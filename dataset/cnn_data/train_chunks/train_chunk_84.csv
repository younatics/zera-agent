"Camp Verde, Arizona (CNN) -- The eighth day in the trial of a formal spiritual retreat leader charged with manslaughter after a deadly sweat lodge ceremony concluded Friday with emotional testimony from the roommate of one of the victims. Self-help author and James Arthur Ray is accused of three counts of manslaughter in the deaths of three people who were in the sweat lodge for the purification ceremony. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison on each count. Witness Beverley Bunn, who roomed with victim Kirby Brown during the five-day retreat in 2009, went through an exhaustive examination Friday, recounting all eight rounds of the sweat lodge purification ceremony. Each round lasted 10 to 15 minutes. While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds. Bunn grew emotional while recalling a horrifying scene after the ceremony ended, describing people tripping over others in their haste to leave the searing hot tent, while others lay unconscious outside. ""As I was getting ready to leave, there was two gentlemen in front of me who were dragging another lifeless person out. One man would pull her arms and another would push. ... They (dragged) her all the way to the door,"" she testified. She also described seeing her stricken roommate. ""I was passing Kirby, and there was some snorting or snoring sounds coming from her,"" she said. ""It was like a gurgling snorting sound."" Other participants had mucus bubbling from their mouths, and one man opened his eyes to reveal burst blood vessels, she said. Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died the night of the event. Volunteer Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died nine days after the ceremony. Prosecutors maintain Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to the deaths of the three victims. The defense has argued the incident was ""a tragic accident"" and that participants had a free choice to take part in the activities or leave if they became too intense. Bunn, however, testified Friday that over the course of the five-day retreat Ray instilled a directive among the participants: ""Play full on."" ""You learn through the course of the week that you don't question Mr. Ray on anything,"" Bunn testified. ""You know what the rules are -- things are not optional. ""As you go through the week you learn that there's consequences or reprimand for you to be called out ... if you question Mr. Ray or don't play full on."" Bunn is scheduled to return to the witness stand when the trial resumes Tuesday. Jurors on Wednesday heard a recording in which Ray previewed the intense ceremony and told participants how it would be a ""death and rebirth experience."" He told participants it would include the most ""intense heat you've every experienced in your life. You will feel like you are going to die."" The author described the October 2009 ceremony as a sacred way for participants to rid themselves of ""all the things that you've allowed to be your truth and have caused you to sell yourself short."" In the recording, Ray told participants, who paid up to $10,000 each to attend the event, that as ""true spiritual warriors"" and in their ""altered state"" they would endure heat so intense it would make it feel like their skins was coming off of their bodies. ""I will be right there with you,"" he said. ""You will have to get to a point where you surrender to death,"" Ray said. ""When you are going into the lodge symbolically you are going back into the womb of Mother Earth."" ""It is such a great metaphor,"" the author said. ""... My body dies but I never die."" Prosecutors argue that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to perilously high temperatures, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. During his recorded talk, Ray repeatedly told participants to drink plenty of fluids. At least 15 others who took part in the ritual fell ill, but more than 40 others were uninjured. CNN's Daniel Lewis and InSession's Beth Karas contributed to this report.","Beverley Bunn roomed with one of the three victims at the 2009 retreat .

"(CNN) -- Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off as Italian Serie A leaders AC Milan wasted a chance to extend their advantage after being held to a 1-1 home draw by bottom side Bari on Sunday. After nearest rivals Inter were held 1-1 at Brescia on Friday, a Milan victory would have seen the Rossoneri move seven points clear at the top of the table. However, in the end, Milan were thankful for a late Antonio Cassano goal to deprive the visitors of a shock victory. Milan crashed out of the Champions League to Tottenham in midweek -- and another defeat looked on the cards when Bari went ahead six minutes before half-time. Almiron took a quick free-kick past Milan's defensive wall for Hungarian Gergely Rudolf to run onto and shoot across goalkeeper Christian Abbiati. Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net on the hour mark, but his goal was ruled out for handball, and the Swedish international was then sent off for hitting out at Marco Rossi. Bari, who remain 12 points from safety, then wasted two golden opportunities to wrap the points, before Cassano levelled with eight minutes remaining, volleying home Luca Antonini's pull-back. Elsewhere, third-placed Napoli closed to within a point of Inter after a comfortable 3-1 win at struggling Parma. Raffaele Palladino gave Parma the lead at the break, but Ezequiel Lavezzi then set up Marek Hamsik to level. Hamsik then returned the favor for Lavezzi to make it 2-1 and the home side had Danielle Galloppa sent off before Christian Maggio made the points safe with a late third. In-form Udinese continued their rise up the table, moving up to fourth place with a 4-0 thashing of Cagliari thanks to a double from the Serie A top scorer Antonio Di Natale. Meanwhile, a fiery Rome derby saw Francesco Totti net both goals, the second from the penalty spot, as Roma defeated Lazio 2-0. Lazio, who finished with nine men after the late dismissals of both Stefan Radu and Francesco Matuzalem, have now lost their last five matches against their city rivals and slip down to fifth place in the table as a result, with Roma two points and one place behind.","AC Milan waste a chance to go seven points clear at the top of Serie A table .

"(CNN)  -- Former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro continued his impressive comeback with a straight-sets win over Radek Stepanek in the first round of the Masters Series event at Indian Wells. The Argentine posted a 6-4 6-0 victory over his 67th-ranked opponent Thursday to set up a second-round meeting with defending champion Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia. ""I broke his serve very soon and took confidence with my serve. I played a good match,"" del Potro told the official ATP Tour website. After winning the hard-court grand slam in New York in 2009, the 22-year-old missed most of 2010 with a wrist injury which saw him plummet down the rankings from a career-high of four. However, since capturing the title at Delray Beach last week without dropping a set, del Potro has climbed more than 400 spots in the rankings to 90th, but admits his injury still troubles him. ""Sometimes I feel a little bad sensation in my wrist, especially in humid weather, so I have many things to fight, but I'm glad with my present,"" he said. Meanwhile, 21-year-old American hope Donald Young earned his first ever win in a Masters event as he came back from a set down to defeat Italian veteran Potito Starace 2-6 6-3 6-3. Young will next play world No. 5 Andy Murray, who was given a first-round bye. Two other home favorites joined Young in the second round, with Ryan Sweeting defeating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6-4 6-1 and Tim Smyczek rallying past Ukrainian Illya Marchenko 2-6 6-3 6-2. In other men's first-round results, Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic raced past German Tobias Kamke 6-2, 6-0, big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic fired 17 aces in a 7-6 6-7 6-2 win over Australian qualifier Marinko Matosevic, and promising Lithuanian Richard Berankis recovered from the loss of the opening set to defeat American qualifier Alex Bogomolov Jr. 1-6 6-3 6-4. In the women's draw, former world No. 1 Dinara Safina overcame an early break of serve to defeat Spain's Arantxa Parra Santonja 6-3 6-3. The 108th-ranked Russian displayed flashes of the brilliance that took her to the top of the rankings in 2009 as she set up a second-round match with Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova. ""I'm getting more and more positive. I'm working day by day and trying to get better and with the hard work I believe I will get better -- nobody forgets how to play,"" Safina told the WTA website. The 24-year-old will aim to record back-to-back wins on the WTA Tour for the first time since September last year when she takes on 26th seed Hantuchova, who was awarded an opening bye. There was also good news for the young American female players in action on Thursday. First, Sloane Stephens set up a meeting with world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki following a 6-4 6-2 defeat of compatriot Janie Hampton. She was joined in the second round by fellow wildcard Christina McHale after the 18-year-old beat Uzbekistan's Akgul Amanmuradova 6-3 6-1, while U.S. Fed Cup players Bethanie Mattek Sands and Melanie Oudin also progressed after the pair recorded respective straight-sets wins over Russian duo Vera Dushevina and Elena Vesnina. In other women's matches, Britain's Elena Baltacha defeated Italian Roberta Vinci in three sets and Poland's Urszula Radwanska prevailed against up-and-coming Serbian teenager Bojana Jovanovski in a final-set tiebreak.","Juan Martin Del Potro beats Radek Stepanek to reach second round at Indian Wells .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Prosecutors in Germany have begun proceedings against a company that makes a card game featuring Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, among others, they said Tuesday. The Hitler card features a photo of the dictator and a partially obscured swastika, the Nazi party symbol -- the display of which is illegal in Germany. ""The photo as such could be problematic, but in connection with the swastika it definitely is,"" said Antje Gabriels-Gorsolke, chief prosecutor and spokeswoman for Nuremberg state prosecutor's office. The state prosecutor's office became aware of the cards because they were on display at the International Toy Fair which is going on in Nuremberg at the moment. They have ordered the cards to be confiscated. The handler has, in any case, cleared his stand. The card game ""Dictator's Quartet: The world's most evil dictators on 32 playing cards"" also features historical figures such as Uganda's Idi Amin Dada and Augusto Pinochet of Chile. It divides dictators into categories such as fascists, military rulers and U.S. puppets, with each card listing their age on succession to power, length of time in power, number of victims and private income. The game is on sale for 10 euros (about $13.60). The company that makes the game did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. It also makes card games featuring plagues, bugs and drugs.","A card in the game ""Dictator's Quartet"" features Adolf Hitler and a swastika .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen was ""very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain"" last Thursday morning, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor. ""Kind of weird, the phone call I received,"" Dr. Paul Nassif told the Los Angeles Fire Department dispatcher in the recorded call, which was released by the fire department Wednesday. Porn actress Kacey Jordan has told media outlets that a two-day party preceded Sheen's collapse. Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours. Sheen's representative later blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain and ambulance ride to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He did not respond to a CNN request for comment on the 911 call Wednesday. Sheen's manager has said the actor is undergoing rehab at home, not in a residential facility. His hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" has suspended production, with the network ordering additional episodes of ""Rules of Engagement"" to fill the gap in their Monday night schedule. ""I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people,"" Sheen said in a statement . released Wednesday. It did not directly address the incident. ""Like Errol Flynn, who had to put down his sword on occasion, I just want to say, 'thank you,'"" Sheen said. Dr. Paul Nassif, in an interview Tuesday by HLN's ""Showbiz Tonight,"" said he couldn't tell if Sheen, who is his friend, was drunk. What he told the emergency dispatcher last week was different. ""I got him on the phone and he was very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain,"" Nassif said on the 911 call. He told the dispatcher that Sheen was saying, ""Don't call 911."" Nassif is a facial plastic surgeon and is not Sheen's medical doctor, Nassif told HLN. Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. Nassif's wife, Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, appears on ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."" ""They wanted to get married, and a mutual friend introduced all of us, and they said, 'Let's get married, can we get married at your house?' and that's how we met and soon after that we became very good friends,"" Nassif said. Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation. ""There were things he said I don't feel comfortable"" disclosing, Nassif said. At another point in the interview, Nassif added: ""Obviously we all want Charlie to keep his sobriety. No one can push him into it.""","NEW: Sheen says he has ""a lot of work to do to be able to return the support""

"(CNN Student News) -- September 1, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • U.S. East Coast  • Pakistan • Chile . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome to our show. Why is NASA testing a rocket that might never get off the ground? We're launching into the details in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hello everyone. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's get started. First Up: Hurricane Earl . AZUZ: First up, Hurricane Earl. A viewer sent in the video you see over my shoulder here of Hurricane Earl. Yesterday, it was a category four hurricane with maximum winds around 135 miles per hour. This is a powerful storm. It's in the Atlantic Ocean and expected to turn towards the U.S. east coast tomorrow. Officials say Earl probably won't make landfall; that's when the center of the hurricane actually reaches shore. But the storm is so big that FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, says people along the coast may need to evacuate. On Monday, rain and wind from Earl knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This iReport you're looking at shows some of the flooding in Puerto Rico. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? A kilometer is longer than a mile. Not at all! It's the other way around. A kilometer is about six-tenths of a mile. Pakistan Aid . AZUZ: A lot of people in Pakistan are traveling more than a dozen kilometers to try and get away from dangerous flooding. If you've been watching our show, you've seen our reports about these floods. They've killed more than 1,600 people in Pakistan and affected at least 17 million other people there. Aid is coming in from countries around the globe and from private companies: money, food, medical supplies. The U.S. is sending more helicopters to Pakistan to help distribute that aid top people who need it. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN medical correspondent, is in Pakistan. He gives us a look at the journey that some families there are going through and the struggles that they're facing. (BEGIN VIDEO) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Most people actually are leaving like this: by foot, in the hot sun, walking for kilometers with no real idea of where exactly they're going or what they're going to find there. It is easy to see why they're leaving. We are literally surrounded by water, and they're worried that that water is just going to get higher and higher. So, they're fleeing the floods with the thing, the priority that they value the most, their livestock, and just starting to walk. This is where so many of them ended up. They were just walking for kilometers and kilometers down that hot road, looking for high land, anything that could protect them from the flood waters. And look at what their lives are like now. Thousands of people, literally, they have this little barrier here. It is so hot outside, anything to try to keep themselves cool. There's no question that relief is slow coming here, but even as we're filming today at the camp, this Pakistani army helicopter comes over and drops parcels of food. But this is just one camp. There are thousands of camps like this. There are more than 20 million people displaced. A fifth of this country is under water. (END VIDEO) Trapped Miners . AZUZ: Terrible conditions there. Now over in the South American country of Chile, efforts are underway to rescue 33 miners who are trapped more than 2,300 feet underground. They've been down there since a cave-in back in early August. All 33 people who are trapped survived and officials think it could take several months before they get out. The plan right now is to drill down through all that rock to reach the miners. What they're making at this time is called an excavation hole. That's where the drill bit will go. Reports are that the miners are doing all right. They're living off of supplies that are being sent down through bore holes. Now those things are only about 4 inches in diameter. A team from NASA is helping out with ideas on how to keep the miners healthy. Sound Check . [SOUNDS OF ARES ROCKET TEST] . Ares Rocket Test . AZUZ: Behold: the Ares rocket. The thing kicks out 22 million horsepower. It could launch humans to the Moon, to Mars. It's a huge part of NASA's Constellation program. Just one problem: a lot of people don't want it, including some officials at NASA. The White House canceled the Constellation program. A panel declared that the Ares rocket is too expensive and behind schedule. So, the big question. Why run the test? Some members of Congress still want it. And since the money for Ares is still in the federal budget, at least for the moment, the company that makes the rocket is required to keep developing it, even if it never gets off the ground. This Day in History . September 1, 1897 -- The first U.S. subway line begins service in Boston . September 1, 1939 -- Germany invades Poland, launching the start of World War II . September 1, 1985 -- The wreck of the Titanic is found on the ocean floor . Fix Our Schools . AZUZ: Well, I know you guys get assignments every day. I had a little homework last Thursday after we wrapped up CNN Student News. It was to interview 11 high school students from around the state of Georgia, some of the state's brightest for Fix our schools. This is a special project that's running all over CNN all week long. It takes ideas from teachers, administrators and, yes, students to look at how schools can succeed even while they're facing challenges. And you've probably seen some of those challenges at your school. Now that homework assignment that I had - that group of high school juniors and seniors that I sat down to speak to - yesterday we brought you what they had to say about what makes schools good. Today, we're focusing on teachers. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: Teachers, should they be your friends on Facebook? FEMALE STUDENT: No. AZUZ: Anybody think so? Go ahead. ALEXIS JOHNSON, CHAMBLEE CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL: OK. So, my teacher has her own Facebook page, and all of my friends add her, all my classmates. And it's so convenient because we ask her a question on what homework we had that night and she automatically replies. AZUZ: Any of you think teachers should not be your friend on Facebook? Want to say why? JANVI CHAWLA, WALTON HIGH SCHOOL: I still really think a teacher is a teacher and students are just also there to learn. AZUZ: What qualities does a good teacher have? Think of your best teacher. Tell me what he or she is like. Go ahead. MCCALL STILES, NORTH OCONEE HIGH SCHOOL: She had a way of adding humor to the class. But then when we were studying, she would be serious about it. And we had a level of respect for her because she added that comedic level to the classroom. AZUZ: Sort of a human factor? STILES: Yes. MARIA FLORES, ETOWAH HIGH SCHOOL: If it weren't for the dedication, the passion that my teachers have, we would all probably be all failing in those classes. But it's the fact that they're willing to stay after school, to be there before school, to walk around during lunch and come say, ""Oh, you're working on the homework? How are you doing?"" AZUZ: So, I'm hearing passion, dedication and humor. Let's say your administration asks you to sit in on a hiring session. What qualities are you going to be looking for if you could make that decision to hire a teacher? LARRY HOWARD, DEKALB SCHOOL OF THE ARTS: I would say someone that always prepares you for the next step. JULIA ABELSKY, NORTH SPRINGS CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL: I would definitely ask them to talk about the subject, maybe talk about their favorite ways to teach. Beause my teacher, he doesn't teach the same way every day. He finds different ways to communicate the information. It really sticks once you laugh about it and you share experiences with your classmates. AZUZ: You aren't afraid of a challenging teacher as long as you're learning something. Does anybody not like a hard teacher? ALEX KELLY, CARVER HIGH SCHOOL: It depends on what you mean by ""hard teacher,"" because there are teachers that be more hard than they should be. So, it's a difference between being hard and overly aggressive. AZUZ: What do teachers do that make you shy away from learning? ZACK KENT, APALACHEE HIGH SCHOOL: When you spend too much time on one subject and you can't complete the entire course, it makes me shy away from trying to study myself, because I think we're going to spend that much time, the rest of the time, on each subject, that long. FLORES: Something that shies me away from learning is when I know what's going to happen in the classroom. For instance, I had a math teacher that, every day, we would walk in and we knew what we were going to do. We were going to check homework, take notes, start on homework. So, I think adding creativity to the teaching really helps keep our attention in the front of the classroom. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go today is something we've been laughing about at workall day long. Just watch it. Looks like man's best friend is man's best dance partner. That dog is burning up the dance floor, and this YouTube video is burning up the internet. You might think we're just showing this just because it's awesome video, and you're right. But it also fits in with one of the main goals of CNN Student News. Goodbye . AZUZ: Making sure our show has plenty of balance. Time to clear the dance floor for now. CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. We return tomorrow fired up and ready to go. Looking forward to seeing you then.","Learn about some of the struggles facing flood victims in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- A second day of a strike against Pakistan's flagship carrier, Pakistan International Airlines, ended Wednesday with police charging protesters and angry passengers at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, said Pervez George, an official with Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. George said a number of people were beaten as police attempted to clear the terminal and restore order. The strike was called on Tuesday after month-long negotiations between the airline and unions representing the airline's pilots and staff ended in failure. PIA grounded close to 60 international and domestic flights leaving thousands of frustrated passengers at Jinnah airport and Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad. The Islamabad airport was closed to passengers and PIA staff with police guarding all entrances and exits. PIA staff called the strike demanding management reinstate five pilots who were fired, that Managing Director Pia Aijaz Haroon resign, and that a proposed code share agreement with Turkish Airlines be dropped. Speaking to CNN, Suhail Baluch, president of the Pakistan Airlines Pilots Association and head of a joint action committee representing all airline employees, said ""the proposed code share agreement, which still needs to be approved by the government and regulators, would make PIA into a regional airline as opposed to international and get rid of lucrative international routes."" Furthermore, the code share agreement would cut down the number of staff because flights would use Istanbul or Ankara as their hub and use Turkish Airlines staff to fly passengers to international destinations currently offered by PIA, he said. Haroon was appointed managing director of Pakistan International Airlines two years ago. Since then, he has been criticized over alleged corruption scandals and for the airline incurring heavy debt. According to Baluch, ""This is another example of Haroon's corruption, we have the crew and capabilities and we have been flying for the last 50 years. I don't know what is the reason behind the code share."" The joint action committee from the union flew to Islamabad Wednesday for discussions with Federal Minister Khurshid Shah, who oversees the airline. However, no agreement was reached. Shah agreed to two of the union's demands but declined to consider removing Haroon as managing director of PIA, the union said. Strikers have vowed to continue striking until they reach a conclusion and the managing director is removed. ""We have declared today that until they kick out Haroon the strike will continue,"" said Baluch. Airline spokesman Mashdood Tajwar refused to comment on the situation.","Second day of strike ends with police charging protesters, passengers, aviation official says .

"(CNN) -- Two people were shot dead and two sheriff's deputies were wounded late Sunday afternoon outside a Walmart store in western Washington state, a Kitsap County Sheriff's spokesman said. Three sheriff's deputies responded to the scene around 3:45 p.m. Sunday after getting a call about a suspicious person ""from a bystander who had concerns about a person inside the store,"" Deputy Scott Wilson said. The deputies approached one man outside the store's south entrance, but -- rather than responding verbally -- he ran from the scene, turned around to face the deputies and began shooting. ""(The deputies) called to him and said, 'Hey, we need to talk to you,'"" said Wilson. ""He turned around and shot at them, and they returned fire."" The male shooter was shot and later pronounced dead in the Walmart parking lot. As of Sunday night, authorities had not released his name, age or other details about him. A young female -- thought to be a teenager, said Wilson -- also was shot, with emergency personnel then transporting her to Tacoma General Hospital. She eventually died from her wounds. Wilson said authorities don't know if the female victim knew the male shooting suspect or if she was an innocent bystander. The two deputies, both men with between five and 10 years of experience in the department, were sent to Tacoma General Hospital to be treated for what Wilson described as ""non-life-threatening"" injuries. The third deputy, a woman, wasn't hurt. Wilson described the situation as ""somewhat chaotic"" but ""stabilized."" ""There is no danger to the community at this point,"" he said. ""We think that all persons (who were) involved ... have been accounted for."" The Washington State Police were taking over as the lead investigative agency in the case, with the Kitsap County Sheriff's Department also requesting assistance from the FBI. The incident occurred near one of the retail giant's stores in Port Orchard, a town just west of Parkwood. Located on Sinclair Inlet, Port Orchard is about 30 miles north-northwest of Tacoma and across Puget Sound from Seattle. The store was locked down for about 20 minutes immediately after the shooting with about 100 people inside, Walmart customer Mike Lambert told CNN affiliate KIRO, with police tape used to cordon off the parking lot. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report .","NEW: A sheriff's deputy describes the situation as ""chaotic"" but ""stabilized""

"(CNN) -- Liverpool continued their improvement under manager Kenny Dalglish with a superb 1-0 Premier League win at Chelsea, making it a debut to forget for striker Fernando Torres against his former club. Torres joined champions Chelsea from Liverpool for a British record transfer fee of $80m last Monday and fate decreed that he would make his debut against his former club. But, playing alongside Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka in a three-pronged strike-force, the Spanish international had a debut to forget -- missing two good chances to open his account for his new club before eventually being substituted by manager Carlo Ancelotti in the second half. Torres: I couldn't wait for Liverpool revival . Chelsea had shown improved form in recent weeks, following a dismal run that had seen them slip away from title contention. And they were handed futher impetus to improve their league position with leaders Manchester United and second-placed Arsenal both dropping points on Saturday. But Chelsea proved no match for a disciplined and determined Liverpool side, who have now won four matches in a row under Dalgish, keeping a clean sheet on each occasion. The only goal of an absorbing match came in the 69th minute when in-form Portuguese midfielder Raul Meireles took advantage of hesitancy in the home defense to rifle home Steven Gerrard's teasing ball from the right. It was Meireles' fourth goal in five matches and lifts Liverpool up to sixth place, just six points off a Champions League place. Chelsea's seventh defeat leaves them fourth, ahead of Tottenham on goal difference, but still 10 points behind Manchester United with just 13 games left. Meanwhile, in the day's other match, Birmingham City moved out of the bottom three after a vital 1-0 win at West Ham, who now prop up the table after this defeat. Nikola Zigic headed home Sebatian Larsson's left-wing free-kick to secure the points for the visitors, as Birmingham followed up their recent League Cup semifinal win over West Ham with another victory over the east London side. West Ham are on 24 points, level with Wolverhampton but with an inferior goal difference. Wigan are the other side in the bottom three, two points better off in 18th position.","Liverpool continued their improvement with a 1-0 Premier League win at Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- Swiss police said Monday there have been no sightings of 6-year-old twin girls since they were abducted by their father more than a week ago. The search for Alessia and Livia Schepp has since stretched to three countries -- Switzerland, France, and Italy -- after the father was found dead in Bari, Italy, on Thursday, police said. Matthias Schepp, 43, committed suicide Thursday night on a railway in Cerignola, Italy, about 60 miles west of Bari, a spokesman for the Swiss police said. When police found the body, there was no sign of the girls. Police discovered Schepp had bought ferry tickets for himself and his two daughters and validated them at the French port of Marseilles, intending to go to the Corsican port of Propriano, but police said it's unclear if they ever boarded the boat. Authorities have dubbed their search Operation Gemelle, which means ""twins"" in Italian. Interpol issued an international Yellow Notice missing persons alert for the girls Saturday. Such notices are distributed to police in Interpol's 188 member countries to help find missing people, especially children. The girls were last seen January 30 when their father abducted them from their home in St. Sulpice, near Lausanne in western Switzerland, police said. He took the girls following personal problems at home, according to the state police in Vaud, which covers the area of St. Sulpice. Swiss police have since carried out three searches at the St. Sulpice home and investigated 60 other homes in the neighborhood, Vaud police said. They have also searched the father's four boats at the ports of Morges and Vidy as well as other ports in the region. Police have contacted all service stations between St. Sulpice and the Swiss city of Geneva, monitored all customs posts in the Geneva region and hired a helicopter to search the lake near St. Sulpice. Both girls are about 3 feet, 9 inches tall and have blond hair, Interpol said. When they were taken, Livia was wearing a green T-shift, jeans, a violet ski jacket and Adidas sneakers. Alessia was wearing a T-shirt with red and white stripes, jeans, a brown jacket and black shoes. The headmaster of the girls' school in St. Sulpice visited each class Monday to inform the students and teachers of the situation, the Vaud police said. Psychological support is being offered at the school. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne in Paris, France, contributed to this report.","6-year-old Alessia and Livia Schepp have been missing since January 30 .

"(CNN) -- Bangladesh gave their Cricket World Cup quarterfinal hopes a boost with victory over the Netherlands while Pakistan sealed their progress with a rain-affected win against Zimbabwe. Bangladesh, who are hosting the tournament along with South Asian neighbors India and Sri Lanka, have leapfrogged England into the final qualification spot in Group B after a comprehensive six-wicket win. It means England need to beat the West Indies on Thursday to keep their hopes of making the last eight alive. In Group A, Pakistan beat Zimbabwe by seven wickets to clinch their place in the knockout stages after Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia also booked their slots. Bangladesh, buoyed by their victory over England on Friday, dismissed the Netherlands for just 160 in Chittagong. Ryan ten Doeschate held their innings together with an unbeaten 53 but regular wickets meant the Dutch couldn't put any big partnerships together. Abdur Razzak was the pick of Bangladesh's bowlers, taking three wickets for 29 runs in his ten overs. Netherlands' last five batsman added just seven runs to their total. In reply, Imrul Kayes hit 73 not out to steer Bangladesh towards their target while Junaid Siddique added 35 and Shahriar Nafees made 37. Netherlands have lost all five of their matches at the tournament. Bangladesh play their final game in the group stages against South Africa on Saturday but if West Indies beat England they will be through. After the match Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan told reporters: ""It was a nervous game because we had to win to stay in the contest. ""We'll watch the West Indies v England game very closely, but we want to do well against South Africa."" Pakistan secured their progress to the last eight after Zimbabwe made 151-7 off 39.4 overs during a rain interrupted match in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Craig Ervine top scored with 52 while fast bowler Umar Gul finished with figures of 3-36 off 7.4 overs. Pakistan's adjusted target was 164, which they reached for the loss of just three wickets in 34.1 overs. Mohammad Hafeez got their innings off to a fast start with a knock of 49 while Asad Shafiq hit 78 off 97 balls to ensure Pakistan's victory.","Bangladesh boost their Cricket World Cup quarterfinal hopes with win over Netherlands .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A suicide bombing at an Iraqi military base north of Baghdad killed at least 10 people and wounded 25 others Monday, police said. Most of the dead and wounded were Iraqi soldiers, according to Baquba police, who said the truck bomber ran into a barracks. Police combed through the rubble of the building looking for victims. The attack took place in the town of Kanan about 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of Baquba in Diyala province, which is ethnically mixed. The province used to be an al Qaeda stronghold, especially during the peak of sectarian violence in the country between 2005 and 2007. On Monday afternoon, a string of roadside bombings targeted Baghdad communities. One civilian was killed and two others were wounded in western Baghdad's al-Amriya neighborhood after a roadside bomb blast, police said. Eight other people were wounded earlier Monday when three roadside bombs exploded in Baghdad neighborhoods, the interior ministry said.","New: A roadside bomb kills one and wounds two in western Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- A quick look at Japan's nuclear industry and the problems faced at three plants since Friday's massive earthquake off northern Honshu, as compiled by the CNN Wire: . NATIONWIDE . Japan's electric power companies run 54 nuclear reactors, with two under construction, at 17 power plants, according to figures from the International Atomic Energy, the U.N. nuclear watchdog. They produced more than 280,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2010 -- about 30 percent of Japan's total electricity generation. Most Japanese plants -- including the three facing emergencies since the earthquake -- use boiling-water reactors, in which water circulated through the reactor is converted to steam and used to drive a generator. Most U.S. reactors and about 40 percent of Japan's are pressurized-water reactors, in which reactor coolant is kept separate from the steam used to drive generators. Both types are far different than the Soviet design involved in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a reactor model now considered unsafe by the international nuclear industry. In addition, the Chernobyl plant lacked the kind of reinforced steel-and-concrete containment structure that U.S. and Japanese regulators require. Tokyo Electric Power Company is the largest of the nine utilities that operate Japan's nuclear plants and runs the two plants affected by Friday's quake. In 2002, its president, vice president and chairman resigned after a scandal in which TEPCO was accused of falsifying safety repair records in 29 cases. The company instituted reforms in September 2002 in an attempt to restore public confidence. FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI . The plant with the worst reported problems is TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi, about 65 km (40 miles) south of Sendai. Three of the plant's six reactors had already been shut down for inspection at the time of the quake, but two of the three that were in service at the time have been damaged, the utility said. An explosion caused by hydrogen buildup Saturday blew the roof off the No. 1 reactor's containment structure and injured four workers, but the reactor was not reported to have sustained damage. Workers have been pouring a mixture of seawater and boron into the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in what experts have called a last-ditch attempt to prevent a meltdown -- a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release. Japanese nuclear regulators have said there is a ""possibility"" that at least a partial meltdown already has occurred in the reactors. The government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes within a 20-km (12.5-mile) radius of the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure, authorities said Sunday. The six units at Fukushima Daiichi went into service between 1970 and 1979. FUKUSHIMA DAINI . Japanese authorities have detected cooling-system problems at TEPCO's Fukushima Daini plant, but have not expressed any concerns about possible meltdowns there. Nevertheless, those living within a 10-km radius of Fukushima Daini were ordered to evacuate as a precaution. TEPCO reported that cooling systems the three operational units at Fukushima Daini failed after the quake, but the IAEA, citing Japanese authorities, reported that all three had power Sunday afternoon. TEPCO reported one fatality at the plant. A crane operator who had been trapped at an operating console in the plant's exhaust stack was pronounced dead Saturday, the company reported. Fukushima Daini is about 80 km south of Sendai. The plant's four reactors went online between 1981 and 1987. ONAGAWA . Japanese officials declared an emergency Sunday at the Onagawa nuclear plant after finding radiation levels above allowed levels in the surrounding area. However, radiation levels had dropped to normal levels by early Monday, and the ""current assumption"" of Japanese authorities is that the increased radiation levels may have been caused by material released from Fukushima Daiichi, according to the IAEA. The plant reported smoke in a turbine house after Friday's earthquake, but Japan has told the IAEA that the three reactors at Onagawa are under control. Onagawa is about 70 km north of Sendai. It is owned by the Tohoku Electric Company, and its three reactors entered service between 1983 and 2001. Reactor No. 2 was shut down for a five-month inspection in November, according to the company.","Japan's electric power companies run 54 nuclear reactors at 17 power plants .

"(CNN)  -- Defending champion Jelena Jankovic will face fellow Serbian player Ana Ivanovic in the last 16 at Indian Wells, after both eased through the third round.

"(CNN) -- A Yale lab technician charged in the strangling murder of a Yale graduate student less than a week before she was to be married plans to plead guilty, his attorney said Wednesday. Public defender Joseph Lopez said his client, Raymond Clark III, will plead guilty in New Haven, Connecticut, Superior Court on Thursday as part of a plea bargain, though he would not divulge the details of the agreement. Clark had originally pleaded not guilty in January 2010. Clark, 26, of Branford, Connecticut, is accused in the slaying of Annie Le, 24, who was pursuing a doctorate in pharmacology at Yale when she went missing September 8, 2009. Le's body was discovered inside a wall of a Yale lab building four days later after an extensive search by the FBI and police. She had planned to marry Columbia graduate student Jonathan Widawsky on the day her body was found. Clark was not a Yale student but had worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004, after graduating from high school. He lived with his girlfriend, who also is a Yale lab technician, according to police. A Yale faculty member described Clark's job as maintaining colonies for animals used in research. A motive in Le's killing was unclear, but police said they were treating the case as workplace violence. Calls to the New Haven district attorney's office and Yale University seeking comment were not immediately returned Wednesday.","Raymond Clark III will enter a guilty plea Thursday, the public defender says .

"Berlin (CNN) -- WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange went from being ""imaginative, energetic (and) brilliant"" to a ""paranoid, power-hungry, megalomaniac,"" a former colleague charges in a new book out Thursday. Assange also has ""a very free and easy relationship with the truth,"" Daniel Domscheit-Berg claims in the book, ""Inside WikiLeaks."" WikiLeaks also lost key software that lets users submit documents anonymously when Domscheit-Berg and another colleague left, he says. WikiLeaks blasted the defector in a statement shortly before the book launch. Domscheit-Berg ""damaged"" WikiLeaks infrastructure and ""stole material,"" WikiLeaks said Wednesday, and the website said it is taking legal action against him-- though Domscheit-Berg denied that. WikiLeaks, which publishes secret documents, downplayed the defector's role in the organization, saying he was ""a spokesperson for WikiLeaks in Germany at various times."" It denied he was ever a ""programmer, computer scientist, security expert, architect, editor, founder (or) director"" of WikiLeaks. ""Domscheit-Berg's roles within WikiLeaks were limited and started to diminish almost a year ago as his integrity and stability were questioned,"" the website said. Domscheit-Berg rejected that claim in a press conference Thursday, calling himself ""the only person who was intensively involved in this organization for such a long time."" Last September, Domscheit-Berg left WikiLeaks, citing shortcomings and clashes with Assange. He and other former WikiLeaks employees have now set up OpenLeaks, which they describe as a more transparent secret-sharing website. OpenLeaks, its founder says, has a ""technical mechanism whereby sources can be protected"" and decide for themselves to which outlets they want to release their information. The defector paints a picture of Assange as becoming increasingly authoritarian over time, saying Assange would threaten him. Domscheit-Berg claims Assange read the USA Patriot Act to him when he tried to dismiss him, using military terminology to designate him a traitor. Assange, he said, had started assuming the characteristics of the kinds of institutions he was trying to bring down. The author says in his book, however, that Assange wasn't necessarily anti-American, even though all of WikiLeaks' major publications last year were aimed at the United States. Instead, Assange was motivated by a frustration with U.S. foreign policy and his desire to seek the biggest possible adversary. ""He had to single out the most powerful nation on earth,"" Domscheit-Berg writes. ""Your own stature, it has been written, can be measured by that of your enemies. Why should he expend his fighting energy in Africa or Mongolia and get into quarrels with the Thai royal family? ""It would have been a far less attractive prospect to end up in some jail in Africa, or wearing concrete boots at the bottom of some Russian river, than to inform the world that he was being pursued by the CIA. And it wouldn't have gotten him on the nightly news."" Domscheit-Berg also says he took about 3,000-3,500 documents when he left WikiLeaks, claiming it would be ""irresponsible"" to leave them with Assange. He did not disclose the contents or origin of the papers. The trove would represent a fairly small percentage of what WikiLeaks says it has in its possession. Domscheit-Berg said he was ""sorry"" about how things worked out between him and Assange, saying, ""We had extremely great times. We achieved great things together."" WikiLeaks gained international prominence after leaking thousands of papers about the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan and is currently releasing a huge cache of secret American diplomatic papers. Assange is fighting extradition from the United Kingdom to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning on sex charges unrelated to the work of the website. There are already several books purporting to expose WikiLeaks' own secrets. Two journalists from The Guardian newspaper in Britain, David Leigh and Luke Harding, have written ""WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy."" It profiles Assange, whom it calls ""one of the strangest figures ever to become a worldwide celebrity,"" and it also discusses WikiLeaks' release of the U.S. diplomatic cables and Afghan war documents. Two journalists from Germany's Der Spiegel magazine have written a book called ""Staatsfeind WikiLeaks,"" or ""WikiLeaks, Enemy of the State,"" describing their encounters with the site's founder. Both The Guardian and Der Spiegel have had agreements with WikiLeaks on publishing leaked documents. The New York Times offers an e-book called ""Open Secrets"" that it bills as the ""definitive chronicle"" of the documents' release and the controversy that ensued. Greg Mitchell, who writes a media blog for The Nation, has written ""The Age of WikiLeaks: From Collateral Murder to Cablegate (and Beyond),"" charting the rise and impact of the site. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Julian Assange read a former colleague the USA Patriot Act in firing him, the defector claims .

"(CNN)  -- An injury-time goal from substitute Nilmar secured Villarreal a 3-2 at Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of their last-16 Europa League tie on Thursday.

Czech international Michal Kadlec put second-placed German Bundesliga side Leverkusen 1-0 up in the 18th minute, but Italy forward Giuseppe Rossi equalized for La Liga's Villarreal five minutes before the interval.

Braga took the lead in the 18th minute courtesy of a penalty from Brazilian winger Alan Silva, after Mossoro was fouled by Greek defender Sotiris Kyrgiakos. Despite having picked up a stomach injury in Braga's impressive win over Benfica on Saturday, Alan had no trouble in driving a low shot past goalkeeper Pepe Reina. It was Liverpool's first defeat in 12 European outings this season in a much-changed line-up from Sunday. Skipper Steven Gerrard did not travel to Portugal because of a long-standing groin injury, and Uruguay striker Luis Suarez was ineligible for selection.

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A Yale University lab technician pleaded guilty Thursday to murder and attempted sexual assault in the killing of graduate student Annie Le in 2009. Raymond Clark III will be sentenced to 44 years in prison as part of the plea agreement. In court Thursday, prosecutors described injuries to the victim and evidence of attempted sexual assault. Le, 24, was strangled to death. She had a broken jaw and collarbone, the prosecution said. Clark's DNA was ""all over"" the crime scene, including in her underwear, the state charged. Le's body was discovered inside a wall of a Yale lab building four days later after an extensive search by the FBI and  police. Clark, 26, admitted the facts as the prosecution presented them but pleaded guilty under a legal precedent that allows him to do so while still officially protesting his innocence. He entered Judge Roland Fasano's packed courtroom handcuffed, winking at his father as he walked in. His handcuffs were removed for the proceedings. ""This is not the Ray we know,"" Clark's father said tearfully outside the court after the hearing. ""I want you to know Ray has expressed remorse from the beginning,"" he added, saying how difficult it was ""to imagine your child did the unthinkable."" ""My family and I send deepest sympathy to the Le family,"" said Clark's father, also called Raymond. Clark pleaded guilty under the Alford doctrine, which allows a defendant to assert that he is innocent but plead guilty when he ""intelligently concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly evidences guilt."" Clark had pleaded not guilty in January 2010. Le was pursuing a doctorate in pharmacology at Yale when she went missing September 8, 2009. She had planned to marry Columbia graduate student Jonathan Widawsky on the day her body was found. Clark was not a Yale student but had worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004, after graduating from high school.

"Minamisanriku, Japan (CNN) -- As some in Japan officially kicked off their first work week Monday since its epic earthquake and tsunami, others -- especially in the country's northeast -- grieved the loss of loved ones, kept fleeting hopes that missing could be found alive and tried to come to grips with a disaster that literally tore some communities apart. The nation's Kyodo News Agency, citing Prime Minister Naoto Kan, reported more than 15,000 people have been rescued in the days since Friday's 8.9-magnitude tremor. But, while 1,598 people were officially dead Monday according to the National Police Agency Emergency Disaster Headquarters, the fear was that the final death toll could be exponentially higher. That official figure, for instance, does not include 200 to 300 bodies in Sendai that have yet to be recovered, Kyodo reports. Nor does it include half the population of Minamisanriku -- some 9,500 people -- who may be unaccounted for. In that northeastern Japanese town, a family photo album lay on the sodden ground, showing a beaming man holding a newborn baby -- happiness out of place amid the devastation and carnage left by a tsunami that occurred just after a massive earthquake. Only a handful of buildings were left standing, with the rest a mangled mess of rubble. A boat sat on the edge of town, carried more than two miles inland by the tsunami. When the tsunami warning sounded Friday, ""Most people ran away,"" said Choushin Takahashi, who was working in a local government office near the water. ""Some had to leave the elderly or disabled behind on the second floor. I think a lot of those left behind probably died."" As the wave hit, he said he felt as if it was happening in a dream. ""I saw the bottom of the sea when the tidal wave withdrew and houses and people were being washed out,"" another resident said. ""I couldn't watch anymore."" A dramatic rescue took place off Japan's coast Sunday, when a Japanese destroyer rescued a 60-year-old man at sea, some 15 kilometers (9 miles) off Fukushima prefecture, according to Kyodo News Agency. The man, identified as Hiromitsu Shinkawa of Minamisoma, was swept away with his house, Kyodo said. He was spotted floating in the sea, waving a self-made red flag while standing on a piece of his house's roof. Shinkawa was conscious and in good condition, Kyodo said, citing Defense Ministry officials. He was quoted as telling rescuers he had left his home because of the quake, but returned home to grab some belongings with his wife when the tsunami hit. ""I was saved by holding onto the roof,"" he said, ""but my wife was swept away."" When a member of Japan's Maritime Self Defense Force handed him something to drink on the rescue boat, Shinkawa drank it and burst into tears, Kyodo reported. ""No helicopters or boats that came nearby noticed me,"" he said. ""... I thought today was the last day of my life."" In Minamisanriku, search and rescue efforts were frequently disturbed by tsunami alerts prompted by ongoing aftershocks. When the alarm sounded, police abandoned their cars, rescue workers blew whistles and people rushed to high ground. ""It's your life!"" shouted one man. ""Run!"" It was a false alarm, but such warnings are taken seriously in the wake of the disaster. In Sendai, south of Minamisanriku, Hiroki Otomo said his mother and uncle remain missing. They were at the family's home when the tsunami struck. ""Frightening beyond belief,"" Otomo said. ""I have no words."" Many areas of the town are simply gone -- mud and splintered wood littering an area where a row of homes used to stand; a vehicle upside-down among tree branches. A school, which had 450 people inside when the tsunami hit, stood with its doors blown open and a jumble of furniture -- plus a truck -- in its hallways. Some teachers and students were able to escape the building, but officials said others did not. Sendai residents said the water reached the treetops as it swept into the town. Cars were tossed like toys, windows blasted out and homes crushed or swept away completely. ""As I was trying to evacuate, the tsunami was already in front of me,"" another young man said. ""I tried to drive, but I ended up running instead."" Some four-wheel-drive vehicles were seen on Sendai roads. Military choppers hovered overhead. Among those yet to be rescued Sunday were those trapped in a hospital, officials said. ""I've been watching TV, but it looks much worse when I actually see it in person,"" said a third young man. ""I grew up in the house that was not close to the ocean. I didn't think it would be this bad, but I'm from the west side and I guess some people could not imagine the horror of the tsunami and couldn't evacuate in time."" Some residents of coastal Sendai returned to their homes Sunday, salvaging what they could. Others stood in long lines for limited fuel and, especially, for food and water. The line at one food and water distribution center was several blocks long. Melissa Heng said she has many colleagues who are unable to reach friends and family living elsewhere in Miyagi prefecture, as phone service has been spotty. That, she said, is ""adding to the emotional toll."" But ""for a city that's seen so much tragedy in the last few days, the people seem very calm,"" she said. Many families are focusing on the cleanup process, she said, and there is a sense that ""we're all in this together.""

"(CNN) -- A late goal from Macedonian international Goran Pandev saved Inter Milan's blushes as they qualified for the Champions League quarterfinals by beating German giants Bayern Munich 3-2. With four minutes left at Munich's Allianz Arena, holders Inter looked like they were crashing out of the competition. Despite taking an early lead through Samuel Eto'o, goals from Thomas Muller and Mario Gomez had put Bayern back in control. But a superb Wesley Sneijder strike leveled the tie 2-2 on the night, yet Inter still trailed 3-2 on aggregate thanks to Bayern's 1-0 victory in Milan three weeks previously. With the clock ticking down, Samuel Eto'o slalomed through Bayern's defense, squaring for Pandev who shot powerfully into the top left hand corner, leveling the tie 3-3 on aggregate and sending Inter through on away goals. ""We have played too passively and made too many mistakes at the end,"" Bayern striker Mario Gomez told AFP. ""We didn't finish our chances to counter-attack, we could have led 4-1 or 5-1 if we had. You can't do something like that against a team like that without being punished."" In the other Champions League match, Manchester United overcame French side Marseille 2-1. After holding the Red Devils to an impressive 0-0 draw at the Stade Velodrome in the first leg, Marseille rarely looked like scoring at Old Trafford following some wayward finishing, with French international Andre-Pierre Gignac and Souleymane Diawara particularly profligate. But profligacy was not a problem for Manchester United's Mexican striker Javier Hernandez who scored twice, taking his goal tally to 16 this season in all competitions. A late Wes Brown own goal gave Marseille some hope, but Manchester United held on to a deserved victory. ""Our experience saw us through in the end, I think, and it was a good result, for sure,"" Manchester United's coach Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. The victory was Ferguson's 100 in the Champions League. Manchester United and Inter join Tottenham Hotspur, Barcelona, Shakhtar Donetsk and Shalke 04 in Friday's quarterfinal draw.

"(CNN) -- After cutting nearly half of its police force in January. the city of Camden, New Jersey, announced Thursday that it is rehiring 50 of the 168 police officers laid off. In an agreement between Camden officials and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the city will have access to $2.5 million from what is known as a ""payment in lieu of taxes,"" or PILOT, state fund. Camden's Mayor Dana Redd will rehire 50 police officers and 15 firefighters. ""Public safety is our primary obligation as elected officials,"" Redd said in a press release. The funding will allow Camden to supplement existing patrols through the spring and summer, but a long-term solution is still needed, Redd said. When asked if crime had increased during the two months since the cuts, the mayor's spokesman, Robert Corrales, said only, ""Crime, in general, ebbs and flows and to pinpoint it on layoffs is just inconclusive."" Redd pledged to keep working with the governor and local officials to find and implement a long-term plan. ""In difficult fiscal times like these, we must work harder (and) be more creative and realistic to find the best, most cost-effective ways to meet our public safety obligations,"" Redd said. In January, 168 police officers and 67 firefighters were laid off due to a $26.5 million budget gap. Camden, a city with the second-highest crime rate in the nation, was left scrambling to figure out solutions to keep residents safe. Camden is second only to St. Louis in annual crime-rate rankings of cities, with the rankings based on compilations of FBI crime statistics. Calls to Camden's Fraternal Order of Police on Thursday were not immediately returned.","Facing a $26.5 million budget gap, Camden laid off police and firefighters .

"(CNN)  -- The MotoGP race due to be held in Japan next month has been postponed until later in the year in the aftermath of Friday's earthquake and tsunami. The 9.0-magnitude quake caused cracks on the track and damaged spectator seats at the circuit in Motegi, to the north of Tokyo. In a statement on their official website, the sport's governing body confirmed that the motorbike world championship race would now take place in October. It is the latest in a list of sporting fixtures to be affected by the recent disaster in the Asian country, where there are also fears of a radiation leak from several explosions at a nuclear plant. Japan's sporting schedule hit in aftermath of quake disaster . On Monday it was confirmed that the World Skating Championships, scheduled to take place in Tokyo this month, had been postponed until further notice. The Japanese Football Association, meanwhile, said that no J-League football matches would take place in March, and added that the national team's upcoming friendly games could also be abandoned. Japan is continuing to experience aftershocks from the quake which has already claimed the lives of thousands of people and left many more homeless. The 18-race MotoGP season will now begin in Losail, Qatar on March 20. It is the second year in a row that the Japanese round has had to be rescheduled. The 2010 race was also postponed from April to October following the volcanic ash crisis in Iceland that prevented competitors and spectators from flying to the Far East. The opening race in the 2011 Formula One championship has already had to be cancelled this year.

"(CNN) -- Japanese stocks closed down 10.55 percent, recovering from deeper losses earlier in the session, as the nation grappled with a crisis at an earthquake-damaged nuclear power plant and the aftermath of last week's earthquake and tsunami. It was the third steepest percentage fall in the Nikkei's history. At one point, the Nikkei plunged more than 1,390 points, or more than 14 percent, nearing the worst-ever plunge of 14.90 percent on October 20, 1987, after the U.S. stock market crash on Black Monday. The close at 8,605.15, combined with the 6.2 percent drop on Monday, the first full trading day after the quake, marked a nearly 17 percent drop in two days. A few hours earlier, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the risk of further releases of radioactive material from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant remained ""very high."" The Tokyo market had opened shortly after the owner of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan reported an ""explosive impact"" at the plant's No. 2 reactor, a day after a hydrogen explosion rocked another reactor. The plant was among the many structures damaged or destroyed by the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The death toll following the quake has risen to 2,475, authorities said, with at least 3,118 people missing. The Kyodo News Agency said that doesn't take into account reports of thousands of bodies in one northeastern prefecture. More than 450,000 people are reported homeless.

"(CNN) -- A lawyer for former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide scoffed Monday at a U.S. government warning that his client's planned return to Haiti from South Africa could disrupt elections scheduled for Sunday. ""The U.S. government has done everything they can to keep him halfway around the world,"" said Ira Kurzban, Aristide's longtime, Miami-based lawyer. ""For them to issue this ridiculous statement that it was voluntary and that he voluntarily stayed in South Africa is pure fiction. He's been trying to come back for seven years."" Kurzban was referring to a comment made by State Department spokesman Mark Toner, who said Monday, ""Mr. Aristide has chosen to remain outside of Haiti for seven years. To return this week can only be seen as a conscious choice to impact Haiti's elections. ... Return prior to the election may potentially be destabilizing to the political process."" Kurzban said Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, is planning to return before Sunday's elections, though he said he did not know when. Aristide has long said that he was removed from Haiti in 2004 aboard a CIA plane in a coup carried out by the U.S. government. U.S. authorities have said they were seeking to prevent him from being violently overthrown by domestic unrest. Since then, Aristide has been trying to return to Haiti to work in education, Kurzban said. He particularly wants to return prior to the election so that any new government will not have the opportunity to keep him out, something he said the U.S. government would support. ""The U.S. government is very involved in keeping Aristide out and trying to shepherd in a right-wing government,"" the lawyer said. Since 2004, Aristide has been teaching in South Africa and trying to arrange for his return to Haiti, his lawyer said. In February, he received a new Haitian passport. But the lawyer conceded that Aristide's return would draw attention away from the current list of presidential candidates. ""It's clear that the candidates now running for office have very low popularity among the Haitian people and the U.S. doesn't want a figure as popular as Aristide coming back,"" Kurzban said. ""He's a populist and represents the aspirations of the Haitian people and (U.S. government officials) are, I think, afraid that those aspirations may not be consistent with the interests of supporting the elite in Haiti."" Toner said that the Haitian constitution gives Aristide the right to return and that the decision to allow that is in the hands of the Haitian government. ""We would urge former President Aristide to delay his return until after the electoral process has concluded to permit the Haitian people to cast their ballots in a peaceful atmosphere,"" Toner told reporters at a State Department briefing unrelated to Haiti. And the State Department spokesman asked South Africa, where Aristide and his family have lived since he left Haiti voluntarily in 2004, to also make the case against his return. ""We encourage the South African government as a committed partner to Haiti's stability to urge former president Aristide to delay his return until after the elections,"" Toner said.

"(CNN) -- The Japanese Football Association (JFA) has announced that its national football team will play a charity match to help victims of the recent earthquake in the Asian country. Japan was hit by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami last week which has already claimed the lives of 6,500 people, with 10,354 reported missing. The match is due to take place at Osaka's Nagai Stadium on March 29, with the Samurai Blue's opposition to be a team made up of players from the domestic J-League. The recently-crowned Asian Cup champions have been forced to cancel friendly matches against Montenegro and New Zealand due to the disaster. Can sport help Japan recover from disaster? JFA president Junji Ogura said the association had tried to arrange a charity fixture with New Zealand, which was also recently hit by an earthquake. ""We have had strong requests from Japan coach (Alberto) Zaccheroni and our national team players that they want to do something to support and encourage the victims,"" Ogura told the JFA website. ""But because this is still a difficult moment, we thought we should hold a charity match to support those who have suffered in the quake-hit areas and assist in their recovery as soon as possible. ""I received a phone call from the president of the New Zealand Football Association and could understand that it was a tough decision they had to make following lengthy discussions. ""Although we cannot play New Zealand, we wanted to do something to encourage the victims. As we want to do it with the power of everyone, we would like to ask for your assistance."" Japan's captain Makoto Hasebe, a midfielder for German club Wolfsburg, expressed his and the team's desire to repay the nation for their support in last year's World Cup. ""Japan performed well in last year's World Cup by establishing great unity within the squad,"" the 27-year-old said. ""We were able to do this through the support we received from people across the country. Now our country is facing a big crisis and this is the moment we should do something in return for the people's support for us then. ""The only thing we can do is play football. It may not be much, but that's how we would like to encourage the Japanese people. I am heading back home to Japan to take part in this charity match for them."" Italian coach Zaccheroni took charge in 2010 and guided the team to Asian Cup success in Qatar in January. The former AC Milan and Juventus boss believes the people of Japan will recover from recent events. ""Since I assumed the position of Japan coach, I have seen very closely the Japanese people's beauty and ability to unite, to be disciplined and to respect others. Because of that, I am convinced that Japan will recover for sure from any difficulties.""","Japan will play a charity match to support victims of the country's recent earthquake .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in the southern city of Sitra on Tuesday, killing at least two protesters and wounding at least 150 people, according to medical officials on the scene Tuesday. ""They are killing everybody,"" one official said. ""They attacked us -- even medical personnel."" The man, who asked to be identified only as a medical official for fear of reprisals, said he was riding with patients in an ambulance as he spoke. ""Even in this ambulance that is marked as an ambulance, they shot at it,"" he said. ""We had to get on the floor of the ambulance. We are not safe even transferring injured patients."" Although troops Saudi Arabia and other member states in the Gulf Cooperation Council are in Bahrain, there have been no reports of those soldiers being involved in the Sitra clashes. A Saudi soldier was killed in Bahrain on Tuesday, a Saudi official said. The United States issued a statement calling for ""calm and restraint on all sides"" and urging a political solution through dialogue, not a military solution. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, now in Cairo, Egypt, expressed ""deep concern"" about Bahrain in a conversation with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud on Tuesday, a senior State Department official said. Clinton later said it was important for all parties to promote dialogue instead of violence. ""You can't solve this problem by just trying to bring security to bear. You have to have a political solution,"" she said. Bahrain's King Hamad has imposed a three-month state of emergency in the island nation, effective Tuesday, according to the state news agency. The moves comes amid uncertainty in Bahrain after foreign troops arrived to help the government quell weeks-long protests in the Persian Gulf kingdom. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates sent troops Monday to ""protect the safety of citizens,"" the Bahraini government said. The troops arrived under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council. But some in the capital city said Tuesday that they did not need the added protection. ""We don't understand why these troops are coming in,"" said a 28-year-old blogger in Manama. ""We have an army and police. We do not need troops from other places. Opposition leaders have called this an invasion. An act of war."" The blogger also said he did not want to be named because of fears of retribution. One Saudi soldier, an under-sergeant, was killed in Bahrain on Tuesday, a Saudi official said. The cause of the death was not immediately released. Separately, a Bahraini police officer was killed in Sitra. A man from the town of Hidd, who wanted to be identified only by his first name, said he feared that the troops would just inflame the already tense standoff. ""I really hope things work, but I don't think foreign troops will solve anything,"" Abdulrahim said. ""It will probably lead to more violence."" But a 25-year-old banker from Manama said she welcomed the presence. ""It gives us peace,"" the woman said. ""Maybe these protests will finally end. These protesters say they are peaceful, but I have seen them carrying sticks and knives. They are blocking the streets so we cannot get to work. They are criminals and this has gone on for too long."" The protests, which started February 14, are part of a series of demonstrations that have swept across the Arab world this year, toppling the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt. But it was not clear whether any other country had taken the step of calling in foreign troops for help. ""Temporarily, it should calm the situation,"" said Simon Henderson, director of the Gulf and energy policy program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He noted that the Obama administration has been urging political dialogue but said Monday's move was not what the U.S. president meant. ""Sending in Saudi forces is hardly encouraging political dialogue,"" Henderson said. ""The great danger is, it will actually worsen the situation by encouraging Iran to get involved. Not militarily, probably, but certainly diplomatically and rhetorically."" The movement of forces came on the same day that protesters seized control of a key part of the capital city, Manama, a Human Rights Watch official said. Medical officials said that at least 36 people were injured in clashes Monday, many of them wounded by projectiles from pellet guns. The Bahrain Financial Harbour was still shut down Tuesday morning, said Faraz Sanei, a researcher with the group. But the extra troops were not visible in the city. ""There are areas of the city that are being controlled by vigilante groups armed with sticks and batons. The patrols seem to be sectarian,"" he said. ""Any time civilians take up arms and take matters into their own hands or threaten violence it is of great concern,"" regardless of their political affiliation, Sanei said. It was not clear how many foreign security troops had entered Bahrain in total. Various parts of the Bahraini government referred questions to other government offices on Monday. A witness said dozens of armored vehicles and buses full of soldiers crossed Monday afternoon from Saudi Arabia into Bahrain afternoon via the causeway linking the two countries. The Gulf Cooperation Council comprises six Gulf states -- Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar -- and encourages cooperation among members in a number of areas, including the economy and security. The nation's independent bloc of lawmakers called on Bahrain security forces to intervene to protect national security and stability, the Bahrain News Agency reported Sunday. The bloc is composed of the 22 pro-government members of the lower house of the legislature. ""Extremist movements are resorting to escalation and sectarian mobilization, which led to an unprecedented disruption of security and hostile sectarian polarization at health and educational institutions,"" the group said in a statement. On Sunday, clashes between protesters and security forces resulted in the hospitalization of more than 1,000 people, human rights activists said. The unrest prompted the U.S. State Department to warn Americans to consider leaving the island nation. The United Kingdom, too, has urged its residents not to travel there. ""One thing is clear: There is no military solution to the problems in Bahrain,"" White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said. ""A political solution is necessary, and all sides must now work to produce a dialogue that addresses the needs of all of Bahrain's citizens."" U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman is ""working the issue aggressively on the ground as we speak,"" the White House said. Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed plans by King Hamad to make changes to his Cabinet and proceed with reforms. But a few days ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates cautioned that ""baby steps"" would not be sufficient to meet protesters' demands. Bahrain is the key banking and financial center in the Gulf. It also plays a crucial role in U.S. defense interests in the region. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain, and Bahrain is the only Arab state to have led one of the coalition task forces that patrol the Persian Gulf. U.S. military access to Bahrain also supports operations in Iraq. An underlying concern in this issue is that Iran, an overwhelmingly Shiite state, could seize the opportunity to meddle in Bahrain's internal affairs. Bahrain has a Shiite Muslim majority population, but its rulers are Sunni Muslims. On Tuesday, an Iranian Foreign Ministry official criticized the arrival of Saudi troops as an ""invasion,"" Iran's Press TV reported Monday. Saudi Arabia's eastern province is home not only to many of the country's rich oil fields but to its largest concentration of minority Shiites as well. In recent weeks, Shiite demonstrators there have protested the Saudi government, whose leaders are overwhelmingly Sunni. The Saudi government would presumably be concerned that any uprising by Shiite Muslims in Bahrain could inspire the Shiite population in nearby Saudi Arabia to follow suit. During protests in Bahrain, moderates have been demanding a constitutional monarchy, and hard-liners have called for the abolition of the royal family altogether. But pro-government members of parliament have asked King Hamad to enforce a curfew and deploy security forces across the country, saying the protesters' motives are far more sinister. ""What we are witnessing in Manama is no peaceful protest,"" Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid al-Khalifa said on Twitter. ""It's (a) wanton, gangster-style takeover of people's lives."" CNN's Lateef Mungin, Jenifer Fenton and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Clinton says there is no military solution to Bahrain's unrest .

"Washington (CNN) -- Embattled Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi's forces have made significant strides against rebel fighters, as the United Nations is working quickly to pass a resolution authorizing international intervention, a senior State Department official told senators Thursday. In remarks to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William Burns, the undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department, said Gadhafi's forces are only about 160 kilometers (about 100 miles) outside of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. ""They've made advances taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military fire power,"" Burns said. Burns expressed fear that Gadhafi, now isolated by the world community, could turn to terrorism again. ""I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground, that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well -- the danger of him returning to terrorism, and violent extremism himself, the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region,"" Burns told the committee. Senators, in turn, expressed frustration with the lack of progress by the United States in responding to Gadhafi beyond sanctions and warnings, as the U.S. tries to build international consensus for any military intervention. ""When is that resolution going to happen, after the bloodbath, in the middle of the bloodbath?"" asked Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. The United Nations Security Council is meeting in New York Thursday, debating forceful options that would go beyond a no-fly zone, Burns told the senators. A vote is schedule for Thursday evening. When Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, asked what those options would include, such as targeted air strikes on Gadhafi's weapons, jamming of government radio signals, and using the tens of billions of dollars in Gadhafi's assets that have been frozen, Burns would only say that diplomats are talking about a ""whole range of measures,"" including a number of the steps Menendez mentioned. ""We are pursuing -- along with the Lebanese, the British, French, other partners in the council -- measures that include a no-fly zone, but could go beyond that.,"" Burns said. ""And I can't in this session, since the debate is going on the Security Council right now, go into a lot of detail about that. But there are measures short of boots on the ground that could be taken by the international community, including active air participation."" Burns' remarks echoed White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, who said Thursday that the United States is still ""actively considering"" the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya, and that U.S. officials also are examining other options to put pressure on the Gadhafi regime. With the ground situation evolving in Libya, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice said previously this week that there are ""inherent limitations"" regarding a no-fly zone ""in terms of protecting civilians."" The U.S. military does not view a no-fly zone as sufficient to stopping Gadhafi. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that establishing such a zone ""would not be sufficient"" to stop the gains made by Gadhafi. Schwartz told the committee that establishing a no-fly zone would take ""upwards of a week."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates has cautioned about the use of a no-fly zone in the past weeks, saying it would involve a military attack on Libya to take out air defenses. On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said Gates' concern extends to other potential military operations in Libya. ""It would be logical if one of his concerns about a no-fly zone is the element of attacking Libyan air defenses, then an option of air strikes would be pretty similar,"" Lapan told reporters at the Pentagon. Burns expects the U.N. Security council to come to an agreement on a resolution Thursday, but wants both operational and financial support from Arab states on the measures decided upon. ""Those are discussions that we've begun including with particular Arab states that have expressed an interest and a willingness to participate in this,"" Burns said.","Gadhafi's forces have made significant advances against rebels, an official says .

"(CNN) -- American golfer Nick Watney produced a fine closing round at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Florida to secure the third PGA Tour win of his career. The 2009 runner-up teed off two shots behind overnight leader Dustin Johnson on the Blue Monster course at Doral on Sunday, but summoned a five-under-par 67 to steal victory away from his compatriot. ""Top-10 finishes are nice,"" Watney told the PGA Tour website after claiming the $1.4 million first prize. ""But winning is what counts out here, and that's how you're measured. To win this tournament against this field, it's a huge honor. I'm very excited. I'm very proud."" By the time he arrived at the last, the 29-year-old Watney had opened up a one-shot lead over close friend Johnson -- with whom he shares a coach in Butch Harmon and regular practice rounds. Johnson's challenge was extinguished when Watney made a birdie at the par-five 18th -- the same hole he had double-bogeyed on Saturday. ""I wasn't nervous. I really wanted to take care of business and to grasp this opportunity,"" said Watney, who rose to 15th in the world rankings after his win. ""I actually love that feeling; you don't get it too often. ""That's why you play. I'm thinking, 'I have to be in this moment -- right now -- because this is all that counts.' "" Johnson was left to reflect on an opportunity missed, having bogeyed the 16th on his way to a disappointing closing round of 71. But he was full of praise for Watney. ""Nick is a good friend of mine,"" Johnson said. ""I told him walking off that if I was going to lose to somebody, I was glad it was him. And he played really well. I didn't give him the tournament. He earned it. He played well."" Tiger Woods produced a stirring final round of 66 to achieve a tie for 10th -- his first top-10 finish in an official PGA Tour event since the 2010 U.S. Open last June. ""I want to win golf tournaments and I didn't do that this week,"" Woods said. ""But I showed positive signs for the next time I play, which is a good thing."" Woods' round of 66 on Sunday was matched by his 22-year-old U.S. Ryder Cup teammate Rickie Fowler, who finished eighth to make it back-to-back top-10s in WGC events. Meanwhile, world No. 3 Luke Donald slipped out of contention with a closing round of 72. The Englishman was seeking a second WGC title of the season after winning the match play event in February, but his challenge faded with bogeys at the 11th and 13th holes. Donald had to make do with seventh, with fellow Europeans Anders Hansen of Denmark and Italy's Francesco Molinari in a tie for third.","Nick Watney shoots a five-under-par closing round of 67 to win WGC event .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova's parents fled their home to escape the fallout from the Chernobyl explosion before she was born. Fast-forward 25 years, and Japan's battle to prevent a possible nuclear meltdown following last week's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has brought into focus the Russian tennis star's work to raise awareness about that earlier disaster. The 23-year-old was born in Siberia a year after the Chernobyl catastrophe, considered the worst nuclear accident in history, as her parents left Belarus to avoid any possible exposure to the spreading radiation. In 2007, the year after she won her second grand slam title at the U.S. Open, Sharapova became a United Nations Development Program goodwill ambassador, making a personal $100,000 donation to its causes in affected areas. 'Heroes' battle to keep nuclear plant under control . This January, she contributed another $250,000 to expand initiatives helping children in the region have access to sporting activities. The problems Japan now faces have raised the specter of another such far-reaching disaster. ""In terms of what's going on over there, it's crazy and something that you can't even prepare for,"" Sharapova -- wearing a T-shirt marking the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl explosion -- told reporters in Indian Wells in the United States, where she is competing. ""It happens, and you see the coverage on it and the videos, and it's really incredible that something like that can even happen in the world. It opens your eyes, and obviously puts a lot of perspective in your life. ""It's a country where I have very great memories from. I started playing there when I was very young, and I always loved my experiences there. So to see it going on there, to its culture and the people, it's really sad."" Sharapova, who moved to the U.S. at the age of nine and is now based in Florida, said she wants to highlight the widespread, long-lasting effects that a nuclear accident can create. ""In the beginning my job was raising awareness to the world, basically getting the message across that even though something like that happened such a long time ago, it still causes many people (problems) on a daily basis,"" she said. ""Kids that were born and now are having kids, you also find that they have something in their body that's not allowing them to live a normal life from the pollution. ""I have never actually been around the area ... I wanted to get all the coverage and all the videos around it, because it's really unbelievable what you see. This big huge area -- it's completely deserted. No-one is around it. ""Everyone has completely fled. They took their passports and that's all.

After losing to 29th-ranked Martinez Sanchez in their three previous encounters, the Dane needed just 71 minutes to close out a 6-1 6-3 win on Monday.

"(CNN) -- Yemen is embarking on a major initiative in its war on terror and plans to build four new branches for the country's elite counterterrorism units next year, a spokesman for the country's American embassy said on Saturday. Mohammed Albasha said the branches will be located in four different locations -- Mareb, Shabwa, Abyan and Hadramawt. Hadramawt, Albasha said, will have the largest contingent of counterterror units. ""This is the next phase in the war on terrorism - we are bringing the fight to al Qaeda."" Yemen has been locked in a struggle with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, the offshoot of the al Qaeda terror network based in Yemen. It grabbed the attention of the west with the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines trans-Atlantic flight as it landed in Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day in 2009. The anti-terror campaign has also come under increased international scrutiny since authorities in late October uncovered a cargo plane bomb plot targeting Western interests. AQAP claimed responsibility for the scheme, which involved shipping explosives disguised as printer toner cartridges on U.S.-bound cargo planes. According to a Yemeni government official, international partners such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Gulf Cooperation Council member countries like Saudi Arabia will assist in training and equipping the Yemeni forces in the new branches. The official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media on the matter, told CNN, ""One of the main reasons this is happening -- and one of the main ideas behind building these branches and training these forces -- is because air strikes have caused a lot of collateral damage."" ""This will, hopefully, minimize collateral damage in the future,"" he said. The four new counterterrorism branches ""have been in the works for a while now,"" said the official. ""This year, the plans were pushed forward,"" he said. ""The branches should be built in 2011."" Yemen's government, which has little control over many parts of its territory, has openly asked for U.S. assistance to target militants -- though some officials have criticized their counterparts in Washington for not acting quickly or effectively enough. In an interview with CNN in November, Yemen's Foreign Minister Abu Bakr Abdullah Al Qirbi said, ""It wasn't really until last year that the Americans have been heavily involved in building our counterterrorism capability and providing us with equipment."" Over the past year, U.S. Special Forces have expanded the type of training they are giving to Yemen's military, while also adding more Special Operations forces to the training mission there. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Robert Gates approved spending $150 million to train and equip Yemen's security forces, specifically so they can fight al Qaeda. That includes helicopters, planes and other equipment and it more than doubles the amount of aid the U.S. military authorized in 2009. According to the Yemeni government official, Sanaa will get another four Huey II helicopters in 2011 -- all of which should be operational by year's end. A senior defense official told CNN last month that the United States and Yemen have shared surveillance and intelligence on AQAP activity inside the country. Last week, at a forum at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said AQAP is ""increasingly active"" in reaching out to find terrorist recruits, even in the United States. ""Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is now the most operationally active node of the al Qaeda network,"" Brennan said. According to a statement released by the While House, Brennan called Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Thursday and emphasized ""the importance of taking forceful action against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in order to thwart its plans to carry out terrorist attacks in Yemen as well as in other countries, including in the U.S. Homeland."" Earlier this month, a vehicle carrying U.S. Embassy personnel in Yemen was attacked but nobody was injured. In October the motorcade of the British deputy ambassador was attacked and in April the British ambassador's car was the target of a failed bomb attack. While it is not yet known who is responsible for that attack, the State Department's most recent travel advisory for Yemen warns Americans of threats to U.S. interests due to active terrorist activity, specifically from AQAP. Embassy employees in Sanaa are instructed to use caution when visiting restaurants, hotels or tourist areas in the capital and are forbidden from traveling outside the capital.","NEW: U.S., U.K. and Saudi Arabia will help Yemen set up four counterterror branches, a Yemeni official says .

"(CNN) -- Native son and veteran dog musher John Baker of Kotzebue, Alaska, made history Tuesday by claiming first place in the state's famous Iditarod Sled Dog Race. Baker's win marks the first time in the race's 38-year history in which an Alaskan Inupiaq has taken top prize. Baker's win triggered some raw emotional Alaskan pride, with native drums beating loudly at Iditarod's finish line. Baker, wearing bib number 53, pulled onto Front Street in Nome at 9:46 a.m. local time, waving and shaking hands with the celebratory crowd as many fans ran behind Baker's sled. Baker, 48, also shattered Martin Buser's course record for fastest completion time, beating it by more than three hours. Baker completed more than 1,150-miles of travel in eight days, 19 hours, 46 minutes and 49 seconds. The win marks Baker's 12th ""Top 10"" finish, but, more importantly, his first win. The Iditarod's finish line in Nome is located along the Bering Sea coast, in the heart of rural but proud Inupiat country, populated by the Inupiat Eskimo group that still relies on a traditional, subsistence lifestyle primarily of hunting, fishing and whaling. A large welcoming crowd gathered around the famed burled arch, and the crowd erupted in cheers and native chants as Baker and his team of 10 dogs became visible on the horizon. Pumping his fists into the air, Baker told the crowd, ""I feel good... I'm just so happy to be here and see everybody. I'm just enjoying the moment... This is the way life is supposed to be."" Along with his lead dog seated on the winner's podium of Iditarod 39, Baker was presented a check for $50,400 and a key to a brand-new Dodge truck. The win epitomizes the pride running very deep in native Alaska. Throughout race coverage provided online with ""The Iditarod Insider,"" Inupiats enthusiastically greeted Baker at checkpoints along the trail, providing words of encouragement to their native son. Sheldon Katchatag, an elder from the village checkpoint of Unalakleet, told the ""The Iditarod Insider,"" ""This is a historic race, not just from the Iditarod perspective, but for the first time in the history of this race, a musher of Inupiaq descent from western Alaska is about to fulfill our ambitions for our customary and traditional livelihood."" Katchatag, who grew up mushing to collect wood to keep his family's cabin warm, reminded race watchers, ""This is not a sport. It used to be the only means of transportation."" Katchatag has been greeting mushers in Unalakleet for decades now, but he admits Baker's position in the race inspired him for the first time to put on native clothing to greet the musher. The village elder donned his mom's polar bear fur boots, his dad's polar bear mittens, a parka with a wolf ruff and a beaver hat. He was beating on a traditional drum to welcome Baker's team into Unalakleet before the sun had even risen, as seen on video provided online by ""The Iditarod Insider."" ""I felt the spirit move me to welcome him into Inupiat country. I did that at 5 o'clock in the morning because I identify with him,"" Katchatag told a reporter from the Alaska Dispatch, ""We are so, so proud of him."" Louie Nelson, an elder from Baker's hometown, was watching as Baker crossed the finish line, telling ""The Iditarod Insider"" that Baker has ""put Kotzebue on the map."" Nelson, whose son also was a musher in this year's Iditarod race, says there is no day in Kotzebue ""that will be prouder than today."" Baker is a commercial pilot in his hometown and describes himself as self-employed. According to a biography featured in the 2011 Iditarod Race Guide, Baker enjoys ""rural Alaska life"" and lists his hobbies as ""flying and dogs."" He has a son, Alex, 22, a veteran of the Junior Iditarod race and a daughter, Tahala, 8 years old. Baker has been competing in the Iditarod Sled Dog Race consecutively since 1996, one of the few natives who have successfully been able to raise the funds necessary to participate in the race each year. Mushers estimate costs at close to $20,000 just to compete in the long-distance event -- including a $4,000 entrance fee, the year-long training of a dog team and the necessary supplies to be stocked all the way along the 1,150-mile trail. Many mushers compete with dog teams borrowed from other kennels to defray their own expenses. Veteran musher Hugh Neff, who was racing in fifth place on the trail Tuesday, told fans before the start of the race that he believes there should be a scholarship fund that would allow at least one native musher to compete each year in the Iditarod. After all, the Iditarod's roots come from rural Alaskan traditions, which Neff says he studied first-hand while living and working in native villages across the Arctic. Neff knows a little something about how to scrape funds together. He moved to Alaska in 1995 to ""chase down a dream,"" he told CNN, with only $200 to his name the first day. He was living in a tent in the woods near an Anchorage public park, he said, but now owns his own successful kennel in Tok, Alaska, where he trains his long-distance teams. Neff was quick, however, to give most of the credit to the dogs themselves, declaring, ""We, as humans, are so weak compared to these dogs. What they do blows my mind. Half the time out there, I'm either giggling or crying with joy just watching them do what they do... it's pretty phenomenal to watch."" Dallas Seavey, a 23-year-old third-generation musher from Seward, Alaska, also was going for a top-five position in the race this year. Seavey, the youngest musher to ever complete the Iditarod at age 19, surprised veterans of the sport at this year's 1,000-mile Yukon Quest -- taking first place and a spot in history as the youngest musher to ever win that long-distance race. Seavey began his Iditarod march from Anchorage to Nome only a couple weeks after the Quest win. Last year's champion and four-time consecutive Iditarod winner, Lance Mackey, had some early disappointments in the race this year. His starting team of 16 dogs has now been pared down to eight; others were left with veterinarians at various checkpoints en route. Mackey was in 17th place Tuesday with about 100 miles still to travel to reach the finish line at Nome. Baker and Mackey are competitors in the race but are also good friends who share a common love for the sport. Mackey acknowledged to ""The Iditarod Insider"" that having a new champion this year is ""good for the sport."" Mackey even predicted a native win by Baker would mean a lot to the state of Alaska. ""It's wonderful. It couldn't happen to a better guy,"" Mackey said. That congratulatory sentiment was echoed by Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell, whose office released a statement saying Baker's ""lightning pace has given Kotzebue bragging rights and made this a thrilling race for Alaskans and people around the world.""","Alaskan John Baker wins this year's Iditarod Sled Dog Race in record time .

"London, England (CNN) -- The pressure on Inter boss Rafa Benitez intensified on Sunday as his team crashed to a 2-1 defeat to Chievo in Serie A. To compound the issue, star striker Samuel Eto'o looks likely to receive a retrospective ban after television cameras showed him head-butting opponent Bostjan Cesar in the chest late in the first half. The referee and officials missed the incident, which was reminiscent of Zinedine Zidane's head-butt on Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final in Germany, but if reported the Cameroon international is likely to be sidelined for several matches. Chievo took the lead shortly before the Eto'o incident, when Sergio Pellissier headed home after 29 minutes. And the home side made sure of victory eight minutes from time when substitute Davide Moscardelli tucked away a cross from Luca Rigoni. Eto'o scored a brilliant individual goal in injury time but it was too little, too late. ""It's clear that after a defeat no-one is happy, the only thing I can say is that we worked very hard today and our reaction in the second half on a terrible pitch showed great character,"" Benitez said, AFP reported. The result means his team is now in sixth place, nine points adrift of leaders and city rivals AC Milan. Swede sends Milan clear . Juventus moved ahead of Inter into fifth place after a 2-0 win at mid-table Genoa. Juve were gifted the lead when Claudio Marchisio's deflected shot cannoned off the post on to the back of goalkeeper Eduardo and into the net. But there was nothing lucky about the second goal as Milos Krasic cut in from the right past Domenico Criscito and fired a shot into the far corner in the 23rd minute. Second-placed Lazio lost ground on AC Milan after a 1-1 draw at Parma left the gap at three points. Hernan Crespo gave Parma the lead after 22 minutes, but Lazio equalized through striker Sergio Floccari in first half stoppage time. In an thrilling game at Lecce, Giampaolo Pazzini scored a hat-trick to give Sampdoria all three points in a 3-2 win. Pazzini opened his account after eight minutes and doubled his tally shortly before halftime from the penalty spot. But back came Lecce after the break with goals from David Di Michele and Souleymane Diamoutene in the 73rd and 83rd minute respectively. But home fans hearts were broken moments later when Pazzini popped up to complete fire home a third in the 88th minute to seal victory for the visitors. In the battle at the bottom of the table Brescia lost 2-1 to Cagliari at home. Andrea Caracciolo gave Brescia the lead after 20 minutes when he converted a penalty, but two second half goals within three minutes of each other from striker Alessandro Matri and midfielder Daniele Conti. Cagliari rise to 17th place, one place above Brescia courtesy of a superior goal difference. Palermo move up to seventh in the table after beating Cesena 2-1, while bottom placed Bari lost 1-0 to 10-man Catania after Christian Terlizzi scored a late winner.","Rafa Benitez on the brink as Inter lose 2-1 at Chievo .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Authorities on Thursday ordered the closure of a restaurant for repeatedly violating the nation's tough new anti-smoking law, the first such shutdown in Spain, officials told CNN. The owner of the restaurant -- El Asador Guadalmina near the popular southern Mediterranean resort of Marbella -- earlier this week defiantly told Spanish media he would not pay a nearly $200,000 fine for allowing clients to smoke in his locale, despite the new law which prohibits smoking in all indoor bars and restaurants. ""This restaurant has been in non-compliance since the law began,"" said a spokesman for Spain's national health ministry. ""From what we know, this is the first case in the country"" of a restaurant closure order. Health inspectors made two visits to the restaurant Thursday, the first time leaving an order to close the establishment and the second time accompanied by two police officers, CNN affiliate Cuatro TV reported from the scene. But restaurant owner Jose Eugenio Arias dug in his heels, telling a throng of reporters outside the restaurant on Thursday, ""No one is going to close my business. I will fight 'til the end. I'm using my constitutional rights as a citizen and I'm not going to be run over by this dictatorial, Marxist, terrorist government."" The restaurant remained open Thursday evening before the Spanish dinner hour, and some clients could be seen smoking inside.  But the CNN affiliate's reporter on the scene said local authorities were not willing to wait much longer and warned they could send the police to shut the locale. Even before the new smoking law took effect January 2, the restaurant posted signs reading, ""As a private business, making use of what we understand to be our rights, this law will not be applied in our establishment."" The signs went on to accuse Spain's Socialist government of using the new law as a ""smoke screen to cover up seven years of massive destruction in Spain,"" apparent references to the country's deep economic crisis and to the two terms of the elected government. The restaurant owner, Jose Eugenio Arias, has since formed an association called Reform or Be Ruined, trying to build support among other bar and restaurant owners for non-compliance with the law. The law puts Spain in line with the strictest European countries, Britain, France and Italy, which prohibit smoking in all enclosed public spaces. The Spanish government says most of the nation's bars and restaurants are complying with the ban. Many have added to their outdoor terrace space, or put in outdoor heating, so that clients can step outside for a smoke, where it is allowed. Arias told Cuatro TV in an interview earlier this week that he had no intention of paying the nearly $200,000 fine, and he vowed to fight any attempt to limit his decision to permit clients to smoke in his restaurant. Arias has 15 days to appeal the administrative order to close his restaurant, the Andalusia health department spokeswoman said.","The restaurant's owner has vowed to defy the law .
He says he won't pay nearly $200,000 fine .

"(CNN) -- Tickets went on sale for the 2012 London Olympics on Tuesday, but some sports fans were unable to process their applications due to problems with the online payment system.

Payments must be made between May 10 and June 10.

But on the streets of Cairo, things are anything but normal. Thousands of protesters jamming the downtown area for the 16th day in a row.

ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Vice President Suleiman made some particularly unhelpful comments about Egypt not being ready for democracy, about not seeing a lift of the emergency law. And I don't, I don't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress. STARR: But a calmer approach from the Pentagon, where sources say they are easing back from crisis atmosphere. ROBERT GATES, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: I think the Egyptian military has conducted itself in exemplary fashion during this entire episode. And they have acted with great restraint. STARR: Middle East analyst Michelle Dunne says the U.S. government message has changed from immediate action to a more protracted process. A process that is unclear. MICHELE DUNNE, MIDDLE EAST EXPERT, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT: President Obama has been calling for a transition to begin now. On the other hand, we hear Secretary Clinton a couple of days ago saying we support the process laid about by Vice President Suleiman, which is not a process the opposition has agreed to at all. STARR: There is a growing concern the man the U.S. is supporting, the new Egyptian vice president, is not on the same page . DUNNE: Up until now, the Obama administration was saying that this had to be a negotiated transition, that the Egyptian government had to deal with the opposition and that the opposition had to be a partner, so to speak, in this transition. What Suleiman is offering right now is not that at all. (END VIDEO) More Winter Weather . AZUZ: Weather report is starting to sound like a broken record, and that doesn't make dealing with it any easier. Yes, there is yet another round of winter storms moving across the country. This is what Oklahoma City looked like on Tuesday, parts of the city getting up to 12 inches of snow. And this is just one week after that massive winter storm we reported on hammered the region. There are winter weather alerts from Texas all the way to the East Coast, with forecasts for rain, wind, snow and sleet through the rest of the week. Sound Check . BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: The economic recovery that began in the middle of 2009 appears to have strengthened in the past few months, although the unemployment rate remains high. State of the Economy . AZUZ: Well, you've heard of the president's State of the Union speech. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a kind of ""state of the economy"" address to Congress. And as you heard, he didn't really offer a simple thumbs up or thumbs down. It was kinda like a ""thumbs sideways."" Talking to the House Budget Committee, Chairman Bernanke said Congress needs to make big changes to help stabilize the economy. The Federal Reserve has taken its own steps to try to get things going in the right direction. But some members of Congress, including the chairman of the budget committee, disagree with the Fed's actions. And they let Bernanke know how they felt during yesterday's hearing. Shoutout .

AZUZ: The name comes from silicon being a main component in computer circuits. You heard Chairman Ben Bernanke a moment ago mention the economic recovery. There are signs of that in Silicon Valley, and it has to do with web sites that a lot of us visit every day. Dan Simon looks at some of the businesses that are on the rise in the valley. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Facebook is getting a new home address, the company announcing that it's taking over nearly eighty acres of property here in Menlo Park, California. It's taking over the former campus, which was held by Sun Microsystems. Facebook also announcing that it's going to be adding about a thousand workers over the next twelve months. And industry observers say it's sort of a barometer of what you're seeing here in Silicon Valley. Google announcing just last week it's adding six thousand people to its workforce. And what you're seeing is basically three sectors where the hirings are taking place. When it comes to social networking, of course led by Facebook and Twitter, mobile computing. We're talking about smart phones and all the applications that go on those smart phones, a lot of expansion there. And when you talk about cloud computing, any information or data that you get on your phone or PC that comes from the cloud. I had a chance to talk to Michael Copeland. He's a senior writer for Fortune Magazine. He says this is one of the most exciting periods he's ever seen here at Silicon Valley. MICHAEL COPELAND, SENIOR WRITER, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: I think it is on fire if you're in the right part of the industry. So clearly, social networking like Facebook, Google, the internet cloud, mobile. Those things are all going like gangbusters. If you're a mobile app developer in Silicon Valley, you can pretty much write your own ticket. SIMON: Economic figures released from the state of California show that Silicon Valley added a little more than eight thousand jobs in 2010. That trend expected to continue into 2011. But the question is is what broader impact will that have, not only here in California, but across the rest of the United States. Dan Simon, CNN, Menlo Park, California . (END VIDEO) Proposed Law on Sexting . AZUZ: The state of Texas is considering a new law focused specifically on the issue of ""sexting."" The Texas attorney general says the goal of this proposed law is to educate instead of criminalize. Right now, sexting can lead to some very serious consequences. Sandra Endo explains how and why the state is thinking about making this change. (BEGIN VIDEO) SANDRA ENDO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: When being social turns into sexting, that's when many teens could run into problems. A new proposed law in Texas is aimed at addressing teen sexting, punishing teens who send the texts and their parents. GREG ABBOTT, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: They are exposing themselves 'round the world forever more. ENDO: A new survey shows one in five teens admitted sending or posting suggestive images of themselves. Nearly four in ten teens admitted sending sexually suggestive messages. The proposed law would charge the teen with a misdemeanor, forcing a court appearance, and require parents to enroll in an educational program. Eventually, offenders could wipe the slate clean at 17 years old. ABBOTT: Our goal is not to put more teens behind bars, but to try to prevent this type of conduct from taking place. ENDO: Right now, teens can be charged with possessing or trafficking in child pornography, an offense which carries the potential of decades of prison time and being on the registered sex offender list for life. Still, the new proposed law is aimed at helping teens think twice before they click and hit send. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People don't really care. Teenagers don't really care. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They don't think about it at all. They're not thinking when they do it. It's terrible. ENDO: In Washington, Sandra Endo for CNN Student News. (END VIDEO) Before We Go .

"New York (CNN) -- At least 14 passengers died early Saturday after the driver of their tour bus lost control of the vehicle and struck a pole on Interstate 95 in the Bronx, New York police said. The accident occurred about 5:30 a.m. at the Bronx-Westchester County line, and forced the closing of I-95 in both directions until late Saturday, police said. Along with those who were killed, eight of the 31 passengers suffered severe injuries and were transported to area hospitals with the remaining survivors. The bus driver, Ophadel E. Williams, 40, of Brooklyn was also taken to an area hospital with ""non-life-threatening injuries,"" police said. Police have not determined the cause of the accident, which is now the subject of a criminal investigation, according to New York State Police Troop Commander, Major Michael Kopy. Williams said he was cut off by a truck driver which caused his bus to swerve into a guardrail, flip on its side and smash into a pole that cut through two-thirds of the vehicle. Kopy said police have recovered a tractor-trailer that was traveling through the area at the time and interviewed the vehicle's driver. However, Kopy said it has not been determined whether the vehicle was involved in the accident. Kopy also said that police had received reports that the bus was traveling ""at a high rate of speed."" Investigators are examining Williams' background and testing his blood for the presence of alcohol, Kopy said. Kopy also said a video camera had been recovered from the bus, but that investigators had not yet viewed it. At least seven passengers had to be extracted by removing seats and cutting a hole in the remaining roof. Most of the passengers were thrust to the forward third of the bus as it split open, suffering injuries mainly from the chest up, Fire Chief Edward Kilduff said. At least five people being treated at New York's St. Barnabas Hospital suffered skull and spinal fractures, internal bleeding and broken bones, Dr. Ernest Patti told reporters. ""Our -- and the entire city's -- prayers, thoughts and sympathies are with the victims, and their families and loved ones,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a written statement Saturday. ""Many of the victims are Chinese, and we have brought in translators to help assist the families."" The National Transportation Safety Board said it has deployed a 16-member team to investigate the crash, as the bus was traveling south on the New England Thruway near the border of Westchester and the Bronx -- one of New York City's five boroughs. It had departed from the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Monika Plocienniczak contributed to this report.","NEW: Police are interviewing driver of another vehicle that was traveling near the area .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The United States finds intervention in Bahrain by the Persian Gulf kingdom's neighbors ""alarming"" and wants all players in the region to keep ""their own agenda"" out of the struggle between the monarchy and anti-government demonstrators, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday. Washington has told the Bahraini monarchy that ""there is no answer to the demands for political and economic reform though a security crackdown,"" Clinton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""We are urging in the strongest possible terms, both publicly and privately, that they immediately begin to negotiate with the opposition,"" Clinton said. ""At the same time, we are telling the opposition,' you cannot use violence. You should return to the negotiating table. There is no positive outcome to this kind of standoff, and security alone is not the answer.' "" Troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates moved into Bahrain on Monday to ""protect the safety of citizens,"" the Bahraini government said. The troops arrived under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council, an association of six Gulf Arab states. Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency Tuesday and launched a crackdown on anti-government protesters Wednesday, according to witnesses in the capital, Manama. Bahraini officials deny these accounts. At the White House, U.S. President Barack Obama called both Hamad and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to express his ""deep concern over violence"" and the need for ""maximum restraint,"" according to White House spokesman Jay Carney. Bahrain has a Shiite Muslim majority population, but its rulers are Sunni Muslims. An underlying concern is that Iran, an overwhelmingly Shiite state, could seize the opportunity to meddle in Bahrain's internal affairs. Clinton said, ""There is no room for anyone to be pursuing their own agenda in Bahrain, no matter who it is. ""There are clearly other agendas are at work, but the only agenda that should matter is the future of the people of Bahrain,"" she said.","A clampdown is ""no answer"" to demands for reform, Clinton says .

"(CNN) -- Four journalists for The New York Times, including two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Shadid and MacArthur ""genius grant"" recipient Lynsey Addario, are missing in Libya, the newspaper said Wednesday on its website. Editors at the paper said they had last been in touch with the journalists Tuesday morning, U.S. Eastern time, according to the report. It said the newspaper received secondhand information that ""members of its reporting team on the ground in the port city of Ajdabiya had been swept up by Libyan government forces."" However, the newspaper has been unable to confirm those reports, Executive Editor Bill Keller said on the newspaper's website. ""We have talked with officials of the Libyan government in Tripoli, and they tell us they are attempting to ascertain the whereabouts of our journalists,"" Keller said. ""We are grateful to the Libyan government for their assurance that if our journalists were captured they would be released promptly and unharmed."" A battle raged Wednesday in Ajdabiya between government troops and rebels. Bob Christie, senior vice president for corporate communications at The New York Times Co., said Wednesday that the Libyan government told the newspaper it was unaware of the journalists' whereabouts. ""They've told us they have a lot of prisoners and that they're processing them"" and suggested that the four could turn up in that process, Christie said. Libyan government forces said Wednesday that they have no information about where the journalists may be and that, if they were picked up by the Libyan military, they would be returned to Tripoli. The newspaper identified the journalists as Shadid, its bureau chief in Beirut, Lebanon, and two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting; Stephen Farrell, a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009; and Tyler Hicks and Addario, photographers who have covered the Middle East and Africa. ""Their families and their colleagues at The Times are anxiously seeking information about their situation, and praying that they are safe,"" Keller said. Addario, a freelancer based in India, recently won a MacArthur Fellowship -- known as a ""genius grant"" -- for her photography around the world. In an e-mail Monday to CNN correspondent Ivan Watson, Addario called the Libya story ""one of the most dangerous"" of her career. The e-mail said, ""qaddafi's forces heading back east, and the rebels are surrendering along the way...so exhausted. this story has been one of the most dangerous i have ever covered. getting bombed from the air and by land."" Addario's husband, Paul de Bendern, told CNN that his wife travels to conflict zones because they're powerful stories. He was anxious to see his wife's return. ""It's very difficult. We're here, we're waiting. I want my wife back,"" said de Bendern, who is bureau chief in New Delhi, India, for Reuters. ""Lynsey is a very smart woman, funny and brave,"" he added. ""She's very passionate about what she's doing. ... She tells the world of these important things with the beauty of her photography."" While working as a foreign correspondent, Shadid was shot in the shoulder by the Israeli Army in Ramallah in spring 2002. Farrell routinely reports from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. Before joining The New York Times in 2007, he worked for the Times of London. In April 2004, he was kidnapped while on assignment in Iraq. Hicks, a staffer for the paper, is based in Istanbul and has served as an embed in Afghanistan. In a 2004 interview with the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, Hicks described how he felt about his job: ""Covering conflicts is a very rewarding experience because you can bring attention to global issues. When I'm working and a photograph appears in The New York Times, I always remind myself of who is seeing that photograph"" and the number of people it may have reached, he said. ""That is when I can go to bed at night and feel good about what I have done that day."" Hicks and Addario are both from Westport, Connecticut.

"(CNN) -- A floating body was found Saturday that authorities believe to be the man who kidnapped his ex-girlfriend's 4-year-old son and drove with him into a canal. A California water authority employee saw the body, believed to be that of Jose Esteban Rodriguez, at about 8:30 a.m. on Saturday. It was discovered in a part of the 117-mile Delta-Mendota Canal in the northern California city of Patterson, according to a press release from the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department. The employee alerted Stanislaus County Sheriff's detectives, who went to the scene along with members of the department's dive team and the West Stanislaus-Patterson Fire Department. Authorities determined the body was that of an adult Hispanic male with clothing and a physical make-up matching that of Rodriguez. Authorities will now employ scientific measures, such as DNA tests and dental records, and examine other evidence to definitively identify the body. The discovery comes 11 days after authorities found the body of young Juliani Cardenas, the boy who Rodriguez allegedly swiped from his grandmother's arms on January 18. Tabitha Cardenas, the boy's mother, who broke up with Rodriguez five months earlier, told CNN affiliate KCRA that she was ""relieved that all this is over."" She also expressed sympathy for Rodriguez's mother, now that his body has apparently been found. ""I feel her pain, because I know what it's like to lose a son,"" Cardenas said. ""She knows that I have always given her the utmost respect, through everything."" A day later, a farmer saw a car that appeared to be Rodriguez's 2003 silver Toyota Corrolla -- purportedly with a man and youngster inside -- careen into the canal. The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department said that the body found Saturday was about 11 miles south of where that car was driven into the water. A homicide warrant had been issued for Rodriguez in connection with Juliani's death while authorities searched for him, Sheriff Adam Christianson said. Last month, authorities found the man's Toyota trapped in 50 feet of water and intertwined with two other vehicles, according to Christianson. The windows of the car were opened and it was badly damaged, but there were no bodies inside. Tabitha Cardenas had said Rodriguez either wanted to have her son for himself or wanted revenge for their breakup. She said she never thought Rodriguez, who is the father of her unborn child, would harm Juliani. Rodriguez ""wanted to be with my son,"" Cardenas said January 20. ""He wanted to be with my son so bad that he took it to the extreme.""","NEW: The kidnapped boy's mother says she's ""relieved that all this is over""

"(CNN) -- Casey Stoner showed he will be a force to be reckoned with at new team Honda by dominating practice for the season-opening MotoGP event in Qatar on Friday, but seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi struggled as he seeks to replace the Australian at Ducati. Repsol Honda claimed the three quickest times in the evening session at the Losail International Circuit, with Stoner's best of one minute 55:035 seconds heading off Spaniard Dani Pedrosa and Italian Andrea Dovizioso. Yamaha's world champion Jorge Lorenzo was fourth fastest as he beat young American teammate Ben Spies for the first time in three sessions this week. Spanish motorcyclist Hector Barbera, who finished 12th overall last season, was the best of Ducati's three riders in sixth place. Rossi, who ended a seven-year stint with Yamaha at the end of a 2010 season marred by injuries, was eighth. American Nicky Hayden, who also rode with Rossi at Honda earlier in his career, was back in 14th. ""Today was a bit difficult, because we had hoped to make a bigger improvement, but in the end we didn't lower our time enough,"" Rossi told the Ducati website. ""First of all, my shoulder bothered me a little. I wasn't as strong as I was yesterday, and in the end of the session, I could feel it. Also, we still don't know this bike perfectly and, as happened to us in the test, we get to a point where it's difficult to make a step forward with the set-up. ""We're missing half a second with our pace to be in the group where we hope to be Sunday. Anyway, today we tried two set-up solutions that were quite different, and we chose one that we'll try to refine tomorrow."" Stoner, the 2007 world champion in motorcycling's elite class, also set the fastest time in windy conditions in Friday's opening session of 1:55:457 as he again headed off Pedrosa, with Spies third. Lorenzo was fifth despite the Spaniard suffering problems with his bike which limited his time on the track. Rossi was ninth, with Hayden just behind him. Lorenzo's compatriot Alvaro Bautista has been ruled out of Sunday's race after the 26-year-old Suzuki rider suffered a broken leg when he crashed late in Friday's second session. Qualifying will be held on Saturday evening Qatar time, with Sunday's race also at night at 1900 GMT.","Honda's new signing Casey Stoner quickest ahead of qualifying in Qatar .

"(CNN) -- Teresa Scanlan of Nebraska will spend the next year as Miss America after besting 52 other pageant hopefuls at Saturday's event in Las Vegas. The 17-year-old Gering resident and Scottsbluff High School student played the piano during the competition. Her platform issue was tackling eating disorders. She hopes to attend law school, become a judge and eventually a politician, according to the Miss America website. Scanlan succeeds last year's honoree, Caressa Cameron from Virginia. The 22-year-old Virginia Commonwealth University student is the National Goodwill Ambassador for the Children's Miracle Network. The other four finalists were Emoly West of Oklahoma, Jacquie Brown of Washington, Jalee Fuselier of Hawaii and Alyse Eady of Arkansas. Scanlan is the youngest winner since the pageant instituted age requirements -- between 18 and 28 starting in 1938. The age limit changed again in 1993 to 17 to 24. In 1933, for instance, when there was no upper or lower age limit, 15-year-old Marian Bergeron of Connecticut captured the title. This year's contest was the 90th anniversary of the Miss America pageant. Margaret Gorman became known as the first Miss America after winning a pair of contests in 1921 -- one consisting of women deemed most popular based on photos shown in various East Coast newspapers and the other for the so-called Golden Mermaid trophy. Today judges rate contestants on talent, appearance and demeanor based on performances, interviews and evening wear and swimsuit competitions. The pageant, which is distinct from the Miss USA crown, aims ""to provide personal and professional opportunities for young women to promote their voices in culture, politics and the community,"" according to the Miss America website.","Scanlan, 17, is a high schooler who plans to attend law school and hopes to become a judge .

"Ashdod, Israel (CNN) -- The Israeli military displayed mortar shells, ammunition and surface-to-sea missiles in Ashdod on Wednesday, ordnance that officials said was seized from a ship bound for Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the weapons ""originated in Iran, went through Syria, and they were en route to terror organizations in Gaza, but their ultimate target was the Israeli civilian population."" ""Every day, new attempts are made by Iran and by Syria to smuggle weapons into Lebanon to Hezbollah, to Gaza to Hamas and to other terror organizations,"" he said. Accompanying Netanyahu for the display were Defense Minister Ehud Barak and army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Benny Gans, among other officials. Israeli commandos intercepted a ship 200 miles off the coast Tuesday. The ""Victoria"" is German-owned and Liberian-flagged, with an international crew. The ship had 1,000 containers aboard, the army said, and three were found to be carrying the weapons. Israeli officials say the containers were loaded in the Syrian port of Latakia, where a false manifest indicated that they were carrying lentils.The ship made a stop in Turkey before heading for the Egyptian port of Alexandria, where the containers were to be unloaded. Lt. Col. Avital Leibowitz, spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces, said the military believes that these weapons were intended to be smuggled into Gaza through the numerous tunnels between the Egyptian Sinai desert and the coastal strip, which is governed by Hamas. Among the weapons were six C-704 surface-to-sea missiles with two launchers, along with a British-manufactured radar command and control system. According to Israeli military analyst Ron Ben Ishai, the introduction of this weapon would have added strategic significance to those battling Israel. ""Had this shipment gone through to Alexandria and then to one of the Palestinian organizations in Gaza, it would have given them the capability that does not exist today, that is, to hit the Israeli navy at a distance of 35 kilometers,"" he said. Along with the missiles, the Israeli army says, it found 230 120-mm mortar shells, 2,200 60-mm mortar shells and 66,960 Kalashnikov rifle rounds.","Three containers of weapons found aboard ship Tuesday, officials say .

"(CNN) -- It's both time-honored tradition and cutting-edge technology blended in this small factory in Osaka, Japan. This is the home of Japan's best known sporting export, Mizuno. Masato Mizuno, chairman of sportswear company Mizuno, speaks to CNN's Andrew Stevens in The Boardroom. Its sports equipment and clothes sell around the world -- baseball gear, its first ever product, now joined by a growing range of other sports equipment. And then there's the ""fastswim"" professional swimsuits, modeled on shark skin. The company is headed by effervescent chairman Masato Mizuno. In Osaka he talked to CNN's Andrew Stevens in The Boardroom about the toughest challenges he has faced in 19 years at the top. Mizuno: OK. I became the president in 1988. It was a really great time. We've been enjoying the so-called bubble economy. So whatever we do, it was very successful in like four to five years, However, after that collapse of the bubble economy, we had a really hard time. But we set up a quite precise schedule to the comeback. And everybody really worked hard -- very cooperative. So we came back . Stevens: What lessons do you think you learnt that made the company better from going through that very sharp downturn? Mizuno: Well we emphasize wherever we have strongness. During the good years, we diversified the range of the business. Most of them I failed. So whatever left we really emphasized this area which is technology. Stevens: You've looked at the animal kingdom to provide some clues for developing new products. I'm thinking of sharkskin used in your fast suits, patterns on a shark actually have been incorporated into your fast suits and there's a lot of success with swimmers wearing your products in Sydney. What else are you working on? Mizuno: Well, we're developing the new swimsuits for Beijing. This is quite different from the past. So I cannot tell you today but this is quite, you know, different products. Stevens: What do you think is the best piece of management advice you've ever received? Mizuno: I've learned from the boy scout experience, our motto is be prepared. So every, you know the item, I have to do, I like to make good preparation, for the company for myself, or for family, we have to be prepared.

Eight U.S. Navy ships are now at work off the Japanese coast, with five more on the way in coming days and weeks, Lapan said. Some military personnel on the USS Ronald Reagan off the East Coast of Honchu set off alarms indicating radiation and were decontaminated with soap and water, according to Lapan. The ship was about 100 miles from the damaged Japanese nuclear reactors at the time and subsequently changed its position, he said. Lapan said those who registered ""very low levels"" of radiation included flight crews on helicopters returning to the ship, as well as crew members who never left the ship. He was unable to say how many people had to be scrubbed down but added that they weren't wearing protective gear and that none had been given radiation-blocking potassium iodide in response. Two search-and-rescue teams from the United States arrived in the hard-hit coastal city of Ofunato, which was severely damaged in the quake. It took their convoy six hours to travel from Misawa Air Base on Monday. Nearly 150 people and 12 dogs trained to detect live victims arrived in Japan late Sunday, according to Los Angeles Fire Department Inspector Don Kunitomi. Hailing from California and Fairfax County, Virginia, the teams are the only two in the United States qualified to respond to disasters on such a scale, Kunitomi said. ""There are a lot hazards that have never been experienced by a search-and-rescue team,"" Kunitomi said. ""There's this radiation factor. We do have radiation equipment ... but no one has ever really experienced this."" ""It looks like it'll be part Katrina because of the flooding and part New Zealand because of the earthquake,"" he continued, referring to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and last month's earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. The teams traveled in a convoy of two buses, several flatbed trailers and half a dozen utility vehicles. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is coordinating the overall American response. The United States is also sending experts from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to offer technical assistance to the Japanese government. On Sunday, the USS Ronald Reagan started delivering aid in the coastal regions of Japan's Miyagi Prefecture. Crew members, in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Forces, conducted 20 sorties delivering aid pallets. Eight U.S. and Japanese helicopters were used to distribute the pallets, according to Sgt. Maj. Stephen Valley of U.S. Forces Japan. . China . . A 15-member Chinese search and rescue team has begun work in Ofunato, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. The group brought 4 tons of material and equipment and is expected to work in the area for up to 10 days, the agency reported. The gesture comes just six months after the two countries sparred in a territorial dispute over the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. Tokyo held a Chinese trawler captain after his fishing boat collided with Japanese coast guard ships near the islands in September. There also remains a great deal of tension between China and Japan, left over from Japan's invasion and occupation of part of China from 1931 to 1945. The wartime atrocities still fuel widespread distrust of Japan by many Chinese. However, ""China is also a country prone to earthquake disasters, and we fully empathize with how they feel now,""  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Monday. China has been hit with two devastating quakes in the past three years. And it is conducting domestic quake rescue efforts in southwestern Yunnan province after a deadly 5.8-magnitude quake Thursday. . United Kingdom . . A British team comprising 63 fire service search-and-rescue specialists, two dogs and a medical support team is in Japan, the U.K. foreign office said. The group has 11 metric tons of rescue equipment, including heavy lifting and cutting equipment to extract people trapped in debris, the government said. . New Zealand . . New Zealand has sent a rescue team of 10 from Christchurch to the hard-hit Japanese coastal city of Sendai. Christchurch is cleaning up from its own earthquake on February 21 that killed 123 people. . Mexico . . A Mexican rescue squad made up of eight search and rescue specialists, five dogs, two structure assessment specialists, members of the Mexican Red Cross and personnel from the National Autonomous University of Mexico is in Sendai, the Mexican Foreign Affairs Ministry said Monday. . International Groups . . The International Atomic Energy Agency's Incident and Emergency Centre has offered technical assistance to Japan in the wake of an explosion at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes close to the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure, authorities said Sunday. In addition to the response from world governments, humanitarian assistance groups have sent teams to hard-hit areas across Japan. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has 62 teams in-country providing assistance, according to a United Nations situation report. A Red Cross hospital in the city of Ishinomaki, which was engulfed by the tsunami, is the primary medical facility providing health care services in the area, according to the International Red Cross' Patrick Fuller. He says the focus is very much on search and rescue at the moment, adding that the group is particularly concerned about Japan's large population of elderly people who are vulnerable to hypothermia. The World Health Organization has alerted its network of health experts who specialize in nuclear-related disasters. The Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network is now on standby, ready to assist if requested by Japanese authorities. The network is made of representatives from more than 40 institutions with expertise in radiation emergency medicine, public heath interventions and long-term followup. Mercy Corps International teamed with Peace Winds Japan to rush aid to affected regions. On Sunday, Peace Winds conducted assessments in two northeastern cities, Ishimaki and Kesennuma, according to a statement on Mercy Corps' website. On Monday, the group will use helicopters to bring in 30 family-sized tents, plus materials to construct a 100-person balloon shelter. Peace Winds has expert responders on their way to remote areas of northern Japan, where they plan to distribute large emergency tents, water, food and blankets, according to Mercy Corps' website. The two groups are working to deliver other essential items that are in short supply. Medecins sans Frontieres has a 10-member team working in Miyagi Prefecture, assisting ""in the massive government-led relief effort."" ""On Sunday, we conducted mobile clinics and assessments in two evacuation centers,"" team coordinator Mikiko Dotsu said in a news release. ""It appears that medical needs are increasing in evacuation centers."" Additional personnel will join the group Monday, which will then split in two to cover more ground. The teams will begin working their way into more remote areas, focusing particularly on the needs of vulnerable populations like elderly people and young children. Stephen McDonald of Save the Children said Sunday that his group had multiple teams in the country, reaching out to families left homeless.

"(CNN) -- England kept their Cricket World Cup hopes alive after a dramatic 18-run victory over the West Indies. Needing to win to stay in the tournament, England failed to capitalize on a quick start to their innings, losing a clutch of wickets in the middle period to post a modest total of 243. The West Indies got off to a fast start themselves and looked well set to clinch their place in the last eight at 222-6 before losing their last four wickets for three runs to hand England an astonishing triumph. England will be through to the quarterfinals if Group B leaders South Africa beat Bangladesh on Saturday or India beat the West Indies on Sunday. For the sixth time in the tournament England were involved in a match that twisted one way and then the other, the outcome unclear until right at the death. Batting first in Chennai, captain Andrew Strauss got England off to a bright start, hitting 31, while Jonathan Trott looked in good touch before he was dismissed for 47. But England slumped from 121-3 to 151-6 as Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara all went in quick succession. They were grateful to Luke Wright, who hit 44, and an unbeaten 20 from Tim Bresnan to set a competitive target. In reply Chris Gayle played in trademark fashion, smashing 43 runs off 21 balls and taking 18 off an over from Chris Tremlett before spinner James Tredwell made his mark on his first appearance in the tournament. He claimed the first three wickets as Gayle, Devon Smith and Dwayne Bravo were all removed. When Bopara then bowled captain Darren Sammy and Devon Thomas, England could scent victory. Explosive batsman Kieron Pollard fell for 24 but Ramnaresh Sarwan and Andre Russell steadied the ship for the West Indies before Trott thought he had caught Russell in the deep. But Trott's catch was ruled out by the third umpire, who adjudged he had made contact with the boundary rope after taking the ball. Six runs were given instead. With the partnership between Sarwan and Russell reaching 72, West Indies needed just 24 more runs to win before the game turned on its head. First Russell was trapped LBW by Tredwell before fellow spinner Graeme Swann then dismissed Sarwan and Kemar Roach in consecutive balls. And England's thrilling victory was confirmed when a pinpoint throw from Trott allowed Matt Prior to run out Sulieman Benn. Swann told the England and Wales Cricket Board's website: ""I thought 'It's one of those nights'. We have dug ourselves a hole and we are slowly stepping out of it. It was up there with the Ashes for raw emotion."" Strauss added: ""We've just been inconsistent, there's no doubt about it. We haven't played as well as we would like in this tournament, but we have pulled out some results when we really needed them. ""Obviously we are still waiting on other results, but hopefully we have done enough to go through to the last eight.""","England beat West Indies by 18 runs to keep Cricket World Cup hopes alive .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro threw his support behind Egyptian protesters Monday, hailing the ""defeat of the United States' principal ally in the bosom of Arab countries."" In a newspaper column called ""The Revolutionary Rebellion in Egypt"", Castro accused Washington of looking the other way while Hosni Mubarak pillaged his own people.  ""We support the people of Egypt and their brave fight for political rights and social justice,"" he wrote. Castro was in power for nearly five decades after his own revolution defeated Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. He was forced to hand power to his younger brother Raul Castro in 2006 when he fell ill. Cuban dissidents have also allied themselves with Egypt's young protesters, saying they too should try to use social media more to organize protests against the government.  On the day of Mubarak's fall, prominent Cuban blogger Yoani Sanchez announced via Twitter, ""Right now I feel like I am in Cairo. I shout and celebrate just like them,"" she wrote.

"(CNN) -- Five U.S. soldiers facing murder charges in the deaths of three Afghan civilians earlier this year have now been charged with ""conspiracy to commit premeditated murder,"" and seven more soldiers have been charged in connection with the probe into the incidents. The five facing murder charges are Pfc. Andrew Holmes of Boise, Idaho; Spc. Adam Winfield of Cape Coral, Florida; Spc. Michael Wagnon of Las Vegas, Nevada; Spc. Jeremy Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska; and Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs of Billings, Montana. They are from the 5th Stryker Brigade. The alleged killings took place at or near Forward Operating Base Ramrod in southern Afghanistan's volatile Kandahar province. In June, the five were charged with murder. Holmes was accused of killing Afghan civilian Gul Mudin in January with a grenade and rifle. Winfield is accused of killing civilian Mullah Adahdad in May in a similar manner. Wagnon is accused of shooting to death Marach Agha in February. Morlock and Gibbs each were charged with three counts of murder and one count of assault involving the same victims as in the cases against Holmes, Wagnon and Winfield. On Wednesday, the military added conspiracy and other additional charges against the five. Morlock, Holmes, and Winfield were charged with wrongfully using a Schedule I controlled substance. Charges were also filed against seven other soldiers from the 5th Stryker Brigade, the military said Wednesday, but none involve murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The seven are Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens, Sgt. Darren Jones, Cpl. Emmitt R. Quintal, Staff Sgt. David Bram, Pfc. Ashton A. Moore, Spc. Adam Kelly and Spc. Corey Moore. All were charged with conspiracy-related and other charges. Stevens and Ashton Moore were charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon. Jones was charged with conspiracy to commit assault and battery and conspiracy to commt aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon. Quintal, Bram, Kelly and Corey Moore were charged with conspiracy to commit assault and battery. Stevens was charged with wrongfully and wantonly engaging in conduct likely to cause death or bodily harm to other soldiers.

"(CNN) -- An operation to retrieve two Colombian hostages held by the FARC rebel group will resume Tuesday, the Red Cross said, but the government denied that it had authorized such a move. The conflicting reports come two days after an initial attempt to retrieve the hostages was foiled by inaccurate coordinates. Christophe Beney, the Red Cross representative for the operation, said that the release of police Maj. Guillermo Solorzano and Army Cpl. Salin Sanmiguel by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC will happen in the department of Cauca on Tuesday morning. But shortly after these comments were reported, the Colombian government said in a statement that ""it is not true that we have authorized the resumption of any operation for the liberation of the hostages."" The government was awaiting a debrief from the Red Cross before moving forward, the statement said. Solorzano, Sanmiguel, and police officer Carlos Ocampo were to be released by the FARC on Sunday, but only Ocampo was freed. Colombian authorities were upset at what they said were wrong coordinates given by the Marxist guerrilla group. ""Even though the government did its part, the FARC have committed an act that shocks us,"" said Eduardo Pizarro, the government's representative for the liberation operation. ""Today, the FARC gave us coordinates in the department of Tolima. The helicopters went to those areas, and it turns out that the hostages aren't in the department of Tolima, but in the department of Cauca."" He added that ""this behavior surprises, upsets and disturbs us very much."" In December, the FARC leftist guerrilla group pledged to release five hostages as a humanitarian gesture. Three of them were released last week, and two others had originally been scheduled to be released Sunday. However, former Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who helped to coordinate the humanitarian mission, later said that the rebel group would release three hostages Sunday. Some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed negotiations between Colombia's government and the rebels. One of the freed hostages called for dialogue between the government and insurgents. ""Humanitarian exchange is the first step toward a friendly understanding, which permits the return of our brothers deprived of their liberty,"" politician Armando Acuna said after his release last week. But Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has sharply criticized the FARC, accusing the group of having a ""double standard"" and creating an ""absurd media show"" in order to draw sympathy to their cause. On Thursday, he said he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped in southwestern Colombia on Wednesday night. Journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.","Red Cross says it is ready to resume a liberation operation, .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese authorities vowed Friday to continue their aerial and ground-level dousing of water on a troubled nuclear reactor, with its owner saying that earlier attempts have been ""somewhat effective"" in addressing radiation concerns. Still, the Fukushima Daiichi complex of six nuclear reactors remained a danger. Radiation levels peaked Friday at 20 millisieverts per hour near in an annex building where workers were trying to reestablish electrical power, ""the highest registered (at that building) so far,"" an official with the Tokyo Electric Power Company told reporters. Radiation levels Thursday morning at the plant were nearly 3.8 millisieverts per hour -- more than a typical resident of a developed country receives in a year. But Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said 17 of 18 workers checked Thursday morning tested normal, and the one who received a higher dose of radiation required no medical treatment. Last Friday's earthquake and tsunami caused damage at four of the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, located on the northern coast of the Japanese island of Honshu. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said that efforts would resume Friday afternoon to spray water from the ground and air in and around the plant's No. 3 reactor, the sole damaged unit that contains plutonium along with the uranium in its fuel rods. They have done so already in two rounds Thursday and another early Friday, according to Tokyo Electric. Based on the steam emitted after these water-spraying operations, Edano said that authorities believe there is still water in the spent fuel pool -- meaning fuel rods, which can give off radiation, likely aren't fully exposed -- though he said it was not clear how much liquid there was. Edano said Friday morning that authorities are also assessing whether to also spray in and around the plant's No. 1 reactor, though he added that the situation there was not as serious as in the No. 3 reactor. Concerns remained about the spent fuel pool at reactor No. 4, from which the IAEA said no water-temperature data has been received since Monday, and which a U.S. official said Wednesday appeared to contain no water. ""The current situation at units 1, 2 and 3, whose cores have suffered damage, appears to be relatively stable,"" said Graham Andrew, a top aide to IAEA Director-General Yukiya Amano. ""Unit 4, in particular, remains a major safety concern."" But a Tokyo Electric Power spokesman said Friday that a video of the No. 4 reactor's pool appeared to show it still contained water. Japanese military helicopters dumped tons of water on the No. 3 reactor housing, including its spent-fuel pool, at the plant until after midnight Thursday, TEPCO reported. Earlier, fire and police trucks turned their hoses on the No. 3 reactor housing for more than an hour, and TEPCO said the subsequent steam and lowered radioactivity levels indicated progress. Experts believe that steam rising from the pool, which contains at least partially exposed fuel rods, may be releasing radiation into the atmosphere. In Vienna, Austria, a senior official of the International Atomic Energy Agency told reporters the situation remains serious, but there had been ""no significant worsening"" Thursday. The state of the six nuclear reactors at Fukushima Daiichi has raised the specter of a multiple nuclear meltdown -- the nightmare scenario in which fuel rods cannot be cooled and the reactor's core melts. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can spill out of the damaged containment unit and spread radioactivity and cancer-causing isotopes through the air and water. All six reactors have been shut down, but some appear in better shape than others. A spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, which oversees the running of the country's nuclear plants, said Friday morning that sea water was still being injected into the reactor pressure vessel of Unit 1. A hydrogen explosion damaged it on March 12. White smoke continued to emanate Friday from a hole in the Unit 2 building, said the spokesman, who was not identified by name. In a news release, the agency said ""an abnormal noise"" from the pressure suppression chamber had occurred on March 15 and the chamber's pressure dropped. Workers have been moved away from the unit, though sea water injection continues. A power source for the cooling system of Units 1 and 2 was expected to be connected Friday morning, a Tokyo Electric spokesman said. Unit 3 has been particularly worrisome. It was struck March 14 by an explosion -- described by the IAEA as caused by a hydrogen blast. Fog -- possibly steam -- began rising from the reactor building on Wednesday morning. Unit 3 too is being injected with sea water and water was being sprayed into it. The pressure of the suppression ""has been temporarily increasing since approximately 6:15 a.m. on March 17,"" the release said. Temperatures in the spent-fuel pools at Units 5 and 6 had been rising slowly since they lost power. But engineers got an emergency diesel generator connected to Units 5 and 6 to cool their spent-fuel pools, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said Friday. Water injection to the spent fuel pools was continuing. On Friday morning, Edano said temperatures in and around those two reactors have risen, though not enough to pose any immediate danger, according to a report by Japan's Kyodo News agency. Used nuclear fuel is stored in pools at each of the six reactors plus a shared pool and in a dry container storage, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Sixty percent of the total is in the shared pool, 34% is stored in the six spent-fuel pools of the reactors, and the remaining 6% is stored in nine dry storage containers, it said. There were ""no safety concerns"" about the dry storage containers. The spent-fuel pools -- located at the top of the reactor buildings to make it easier to handle the fuel during refueling -- were typically filled with water 16 feet or more above the top of the fuel rods. ""The only way to rapidly drain down the pool is if there is structural damage to the walls of the floor,"" the release said, noting that the pools have no drains and are built of concrete and steel. They lose water slowly due to evaporation when the units lose power and the cooling systems stop working. But the threat is not immediate. ""Rapid evaporation of the water will not occur,"" the release says. If the water level drops below the fuel, ""oxidation of the zirconium cladding could occur,"" resulting in the formation of hydrogen, it says. But only fuel discarded within recent weeks would cause such a strong reaction, which would require temperatures of approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius, it adds. Zirconium melts at 1600 degrees C. ""The likelihood of cladding damage, as with hydrogen generation, decreases substantially with temperature and cooling time,"" it says. It called the prospect of a zirconium fire ""virtually impossible."" The TEPCO spokesman said the level of water in the main pool, which contained older fuel that had already cooled, was only 10 to 15 centimeters below normal. Still, he acknowledged, officials had not been able to measure the temperature there. And nuclear engineer Arnie Gundersen told CNN that the effort will likely need to be sustained ""for months, if not years."" ""What's pushing the firemen back is the radiation that's coming from the spent fuel pool,"" he said. If the spent fuel rods in that pool are uncovered, ""There's an awful lot of gamma rays flooding that site, forcing the workers to say further away."" Public health officials say the release of radiation from a meltdown can cause immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. About 200,000 people living within a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius of the plant have been evacuated; those living 20 to 30 kilometers from the site have been told to remain inside, and Japan has banned flights over the area. Rebecca Johnson, founder of the London-based Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy, which promotes international security, disarmament and arms control, told CNN that Japanese engineers were ""flying by the seat of their pants now ... Everything they try goes wrong. They're focusing on reactors, then spent fuel becomes damaged,"" Johnson said. ""They've just got to get water in there, keep the water pumping.""

"(CNN) -- The 20 jurors to be selected in the Orlando, Florida, murder trial of Casey Anthony will cost the court system an estimated $361,000, according to court administrators. According to a cost breakdown spreadsheet obtained by ""In Session"" on truTV, these expenses include everything from housing, transportation and three daily meals, to wages associated with the sheriff's office, court clerks and courthouse facilities for the duration of the trial. The jurors will be sequestered for the trial, in which Anthony, who turns 25 on Saturday, faces a capital murder charge in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. The girl was reporting missing in July 2008, and investigators found her body after five months of intense searches. Prior to a jury being seated, the Orange County Clerk of Courts Office will be required to pay nearly $4,000 in jury selection costs. ""It's an estimate of the expenses, but it's certainly not all-inclusive,"" court spokeswoman Karen Levey told the Orlando Sentinel. However, she added, the cost breakdown per juror is ""fairly accurate."" Orange County Clerk of Courts Lydia Gardner told the newspaper that ""funding for the Casey Anthony trial is in serious jeopardy"" and that she ""informed both the chief justice of the state Supreme Court as well as Chief (Judge) Belvin Perry of these dire circumstances."" Florida Gov. Rick Scott in February proposed cutting state spending by more than $5 billion this fiscal year. That includes a cut of about 8.4 percent -- or nearly $40 million -- to the state courts' budget for 2011-12, according to the governor's web site. In a statement released Thursday, Levey said the chief judge knows that Gardner ""has concerns regarding her office's ability to cover the costs that her office is responsible for, ... such as jury sequestration.""

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Even as Washington and Tokyo disagreed on the extent of the threat a damaged nuclear power plant poses, President Barack Obama told the Japanese prime minister Thursday that the United States will help Japan rebuild following last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami. The two leaders had a 30-minute phone call at 10:30 a.m. Thursday (9:30 p.m. ET Wednesday). During the phone call with Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Obama voiced sympathy for Japan's plight. ""The president again conveyed his deep condolences at the tragic loss of life and the widespread suffering in northeastern Japan,"" a White House statement on the call said. ""The president emphasized that the U.S. is determined to do everything possible to support Japan in overcoming the effects of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck on March 11."" Kan also briefed the president on the status of Japanese efforts to contain the nuclear emergency at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in the country's northeast, the White House said. The developments came as the nations established significantly different radiation exposure warning zones. The U.S. military will not allow troops to get within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the damaged plant. The Japanese government has told people to evacuate to at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) away from the damaged reactors. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Thursday it's ""understandable"" that the United States would make a ""more conservative decision"" on the warning zone as it tries to protect its own citizens. He suggests that is, in part, because the United States is ""not directly controlling"" the situation. Meanwhile, a Tokyo Electric Power company official said Thursday that -- based on information gathered from a helicopter that flew over the Fukushima facility on Wednesday -- authorities believe that there is water in a key fuel pool outside one of the plant's most troubled reactors. Hours earlier, Gregory Jaczko, the head of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Congress that spent fuel rods in Unit 4 of the plant had been exposed, resulting in the emission of ""extremely high"" levels of radiation. Having water in the fuel pool is important because it helps absorb the radiation. The Fukushima complex lost its power Friday, after a 9.0-magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami pounded northeastern Japan.","NEW: Japan and United States issue different radiation warning zones .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of African Union soldiers have been killed in two weeks of fierce fighting in Somali capital of Mogadishu, clashes that resulted in significant gains against local and foreign extremists, according to an African Union official familiar with the scale of those losses. The fighting was part of a major offensive by Ugandan and Burundian forces, who are part of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), against Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked extremist group trying to take over the weak transitional federal government and implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. AMISOM officials said they would not specify exactly how many soldiers have been killed or wounded in the operations until the families and contributing countries were properly notified. Also, they didn't detail Al-Shabaab losses. ""This loss of life comes in an intently meaningful and honorable victory, one which will ensure that many more lives will be saved in the long run,"" Wafula Wamunyinyi, a senior AMISOM official, told reporters in Nairobi, Kenya. ""The positions that we have seized in the past week break the grip of extremist militants in the city. We have taken a very important step towards the stabilization of Mogadishu and in pursuit of a day many deemed impossible -- the day when law and order returns to Mogadishu,"" Wamunyini said. The operations began on February 19 with the clearance of a network of urban trenches by Ugandan forces. That battle uncovered further proof that foreign fighters are playing a key role in the leadership of Al-Shabaab, originally a homegrown Somali movement. According to AMISOM, several key foreign fighters were killed in the operation. ""Al-Shabaab is organized like an Al Qaeda operation,"" said force commander Maj. Gen. Nathan Mugisha, ""their tactics are replicated from Afghanistan."" On February 23, Burundian forces successfully took two key Al-Shabaab positions in fierce fighting -- the former Ministry of Defense buildings (known as Gashindiga) and the former milk factory, according to Mugisha. Located in northeastern Africa, Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country. One U.N. humanitarian official said on Friday voiced urgent concern about the ""increased displacement"" caused by the fighting and the effects of drought there, said Valerie Amos, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs . She visited Somalia last month and talked to reporters on Friday. ""I again urge all parties to the conflict and AMISOM (the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia) to comply with international humanitarian law in order to minimize harm to the civilians,"" Amos said.","The fighting was part of a major offensive .

A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. Der Spiegel identifies the soldiers as Spc. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who are both facing charges relating to the wrongful deaths of Afghan civilians. Specifically, Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties, and smoking hashish. He is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. Morlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. U.S. military rules also prohibit ""taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies,"" which the photographs may be construed as. The trial for the two soldiers is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Morlock's court martial is slated to begin Wednesday, while the start date for Holmes' court martial has not been publicly announced. The U.S. Army released a statement Monday calling the photographs ""repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards and values of the United States Army."" ""We apologize for the distress these photos cause,"" the statement said. Army officials asserted in the statement that ongoing court-martial proceedings related to the alleged atrocities ""speak for themselves. The photos appear in stark contrast to the discipline, professionalism and respect that have characterized our soldiers' performance during nearly 10 years of sustained operations."" They also stressed that the ""United States Army is committed to adherence to the Law of War and the humane and respectful treatment of combatants, noncombatants, and the dead. ... Soldiers who commit offenses will be held accountable as appropriate."" In all, officials have charged 12 U.S. soldiers in what they called a conspiracy to murder Afghan civilians and cover it up, along with charges they mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs. Five of the soldiers face murder charges, while seven others are charged with participating in a coverup. All of the accused men were members of a 2nd Infantry Division brigade operating near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010.

"(CNN) -- More than 65 people have been killed in two days of clashes between rebel groups and soldiers in Southern Sudan's Upper Nile state, an army spokesman said. Philip Aguer, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) told CNN.com that forces loyal to a militia leader named Oliny attacked the village of Uach west of Malakal in Upper Nile state. ""55 members of the militia and seven SPLA soldiers were killed, and we believe a number of civilians also died, but we are still getting information."" Oliny, Aguer said, is a former member of Southern Sudanese politician Lam Akol's militia. ""But we don't know if he is still associated with him."" Aguer also said that he believes that Oliny was receiving military support from the government in northern Sudan. ""They have received new weapons. We suspect they all acted in coordination with Khartoum ... I think things are going to continue escalating,"" he said. However, Sudan's dominant National Congress Party (NCP) in the north denied having any involvement. Rabie Abdelati, an NCP party official, said on Monday: ""If we really wanted to go back to war, we would not have signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (the 2005 accord) or accepted the referendum. ""We are hoping for a strong south after secession. If the south is not stable the north will not be stable,"" he said. Akol, a seasoned Southern Sudanese politician and a former member of the SPLA, broke from the SPLA in 2009 and created a new party, the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement-Democratic Change (SPLM-DC). Akol rejected any association with Oliny's militia. ""He was never a part of the SPLM-DC,"" he told CNN.com. ""He is a Shiluk youth who with others were defending their land from Dinka who tried to take their land,"" he told CNN.com. The fighting took place in areas dominated by the Shiluk tribe, which Akol belongs to. The SPLA on the other hand is dominated by members of the Dinka tribe. The fighting comes days after more than 40 people had been killed in clashes between soldiers and another rebel militia, George Athor, in Southern Sudan, . Rebel leader George Athor has been saying his forces have killed more than 100 people, most of them soldiers, since a fresh round of fighting started last week. But Philip Aguer, a spokesman for Southern Sudan's military, said Athor's claims are exaggerated. Athor took up arms in 2010 when he was not elected governor of Southern Sudan's Jonglei state. The fighting comes just four months before the region is due to become independent. The south is expected to secede on July 9 after southerners overwhelmingly voted to declare independence from the north in a January referendum -- a vote promised in a 2005 peace accord that ended decades of civil war between north and south.","Increasing violence comes as south prepares to declare independence from north .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador Friday to protest a drone strike as the death toll from that attack rose to 44, Pakistani intelligence officials said. The attack also unleashed tribal fury, with regional elders vowing revenge on the United States for the strike. Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir summoned Ambassador Cameron Munter to make a ""strong protest"" regarding the Thursday drone strike in Pakistan's remote tribal area, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Pakistan's prime minister and a military leader have already made harsh statements about the attack. Two Pakistani intelligence officials said Friday the death toll had risen to 44, and that the majority of the dead were civilians. Munter was told that such strikes are not only unacceptable but constitute ""a flagrant violation of humanitarian norms and law,"" the ministry said. ""Pakistan should not be taken for granted nor treated as a client state,"" the ministry said. Munter was also told that, under the current circumstances, Pakistan will not be able to participate in the upcoming trilateral meeting between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the United States, scheduled for March 26. Two intelligence officials said the drone fired two missiles on a jirga meeting in North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. Tribal elders from the region where the drone strike happened vowed to take revenge on America, saying they will unleash their family members as suicide bombers because of the drone strike. ""Americans don't spare us -- not our children, nor our elders, nor our younger,"" Malik Jalal Wazir, a tribal elder from North Waziristan, said in news conference. ""That is why we have decided we will take blood revenge however we can."" A statement from the elders titled ""Announcement of Jihad against America"" said, ""We have given permission to our loved ones to do suicide attacks against Americans. And we will take revenge so that Americans will remember it for centuries."" They added that the victims were civilians. ""None of the killed were linked to al Qaeda,"" they said. The drone strike follows the controversial release of CIA contractor Raymond Davis, a U.S. agent acquitted of the double murder of two Pakistani men in Lahore after a total of $2.3 million was paid to the relatives of his victims. That incident had already fueled talks of protests in Pakistan. Based on a CNN count, Thursday's suspected drone strike was the 18th of the year, compared with 111 in all of 2010. U.S. officials rarely acknowledge publicly the CIA's secret drone program in Pakistan.","Pakistan summons the U.S. ambassador to register ""strong protest""

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka returned to the top of Group A with a convincing 112-run win over Cricket World Cup rivals New Zealand on Friday as veteran spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan took center stage in Mumbai. Both teams had already qualified for the quarterfinals of the 50-over tournament, but the highest-placed sides should avoid Group B heavyweights such as India and South Africa. Sri Lanka's fourth victory in six games left the co-hosts above Australia on run differential, meaning they will finish second, with New Zealand a point back in third place. The Australians, seeking a fourth successive title, complete their group campaign in Colombo on Saturday against fourth-placed Pakistan -- who have also qualified for the last eight and who could top the table with a win. New Zealand restricted Sri Lanka to 265-9, with skipper Kumar Sangakkara top-scoring on 111 as he made his first World Cup century. Sangakkara put on 145 for the third wicket with Mahela Jayawardene, who was controversially given not out in the 24th over when bowler Nathan McCullum dived to pluck a return catch. Television replays showed that the Black Caps player had grasped the ball before it touched the grass, but umpire Asad Rauf told Jayawardene to stay at the crease after consulting with video official Amiesh Saheba. Jayawardene went on to make 66 off 90 balls before becoming the second of Tim Southee's three victims, while McCullum struck twice as the last seven wickets fell for 101 runs. In reply, the Kiwis reached 83-2 before suffering an all-too-common batting collapse, losing five wickets for 27 runs and eventually slumping to 153 all out in the 35th over. Muralitharan, who turns 39 next month two weeks after the final, claimed figures of 4-25 off eight overs has he extended his world-record one-day total to 530. He has now taken 64 wickets in World Cup matches, leaving him seven behind Australia's record-holder Glenn McGrath in his last tournament before retiring from international cricket. Murali's expected successor, Ajantha Mendis, took 2-24 as the four other Sri Lankan bowlers shared the wickets evenly. In Friday's other match, Ireland beat the Netherlands by six wickets in Kolkata to clinch a second win in Group B. The Irish, who shocked England earlier in the tournament, reached 307-4 with 2.2 overs to spare in the third-highest run chase in World Cup history. Paul Stirling smashed 101 off just 72 balls faced, hitting 14 fours and two sixes in the fourth-fastest World Cup century. He put on 177 for the opening wicket with captain William Porterfield, who scored 68, while Niall O'Brien was unbeaten on 57. The Dutch had been hopeful of a first victory after posting 306, including a bizarre four run-outs in the final over, with Ryan Ryan ten Doeschate's 106 being his second century of the event. On Saturday, Bangladesh play Group B leaders South Africa -- who have already qualified for the quarterfinals -- in Dhaka in a match the fifth-placed co-hosts need to win to go through. The West Indies, above Bangladesh only on run differential, close out the schedule against India in Chennai on Sunday.","Sri Lanka will finish second in Group A following 112-run victory over New Zealand .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United moved five points clear in the English Premier League after snatching a 1-0 win against Bolton on Saturday despite having a player sent off. Second-placed Arsenal lost ground after coming from behind to earn a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened West Brom, but have a game in hand on the leaders. Third-placed Manchester City face fourth-placed Chelsea on Sunday in a match that will have a big bearing on the Champions League hopes of Tottenham, who could only draw 0-0 at home to struggling London rivals West Ham on Saturday. Second-half substitute Dimitar Berbatov was United's hero as he bundled home an 88th-minute winner after visiting goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen failed to hold a shot by Nani. The Bulgarian striker had never before netted for United coming off the bench, but made a telling impact after replacing in-form Mexico forward Javier Hernandez at halftime. Chelsea draw English rivals Manchester United in Euro quarterfinals . United, with manager Alex Ferguson watching from the stands as he started his five-match touchline ban, failed to dominate a Bolton side seeking to claim sixth place from Liverpool. The home team lost Jonny Evans with 14 minutes to play when the Irish defender was sent off for a raised-studs challenge on Stuart Holden that required the United States midfielder to be carried off with a gashed leg. But United kept pushing for a winner, which finally came as Berbatov moved two clear of City's Carlos Tevez in the English scoring charts with his 20th Premier League goal this season and 21st overall. Arsenal went into the match at West Brom hoping to resurrect the team's final chance of winning a trophy this season after being knocked out of the Champions League and FA Cup plus losing in the final of the League Cup. But Steven Reid's third-minute header and a second goal by Nigeria striker Peter Odemwingie in the 58th minute after a mix-up by goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and Sebastien Squillaci gave Roy Hodgson's hosts hope of a much-needed win. However, Andrei Arshavin reduced the deficit with 20 minutes to play, and Dutch striker Robin van Persie equalized on 78 with an effort that just crossed the line after the Russia forward's cross hit the post. The result lifted West Brom a point away from the bottom four clubs -- led by West Ham on goal difference from Wolverhampton. Fifth-placed Tottenham trail Chelsea by two points after failing to score against the Hammers, despite hitting the woodwork three times as Harry Redknapp's team once again crashed back to earth after European heroics. Having earned a Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid after eliminating AC Milan on March 9, Redknapp saw his team frustrated by West Ham's former England goalkeeper Robert Green on a day that Spurs' Wales winger Gareth Bale signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract. Everton claimed eighth place, joining Bolton on 40 points, with a 2-1 win over Fulham in the late match. Young Irishman Seamus Coleman opened the scoring in the 36th minute and France striker Louis Saha doubled the lead four minutes after the restart with his 10th goal this season before U.S. midfielder Clint Dempsey reduced the deficit just after the hour mark. FA Cup semifinalists Stoke moved above Newcastle into 10th place after a 4-0 thrashing of their mid-table rivals that maintained the side's unbeaten home run in 2011. Striker Jon Walters headed a first-half opener and his provider Jermaine Pennant made it 2-0 after the restart before Danny Higginbotham's free-kick added to the lead soon after, and Jamaica forward Ricardo Fuller capped the victory at the end when he came on as a late substitute. Just three points separate the bottom eight teams, with four clumped together on 33 after Blackburn came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw at Blackpool and Aston Villa lost 1-0 at home to Midlands rivals Wolverhampton. Wolves joined West Ham on 32 points with a first win at Villa Park in more than 30 years thanks to a winner by winger Matt Jarvis, while bottom club Wigan moved up to 30 with a 2-1 win over League Cup winners Birmingham, who remained in the relegation zone.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic can move above Roger Federer in the world rankings by beating the 16-time grand slam champion in the semifinals of the Masters Series event at Indian Wells on Saturday. The Serbian will clinch the No. 2 spot behind Rafael Nadal if he continues his hot form this year, which has seen him beat Federer on the way to winning the Australian Open and then again in the Dubai Tennis Championships final last month. The 23-year-old stormed into the last four of the Californian desert event on Friday with a 6-2 6-4 dismissal of French 18th seed Richard Gasquet, his 16th successive victory this year and 18th including the Davis Cup final in December. He has dropped just 12 games in this tournament, which he won in 2008 after losing in the final to Nadal the year before. ""This has been the best period of tennis in my career over the past three months. I want to maintain this level of performance,"" Djokovic told reporters. Federer, however, is not giving up his ranking without a fight, and set up a rematch against a man he beat four times out of five last year by ending the hopes of 12th-seeded friend and fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka on Friday. The 29-year-old won the closing quarterfinal 6-3 6-4 to give himself a chance of a record fourth title at Indian Wells, which would take him one past Michael Chang and Jimmy Connors. Nadal's bid to join that trio with three titles will face a strong test against resurgent former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro on Saturday. The Spaniard was less than comfortable as he battled back to defeat big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic 5-7 6-1 7-6 (9-7) in the quarterfinals on Thursday. ""You lose a set against Karlovic, and you are under pressure the rest of the games of the match,"" nine-time grand slam winner Nadal told the ATP World Tour's official website. ""I think I played a fantastic second set, returning better than ever. In the third, I didn't have chances. His serve was unstoppable. In the tiebreak I was really nervous. ""For sure, it is a very important victory for me. Being in the semifinals another time here after one month outside competition is fantastic news for me."" Nadal, 24, has only recently recovered from a hamstring injury sustained at January's Australian Open, where he lost in the quarterfinals. Former world No. 4 Del Potro has climbed back up the rankings to 90th after winning at Delray Beach and reaching the semis in San Jose and Memphis. He had easier progress to the last four when Nadal's compatriot Tommy Robredo was forced to withdraw from their quarterfinal with an abductor muscle injury. Federer closes on Djokovic rematch . In the women's draw, Marion Bartoli became the first Frenchwoman to reach the final at Indian Wells when she beat Yanina Wickmayer 6-1 6-3 on Friday. The 15th seed will next take on world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki, who thrashed three-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova 6-1 6-2 in the second semifinal. Bartoli, the 2007 Wimbledon runner-up, ended a streak of seven semifinal defeats as she proved too strong for the Belgian 23rd seed. Japan crisis focuses Sharapova's Chernobyl commitment . Wozniacki was fresh for her match with Sharapova after playing only three games of her quarterfinal against close friend Victoria Azarenka before the eighth seed from Belarus retired with a hip injury. Sharapova, the 2006 champion but seeded 16th this year at Indian Wells, had been seeking to return to the top-10, which Bartoli now has the chance to do in her place. The Russian had battled into the last four with a 6-2 5-7 6-3 win over China's Shuai Peng on Thursday.","Novak Djokovic will take on Roger Federer in the semifinals at Indian Wells .

"(CNN) -- Former world champion Casey Stoner claimed the 27th pole position of his career on Saturday to ensure he will start the new MotoGP season at the head of the grid in Qatar. The Australian, who dominated the three practice sessions at Losail with his new Repsol Honda team, set the fastest time of one minute 54.137 seconds. His teammate Dani Pedrosa will line up on the front row of the grid in Qatar for the first time on Sunday after finishing second, while Yamaha's reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo took the final place -- 0.810 seconds behind Stoner.

"Ithaca, New York (CNN) -- I work at an inland university in chilly upstate New York. Around here, many people feel a little global warming is good and there is really nothing that they can see or hear that will make them feel differently. News of warming sea surfaces and bleached coral reefs inspire little response when there's a chill in the air and the ocean is hundreds of miles away. Sure, the ice is off the lakes a few weeks earlier and the growing season is a couple of weeks longer. But there are costs we are seeing now -- mosquitoes, ticks and other species of insects are really thriving with the warmer weather while some species of trees, like sugar maple, are suffering slow declines. However, none of these small, incremental impacts gives one a sense of imminent disaster, but the reality is that increased sea-surface temperatures will impact hundreds of millions of people, whether they live in Key West or Kalamazoo. In contrast to the incremental changes we are seeing here in the heartland, the sea is already undergoing catastrophic changes on a massive scale, ones that are unprecedented in human history and that may be largely irreversible on human time scales. During the past few months, coral bleaching near Aceh, Indonesia, in the Coral Triangle and in the Andaman Sea of Southeast Asia has left vast tracts of reefs impacted, with up to 80 percent of the corals dead or dying at some sites. Bleaching occurs when corals get so thermally stressed that the symbiotic relationship with their solar-powered algae falls apart, and the pigmented algae get expelled. The result is a bleached reef that looks starkly white because the white skeleton underlying the coral skin shows through. Imagine if overnight all of the leaves on the trees in your neighborhood turned white from losing their photosynthetic pigments. Then think about what it would look like if more than half of those trees didn't recover and died. Coral reefs are an ecosystem rich in biodiversity beyond our wildest imagining -- we are still discovering the countless links that support transforming nutrient- poor tropical oceans into an oasis of life. Reefs provide a home to countless small crabs, worms, starfish and rich zooplankton which hide in the reef by day and come out at night to be a rich banquet for fish. Young fish shelter and feed in the reef, until large enough to survive elsewhere. Gobies are an example of a small reef fish that shows big declines on reefs affected by bleaching; the butterfly fish also is a species that feeds directly on coral and so declines with reef damage. Reefs that have bleached and died quickly erode and cannot fix carbon from the sun or provide habitat for fish. Even as I write this, I am anticipating that one of the largest bleaching events in the history of the Caribbean is under way. We don't know yet if this event will become the largest because it has not reached its peak. I have checked NOAA's Coral Reef Watch website every week this August and September to monitor the sea surface temperatures and to try to guess at what level they might peak. Currently, the trajectory is on course to be markedly warmer than the record-breaking summer of 2005. During that year of record-breaking bleaching and devastating hurricanes, including Katrina, scientists identified the extreme sea surface temperatures as a once-in-a-100-year event. Well, here we are five years later, and with a month to go before the expected temperature maximum during mid-October, it looks like we are in for a greater once-in-a-100-year event in the space of five years! So, this raises the question -- does this really matter to folks in the heartland? Does it matter that nobody is even aware that this huge event is even going on? Well, it matters if we care about global biodiversity, since those reefs in the Coral Triangle are at the center of both fish and coral biodiversity. It also matters if we care about the people who make their living on the fish, snails, crabs, and other animals that live on the reefs in the Coral Triangle, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean -- and the people who eat seafood in your town and every town. It matters if we are concerned about future tsunamis in the Indo-Pacific because those reefs are the strongest wavebreaks known to protect fragile coastal communities. And finally, it matters because coral reefs fuel billions in tourist dollars to fragile economies in the developing world as well as in our territorial waters. So, for people who are concerned about the fate of the global environment and human civilization, it does matter. We are an ocean nation with vast areas of coral reefs. The exclusive economic zone of the US includes not only a 200-mile coastal zone around our fifty states, but a 200-mile zone around rich marine resources in the Pacific, including Guam, Midway Island, Palmyra Atoll and American Samoa. It is important to realize that the effects of climate change are being felt more directly in the oceans than on land. Just because they are out of sight does not mean that they should be out of mind. Most people have not experienced firsthand the already disastrous impacts of climate change on our ocean. But soon enough we will start to notice disruptions in terrestrial ecosystems as well. To help coral reefs and other affected coastal ecosystems, much more stringent management policies must be implemented to control overfishing and land-based pollution. This can improve the resilience of these climate-stressed ecosystems. In the larger policy arena, to slow this sea surface warming we must not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we have to figure out a way to get the CO2 concentration below the level of the 388 parts per million it is at now. The target of 350 ppm CO2 advocated by 350.org movement is a way forward if future generations are to benefit from the services coral reefs provide and the sense of awe that they inspire. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Drew Harvell.","Higher sea temperatures are damaging coral reefs around the world, says Drew Harvell .
She says the reefs provide a crucial habitat for fish and a lure for tourists .
Some effects of global warming are most visible in our seas, she says .

"(CNN) -- Late goals from Brazilian duo David Luiz and Ramires gave Chelsea a 2-0 home win over Manchester City in the English Premier League on Sunday. A 78th-minute header from January signing Luiz and a fine solo effort by Ramires in time added on meant the London club moved into third place above City, a point clear having played one less match. The English champions are now four points behind second-placed Arsenal and nine adrift of league leaders Manchester United, who beat Bolton 1-0 on Saturday. City, hoping to reach for the European Champions League for the first time next season, are four points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham -- but Roberto Mancini's team have played one more game than the team who pipped them to the final qualifying position last season. Ten-man United extend English lead . The result was a deserved one for Chelsea, who dominated a lackluster City side missing injured captain and top scorer Carlos Tevez. After a frustrating goalless first half, the home side came alive after the break and defender Luiz netted the crucial opener with just 12 minutes of play remaining with a header from substitute Didier Drogba's well-flighted set-piece. The 23-year-old Luiz, who has looked a bargain buy since joining from Portugal's Benfica in a $35 million deal, won the free-kick after some nimble footwork. Drogba had come on to replace $80 million striker Fernando Torres, who has now yet to score after seven appearances for his new club. Chelsea looked to be home and dry after Luiz's goal, but Ramires made sure as he waltzed into the penalty area and fired an impressive strike past City goalkeeper Joe Hart in the dying seconds. Earlier, City's best attempt at goal came from Yaya Toure, but his shot was easily blocked by Peter Cech, and the Ivory Coast midfielder was later replaced by striker Mario Balotelli after suffering an injury. In the day's other match, sixth-placed Liverpool kept their hopes of playing European football next season alive with victory by the same score away to 10-man Sunderland. Holland striker Dirk Kuyt gave Liverpool a first-half lead from the penalty spot, as Sunderland's Ghana defender John Mensah fouled Jay Spearing in the box just after half an hour. The referee had initially awarded a free-kick for the incident but changed his mind after consultation with the linesman, much to the anger of the home players and fans. The Reds' second goal came in the 77th minute courtesy of Uruguay forward Luis Suarez, who found the net from an impossible angle. Mensah was shown a straight red for pulling back Suarez six minutes later, leaving the Black Cats a man down for the remainder of the game. With Liverpool having been knocked out of the Europa League on Thursday, the win gave Kenny Dalglish's team hope of catching Tottenham to secure a berth for next season. Champions League quarterfinalists Tottenham have a four-point buffer, and have played 29 games to Liverpool's 30. A run of seven games without a win has left Sunderland in ninth position with eight games remaining, having been as high as sixth earlier this season. Meanwhile, Rangers won the Scottish League Cup for the 27th time with a 2-1 victory over Glasgow rivals Celtic after extra-time on Sunday. Croatian striker Nikica Jelavic scored the winner in the 98th minute, while Celtic's Honduras defender Emilio Izaguirre was sent off at the end.","Chelsea leapfrog Manchester City in the EPL after a 2-0 win over Northern side .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration sent mixed signals Wednesday on its stance on a no-fly zone in Libya, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying U.N. backing was essential while White House spokesman Jay Carney left the door open to the United States acting unilaterally or in concert with NATO allies. Some critics, as well as top Democrats such as Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, have called for a stronger U.S. response to the Libya violence, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone that would prevent Libyan military aircraft from attacking the Libyan people. President Barack Obama has made clear he wants any military response to come from the international community, to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from blaming the United States for his predicament. Clinton emphasized that point Wednesday in an interview with CBS News, saying the administration seeks to avoid ""any room for anyone, including Col. Gadhafi, to say that 'This isn't about my people, this is about outsiders.' "" She noted that the British and French governments were bringing a draft resolution on international action to the United Nations, saying: ""I think it's very important that there be a U.N. decision on whatever might be done."" ""We believe it's important that this not be an American, or a NATO, or a European effort. It needs to be an international one,"" Clinton said. Approval by the U.N. Security Council for international military intervention in Libya, including a no-fly zone, is considered unlikely due to expected opposition from China and Russia. Both countries are believed to be reluctant to set a precedent of U.N.-supported military action in an internal conflict. Clinton acknowledged opposition to a no-fly zone from within the U.N. Security Council, but said efforts continued to come up with an acceptable package. She also emphasized the need to have Arab nations and bodies such as the Arab League in support. A few hours later, Carney told reporters at the White House that U.N. backing was just one possible form of the international support sought for any military intervention in Libya. ""It is our strong preference in this situation and many others that we act together with our international partners,"" said Carney, who then added that ""we always reserve the right, NATO does rather, as does the United States, to act on our own."" At the State Department, spokesman Mark Toner also stopped short of insisting on U.N. backing, instead saying: ""It's always desirable."" In a letter dated March 5 to the U.N. General Assembly, Libya's Interim Transitional National Council -- the opposition movement seeking to oust Gadhafi -- asked for the international community to ""fulfill its obligations to protect the Libyan people from any further genocide and crimes against humanity without any direct military intervention on Libyan soil."" Carney and other administration officials contend the United States already has moved quickly in the crisis by freezing $30 billion in U.S. assets of Gadhafi, supporting further U.N. sanctions on Libya and sending military aircraft to help transport foreign nationals who fled the fighting there. At the same time, top U.S. defense officials including Defense Secretary Robert Gates warn that imposing such a no-fly zone amounts to an act of war that requires major resources and political will. On Wednesday, Carney reiterated the White House stance that all options remain on the table regarding Libya, and he specified that a possible no-fly zone was being actively discussed by both the United States and NATO. Overall, though, the Obama administration has tried to downplay the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone without significant international backing, especially from the Arab world. Asked about it Sunday on the NBC program ""Meet the Press, White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley complained that people calling for such a move ""talk about it like it's a game or a video game or something."" Obama, in response to questions about the U.S. response in Libya, told reporters last week that that it was important to ensure that the Libyan people feel ""full ownership"" for any transformation and cited Egypt's recent revolution as an example. ""We did not see anti-American sentiment arising out of that movement in Egypt precisely because they felt that we hadn't tried to engineer or impose a particular outcome, but rather they owned it,"" Obama said.","Clinton: U.N. backing is important .

"(CNN) -- The Black Eyed Peas have joined a growing list of artists and celebrities calling attention to the disaster in Japan. The group shot their latest music video for the single ""Just Can't Get Enough"" in Tokyo a few days before the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami rocked the island nation. The video opens: ""This video was filmed in Japan one week before the earthquake. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people of Japan. We love you."" The video closes with a link to the Red Cross. The video is scheduled to premier this week and the group will perform the song on ""American Idol"" Thursday night. The international aid agency appeared to be the charity of choice among celebs. Many are encouraging their fan bases to make donations via text message. ""Imagine... if we ALL texted REDCROSS to 90999 we'd have raised over 60million dollars for #JAPAN REFLIEF! BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE! BE!,"" said a post on singer Katy Perry's Twitter account this week. Likewise, rapper P.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed in California against Kellogg, Brown and Root on Wednesday alleges the company and its subcontractor were involved in a human trafficking plan that forced Nepali men to work against their will in Iraq. The lawyer and relatives of men who were employed by KBR and allegedly sent to Iraq without their consent. The men, between the ages of 18 and 27, were recruited in Nepal and told they would be doing work in hotel and restaurant kitchens in Amman, Jordan, but were sent instead to Iraq to work at a U.S. air base, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges KBR, based in Houston, Texas, and Daoud & Partners, a Jordan-based subcontractor, engineered the trafficking scheme. A KBR spokeswoman would not comment directly on the allegations but released a statement defending the company. ""KBR has not yet seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time. The safety and security of all employees and those the company serves remains KBR's top priority. The company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior,"" KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. ""Each employee is expected to adhere to the company's Code of Business Conduct and complete ethics training, which includes TIPS (Trafficking in Persons) information,"" Browne continued. Efforts by CNN to reach Daoud were unsuccessful. When the Nepali men arrived in Jordan, according to the lawsuit, the contractors took their passports and drove them into Iraq. Mathew Handley, a lawyer with Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, which filed the lawsuit, said about 70 Nepali men were driven into Iraq in a large convoy of civilian vehicles. One of the lead vehicles was ahead of the convoy and was stopped by insurgents posing as Iraqi Police. Twelve of the Nepali men were taken by the insurgents and later killed. ""As the men were being transported to Iraq, a car containing twelve of the men was stopped by members of the Ansar al-Sunna Army, an insurgent group. The 12 men in the car were taken hostage and executed by the insurgents,"" according to a statement on the law firm's Web site. A 13th man, Buddi Prasad Gurung, was not kidnapped and arrived at the U.S. Al Asad air base in western Iraq in August 2004. Gurung worked in a warehouse managed by KBR and was released 15 months later by the company, according to the law firm. Gurung and the families of the 12 men who were killed have brought the lawsuit. Handley says the other Nepali workers who were sent to Iraq with Gurung did not come forward for the lawsuit after they were eventually released from KBR. ""Their families went deep into debt to arrange the jobs, which they hoped would lift them out of poverty,"" according to the lawsuit. The case garnered the attention of the Department of Defense Inspector General's office after a number of news reports about KBR involvement in trafficking. The department concluded an investigation in April 2006. ""The primary finding concluded that the U.S. Government had no jurisdiction over the persons, offenses, or circumstances that resulted in the Nepalese deaths,"" according to the final report. The report also concluded that the events happened ""before starting their employment with KBR."" However, the case led to increased awareness and enforcement of trafficking laws by the U.S. military.","Suit claims that Nepali men were told they would work in kitchens in Jordan .

"(EW.com) -- Matthew McConaughey plays a slick Los Angeles criminal defense attorney in the movie adaptation of Michael Connelly's legal thriller ""The Lincoln Lawyer"". Audiences are likely to have strong memories of the star as a perspiring Mississippi lawyer 15 years ago in the movie adaptation of John Grisham's legal thriller ""A Time to Kill."" Those customers will be pleased to know that the guy still looks great arguing in a courtroom, still delivers his lines with a variable drawl implying barbecue for dinner. This time, McConaughey is Mick Haller, who's familiar to fans of Connelly's best-selling detective novels as the half brother of the LAPD's Harry Bosch. Haller's an unorthodox smoothie: His ''office'' is the backseat of his chauffeured Lincoln Continental, and his clients tend to be colorful bottom-of-the-deck types that character actors love. The lawyer's newest client, though, is fancier goods. Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe, his petulant lip telegraphing his attitude) is the son of a rich family, and he's been charged with attempted rape and murder. He swears innocence, but he may or may not be guilty. And his case bumps up against that of another former Haller client already wrongly convicted. The whole thing gets Haller's moral gyroscope whirling in a way that makes for good reading but not automatically compelling moviegoing. Plot leaps that are fun on paper look generic on screen; here's another lawyer movie in which the characters are only as interesting as the actors playing them. At least director Brad Furman gives them their space. Among the draws: William H. Macy (in ""Shameless"" hair) as Haller's investigator; Marisa Tomei as a DA who's also Haller's ex-wife; and Bryan Cranston (with more hair than on ""Breaking Bad"") in a small, swell role as a hard-ass homicide detective.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Famed actress Elizabeth Taylor has shown ""steady improvement"" since she was taken to a Los Angeles hospital last week for treatment of a heart problem, her representative said. Taylor, 78, has been ""comfortable over the past few days,"" according to a statement released Tuesday afternoon. She checked into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center a week ago for ""symptoms caused by congestive heart failure,"" which an ""ongoing condition,"" representative Jamie Caldwell said last week. ""Since being admitted, there has been steady improvement in her condition,"" the latest statement said. Taylor will stay at Cedars-Sinai for ""continued monitoring,"" the statement said. ""Her medical team is gratified by her progress to date, and it is hoped and expected that this will continue over the next few days,"" it said. The London-born movie star has won two Academy Awards for best actress: for ""Butterfield 8"" in 1961 and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" in 1967. When doctors repaired a leaky heart valve in October 2009, Taylor posted a Twitter message saying it ""was like having a brand new ticker."" The actress has used Twitter over the past two years to communicate with fans and dispel the occasional rumor reported on celebrity gossip websites. However, a message she tweeted last Wednesday was her first in nearly six months. The tweet pointed fans to an interview she gave to Kim Kardashian in Harper's Bazaar magazine. ""I like the connection with fans and people who have been supportive of me."" Taylor told Kardashian when asked about Twitter. ""And I love the idea of real feedback and a two-way street, which is very, very modern. But sometimes I think we know too much about our idols and that spoils the dream.

"(CNN) -- Gas prices have jumped nearly 7 cents a gallon over the past two weeks, reaching a level more than 75 cents higher than they were a year ago, according to a survey published Sunday. The average price for a gallon of self-serve regular is $3.57, the Lundberg Survey found. That's 6.65 cents higher than the price the same survey found two weeks earlier. The latest spike suggests that the dramatic price increases are slowing down, said publisher Trilby Lundberg. Between February 18 and March 4, the survey had found an increase of about 33 cents. That hike corresponded to an increase in crude oil prices amid unrest in more than a dozen countries in the Middle East and north Africa, six of which are OPEC members, Lundberg said. The new jump in prices at the pump comes despite a drop in crude oil prices over the past two weeks. Lundberg described that as ""follow-through"" from the previous spike in oil prices. The survey was taken Friday, before several countries began military action against Libya. It is too soon to know what impact events in Libya will have on gasoline prices, Lundberg said Sunday. The Lundberg Survey tabulates prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide. Of the cities included in the latest survey, the lowest average price was in Billings, Montana, at $3.27 a gallon. The highest was in San Francisco, California, at $3.97. Here are the average prices in some other cities: . -- Denver, Colorado - $3.29 . -- Atlanta, Georgia - $3.49 . -- Boston, Massachusetts - $3.54 . -- Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - $3.56 . -- Portland, Oregon - $3.64 . -- Minneapolis, Minnesota - $3.52 .","Gas prices have jumped nearly 7 cents a gallon over the past two weeks .

"(CNN) -- Gary Ridgway, the confessed ""Green River Killer,"" pleaded guilty Friday to a 49th slaying -- that of a 20-year-old mother more than 28 years ago. The arraignment and plea took place at the Maleng Regional Justice Center in Kent. Authorities filed an aggravated murder charge against Ridgway related to the slaying of Becky Marrero, whose remains were uncovered last December by teens exploring a steep ravine near the town of Auburn. The count is the first filed against Ridgway since he admitted to serial killings in 2003. ""The Marreros have the right to face the man who killed Becky and the opportunity to remind us all about what was taken from them,"" King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg said before the plea. ""They finally have the answers, and with these charges and the anticipated guilty plea, they will have obtained the truth, accountability and ... a degree of justice."" The most prolific known serial killer in U.S. history, Ridgway is already serving 48 consecutive life sentences for murdering women. Forty-six of the bodies were found near Seattle -- which is part of King County -- while two were in Washington County, Oregon. In a plea deal dating to November 2003, when he was sentenced on 48 counts of aggravated murder, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against Ridgway if he agreed to ""plead guilty to any and all future cases (in King County) where his confession could be corroborated by reliable evidence,"" Satterberg said. ""Ridgway confessed to killing Becky Marrero, but he was unable to provide sufficient details to warrant a charge,"" Satterberg said. ""The discovery of Ms. Marrero's remains now gives us the evidence we need to file this charge."" Once he entered the guilty plea, Ridgway was given a 49th life sentence and returned to his prison cell at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Ridgway may still face the death penalty if convicted of murder outside King County. Satterberg said his predecessor, Norm Maleng, opted to eliminate that option in King County in hopes of resolving more cold cases. ""When the late Norm Maleng made the difficult decision in 2003 to trade the possibility of the death penalty for the truth about unsolved cases, he had cases like this one and families like the Marreros in mind,"" Satterberg said. ""It wasn't about what Gary Ridgway deserved. ... It was about what the families' deserved."" Marrero left her 3-year-old daughter with her aunt on December 3, 1982, headed toward Seattle's Sea-Tac airport, and was never seen alive again. Satterberg offered few details about the victim, beyond that she ""was in an area engaged in activities that made her vulnerable to crime, (and) particularly to Mr. Ridgway's method of operating."" Her remains were found about 100 feet away from where searchers in 2003 found another of Ridgway's victims, according to Satterberg. The Green River Task Force had made periodic visits to the area over the past seven years, but found nothing new, he said. Ridgway was arrested in 2001 in King County and accused in the murders of five women. Two years later, when prosecutors were preparing seven separate murder cases, he offered to confess to those seven and 41 other murders. The ""Green River Killer"" moniker came from a river south of Seattle where Ridgway began dumping his victims in 1982. Most of the women were prostitutes, officials say. Ridgway has said he targeted prostitutes ""because I thought I could kill as many as I wanted without getting caught."" He said he killed because he hated prostitutes and didn't want to pay them for sex, and claimed he killed so many women he had a hard time keeping them straight. While not indicating any news on the horizon, Satterberg did not close the door to further murder charges against Ridgway. ""It's quite possible that more remains will be found someday,"" Satterberg said.","NEW: Gary Ridgway was sentenced to his 49th consecutive life sentence .

"Berlin (CNN) -- A 48-year-old German man admitted being the father of his stepdaughter's eight children Tuesday, but denied he had sexually abused her, a German court official said. The man, identified only as Detlef S., is on trial in Koblenz, Germany, charged with the sexual abuse of dependents and facilitating the sexual abuse of minors. He is accused of hundreds of incidents of sexual abuse of his daughter, his stepdaughter and his stepson between autumn 1987 and summer 2010. He is also charged with bringing his underage stepdaughter and his daughter to men who paid for sex with them on multiple occasions. The first allegations of abuse came more than a decade ago, in 1998, but there was no medical evidence to support the claims then, Germany's youth welfare office said in a statement Tuesday after the trial opened. Two stepsons leveled fresh accusations in 2002, saying the defendant was abusing his biological daughter, then 11. Police began an investigation but found no medical evidence and dropped the case, the statement said. The daughter denied having been abused, the welfare office said. It would not be against the law for the defendant to have a consensual sexual relationship with his stepdaughter, the office added. Two men are due in court on charges of sexual assault in connection with the case. A third man suspected of abusing the children has died, Koblenz state court spokesman Alexander Walter said. The trial of Detlef S. opened Tuesday, with his stepdaughter and stepson in court. His biological daughter was not present, Walter said. The stepdaughter is giving evidence against him, the court spokesman said. DNA test results introduced in court gave a ""99.999%"" certainty that the defendant is the father of her children, he said, and Detlef S. admitted Tuesday he was the father. But he denied the charges of sexual abuse, Walter said. Seven of the stepdaughter's eight children survived infancy, he said. He did not know the cause of death of the eighth. The sexual assaults took place in the defendant's home, in woods nearby and in various apartments near where the family lived, prosecutors charge. Only two of the 350 charges are related to the stepson, Walter said. The case is due to run through February 25, he said. One of the men accused of paying for sex with the children is due to go on trial March 18, he added. CNN's Roman Lehberger contributed to this report.","NEW: There were allegations against Detlef S. for more than a decade, officials say .

"(CNN) -- The Japanese J-League will resume its fixture list on April 23, after all football was suspended following the earthquake and tsunami that hit the north-east of the country on March 11. Just one round of matches had been played prior to the disaster, with the missing five rounds now due to take place in July -- a month where no fixtures were originally scheduled because of Japan's national team commitments. However, it is still not certain whether the clubs that have been affected most be the disaster -- Kashima Antlers, Vegalta Sendai and Mito Hollyhock -- are able to resume their fixtures, or whether those games will be moved to a neutral venue because of damage to their stadiums. Meanwhile, the electricity shortages caused by the after-effects of the earthquake have resulted in the J-League confirming that all matches in April will take place during the day -- a measure that might be extended throughout the rest of the season. That measure has also been taken up by the Japanese baseball Pacific League, who have decided not to stage night games next month in the worse-affected regions of Kanto and Tohoku. In other sport affected by the disaster, Russia have made a bid to stage this year's world figure skating championships. On Sunday, the Japan Skating Federation withdrew their offer to restage the event in October after the original March 21-27 competition in Tokyo was cancelled. Russia, who will stage the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, have proposed to host the event in Moscow from April 25 to May 1.

"(CNN) -- When the FBI called Martha Huie's house in 2005, she didn't think much of it. ""I answered the phone, and he identified himself and wanted to speak with Ernest Withers. I said, 'This is not Ernest Withers!'"" Huie recalled, laughing. Last year, she learned the likely reason for the call was no laughing matter. In 2010, The Memphis Commercial Appeal revealed that the friend she knew for almost 20 years was an FBI informant. As the pre-eminent photographer of the civil rights era, Withers had close access to leaders of the movement. To some, charges of informing represented a betrayal of the highest sort. But not to Huie. Watch the trailer for In America's documentary about Withers, ""Pictures Don't Lie"" ""I can't think about why it was presented in such shock value,"" Huie said. ""A lot of people talk to the FBI. If the FBI wants to talk to you, you talk to them. It's just not a horror story, and Ernest just doesn't deserve that."" Huie met Withers at a contemporary art show in Memphis in 1988. ""We were the senior people there!"" she laughs. ""That was how Ernest and me started talking."" He was black. She was white. He grew up poor in Tennessee. She had a relatively privileged upbringing in Alabama. Withers' wife, Dorothy, supported his fledgling photography business and eight children. Huie's late husband, William Bradford Huie, was a celebrated author and investigative journalist who chronicled the events of the civil rights movement and broke the story when two white men confessed to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a black teen. Withers, too, had covered the Emmett Till case. Huie and Withers formed an immediate bond over the journalistic work, but it was their mutual appreciation of art and history that kept them talking. The photographer shared stories about his experiences during the civil rights movement and how he learned to use a camera. In one conversation, Withers told Huie how he learned to see color. ""When he was a young boy, his mother died. His stepmother was his mother. And she sewed. She made things for rich white women, and she would send him to the store to buy thread,"" Huie said. ""And if he didn't come back with the exact right color, he would have to go right back. And there's where he learned to see matching colors."" When an FBI agent called Huie a second time in 2005, she assumed again it was a mistake, and gave the agent Withers' number. She still doesn't know why they called her house. When Withers died in 2007, his funeral was front-page news in Memphis. Huie and Withers never spoke about his involvement with the FBI, and she isn't concerned that the information will affect his legacy. ""Ernest was not a traitor, or doing anything political or underhanded,"" Huie said. ""If the FBI wanted to hand him some grocery money, then so what?"" While the civil rights photographer later became famous for his photographs, he never achieved fortune. But, according to Huie, he lived a life rich in other ways. ""He tried his best every day of his life and made a lot of mistakes and laughed at himself,"" Huie reminisced. ""He was on the right side all the way, all the time. And he played it like he needed to."" CNN's Alicia Stewart contributed to this report.","Civil rights photographer Ernest Withers was revealed in 2010 to be an FBI informant .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Barry Bonds' personal trainer refused to testify against the baseball home run king in his perjury trial Tuesday, prompting the judge to order the trainer held in custody until he changes his mind. Federal prosecutors called Gary Anderson as the first witness as they began laying out their case against Bonds in a San Francisco courtroom Tuesday morning. Anderson, flanked by lawyer Mark Geragos, told the judge he would not testify, . ""It's very important that you testify so that the whole truth can some out in this trial,"" U.S. District Judge Susan Illston told Anderson, as she found him in civil contempt. Geragos said he would immediately appeal the judge's decision to send Anderson to jail on the grounds that he was not given a fair hearing. Anderson has already served several months in prison for previously refusing to testify against Bonds before grand juries in 2006.  He also was sentenced to three months in prison after pleading guilty in 2005 to illegally possessing anabolic steroids with the intent to distribute. ""He doesn't trust the prosecution,"" Geragos said of Anderson.  ""He will never cooperate with these guys."" The trial, which is expected to last three or four weeks, is taking place less than two miles from the ballpark where Bonds, 46, broke Henry Aaron's major league home run record in August 2007. Bonds, then a star on the San Francisco Giants, was indicted three months later on four counts of lying to a grand jury about his use of performance-enhancing drugs during the federal investigation of steroids use by athletes. He also faces one count of obstruction of justice. Prosecutors will try to convince a jury of eight women and four men that Bonds knew his trainer was giving him illegal steroids and that he lied about it to a grand jury in December 2003. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Parrella told jurors that a urine sample given by Bonds in the summer of 2003, just months before his grand jury testimony, tested positive for anabolic steroids. Defense lawyer Allen Ruby, in his opening statement told jurors that Bonds acknowledged to the grand jury that he used the substances known as ""the clear and the cream,"" but at the time of his testimony even investigators didn't know what was in it. Bonds told the grand jury he thought Anderson was giving flax seed oil, Ruby said. ""Barry answered every question, he told the truth, he did his best and, most significantly, he provided the grand jury with useful information which supported the indictment that they later returned against the BALCO defendants,"" Ruby said, referring the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative by its acronym name, BALCO. The witness list includes Bonds' ex-girlfriend Kimberly Bell, who will testify that Bonds told her he was taking steroids prior to the 2000 Major League Baseball season, according to the prosecution. ""Ms. Bell will further testify to personal observations regarding changes in the defendant's body during the period of time beginning in the year 1999, including bloating, acne on the shoulders and back, hair loss, sexual dysfunction, and testicular shrinkage,"" the prosecution's description of its witnesses said. ""She will also testify about changes in the defendant's temperament, including an increase in angry, threatening, controlling, and violent behavior."" Several former teammates and friends are also on the witness list to testify for the prosecution. Ruby, in his opening statement, attacked the former friends who are expected to be called as key prosecution witnesses. ""The bitterness of these people toward Barry that surfaced around the time of the breakup, was very pervasive, very strong,"" Ruby said. These witnesses ""cooperated with the media as anonymous sources on many of the poisonous things about Barry,"" he said.  ""They have tried to create a caricature of Barry Bonds, a terrible guy, always bad, mean and so on."" A former IRS agent who fished through the trash at BALCO every week for a year testified Tuesday afternoon that a magazine clipping he found in the garbage bin led him to Barry Bonds as a witness in his investigation. The article, which included a photo of Bonds with BALCO chief Victor Conte and Anderson, indicated that Bonds ""was using their services,"" investigator Jeff Novitzky testified. Bonds holds the major league record for home runs with 762 in his 21-year career. He also set the record for most home runs in a single season in 2001 when he hit 73 balls out of the park. Bonds did not officially retire after he was indicted, but he never played another game.","NEW: Bonds' trainer is sent to jail for refusing to testify .

"Edmonds, Washington (CNN) -- Scott West went to Japan expecting trouble. A veteran anti-porpoise hunting activist, West documents and protests the killing of the mammals. His actions are deeply unpopular in many of the Japanese coastal communities that cling to the tradition of catching and eating whale. West's organization, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, has a long and colorful history of clashing with the Japanese. In the Animal Planet series ""Whale Wars,"" Sea Shepherd volunteers impede Japanese whale fishing off the coast of Antarctica. Their tactics include placing their boats in front of whaling ships, attempting to carry out citizen's arrests of the Japanese crew and heaving acid stink bombs onto the vessels. For their efforts, the Sea Shepherd volunteers have had flash bang grenades thrown at them, their boats sunk in collisions and detainment for days by the Japanese crews. The show has made the Sea Shepherd members reality TV stars and notorious in Japan. March 11 started like many other days for Scott West. He was in an unfriendly territory, a small Japanese coastal town where a porpoise hunt was under way and the efforts of outsiders to document the slaughter were not welcome. West led a five person Sea Shepherd team of Mike Vos, Tarah Millen, Carisa Webster and Marley Daviduk to the town of Otsuchi, Japan. They were joined by Brian Barnes a cameraman from Save Japan Dolphins, a group that often collaborates with Sea Shepherd. The activists had other company, as well. Closely monitoring the group were two plain clothes Japanese policemen the activists nicknamed ""Turner and Hooch,"" for the Tom Hanks comedy about a cop and his sidekick, a dog. As detailed in the Academy Award winning documentary ""The Cove,"" the relationship between anti-porpoise hunt activists and Japanese authorities often becomes a game of cat and mouse. The police try to impede the activists from documenting the killing of the dolphins. The activists use disguises and other sleights of hand to keep the police off their tails. A former EPA and customs investigator, West said he is still able to think like law enforcement agents. And he recounts with a smile how he managed to lose Turner and Hooch at a traffic light with some creative driving as they tried to shadow his group. West is back in his home in Edmonds, Washington. It's been just over 24 hours since he returned from Japan and four days since the earthquake and tsunami that wrecked much of the country. As he thinks of the two cops back in Otsuchi his mood darkens. ""You know those guys are probably dead,"" he said. When the earthquake hit in Otsuchi, about 94 miles from Sendai, the quake's epicenter, the activists were at the town's port waiting for the porpoise fishing boats to return with their catch. ""The car was rocking and rolling it was actually jumping on the pavement like a frog,"" West said. ""We got out of the cars and it was almost impossible to stand up. The ground was heaving. It lasted for a long time."" Immediately seafood workers got out of factories as the town loud speakers called for residents to seek higher ground. The six activists jumped into their two cars and made for the hills. It was a snap decision that West believes saved their lives. ""If we had stayed where we were, they probably would have never found our bodies or our cars,"" West said. West estimates that the drive to higher ground took them about eight minutes. In that time the first tsunami waves already crashed into the town. Video West took from the hillside shows fishing ships fighting the incoming rush of water to get to the open ocean and safety. Houses can be seen being dragged out to sea by the monster waves. On the hillside, the activists were joined by a handful of rescue workers and a Japanese woman. ""It was impossible to comprehend the amount of devastation and the human misery,"" West said ""How many people got to the hill? There were only a handful of us up there. Why aren't there thousands here with us?"" In the video he took from the hill, West narrates as a wave heads toward the area below where they have sought refuge. ""Look at the black one heading toward us,"" he said. An aftershock rocks the activists. ""This is scary s**t,"" a woman says off camera. As darkness fell, the tsunami waves continued sweeping into the town below them. The rescue workers on the hill left to begin their work and check on their own homes. The activists and the Japanese woman who also made it to the hill took turns warming themselves in the cars. Over the roar of the waves they heard a voice. ""We could hear this woman screaming out in the water,"" West said. ""It was dim out there and all this debris was out there and then we could make out her form on a pile of debris. "" The activists tried to reach her but were pushed back the waves still topping the tsunami wall. They commandeered an abandoned fire truck and the Japanese woman with them used the loud speaker to call to fishing boats off the coast. ""We quit hearing her,"" West said of the trapped woman. ""I don't know if it was because she grew weary or from exhaustion or she floated too far away. But then her voice would come back."" The boats came near to where the woman was floating but the group could not make out if they rescued her. ""We don't know if the boats found her but we certainly hope they did,"" West said. ""We heard her voice no more and the sound of her pleas in Japanese are a sound that will stay with me the rest of my life."" The next morning the group marched out of the town that was shrouded in a fog of burning wreckage and diesel. West calls it a journey through a ""post-apocalyptic world."" The photos he took along the trip show enormous tsunami barriers torn and twisted by the waters, a person being plucked from a roof top by a rescue helicopter and fields of debris that were once people's homes. And there are photos of a human body hanging in a tree. The group came across a teenager still in his school uniform wandering the debris fields. They tried to get him to come with them. Unable to communicate with the activists, the teenager walked away in another direction. They finally made found a group of Japanese people huddled over a campfire. Their house was destroyed but they offered the travelers soup. West said they felt bad but receiving food from them but ""it would have been rude to have refused and it was welcome."" West said he and his companions were only able to leave the devastation through the kindness of Japanese people they encountered along their journey and who they could just barely communicate with. One man, West said, pantomimed for the group to stay put and then returned with cars to drive them from the disaster area. The Japanese, West said, refused to take anything more than gas money. Back at his home in Edmonds, West has been able to take a hot shower and sleep in a real bed if not yet fully absorb his ordeal. West's views on the porpoise hunts haven't changed. But he has invited many of the Japanese people he knows to come stay in his family's home as they try flee the damage and radiation released by the quake. He is more than 4,000 miles from Japan but still feels like he is on the hilltop being battered by the tsunami waves. ""My wife's been saying, 'what if?' I hadn't really allowed myself to go there,"" West said. ""The six of us made it, we are fine, we are home with our families but so many other people didn't make it.""","Scott West documents and protests the killing of porpoises .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president and prime minister resigned from the ousted leader's ruling party, state TV said Tuesday, a move seen as a gesture to placate angry street demonstrators and keep the unity government afloat. But at least four ministers from opposition parties have pulled back from the new government, leaving some observers concerned that the coalition may collapse before it can set up new elections. President Fouad Mebazaa and Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi submitted their resignations from the Constitutional Democratic Rally, which was the ruling party of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- now in exile in Saudi Arabia. Members of the opposition and the Ben Ali party formed a unity government to replace the ousted president, but there have been difficulties in getting that administration going because protesters are demanding that more should be done to sweep the old guard out of power. The displeasure was reflected Tuesday in central Tunis, when roving packs of protesters staged demonstrations and up to 1,000 protesters took to the streets of the capital and called the country's new unity government a sham. The opposition parties were listening. Lotfi Al Ahwal, a senior member of the General Union of Tunisian Workers, confirmed that the union's administrative committee is calling for all of its members to resign from the recently formed unity government. Three ministers have already stepped down, Al Ahwal said. The union's administrative committee, which met Tuesday in a Tunisian suburb, decided not to accept any government that has officials from the old regime and called for demonstrations against the ruling party. Another opposition leader, Mustafa Ben Jaafar, was to serve as health minister in the new government but suspended his participation in the united government, his spokesman, Abudallah Tif, told CNN Tuesday. The move by the interim president and prime minister was seen as a way to disassociate themselves from the old guard and salvage the new government. Earlier, Ghannouchi said in an interview with Europe 1 radio that some officials from the old regime kept their positions ""because we need them in this time of building democracy."" ""All ministers who have retained their jobs have clean hands and they are very competent. They also have a merit. With their dedication, they have succeeded in reducing the destructive capacity of some areas,"" he said. He emphasized that a new election will take place in six months and will be the first to be held in a free Tunisia. Ghannouchi also said that ""we will not forgive"" those responsible for wrongful shootings, including people who may have been personal officers of Ben Ali, and that ""all those who were behind this massacre will be held responsible."" Weeks of demonstrations have left 78 dead and 94 wounded, the government said. Many of the injured were police officers, according to the country's interior minister. It was not immediately clear how many may have been shot by those affiliated with Ben Ali. Ghannouchi -- who said the military didn't shoot people -- emphasized that he never gave any order for police to shoot people and only allowed tear gas and rubber bullets. When peaceful gatherings started to grow in size, witnesses said, police would step in and start firing tear gas and chase protesters with their batons.  At least a half dozen people were beaten, witnesses said, and one man's arm was broken. At the same time, more people began going back to work and more businesses were opening Tuesday, as many tried to restore a sense of normalcy despite the unrest permeating certain places in the restive country. But many others remained angry about the country's new unity government, saying they don't want it to include anyone from the old administration, which fell apart after Ben Ali fled last week. ""No leftovers from the old regime!"" protesters chanted. Ghannouchi's 19-member cabinet was to include three opposition leaders and 10 independents, he announced Monday. The new government will be tasked with leading Tunisia toward new elections, he said. Opposition leaders Ahmad Ibrahim and Ahmad Najib Al Shabi were named to serve as education minister and minister of local development, respectively. Monsef al Marzouki, the leader of Tunisia's National Congress Party -- a leftist and secularist movement that was banned by Ben Ali's ruling party -- returned to Tunisia from exile in Paris to cheers from demonstrators at the Tunis-Carthage International Airport. Among the holdovers from the previous government is Ahmed Friaa, the interior minister. Friaa has vowed that those who should be held responsible for mistakes of the past will be punished. Hager Ben Mahmoud, a 34-year-old bid manager at a software company, told CNN that normalcy is creeping back, with banks, shops and grocery stores in Tunis starting to reopen. But the military is ever-present. ""There are still a couple of demonstrations because people are against the fact that older members of the political party (will remain) in power,"" she said. She said that the Tunisian workers union is asking people to go back to work in order to get things back to normal. In the city of Sfax, Tunisian State TV said, all of the the shops, pharmacies, cafes and most banks are open as usual. Unlike the previous two days, no demonstrations had taken place in Sfax Tuesday, the report said. The army is still positioned in most areas but not as prominently as in previous days. Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia last week after ruling the country for 23 years, following weeks of protests over what Tunisians said were poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression. The unrest over the past several weeks was triggered in December when Mohamed Bouazizi, an unemployed college graduate, set himself ablaze after police confiscated the fruit cart that was his source of income. He died early this month. Recent diplomatic cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia, disclosed by the WikiLeaks website, revealed growing discontent with what Tunisians believed was widespread corruption and nepotism within Ben Ali's government. The unrest has stoked concern across the world, with international leaders calling for an end to violence and offering assistance to develop a Tunisian democracy, with a unity government  that ""ensures a peaceful democratic transition."" ""Tunisia has reached a point of no return. The EU will stand side by side with Tunisians as they pursue their peaceful and democratic aspirations,"" Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, and Stefan Fule, commissioner for enlargement and the European neighborhood policy, said in a statement released Tuesday. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon underscored the EU statement, appealing ""for broad-based consultations in Tunisia to establish an inclusive interim government leading to the holding of timely and credible elections through which the citizens of Tunisia can freely choose their leadership."" ""The United Nations stands ready to provide assistance to the Tunisian people,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The woman charged in a deadly day care fire that killed four small children is back in Texas, an official said Tuesday. Jessica Tata, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Nigeria, fled to Lagos shortly after the fatal fire at her Houston home in February. She was transported to the Harris County Jail early Tuesday morning, said Christina Garza, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Tata arrived in Atlanta Monday morning and was booked into the Fulton County Jail, officials said in a statement. She made an appearance in magistrate court, where she waived her extradition rights. Investigators allege that Tata, a 22-year-old day care owner, left seven children alone at her Houston day care center with the stove on while she went to a store. Four children died, and three others were injured in the blaze. Tata was taken into custody Saturday in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, by Interpol and U.S. diplomatic security agents, officials said. At a news conference Monday, U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee said Tata turned herself in to authorities after a ""monumental"" effort between the U.S. and Nigerian governments, along with Tata's family in Lagos. ""We now have the opportunity to move forward,"" Lee said, adding that she worked closely with the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and spoke with the Nigerian ambassador to the United Statesto make sure Tata's return was a ""top priority."" On Sunday, Lee gathered with Houston's Nigerian community for a memorial service in honor of the four children lost in the fire, where ministers ""pleaded"" for Tata to return home. U.S. marshals were asked to join the search by Harris County authorities after Tata left the Houston area. They added the missing woman to their 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list in March. Tata has been indicted on felony charges in the fatal fire, including four counts of manslaughter, six counts of reckless injury to a child, three counts of abandoning a child under 15 and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan capitalized on AC Milan's slip-up to move within two points of their city rivals after a controversial 1-0 win at home to lowly Lecce on Sunday. Leaders Milan suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Palermo on Saturday, giving Inter hope of a sixth successive title with eight rounds left to play this season ahead of the derby at the San Siro on April 2. However, both teams also face a challenge from Napoli who could move within three points of the leaders with a win over Cagliari in Sunday's late match. Inter took control from the opening whistle at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, but squandered countless opportunities as Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder missed two great chances in the opening 20 minutes. Blow for AC Milan title bid . The remainder of the first half was peppered with controversial incidents, with Lecce's Uruguayan midfielder Guillermo Giacomazzi yellow-carded for his kick on Samuel Eto'o, then Inter defender Lucio was booked for a handball that means he is suspended for the Milan derby in two weeks. Inter striker Giampaolo Pazzini and Lecce's Brazilian defender Fabiano had to be broken up by referee Daniele Orsato when the pair came to blows. The second half started just as bizarrely, as a mistake from Lecce goalkeeper Antonio Rosati almost gifted Inter with an unlikely goal. As it was, Inter's 54th-minute winner from Pazzini was hotly-disputed by the Lecce players, who claimed it had come off the Italy forward's hand. ""Today I can say that we're where we wanted to be and the derby won't be decisive, even if we win, because we'll only have a one-point lead,"" Inter coach Leonardo told the club's website. ""Let's not forget that Napoli and Udinese have been on great runs for a long time. Champions League hopefuls Udinese moved ahead of Napoli and Lazio into third place in the table after defeating Catania 2-0. Gokhan Inler opened proceedings for the home side in the 22nd minute, while captain Antonio di Natale doubled the lead with a penalty in the 74th minute after Alexis Sanchez was brought down by Giuseppe Marchese. Sixth-placed AS Roma twice came from behind to secure a 2-2 draw at Fiorentina, as captain Francesco Totti bagged his second successive double to pass 200 career goals in Serie A. Romania striker Adrian Mutu put Fiorentina ahead before Totti reached the landmark with a penalty, but defender Alessandro Gamberini made it 2-1 at halftime. Totti, whose brace secured Roma victory in the in the Eternal City derby against Lazio last weekend, earned his team a point seven minutes after halftime from John Arne Riise's cross. Juventus moved into seventh place ahead of Palermo after defeating second-bottom Brescia 2-1. Milos Krasic scored in the 25th minute for Juve, but Eder leveled the match just before halftime. Veteran striker Alessandro del Piero tied up three points for the home side in the 68th minute, while Victor Mareco's sending-off left Brescia with just 10 men for the last 20 minutes. Mid-table Chievo beat bottom side Bari 2-1. Sergio Pellissier put Chievo ahead after 38 minutes only for the home side to be awarded a penalty two minutes later, allowing Abdelkhader Ghezzal to equalize. Davide Moscardelli scored the winner for the visitors four minutes after halftime. Parma moved four points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Sampdoria, thanks to Cristian Zaccardo's 65th-minute goal. Sampdoria had a chance to level the game with a penalty 10 minutes later, but striker Massimo Maccarone was unsuccessful as his team were left two points above the relegation zone.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The Egyptian stock market plunged 5% in the opening minute Wednesday, triggering circuit breakers as the exchange opened for the first time in nearly two months. The sell-off was expected. Traders had predicted a ""bloodbath."" ""For sure, the main index will drop 5% in the first minute,"" said Ahmed Samir of Hurreya Brokerage ahead of the trading day, pointing to the red sales orders dominating his computer screen. ""Then the stock market will close."" The circuit breaker stops trading for 30 minutes. Outside the stock market, the orderly palm-lined street was mostly empty, with the exception of soldiers and armored personnel carriers. Security has been increased since some protesters demanded on Tuesday that the exchange not reopen. Mohamed Abdel Salam, who is the chairman of Ministry for Clearing and Settlement, will serve as chairman of the exchange for 6 months, a government statement said this week. He said this century old building has housed the Egyptian stock market since 1903. Never in the history of Egypt or the world, however, has he seen a stock market closed for such a long period. The markets have been closed since January 27. A political uprising that began two days earlier resulted in the eventual overthrow of then-President Hosni Mubarak. On Saturday, Egyptian voters overwhelmingly approved proposed constitutional amendments that pave the way for parliamentary elections in June. An estimated 45 million Egyptians were eligible to vote in what was widely viewed as the country's first free election in decades, and the poll sets the stage for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year. The proposed amendments included limiting the president to two four-year terms, capping emergency laws to six months unless they are extended by public referendum, and placing elections under judicial oversight.

"MUMBAI, India (Reuters) -- An exclusive magazine for prostitutes is offering a snapshot of life in some of India's biggest brothels, reporting the murky world of pimps and violent customers and showcasing the dreams and talents of sex workers. ""Red Light Despatch,"" a monthly publication, is full of emotional outpourings of women sold to brothels as children, personal accounts of torture and harassment, poems and essays by prostitutes, book and film reviews and advocacy articles. Health workers and prostitutes sit together once a week in a tiny newsroom located inside a brothel in India's financial capital to discuss stories, headlines and the design of issues. The reporters, often themselves prostitutes or their relatives, file their contribution after scouring the brothels of Mumbai, Kolkata and New Delhi and some smaller cities. ""We choose the best stories for publishing,"" said Rupa Metgudd, a news coordinator and daughter of a former prostitute, sifting through reports for the latest edition. ""The magazine is not a mere publication. For us it is journalism of purpose."" Although prostitution is illegal in India, it is a thriving underground industry and voluntary groups estimate that there are about 2 million women sex workers. Launched six months ago, the magazine is a platform for the collective memories, nostalgia and dreams of the sex worker community and an attempt to wean their children away from the profession, said editor Anurag Chaturvedi. In one recent edition, Sita, a prostitute from Kolkata who gave only one name, told of her violent childhood marriage that forced her to flee her home and land in a brothel. ""My dignity was torn to pieces. I used to cry a lot. But I soon learnt some things will never change no matter how much you cry,"" she wrote. Elsewhere, women wrote about betrayed love, bad marriages, their dreams of living a life of dignity, of owning a ""house with lots of sky,"" and about the ""frightening"" world of prostitution. With a little help from a voluntary group, the magazine prints about 1,000 copies in Hindi and English and is distributed free among prostitutes and residents of red light districts. The ragtag magazine, without any photographs, looks more like a booklet but it apparently serves the purpose. ""It's a platform, a vent for many prostitutes who deposit their anger, hurt and thoughts on these pages,"" said Anita Khude, a health volunteer associated with the magazine. ""The magazine is for them and it is about them."" If there were any doubts about the quality of the magazine staffed by people with no journalistic experience, two former journalists help edit it. There also are plans to turn it into a more appealing tabloid in Hindi, English and Bengali. ""We have little money, but we still pay our writers small amounts so that they realize they can earn a respectable living as well,"" said editor Chaturvedi. For its reporters, getting stories from brothels is not a problem because ""we are accepted as one of them"". ""When we go to people's homes they are comfortable and they talk,"" said Khude. ""In the next issue we will write about how a 'normal' man -- a poor roadside snacks seller -- fought prejudices and married a prostitute he fell in love with.""  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain has foiled a foreign plot to destabilize it, the country's king said Sunday. King Hamad said the plot had been in the making for more than two decades -- but did not name a country that he believed was trying to carry it out. Bahrain's Sunni Muslim monarchy has long suspected Iran of attempting to foment unrest among the island's majority-Shiite population. Relations have been tense in recent weeks as anti-government protesters have taken to the streets of Manama and Iran has condemned Bahrain's violent crackdown. The king was speaking to officers from the Peninsula Shield, the military arm of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Several members of the council have sent troops to Bahrain to help Manama quell the protests. ""An external plot has been fomented for 20 to 30 years for the ground to be ripe for subversive designs,"" the king told the gathering. ""Such subversive designs are not however possible, whether in Bahrain or in any other GCC country, thank goodness,"" he added, according to a report by the Bahrain News Agency. ""I here announce the failure of the fomented subversive plot."" King Hamad said that if the plot succeeded in one council country, it could spill over into others. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch urged Bahrain on Monday to end its ""campaign of arrests"" of doctors and human rights activists. Over the weekend, security forces arrested four medical doctors and two activists, the group said. ""The arrests, some of which occurred during pre-dawn hours, appear part of a broader government crackdown involving nighttime raids on the homes of those viewed as supporting pro-democracy protesters,"" Human Rights Watch said. Among those detained was Nabeel Rajab of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. About 25 people in about a dozen cars pulled up to his house early Sunday and took him to the offices of the interior ministry's investigative department, he said. ""They said that they were looking for a suspect who was armed and thought I might know him,"" Rajab said. ""They beat me, punched me, kicked me, handcuffed me. Blindfolded me."" The government confirmed that Rajab was arrested but did not provide additional details. In a statement released Monday, the government denied accusations from the Human Rights Watch suggesting ""there is a campaign of indiscriminately arresting or targeting doctors."" ""What such organisations have so far failed to understand is that the services of some of Bahrain's main medical facilities, including Salmaniya Medical Complex, had been overrun by political and sectarian activity,"" the government said in a statement. ""This was totally unacceptable behaviour, by any standard. ""Those responsible are being investigated and will be held to account in the proper, legal manner."" Thousands of people have been demonstrating in Bahrain since last month, part of a wave that has spread through North Africa and the Middle East. On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Bahrain to allow its people to demonstrate peacefully as opposition members reported the death of a fifth protester. ""We have made clear that security alone cannot resolve the challenges facing Bahrain,"" Clinton said. ""Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so."" The demonstrators were killed when Bahraini security forces cleared protesters from the Pearl Roundabout in the capital, Manama, on Tuesday. The roundabout had been a rallying site for anti-government demonstrators since the unrest began. Three days later, the government demolished the landmark monument at the center of the traffic circle.","Bahrain denies accusations it has been singling out doctors for arrest .

"Berlin (CNN) -- A German man who pleaded guilty to sexually abusing his daughter, stepdaughter and stepson was sentenced to more than 14 years in prison Tuesday, a court official said. The man, identified only as Detlef S., was accused of hundreds of incidents of sexual abuse of his children between autumn 1987 and summer 2010. He pleaded guilty on Monday to all charges, said Alexander Walter, Koblenz state court spokesman. He was convicted of severe sexual abuse of children in 42 cases, rape, sexual abuse of wards and sponsoring rape, Walter said. He was sentenced to 14 and a half years in prison, and will stay in preventive custody after that because the court feared he would commit further criminal acts, Walter said. Preventive custody usually means that a person who has served their sentence remains behind bars but receives extra privileges. Detlef S. admitted last month when the trial opened that he was the father of multiple children with his stepdaughter. He was charged with the sexual abuse of dependents and facilitating the sexual abuse of minors. He was also accused of bringing his underage stepdaughter and his daughter to men who paid for sex with them on multiple occasions. The first allegations of abuse came more than a decade ago, in 1998, but there was no medical evidence to support the claims then, Germany's youth welfare office said in a statement when the trial opened February 15. Two stepsons leveled fresh accusations in 2002, saying the defendant was abusing his biological daughter, then 11. Police began an investigation but found no medical evidence and dropped the case, the statement said. The daughter denied having been abused, the welfare office said. Two men other men are facing trial on charges of sexual assault in connection with the case. A third man suspected of abusing the children has died, Walter said. The stepdaughter gave evidence against Detlef S., the court spokesman said.  It was unclear at what age she gave birth to the children. DNA test results introduced in court gave a ""99.999%"" certainty that the defendant is the father of her children, Walter said. Seven of the stepdaughter's eight children survived infancy, he said. He did not know the cause of death of the eighth. The sexual assaults took place in the defendant's home, in woods nearby and in various apartments near where the family lived, prosecutors alleged. Only two of the 350 charges are related to the stepson, Walter said. CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","There were allegations against Detlef S. for more than a decade, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Congress might cut most of the federal funding for your local poison control center, which could mean a longer wait during your next poison-related emergency. Measure H.R. 1 would cut $27.3 million, or about 93%, of federal funding for poison control centers across the United States. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate on March 9.  Congressional leaders now need to negotiate a final spending measure, and that bill might include cuts to the poison control centers. ""My feeling is that just based on my experience, it would end up costing lives somewhere along the way,"" says Jo Anne Bryant, a nurse with 30 years experience who recently called a poison center when her husband, Ronald, accidentally inhaled pesticide fumes while cleaning out the garage. ""I've dealt with some emergencies in this field over my career, but I was completely at a loss as to what to do. When it came to this, I felt completely helpless."" Bryant dialed the national poison center hot line 1-800-222-1222 and was told to take her husband to the hospital if he had specific symptoms, including vomiting. He'd already thrown up, so they headed to the emergency department, where he was treated and released. It's not just the patients . Hospitals rely on poison control centers, too. Poison centers answered 4.2 million calls in 2009, and about 16% of those calls came from hospitals seeking their expertise. ""After the hospital did their initial treatment,"" says Bryant, ""they also called the poison control center to verify that they had administered the correct treatment."" What about when you dial 911? They call your poison center, too. When the 911 operators figure out your emergency is poisoning related, they conference in the poison center for a three-way conversation. That's because the poison center staff answering phone calls include nurses, physicians and pharmacists with specialized poison center training, and there is always a toxicologist on call. ""If we're not around, you better tell your 911 operator to strap their belts on to answer a whole lot of calls that they don't know a damn thing about and can't safely manage that patient at home,"" says Mark Ryan, director of the Louisiana Poison Center. Spending here, saving there . Poison control center operators say their services save health care dollars, primarily because most callers are told they don't need a hospital. Eliminating call centers could increase unnecessary trips to the hospital, further burdening the health care system, they say. ""Poison centers treat nearly 75% of all exposure cases at home, without the patient having to go to a health care facility,"" said Jim Hirt, executive director of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, in a written statement. ""The costs of this cut would ultimately far exceed the $27 million saved."" According to a study cited by the Department of Health and Human Services, for every dollar spent on poison control centers, $7 in health care spending is saved. Other studies find the per dollar value of poison control centers to be far greater. Louisiana has already been down this road. Because of state budget cuts, the Louisiana Poison Center closed on October 31, 1988. The percentage of patients treated at home dropped to 28.6%, from 74.1% before the center closed, according to a 1991 study published in the Southern Medical Journal. The Louisiana Poison Center reopened in 1992, because the additional health care costs outweighed the savings, and because of stories like Peggy Toner's. Toner's 2-year-old daughter swallowed an antibiotic cream one day in 1990. With the Louisiana Poison Center closed, she called another state's poison center for help, but the staff was instructed not to help her, because the state where she lived, Louisiana, was not paying for their poison center services. ""It was the most horrible feeling in the world,"" says Toner. ""What if my daughter died because they wouldn't help me?"" She then called a Kentucky poison center, where she got help. Creating one national call center . The cuts in federal funding would eliminate all but one of the nation's 57 poison control centers, which rely heavily on federal funding. Click here to see how many federal dollars your local poison control center receives. ""There's just no reason to maintain 57 separate call centers around the country when technology would enable us to get the job done with one,"" said a statement from Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Montana, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Health and Human Services. ""We can save millions simply by cutting out 56 duplicative locations and with record debt and deficits putting our future in jeopardy, it's worth looking under every rock for savings."" Poison control center operators strongly disagree. ""Local relationships are invaluable"" says Ryan of Louisiana. ""There's no way a single center could get in there and provide for the wants and needs of every state. It's not possible."" He also warns of putting all resources in a single entity. ""What happens if the hypothetical 'single' center gets wiped out by a tornado and the infrastructure is destroyed? Where are those 12,000+ calls each day going to go?"" Many health care students -- doctors, nurses, pharmacists, EMTs -- receive formal toxicology training from their local center. ""Who else knows what we know?"" says Ryan. It is unclear how one enormous center would be funded, or in which state it would be. ""If you want the same number of people to be answered,"" says Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, ""suddenly you need to have probably six- or seven-hundred people working in a single poison control center."" Proponents of the one-center plan cite innovation in private business and say government could follow the example to be more efficient. ""If you look at things like bookstores or movie rental stores, with internet technology, where long distances really aren't an issue anymore, what they do is they save a ton of money by putting everything in a single warehouse,"" said one congressional staffer speaking anonymously. Could it work? Many call centers already serve areas far beyond their locale. A call center in Nebraska also handles emergencies in American Samoa and Micronesia. Oregon serves Guam. A Jacksonville, Florida, call center serves the Virgin Islands. And Montana -- Rehberg's state -- is served by the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center, which also handles Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho and Nevada, negotiating rates with each state. Cell phones also make out-of-state poison emergencies a common thing. Timing the announcement with National Poison Prevention Week, which began Sunday, the American Association of Poison Control Centers will release an iPhone app to help users dial the poison control hot line. Those calls, like all cell phone calls, may ring at the nearest poison control center, or not. ""Every single center gets calls from other states almost daily,"" says Ryan. ""Two or three a day; we see it more with certain carriers than others."" Still, poison center operators insist that local matters. ""I think it was just an ill-informed decision by somebody who, let's just hope, was new on the scene,"" says Lopez about the proposed budget cuts, ""and wasn't that ill-informed after lots of experience.""","Measure H.R. 1 could cut  93% of federal funding for poison control centers .
House passed H.R. 1 but Senate rejected it; cut could still be in a final, negotiated bill .
Centers answered 4.2 million calls in 2009; about 16% of those came from hospitals .

"(CNN) -- Tensions boiled in a volatile Syrian community Thursday as thousands turned up for the funerals of people killed in unrest. Meanwhile, Syria's government blamed the instability on outsiders and announced plans to study popular demands, including the lifting of the country's decades-old emergency law. Syria is the latest in a string of Arabic-speaking nations beset with discontent over economic and human rights issues. Syrian discontent centers on Daraa, a southern city in the impoverished country's agricultural region, where violence has been escalating between security forces and anti-government protesters since late last week. Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights organization Insan, said at least 34 people have been killed in Daraa in the past two days. Other activists believe many more have been killed. Tarif said as many as 20,000 people followed the funeral procession for those who died in the violence, including a conscripted soldier who was reportedly shot and wounded because he refused to fire on demonstrators. A witness, who asked not to be named, said 10 ""martyrs"" were buried following afternoon prayers, with the people in the procession mourning the loss of the victims and chanting anti-government slogans. Kamal Aswad, a political activist in Daraa, said people in the funeral procession were chanting: ""Those who kill their own people are traitors"" and he said activists are trying to generate support for a big protest on Friday -- a ""Day of Martyrs"" to be held after Friday prayers. Syrian state TV portrayed an opposite picture of the public mood. Scenes broadcast Thursday included fireworks and crowds of pro-government supporters waving pictures of President Bashar al-Assad and shouting, ""with our bloods and our souls, we defend you Bashar!"" The footage was marked onscreen as ""live,"" but it could not be determined when the footage actually originated. Also Thursday, state TV broadcast an ""urgent"" message that read: ""Following a directive by President Assad, all those who were detained in the latest events were released."" It could not be determined whether the statement was true. State TV reported on Wednesday that the government fired the provincial governor amid the demonstrations. The Obama administration on Thursday released a statement condemning ""the Syrian government's brutal repression of demonstrations, in particular the violence and killings of civilians at the hands of security forces."" ""We call on the Syrian government to exercise restraint and respect the rights of its people and call on all citizens to exercise their rights peacefully,"" the White House statement read. Al-Assad's government on Thursday announced a number of measures apparently addressing protesters' demands. Among them, decrees to cut taxes and raise government workers salaries by 1,500 Syrian pounds ($32.60 US) a month, as well as pledges to provide more press freedoms, increased job opportunities and curbs on government corruption. The government also said it would study lifting the country's emergency law and new legislation that would license political parties. Syria's emergency law has been in effect since 1963. The law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. It also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations. The government also announced Thursday it will form a committee ""to contact and listen to citizens in Daraa."" Bouthina Shaaban, a spokeswoman for al-Assad, passed along his condolences to those killed in Daraa and said the president ""would not accept any bloodshed."" ""I was an eyewitness to his excellency's orders that no live bullets would be used against the demonstrators,"" Shaaban said. Shaaban also said the government is investigating the unrest in Daraa and that there are ""indications and proof that there is a foreign financial support."" ""Daraa was chosen because of its geographic location near the borders and how easy it is to transfer money and weapons to the city,"" Shaaban said, referring to the area's proximity to Jordan. The Jordanian government on Thursday released a statement on state TV denying ""as baseless, reports that fighters and vehicles loaded with weapons entered Syria from inside Jordanian territory."" ""Such reports are nothing but media allegations that will not affect the good relations between the two countries,"" the statement read. Syria is a diverse country, largely Sunni Muslim but ruled by the minority Alawite Muslim sect. It is also populated by Christians and members of the Druze sect. Along with Arabs, it has a significant Kurdish minority, which has been restive in recent years, and an Armenian population. Those populations are controlled by a government that human rights groups consider one of the most repressive in the world. In 2010, Syria ranked 127th out of 178 countries in transparency and accountability to the public, according to the international government watchdog group Transparency International. On a scale of 0 to 10, the lowest score representing the world's most corrupt governments, Syria scored a 2.5, Transparency International reported. Human rights groups estimate that tens of thousands of people were killed in Syria during the three decades under the rule of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's father. Bashar al-Assad came to power in 2000 promising reforms, but aside from implementing some economic reforms, failed to deliver, according to human rights groups. Joshua Landis, who runs the Syria Comment blog and is director of the Center for Middle East Studies and associate professor at University of Oklahoma, told CNN that the unrest in Daraa is spurred by a number of factors, widespread poverty, a dislike for the emergency law and the arrests two weeks ago of young people who scrawled anti-government graffiti. It is also driven by Sunni resentment against a government controlled by Alawites, among them, al-Assad. So far, Landis said, the rallies been localized to Daraa but it's possible that there will be demonstrations elsewhere on Friday. ""Daraa is very poor and Islamic -- it optimizes everything that troubles Syria -- a failed economy, the population explosion, a bad governor and overbearing security forces,"" Landis wrote in his blog. ""It is an explosive brew. Even if the government can contain violence to Daraa for the time-being, protests will spread. The wall of fear has broken. Apathy of the young has turned to anger,"" Because there are so few sources available from what has been a closed, authoritarian society, human rights activists are trying to get a handle on the number of casualties and the context behind the unrest in Daraa, which is a more conservative, tribal and close-knit community. Amnesty International said it has been ""deeply disturbed by reports of multiple deaths"" in Daraa, as security forces fired ""at protesters and people coming to the aid of the injured."" Along with many killed in the violence over the past 36 hours there were 92 confirmed arrests, according to Neil Sammonds an Amnesty researcher on Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Sammonds said there are reports of army snipers shooting women carrying water and an 11-year-old girl. It's ""hard to imagine these are front-line protesters,"" Sammonds said.

"St. Louis (CNN) -- A 1-year-old boy whose family fought a Canadian hospital over whether he should be allowed to die received a tracheotomy at his St. Louis hospital early Monday morning. Officials at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center where Joseph Maraachli -- widely known in the media as ""baby Joseph"" -- is being treated, wrote that following a thorough examination by a multi-disciplinary team of specialists and ethicists, a tracheotomy was deemed ""medically appropriate"" for the child. The surgical procedure creates an opening into the airway through an incision in the neck, and a tube allows for suction of fluid out of the lungs. According to the hospital, this creates a safe and stable way to use a mechanical ventilator. Joseph, who was born in January 2010, had been in the care of the London Health Sciences Centre in Canada since October. His doctor, in court papers, said there was no hope for recovery and recommended that the infant's breathing tube be removed and he be allowed to die. The hospital would not perform a tracheotomy because they consider it to be an invasive procedure, one not typically recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine. The child's parents, Moe and Sana Maraachli, refused to comply with court orders and sought instead to have their son transferred to a location where he could get a tracheotomy combined with continued mechanical ventilation and later be transferred home into their care. Physicians at Cardinal Glennon say Joseph suffers from a rare genetic neurometabolic disorder called Leigh Syndrome. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. The condition is characterized by the degeneration of the central nervous system and is inherited in most cases. In February, a family spokesperson told CNN the Maraachlis have undergone genetic testing, but no genetic link had been found. Joseph will remain in the intensive care unit for seven to 10 days and then head to Ranken Jordan, a pediatric specialty hospital in St. Louis, before being discharged and transported to his family home in Windsor, Ontario.","Canadian doctors had refused, citing no hope for recovery .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, will travel Monday to Havana, Cuba, for a visit at the invitation of the Cuban government, the Carter Center announced Friday. During the trip, which will last through Wednesday, they will meet with high-level officials of the communist regime, including President Raul Castro, and other Cuban citizens ""to learn about new economic policies and the upcoming Party Congress, and to discuss ways to improve U.S.-Cuba relations,"" the Atlanta, Georgia-based center said in a written statement. The trip is being undertaken as a private, nongovernmental mission under the auspices of the not-for-profit Carter Center. Carter last visited the island in May 2002, becoming the first former or sitting U.S. president to travel to Cuba since 1928. In a speech broadcast live on Cuban radio and television, Carter, speaking in Spanish, called on the United States to end its ""ineffective 43-year-old economic embargo"" on the island. He also called on then-President Fidel Castro to hold free elections, improve human rights, and allow greater civil liberties. ""Analysts said it was the first time in 43 years that citizens had heard any public criticism of the Cuban government, much less direct condemnation of human rights violations,"" Carter wrote in his report from the trip, referring to the time since Castro had been in power. ""I anticipated President Castro would be upset, but he greeted me after the session.""","Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter are departing Monday at invitation of the Cuban government .

"(CNN) -- The trial of a soldier accused of killing Afghan citizens for sport is scheduled to begin Wednesday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Spc. Jeremy Morlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. Morlock is one of two U.S. soldiers who are scheduled to be tried at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Pfc. Andrew Holmes is also facing charges in the case but a start date for his court martial has not been publicly announced. Both are part of a larger case that involves several other soldiers, all accused of similar killings. In all, officials charged 12 U.S. soldiers in what they called a conspiracy to kill Afghan civilians and cover it up, along with charges they mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs. Five of the soldiers face murder charges, while seven others are charged with participating in a cover-up. Morlock was the first of the five to face an Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. If convicted, Morlock faces a maximum punishment of imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole, the military said. Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties and smoking hashish. He is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. All of the accused men were members of a 2nd Infantry Division brigade operating near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. The three others facing murder charges are Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs, of Billings, Montana; Adam Winfield, of Cape Coral, Florida; and Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas, Nevada. Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. Wagnon allegedly kept a skull from a corpse, according to charging documents. Several soldiers are charged with taking pictures of the corpses, and one soldier is charged with stabbing a corpse. This week, German news outlet Der Spiegel published photographs of what they identified as Morlock and Holmes posing over the bodies of dead Afghan. Two images show the soldiers kneeling by a bloody body sprawled over a patch of sand and grass. A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. The U.S. Army released a statement Monday calling the photographs ""repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards and values of the United States Army."" ""We apologize for the distress these photos cause,"" the statement said. Army officials asserted in the statement that ongoing court-martial proceedings related to the alleged atrocities ""speak for themselves. ""The photos appear in stark contrast to the discipline, professionalism and respect that have characterized our soldiers' performance during nearly 10 years of sustained operations.""","Spc.

"(CNN) -- The man who killed a University of Connecticut football player in 2009 was sentenced Friday to 18 years in prison for manslaughter in the first degree, said Rockland County Deputy Clerk Tammy Fluet. John Lomax III, 22, stabbed Jasper Howard in the abdomen during a fight outside a campus dance on October 18, 2009. The UConn cornerback died later at a hospital in Hartford, Connecticut. More than 300 people at the dance left the building and spilled out into the street. A fight broke out between two groups, and Howard and another person were stabbed, police said after the incident. The second victim, who was treated and released, was Brian Parker, then 19, another player on the UConn football squad, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. Maj. Ron Blicher of the UConn Police Department said in 2009 that more than 40 investigators from his department and the Connecticut State Police conducted more than 200 interviews during the course of the investigation. The university set up the Jasper T. Howard Endowed Scholarship to honor the slain student athlete.","John Lomax III, 22, was sentenced to 18 years for manslaughter in the first degree .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Thousands of angry protesters took to the street in downtown Dhaka and other major cities as regulators halted trading on the country's prime Dhaka Stock Exchange after the DGEN index fell a record 9.25% within an hour of opening on Monday. After Sunday's record fall of 600 points, the market began at 10 a.m., but it nose-dived within an hoursetting a record fall. The authority instantly halted the trading as the DGEN index dipped to 660 points in an hour triggering off violent protests. A notice on the DSE website reads, ""Today's (10-01-2011) market has been halted as per SEC's (Security and Exchange Commission) order, it will be resumed after further announcement."" All the top SEC and DSE executives sat in an emergency meeting and a DSE spokesman said the decision was taken to safeguard the tens of thousands of small investors who went on a selling spree in panic Monday morning. Many investors in the street, however, claimed the index dipped due to manipulation by some big investors. ""I've lost my capital here... I didn't have any job... I borrowed taka 300,000 (US$4285) from my relatives and invested... two thirds of the capital has gone... I've become a pauper... how can I repay the loan?"" lamented an investor, Abdur Rahim. Like Rahim, thousands of angry investors, who lost their money, immediately took to the street in downtown Motijheel and its adjoining areas -- defying large contingents of anti-riot police -- and damaged cars and buses. They took control of more than a kilometre of the street, blocking traffic movement and burning used tires and broken furniture in the capital's commercial hub. The protests also spread many parts of the country including the southern port city of Chittagong, holy shrine city of Sylhet and many other places. Protesters marched in groups chanting anti-government slogans for not intervening before the market plunged and blocking the roads to traffic. ""The government will certainly look into if there is any manipulation,"" Bangladesh Finance Minister AMA Muhith said. In Dhaka, police used clubs and water canon to disperse the violent protesters who pelted chunks of bricks and small stones at police in retaliation. Earlier, the biggest fall in a single day was on December 19 last year when DGEN slipped 552 points or 6.73 percent. The investors took a bumpy ride of a rollercoaster in recent weeks as they saw a record peak of 80 percent rise on December 5 and subsequently saw a nosedive after three days prompting protests in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country. In a bid to settle the market, the SEC on Sunday morning lifted the bank loan ceiling of 100 million taka (about US$ 1.43 million) for investing in the stock market and eased many other restrictions but those steps could not stop the price erosion on Monday. said.

"(CNN) -- The owners of Manchester United, Red Football Joint Venture, have announced huge losses for the last financial year. United's parent company -- which is owned by the Glazer family -- have confirmed losses of $178 million according to their latest accounts filed at Companies House. The accounts also reveal the deficit includes some one-off costs incurred by the Glazers, following the setting-up of the $861 million bond scheme last year to replace the bank loans they obtained to purchase the club. United, who currently lead the English Premier League table by five points, also suffered a drop in income from the sale of players. The previous year's accounts recorded a $35m profit following the $130m sale of winger Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. Meanwhile, respected magazine France Football have published their list of the highest-paid players in the world, with Lionel Messi taking over from David Beckham at the top of the earnings table. Barcelona maestro Messi earned a remarkable $48 million in the last financial year, ahead of Beckham -- who has been first or second in each of the last nine years.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Muhammad Yunus won a Nobel Peace Prize for the Bangladeshi bank he founded but now he finds himself in a bitter fight to retain his job. Yunus pioneered microcredit financing and founded Grameen Bank nearly three decades ago in an effort to alleviate poverty by lending to the poor. He refused Wednesday to bow to government demands and resign from the bank that won him a Nobel in 2006. ""We established Grameen Bank through a special ordinance, with rules that are specific, according to which my current term as managing director is fully valid,"" he said. ""Government has three representatives on the board and they have unanimously approved these rules."" Grameen caught the world's attention by specializing in providing loans to low-income entrepreneurs who were unable to secure money through regular banks. Yunus quickly gained a reputation as a ""banker to the poor."" Bangladeshi Finance Minister Abul Mal Abdul Muhith said Yunus was too old to run the bank and should step down. ""Normally the retirement age of a bank's managing director in Bangladesh is 65, and Professor Yunus is now 70,"" Muhith said. The pressure stems from allegations in a television documentary that Yunus illegally diverted Grameen money. Grameen denied the charges and Norway, a key bank donor, found no evidence of wrongdoing. But the larger debate has been over the notion of microcredit itself. Its critics have charged that lenders were making big money off small loans. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina minced no words when she compared Grameen's operations to ""sucking the blood from the poor in the name of alleviating poverty."" ""It is a question of explaining to her,"" Yunus told CNN in a recent interview. ""She probably has no close connection to that, all the good things that microcredit has done globally, not just in Bangladesh."" Yunus has admitted serious problems that have surfaced recently in the world of microfinancing. Poor families have complained about debt burdens and loan sharks who charge an exorbitant interest. Yunus conceded some lenders have taken advantage of the system. But, he insisted to CNN, that a few bad apples should not undermine the idea of microcredit. ""The idea will not disappear,"" he said. ""It is a question of teething problems. It is a question of misuse and abuse of the idea."" Muhith said the push for Yunus' resignation had no link to politics, but many analysts say Yunus is still under fire for criticizing politicians and trying to form his own political party four years ago during an interim, unelected military-backed government. That party was later abandoned. Yunus faces a defamation charge for comments he made four years ago to the French news agency that politicians were only in ""power to make money."" Several prominent figures have stepped up in Yunus' defense, including Mary Robinson, the former Irish president and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who chairs a newly formed ""Friends of Grameen"" initiative. ""One of the priorities is also to support the independence of Grameen Bank and its founder Professor Yunus, who together were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, as they have been the target of an ongoing pressure campaign of rumors and misleading information,"" the group said in a statement. CNN's Sara Sidner and Moni Basu and journalist Farid Ahmed contributed to this report.","The Bangladeshi government wants Muhammad Yunus to resign .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Apologies are not sufficient when it comes to civilian casualties, Afghan President Hamid Karzai told the NATO commander Sunday, days after a NATO airstrike killed nine Afghan boys. Karzai told Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, that incidents of civilian casualties during coalition military operations are the main reason for tensions in the U.S.-Afghan relationship and he demanded there be no more, according to a statement from Karzai's office. The comments came in a private conversation between the two men Sunday, according to an official with NATO's International Security Assistance Force who asked not to be named. Petraeus made a public apology Wednesday for the deaths, which happened the day before in the province of Kunar, along Afghanistan's eastern border. U.S. President Barack Obama also expressed regret for the deaths, calling it a ""tragic accident."" A White House statement said Obama and Karzai agreed that such incidents undermine shared U.S. and Afghan efforts in fighting terrorism. The incident happened after insurgents in mountains above a coalition base launched a rocket attack that wounded a U.S. civilian, according to U.S. Lt. Gen. David Rodriguez. Troops returned fire and insurgents later shot another rocket at the troops. Two attack helicopters flew to the location where they were told the rockets originated, identified who they thought were insurgents and killed nine people. Rodriguez said. Later, they found that the slain people were boys cutting wood. Rodriguez called the incident ""a terrible mistake"" and promised disciplinary action if warranted. The statement from Karzai's office said Petraeus repeated his apology Sunday and promised ""it will not happen again."" Karzai said the Afghan people are suffering as a result of civilian casualties and that apologizing and condemning these actions cannot ease their pain, according to his office. ""The trust of Afghanistan's government and people definitively depend on this issue,"" Karzai told Petraeus. Recurrence of such incidents, he said, is ""unacceptable."" The NATO force official said Sunday, ""We take all civilian casualties very seriously. In light of the recent event that tragically killed nine children, commanders have been given the direction to review our tactical directive that is intended to reduce civilian casualties to the absolute minimum. We will continue to reinforce the need to protect the lives of innocent Afghans as we pursue a ruthless enemy."" Rodriguez said last week such incidents are ""rare"" when considering all the operations the coalition undertakes. He said a lot of time is spent training soldiers on how to engage the right targets and that directives are constantly reviewed. ""We have done much better preventing civilian casualties,"" he said. ""But we acknowledge we have to do better."" Rodriguez said the military understands families' grief over such deaths, and he said soldiers ""feel worse than they can express"" when they ""do something terrible like mistakenly killing young boys."" ""They have to live with that for the rest of their lives,"" he said. Rodriguez also urged Afghans to help their security forces battle insurgents. Karzai previously noted the Tuesday incident occurred less than 10 days after another one ""that left many civilians dead in the same province."" On February 20, Kunar Governor Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi said 64 civilians had died in a joint operation by the NATO force and Afghan security forces over several days. The dead included 20 women and 15 children, he said. Petraeus recently directed military commanders in Afghanistan to review changes meant to minimize civilian casualties. He has ordered commanders to brief helicopter attack crews again on the changes, he said.

"(CNN) -- Australian soprano Dame Joan Sutherland, dubbed ""La Stupenda"" by opera lovers, died Sunday at age 83 in her home in Switzerland after a long illness. In a career spanning the last half of the 1900s, Sutherland twice won a Grammy for best classical performer, in 1961 and 1981. Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the Recording Academy, described Sutherland as possessing ""an organic and elegant voice with astonishing range, vibrance and sense of drama."" ""Throughout her extraordinary four-decade career, she performed with such greats as Luciano Pavarotti and before audiences in opera houses across the globe. Her legacy lives on in the beautiful arias with which she graced the world,"" Portnow said in a written statement. Her stage career began in 1951 in her native Sydney in a production of ""Judith"" by Eugene Goossens, according to a spokesman with her recording company, Decca Records. She signed with Decca in 1959. Over the next 30 years, she made 40 recordings of 33 operas, as well as operatic highlights, anthologies and collections ranging from baroque rarities to songs by Noel Coward, a personal friend to her. Sutherland was often accompanied on stage or in studios by mentor and husband Richard Bonynge, and regular vocal partners included mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne and the tenor Pavarotti. Her last stage appearance was with both performers in Act 2 of ""Die Fledermaus"" at The Royal Opera House in London, England's Covent Garden on December 31, 1989. Her record company credits her with rising to international stardom in 1959 when she appeared in Franco Zefirelli's Covent Garden production of Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor."" During her career she sang the role of Lucia 233 times. During the late 1950s and 1960s, she and Bonynge, whom she married in 1954, were at the forefront of a Handel revival. In 1960, during Venice, Italy, performances of Handel's ""Alcina,"" a journalist nicknamed her ""La Stupenda."" That same year, Sutherland paid homage to bygone prima donnae when she recorded ""The Art of The Prima Donna,"" and the two-album set became a bestseller and won a Dutch Edison Award in 1961. She resurrected a number of forgotten works and gave them new life on the stage and in the recording studio, including Massenet's ""Le roi de Lahore"" and ""Esclarmonde,"" the latter being a favorite of hers. During retirement, she mentored young singers and sat as a juror on international signing competitions. She is survived by her husband; her son Adam and daughter-in-law Helen; and two grandchildren, Natasha and Vanya.","Sutherland won two Grammy Awards, in 1961 and 1981 .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday began his second visit to Spain, where he prayed at the tomb of an apostle and planned to consecrate one of Barcelona's most famous sights -- the distinctive Gaudi-designed Sagrada Familia church. The pope's first stop on his two-day trip is Santiago de Compostela, in Spain's northwestern tip, an important pilgrimage site for centuries. The cathedral there was built 900 years ago atop what is said to be the tomb of St. James, an apostle of Jesus. After praying there, the pope presided over a Eucharist in the square outside, to celebrate the city's jubilee year. ""I come as a pilgrim on this Compostelean Saint Year ... I want to join to that long line of men and women that all over the centuries had come to [Santiago de] Compostela from different places on the peninsula and Europe,"" the pontiff said at the airport earlier in the day. Saturday night, the pope planned to head all the way across Spain to Barcelona, the Catalan city on the Mediterranean. Barcelona is home to the Sagrada Familia, or ""holy family,"" church, still being built after more than 100 years. Benedict is expected to designate the church a basilica, a special honor in Roman Catholicism. Antoni Gaudi, a Catalan architect, only lived to see one tower and most of one facade finished by the time he died in 1926. ""The interior space of the church, the sacred space of the church, is finished, and for that, the pope comes here to consecrate the church,"" said Jordi Fauli, the deputy architect. Gaudi planned the church to have 18 towers -- 12 for the apostles and the tallest for Jesus. Only eight are finished. Fauli said the privately-financed work may be done by 2026, on the 100th anniversary of Gaudi's death. Asked once why it was taking so long to finish the Sagrada Familia, Gaudi replied, according to his assistants, ""My client -- meaning God -- is not in a hurry.""","He visits Santiago de Compostela and plans trip to Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom and his wife, Sandra Torres de Colom, have filed for divorce in an attempt to clear the way for the first lady to run for the presidency, Guatemalan Judge Mildred Roca told CNN. Torres jumped in the race for president on March 9, but she has been dogged by critics who called her candidacy illegitimate because of a constitutional article that bars relatives of the president from seeking the high office. The couple filed for divorce on March 11, the family court judge said. The divorce petition was a ""mutual agreement,"" so judicial hearings will not be necessary, Roca said. Under Guatemalan law, within eight days of the divorce petition being filed, both parties must meet with a conciliatory commission to examine if the marriage can be saved. If not, then the divorce can be finalized in another eight days. Roca declined to say whether Colom and Torres met with such a commission. In an interview with CNN en Espanol the day before she filed for divorce, Torres declined to say whether divorce was an option to see her candidacy go forward. She did say, however, that she and her husband had an ""excellent relationship,"" and that she was very happy. Torres claimed that under Guatemala's civil code, marriage does not constitute a relation that is banned under the constitution, and she said that her candidacy was legitimate even without divorce. ""I have the legitimate right to participate, the political right, the human right, to be a presidential candidate,"" she said. Critics are calling the divorce a fraud to circumvent the anti-nepotism article in the constitution, but Roca said that because the divorce is mutually agreed upon, no reason or cause need be given. ""Their intentions are a personal matter,"" the judge said. If mutual, the only requirement to is have been married for longer than one year. Torres and Colom have been married for eight. Torres and Colom belong to the National Unity of Hope, or UNE, party. In a statement, the party confirmed the pending divorce, stating that the goal was ""to avoid further political manipulations from the opposition."" ""They were in a situation that was difficult, but for the good of the nation,"" said Jaime Martinez, general secretary of the Grand National Alliance party, which is allied with UNE. ""They are doing it for national interests and not personal interests. They are making a sacrifice."" Constitutional lawyer Carlos Molina Mencos told the Guatemalan newspaper Prensa Libre that the politically motivated divorce made a farce out of the institution of marriage. ""As public figures, they should set an example, and the worst part is that they are taking these actions only for the possibility of a candidacy,"" he told the paper. ""This means that if they win they can reunite, or if not, they can also reunite. This is a mockery.""","President Alvaro Colom and wife Sandra Torres de Colom filed for divorce on March 11 .

"(CNN) -- The growing push to restrict the collective bargaining rights of government employees has reached the far-flung state of Alaska. There, a Republican state lawmaker has introduced legislation that would strip many public employees of the right to collectively bargain for hours, benefits and working conditions. State employees could still collectively bargain for wages under the legislation. The bill exempts firefighters, police officers and emergency medical technicians, who, according to Title 40 of the Alaska Statutes, are prohibited from going on strike. The bill's sponsor, state Representative Carl Gatto, R-Palmer, said his legislation mimics a measure that was passed by the Wisconsin Legislature earlier this month, signed into law and is now the subject of a lawsuit. ""It is the Wisconsin arrangement,"" Gatto told CNN. Gatto said that his bill, like the Wisconsin measure,  is aimed at curbing state costs. Similar bills to limit collective bargaining rights also are pending in Ohio and Indiana. Opponents of the bill give the measure little chance of passing this session. That's because the 2011 session of the Alaska Legislature is roughly two-thirds over, they said. Also, opponents said, Alaska lawmakers have been focused on controversial legislation to roll back the state's oil and gas tax on profits earned by petroleum companies in the state. Gatto said he doesn't necessarily disagree that his bill probably won't pass this year. ""This is such a union state,"" Gatto said. ""But if you just decide that it doesn't have a chance that guarantees the public will never know about it. You have to build, build, build and ultimately if you do enough building, you'll end up with a house."" House minority leader Beth Kerttula, D-Juneau, said Gatto's bill ""would be a particularly onerous thing to drop on state employees."" Kerttula said public employees are still smarting from a 2005 overhaul of the state's retirement, pension and health care system. Kerttula called the switch ""a disaster"" in a state that has a difficult time retaining qualified teachers and police officers. ""I cannot tell you how wrong she is,"" Gatto said. ""We have teachers lined up to teach here because we pay a decent wage."" Gatto agreed with Kerttula that the bill would face tough sledding in the state Senate, where, unlike the GOP-controlled House, the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats is evenly divided. Kerttula, nevertheless, said the Democratic minority leadership is taking the bill seriously. Gatto said he thinks he can get his bill to the House floor for a vote and and that, if it gets that far, the measure could get passed out of the chamber. Because the 2011 session is the first year of a two-year session for the Alaska Legislature, the bill would not have to be reintroduced in 2012. State Representative Berta Gardner, D-Anchorage, who is the House minority whip, wondered whether the proposed collective bargaining bill for Alaska public employees could spark as fierce an argument as Wisconsin's, which prompted 14 Democrats to leave the state in an unsuccessful effort to kill that bill. ""If the Democrats flee here,"" Gardner said, ""we'll have to go to Canada.""","NEW: Alaska GOP lawmaker says his collective bargaining bill faces tough sledding .

"London (CNN) -- It's a scene straight out of Cinderella: a princess in her royal wedding dress, riding in a horse-drawn carriage through majestic streets. That's just what Kate Middleton may look like on her wedding day next month. Buckingham Palace announced Tuesday that a century-old gold-trimmed royal carriage will carry the new princess and her prince, William, from Westminster Abbey through central London to the palace. The same carriage -- called the 1902 State Landau -- has carried previous royal brides on their wedding days. William's mother, Lady Diana Spencer, rode in it in 1981 after her marriage to Prince Charles, and Sarah Ferguson traveled in it five years later after she wed Prince Andrew. It was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 to be used at his coronation, and it remains the most-used carriage in the Royal Mews, usually used these days by Queen Elizabeth II when she meets foreign heads of state. It is an open-top carriage, so if it rains, the new royal couple will instead travel in the enclosed Glass Coach, another historic carriage, the palace announced. The Glass Coach was built in 1881 and purchased for use at King George V's coronation in 1911. Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson used it on their way to their weddings, along with three other brides: Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who married the future King George VI in 1923; Princess Alexandra in 1963; and Princess Anne in 1973. The wedding procession will take in some of central London's most famous sights. After leaving the abbey, it will pass the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben, the prime minister's residence at Downing Street, the Horse Guards Parade and the Mall: the long avenue that stretches from Trafalgar Square past St. James's Park, straight to Buckingham Palace. As they make their way to the palace for their wedding reception, Middleton and William will be at the head of a five-carriage procession. Riding in the two carriages behind them will be the best man, William's brother, Prince Harry; the maid of honor, Middleton's sister, Philippa; and the bridesmaids. The queen and her husband will travel in the next carriage, with Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, and Middleton's parents riding together in the last. Eighteen horses will pull the five carriages, with the white-looking Windsor Greys, which are usually reserved for the queen, pulling the newlyweds. The carriages are maintained by Senior Carriage Restorer Martin Oates, whose family has been working in the mews for four generations. Like everyone working in the palace, Martin has his own particular concern: ""If the wheels fall off, then obviously I would lose my job, so that is a bit of a worry,"" he said. Martin's key task on the big day will be ""chocking,"" which means fixing blocks of wood under the carriage wheels, so they don't move as the passengers get in. As beautiful as they are, state carriages aren't always an easy way for passengers to travel. As the carriages move along, they swing around in a circular motion, which can make passengers feel queasy. Between now and the wedding, however, Middleton will have a chance to get used to the feeling -- and, crucially, to practice getting in and out. ""I think she will wish to practice getting in and out of the carriages, because obviously, on the day, she will be wearing a dress with a large train,"" Crown Equerry Toby Browne said. ""And it's a quite difficult event to get into a carriage and get settled so it looks perfect, but I think she's very excited about it."" Middleton will take a more modern mode of transport to the abbey before the service, the palace announced. In fact, she plans to travel in the same Rolls-Royce used by Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, when they were attacked by protesters in London in December, Buckingham Palace said. ""Rolls Royce 1,"" which has glass in the back panels, is currently being repaired in readiness for for the April 29 wedding. ""It's actually designed with visibility in mind, so you actually probably get a better view in the Rolls-Royce that she's using than a closed carriage,"" Palace Transport Manager Alexander Garty said. In December, students protesting increases in university costs hit the car with paint and cracked a window, as Charles and Camilla rode through a crowd en route to a show in central London. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","The carriage was built in 1902 for King Edward VII's coronation .

"(CNN) -- Teenage striker Neymar showed why some of Europe's biggest clubs are hot on his trail as he scored both goals in Brazil's 2-0 friendly international win over Scotland at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium on Sunday. The 19-year-old Santos star is reported to be a transfer target for both Real Madrid and Chelsea when the season finishes and his display against the Scots will have only further enhanced his reputation. Neymar has now scored three times in three appearances for his country as Brazil got back to winning form after recent defeats by both France and Argentina. Brazil were always in control against a side that had never beaten them in nine previous meetings and they took the lead three minutes before half-time. Andre Santos played a superb cross in from the left for Neymar, who was given too much space in the area before curling a low shot into the corner of the net. And it was Neymar who secured the victory in the 77th minute, scoring from the penalty spot after he had been fouled in the area by Charlie Adam. Meanwhile, the United States and Argentina shared a 1-1 draw in their friendly match at New Meadowlands Stadium, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets. Esteban Cambiasso put Argentina ahead in the 42nd minute from close range after goalkeeper Tim Howard had saved Angel Di Maria's initial shot. But the home side rallied and levelled on the hour mark when teenage substitute Juan Agudelo fired home after Argentina failed to deal with Landon Donovan's corner.","Brazil defeat Scotland 2-0 in their friendly international at Emirates Stadium .

"Nouakchott, Mauritania (CNN) -- A man convicted in the 2009 murder of American teacher Christopher Leggett has been sentenced to death, the Mauritanian Information Agency announced. The criminal court in the capital, Nouakchott, made the ruling late Tuesday against Mohamed Abdallahi Ould Mohamed Salem Ould Ahmednah, the agency said.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Eight journalists were wounded Tuesday in an attack at a police school in Abdiasis district of northern Mogadishu, the National Union of Somali Journalists said in a news release. The victims were covering a news conference held by a spokesman for Al Shabaab in the training facility at a base that had been taken over Monday by the al Qaeda-linked group, it said. Four of the wounded journalists have been identified as: Muse Mohamoud Jisow, Ilyas Ahmed Abukar, Abdinasir Idle, and Abdirisak Elmi Jama, the news release said. ""A big artillery shell hit a nearby building as we were being taken to new areas where Al Shabaab took control in north Mogadishu,"" journalist Abdirisak Black told CNN. The blast ""rocked everything, including us,"" showering the journalists with shattered glass, said the television journalist based in Mogadishu. The shelling continued for at least an hour, said Black, who said he sustained a minor shrapnel wound. ""I always knew that it is too risky to go out and do your job in Mogadishu as a journalist, but today was one of the most dangerous days in my life,"" he said. The journalists' union said that one of the victims said that the bombers knew that a news conference was taking place at the time. NUSOJ said it ""condemned the attack as a wasteful and cowardly act that only targets the harmless journalists who are only armed with pens and cameras and notebooks."" The organization called on all parties in the conflict in Mogadishu to cease hostilities and to desist from taking their conflict to journalists and unarmed civilians. ""Warring sides have made it their habit to bombard or attack places with a congregation of journalists ostensibly to eliminate their enemy's claims of political gains,"" said Omar Faruk Osman, NUSOJ secretary-general. ""But we must remind them of their responsibility to protect journalists and civilians. Once they commit such otherwise avoidable atrocities they then take their war to the people."" Al Shabaab means ""the youth,"" but observers say it is too far-reaching to be just a rabble of youngsters. It controls much of central and southern Somalia and large parts of the capital, Mogadishu. And after years of pledging allegiance to al Qaeda, Al Shabaab formalized the relationship in February. Since then, the Somali government says there's been an influx of foreign fighters. Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed leads the weak, U.N.-backed Transitional Federal Government (TFG). Ahmed was once a senior, moderate figure in the Union of Islamic Courts -- an alliance that included Al Shabaab and held power in Somalia for six months in 2006 before being overthrown by Ethiopian forces. The Ethiopians remained until early 2009 when the TFG took tentative control, clinging to a small part of Mogadishu, and protected by African Union (AU) peacekeepers mainly from Uganda and Burundi. Al Shabaab has reached out to Somalis living in the West, radicalizing young Muslims via the Internet and encouraging them to move back to the country to join the jihad.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy warship and helicopters are trailing a boat believed to be the one that was hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend, a senior military source with knowledge of the operation told CNN. Four Americans were manning the boat. Pirates boarded the American yacht off the coast of Oman last Friday, three days after the boat's owners split off from the relative safety of a sailing group traversing a dangerous section of the Indian Ocean, according to the group, the Blue Water Rally. Owners Jean and Scott Adam and two others, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle, were aboard the yacht, the S/V Quest. U.S. officials have made no further comment on the situation since Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette, deputy commander of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, said Saturday that the government is evaluating its options. The Adams are experienced boaters, having started a world tour in 2004, and were very much conscious of the threat from pirates, said a friend of the Adams, fellow boater Scott Stolnitz. Scott Adam said several weeks ago that he was concerned about pirate activity in the area, which he had never visited before, Stolnitz said. But he said Adam was determined to traverse the world himself as opposed to shipping the boat -- as some other yacht owners have done.","Four Americans had their yacht overtaken by pirates on Friday .

"(CNN)  -- Islamist militants in Somalia have warned a United Nations agency to buy food from Somali farmers or stop sending aid to the impoverished African country. ""WFP [World Food Programme] causes many problems for the local Somali farmers by importing food from outside Somalia and that discourages the Somali farmers,"" al-Shabaab said in a statement. ""So the WFP should buy its supposed food distribution from Somali farmers or stop its operations in Somalia."" The militia also warned local Somali contractors who help distribute WFP food aid to stop helping the U.N. agency by January 1. The warning could be a desperate measure by al-Shabaab, which is reportedly facing financial difficulties following the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces last year. The Ethiopian invasion of Somalia had outraged many members of the Somali diaspora who had sent money to al-Shabaab, which had vowed to kick out the invading forces. Al-Shabaab has now waged a bloody insurgency against the U.N.-backed government of transitional President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. The WFP is aware of the report, according to a spokesman for the agency who would not say whether WFP was in touch with al-Shabaab. ""WFP is working in Somalia because the country cannot currently support the food needs of its population,"" Greg Barrow told CNN. Somalia is in the middle of the worst humanitarian crisis since the famine of the early 1990s, with half of its population -- nearly 4 million people -- in need of food aid, according to the WFP. Somalia is also one of the most dangerous places in the world: four WFP staff members were killed between August 2008 and January 2009. Nevertheless, the aid agency said it increased its operations during the first half of this year, providing assistance to nearly 3 million people.

"Palau, Mexico (CNN) -- Fermin was a mechanic, not a coal miner, but on the morning of February 19, 2006 he had to go down into the Pasta de Conchos mine near here to fix a broken cart that couldn't haul the coal out. Five years later, Fermin's remains are still more than 100 meters (109 yards) below the ground, together with dozens of miners who worked that night. Daniel Ezquiel, Fermin's only son, doesn't remember his father. He was just 1 year old when ""the mine swallowed the miners."" So that he won't forget, his mother, Maria de Lourdes, sets aside part of her widow's pension -- 2,200 pesos a month -- to buy any newspaper that publishes something about the incident. She cuts articles and photos, and pastes them in an album. That Sunday, just past 2:30 a.m., an explosion left 65 miners buried who were working inside the Pasta de Conchos mine, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, in northern Mexico. The mine is owned by Grupo Mexico, one of the largest mining companies in the country. Then-President Vicente Fox never visited the relatives mourning at the mine site. President Felipe Calderon has also avoided meeting with the more than 300 family members. After five years, the relatives and about five widows continue asking for the bodies to be retrieved from the mine. Citing dangerous conditions, the company abandoned the attempts to pull them out. Maria de Lourdes says that a year and a half ago, she stopped receiving the 420 pesos the-ex governor of Coahuila sent so that the children of the miners could continue studying. She sells baby clothing to complement her income and keep her son in school. She doesn't want Daniel Ezequiel to be a coal miner. There are several versions about the cause of the incident that killed the workers. Grupo Mexico says that there was an explosion caused by a ball of gas -- gas that escapes from the earth at the moment of the coal extraction -- and that as a consequence, the temperature in the mine rose to more than 900 degrees Celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit). However, according to the autopsies of the only two bodies that were pulled from the mine, their deaths were caused by asphyxiation, not burns. Those two bodies were located in the ninth diagonal tunnel in the mine. Grupo Mexico says it went nearly 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) into the mine, but hadn't found the other remains. In February 2007, the Coahuila state government produced 65 death certificates certified by a medical examiner, even though only two bodies had been recovered. With 63 bodies still underground, Grupo Mexico decided to suspend the rescue of the bodies in April 2007. At that time, the company argued that according to their investigations, 25% to 75% of the mine was flooded and ""the water possibly is contaminated by HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, that could contaminate the rescuers, their families and entire populations."" These findings were given to the Pasta de Conchos Family Organization, which has advised the victims' relatives. Inspection records from a few months before the blast revealed that the ventilation system was failing and that there were problems with the electrical equipment. Some family members say the workers complained of a strong odor of gas. Through a spokesman, Grupo Mexico declined to speak about the incident, citing internal policies. Cristina Auerbach, lawyer for the victims' relatives in the Pasta de Conchos Family Organization, said that explosions in the regions' mines had been recorded since 1889. Even then, the only times that bodies were left inside the mine were 1889 and 2006. In the rest of the cases, the bodies were always recovered, alive or dead. Auerbach recalled one of the biggest blasts that happened in 1969 in the town of Barroteran. In the Guadalupe mines, more than 160 people died. A little over a year later, all the bodies were recovered. ""The question isn't whether Chile could and Mexico couldn't, because the answer that they will give is that it was different because that mine was mineral and this one was coal, and this one had gas and that one didn't. What you can compare is the government's attitude,"" she said. ""Neither Vicente Fox nor Felipe Calderon has wanted to meet the families. Not only that, but in coal mining region, the bodies are always rescued. Only at Pasta de Conchos they are not."" In northeast Coahuila, it's common to find someone who has a miner in the family. Walking down the streets of towns like Nueva Rosita, Palau, San Juan Sabinas and Muzquiz, you can see trucks full of freshly mined coal at all hours. At the end of each shift -- around 3 p.m., 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. -- trucks pass by with men whose faces are painted black by the carbon dust that fell on them during their 12 hours of work. Nearly all the coal in Mexico is produced in Coahuila, according to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Information. Raul Villasana, retired at age 67, also was a miner. He worked for more than 20 years in Grupo Mexico's mines. One of his sons remains inside Pasta de Conchos. He and his wife Trinidad have traveled several times to Mexico City to participate in demonstrations in front of Grupo Mexico and the Labor Ministry to plead for the excavation of their son. ""We were recently at the Interior Ministry in November and what I asked for was my son's rescue. I have asked for that since the beginning. Because the mine is not a cemetery, right? It's for people to work in,"" he said. ""What we are asking the company and the government to do is to give the bodies to us, so we can do a holy burial and take him flowers, go see him, go visit him with his daughters, wife, sister, who also have asked for this."" Villasana's son left behind a son and two daughters. The widow decided to invest the 750,000 pesos that the family received from the company to set up a used clothes business that she supplies from the United States. Maria de Lourdes, Fermin's widow, knows the mining life well. Her father, Arsenio, was also a miner. He mined black gold from Pasta de Conchos. He retired several years before the blast. Five years after the tragedy, she says some rescuers have dared to confess that at night they heard ""noises like pickaxes striking on metal."" Arsenio thinks those were the sounds of the last surviving miners. ""Though after all that time there is no way that they could come out alive,"" he stated. For residents like Villasana and Arsenio, Pasta de Conchos turned from a mine into a cemetery the morning of February 19. 2006.","5 years ago, explosion buried 65 coal miners .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- At least four rockets slammed into Israel Wednesday, injuring one man and prompting retaliatory Israeli airstrikes that wounded two Palestinian militants, one critically, sources said. The strikes and counterstrikes mark the latest phase in an unusually intense round of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. At least 10 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday, including two children, and though both sides say they do not want the violence to escalate, Wednesday's attacks show it does not seem to be abating. The Israeli man hurt Wednesday was injured in one of two rocket strikes on Beer Sheva, an Israeli army spokeswoman said. The Israel  Defense Forces struck back at a rocket launching site in northern Gaza associated with one of the other attacks Wednesday. Two militants were injured, one critically, Palestinian medical officials and Hamas sources said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would ""protect our citizens rigorously and determinedly. No country would put up with continuing rocket fire on its cities and civilians, and of course Israel will not put up with that."" ""We are very determined to hit the terrorists and prevent them from harming our citizens,"" he added. The violence comes after four Palestinian militants were killed Tuesday evening in an Israeli airstrike in the Zeitoun neighborhood east of Gaza City. Islamic Jihad said all four militants were field commanders for Islamic Jihad. An Israeli army spokeswoman said that an Israeli military aircraft fired toward the group after identifying a group of militants who were preparing to launch a rocket into Israel. In an earlier incident Tuesday, two adults and two children were killed in the Al-Shajaieh neighborhood east of Gaza City when shells from Israeli tanks hit a house there, the sources said. The children, 11-year-old Mohammed Jihad Al-Hilo and 16-year-old Yasser Ahed Al-Hilo, were playing soccer outside their house when the shells hit, the sources said. Yasser Hamed Al-Hilo, 50, and Mohamad Saber Harara, 20, were also killed, according to the sources. Eight others were wounded, three of them critically, they said. The IDF said the mortar attack was carried out in response to the launch from Gaza of four military-use projectiles into the Shaar Hanegev regional council area. ""It appears that uninvolved civilians were injured as a result,"" the IDF said. The incident was under investigation by the IDF. ""The IDF does not want an escalation of violence in the South,"" an IDF spokesman said. In a statement, Netanyahu expressed regret over the deaths and injuries of Gaza civilians in Tuesday's Israeli military action and said the strikes were carried out in response to Hamas attacks on Israeli citizens. ""It's unfortunate that Hamas continues to intentionally rain down dozens of rockets on Israeli civilians using its own civilians as shields,"" he said. ""Israel has no intention of bringing about a deterioration of the situation, but at the same time the IDF will continue to act decisively to protect Israeli citizens."" Hamas condemned the killings east of Gaza City. ""The massacre in Al-Shajaieh neighborhood is a war crime and the Israeli occupation bears full responsibility,"" it said in a statement. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad also condemned what he called ""the Israeli aggression against the civilians"" and asked for international protection of civilians. He called the military shelling of residential neighborhoods a ""dangerous escalation that should be ended."" Since Saturday, 10 Palestinians have been killed and at least 37 others wounded in a series of incidents in Gaza, Palestinian medical sources said. Also since Saturday, 61 mortars and rockets have been fired into southern Israel, the IDF said. CNN's Michal Zippori, Kareem Khadder and Talal Abu Rahma contributed to this report.","NEW: Netanyahu says no country would put up with rocket attacks on its citizens .

"London (CNN) -- British Airways cabin crew members voted overwhelmingly Friday to go on strike -- again. Nearly 79 percent of crew members, who are represented by the union Unite, backed the move. They did not indicate when the strike would occur. BA's cabin crew employees, embroiled in an ongoing wage dispute, have now voted to go on strike four times in the past 13 months, according to Len McCluskey, the incoming union chief. ""Surely BA management must now wake up and listen to the voice of its skilled and dedicated employees,"" McCluskey said. ""This dispute will be resolved by negotiation, not litigation or confrontation, and it is to negotiation that BA management should now apply itself. We are ready."" BA released a statement noting that only 43 percent of its 13,500 crew members had backed a new strike. The statement also claimed Unite has lost 2,500 crew members since the pay dispute started. ""We urge Unite to return to the deal we negotiated, which guarantees pay rises for the next two years and secures terms and conditions for our existing crew that are the best in the UK industry,"" the statement read. ""This U-turn reflected the union's deep-seated internal divisions (and its) dysfunctional relationship with its crew branch. ...

"(CNN) -- In Futaba, Japan, the threat of death by radiation poisoning is not enough to compel some residents to obey the Japanese government's order to leave their homes. Futaba is within the 12-mile evacuation zone surrounding the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant where crews are struggling to contain radiation spilling out of the facility -- a disaster created by a March 11 earthquake-triggered tsunami. The nuclear accident has turned Futaba into a ghost town, almost. Trains no longer run to this northern Japan farming community. The clean-up of the damage wrought by the earthquake has not started and the only people on the streets are members of Japan's self-defense forces, all dressed head to toe in protective clothing. However, government forces conducting house-by-house searches have found people who refuse to get out of Futaba. Some say they are too sick or old to leave their homes. Others say they stayed behind, or managed to return, to feed their animals. ""We've come to help you go to the evacuation center,"" a security forces officer told one woman during a recent visit to her home. ""No, no, we cannot go,"" the woman replied. The woman said she couldn't leave because her husband suffers from Alzheimer's disease and has a bad leg that renders him unable to get out of bed. When the officer told the woman her daughter is worried about her, the woman still refused to obey the evacuation order. A security forces member told CNN that two days after the visit, they managed to persuade the woman to leave Futaba with her husband. ""We are explaining how serious the situation is to people, because radiation is something you can't see with your eyes,"" said Kei Higuchi, a representative of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. ""However, some of those who remain in the danger zone, find adapting to a new environment even more challenging,"" Higuchi said, ""so they want to stay at home."" Stubborn residents aren't the only problem complicating the evacuation, according to security forces. Earthquake damage to roads has made it difficult to travel through the area. Nevertheless, government officials remain adamant that residents who live within 12 miles of the Fukushima plant must leave. ""We would like to request once again that residents stay away because it's a very risky area with contamination, Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. ""We urge residents not to return to the 20 kilometer (12 mile) radius area."" U.S. government guidelines call for residents who live more twice as far from the Fukushima plant to leave the area.","Some Japanese residents in the evacuation zone are refusing to leave .

"(CNN) -- A Pakistani provincial court ruled Thursday that Raymond Davis, the CIA contractor accused of killing two Pakistani men, does not have diplomatic immunity. The court in Lahore was responding to a personal application that Davis filed last week asking that he be released from jail because he has diplomatic immunity. The court said Davis didn't enjoy diplomatic immunity because neither he nor the Pakistani government provided documents proving that he was a diplomat, according to Asad Manzoor Butt, a defense lawyer for the shooting victims. Davis has yet to be formally charged in the case. On March 14, the Lahore High Court will take up the matter again when the federal government will submit its opinion on whether Davis enjoys immunity. On Thursday, the provincial court had been expected to read out charges against Davis. However, lawyers for the American told the court that they had not yet received all documents of alleged evidence against Davis. The court adjourned the case until Tuesday when additional documents will be provided to Davis' legal team. The case has strained relations between the United States and Pakistan, a key ally in the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan, and the shooting deaths have outraged many Pakistanis. Davis has said the January 27 shooting occurred after two men attacked him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, according to the U.S. Embassy. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation.

"London, England (CNN) -- A British judge opened a detailed investigation Monday into the killing of 52 people in suicide bombings on London underground trains and a bus on July 7, 2005. Justice Heather Hallett is probing whether the secret service or police could have prevented the attacks, which were carried out by British-born bombers backed by al Qaeda. It's not clear whether MI5 officials will testify in public or in private. Hallett said Monday she had not decided whether it was within her powers or in the interests of justice to hold closed-door hearings. Five potential witnesses have requested anonymity, she said. She is expected to spend about six months on the investigation, which will also examine the emergency services' response to the blasts that threw London into chaos during the morning rush hour. She will probe whether emergency responders were influenced by the fear of secondary explosions, and sophisticated computer models will show what injuries victims would have suffered based on where they were sitting in relation to the bombs. The investigation will hear from relatives of the victims, survivors, London Underground staff, police, and emergency services personnel. The probe -- known formally as a coroner's inquest -- follows criminal and parliamentary investigations, and could not begin until the police investigation was complete. Two of the bombers, including ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan, were trailed by security services for a year before the attacks, according to a report released last year by the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC). Entitled ""Could 7/7 have been prevented?"" the report said that domestic intelligence service MI5 considered Khan a ""small time fraudster"" and ""minor criminal"" and did not link him to potential attacks within the U.K. at that time. John Reid, the home secretary at the time of the attacks, said the four bombers -- three British males of Pakistani descent and a Jamaican-born man -- were young ""radicalized"" Muslims whose motivation was ""fierce antagonism to perceived injustices by the West against Muslims"" and a desire to become martyrs. CNN's Andrew Carey contributed to this report.","The inquiry will look into the emergency services' response .

"(CNN) -- Afghanistan is seeing higher levels of violence this year than last year at this time, with 20% more civilians killed and the number of ""security incidents"" up by 66%, the United Nations says in a new report. The number of civilians killed by the United States and its allies was lower, but insurgent attacks are significantly higher, meaning the overall number of civilian deaths is up. More than 2,400 civilians were killed, and more than 3,800 injured in the first 10 months of this year, the report says. More than three out of four of the casualties were caused by ""anti-government elements,"" it says. That's a 25 percent increase on last year, it said. Deaths caused by U.S. troops and their allies were down 18 percent. ""Assassinations"" of civilians and police reached ""unprecedented numbers"" in August, and there were an average of three suicide attacks per week, the U.N. said in its quarterly report. The United Nations report, which was finalized December 10, also tracked widespread kidnapping of aid workers. A total of 134 were abducted between June and the end of October, the U.N. said. Most were freed quickly, but one Afghan was killed by his captors, the world body said. A British aid worker was also killed this year by U.S. special forces trying to rescue her from kidnappers. Linda Norgrove, 36, was killed by an American grenade thrown by a rescuer who did not realize she was there. U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who was the top international military commander in Afghanistan until he was fired in June, urged his troops to avoid civilian casualties in order to avoid making enemies of the population. ""It is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties,"" McChrystal said in December 2009. ""We can always target enemy leaders later. We can't make up for the fact that we killed civilians."" But there continued to be high-profile incidents, including one where 23 civilians were killed in a NATO airstrike in February. McChrystal personally apologized to Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai for those killings and ordered an investigation. It concluded that troops needed more training. McChrystal's dismissal was not related to the incident. He was fired over disrespectful comments his inner circle made about top White House officials in a profile of the general in Rolling Stone magazine. The United Nations report was prepared for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.","NEW: Three out of four civilians casualties are caused by insurgents .

"(CNN) -- A powerful family accused in what is considered the worst politically motivated killings in recent Philippine history has committed many other atrocities with impunity over two decades, a human rights group says. The Ampatuan family and its forces are ""one of the most powerful and abusive state-backed militias in the Philippines,"" says a new 96-page report released by Human Rights Watch, called ""They Own the People."" The family's ""many abuses"" include ""more than 50 incidences of killings, torture, sexual assault, and abductions and disappearances,"" according to the report. The executive secretary in the administration of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo categorically denied the allegations leveled in the report, saying that the administration's ""earnestness to promote, protect and fulfill human rights has always been clear, and not even the unceasing efforts of critics, including ill-prepared reports, will diminish or discredit it."" Andal Ampatuan Jr. -- former mayor of Maguindanao province and the son of a former provincial governor -- is now on trial, accused of being the ringleader in the political massacre in Maguindanao. Ampatuan and his family have denied wrongdoing. Dozens of people in a convoy were ambushed on November 23, 2009, and their bodies were buried in a mass grave. The wife and sister of a political rival of Ampatuan's and 30 journalists were among the victims. There are 196 accused, about 500 witnesses and more than 11,000 murder charges involved in the massacre case, which is expected to take years. ""In addition to the 58 killed in the Maguindanao massacre, the family is implicated over the years in the killing of at least 56 people, including relatives of opposition politicians, landowners who resisted forced acquisition of their property, eyewitnesses to Ampatuan crimes, including their own militia members, and even children,"" the rights group's report says. Human Rights Watch said it interviewed approximately 50 victims of abuses, their family members and friends, and witnesses, in producing the report. ""Despite an initial flurry of activity after the November 23 killings, including some arrests, 126 suspects remain at large and the government's prosecution remains woefully slow and limited,"" the report says. ""Senior police and military officers who failed to act upon knowledge of Ampatuan crimes have not been investigated; investigations into the source of the family's weapons have lacked transparency and independence; and the national institutions responsible for accountability -- the Justice Department, the Ombudsman's Office, and the Commission on Human Rights -- have done nothing significant to address the situation."" ""One year after the Maguindanao massacre, the Ampatuans remain a powerful and dangerous force with which to be reckoned. For more than two decades, the Ampatuans operated unchecked by the national police, the military, and the Department of Justice, which have not only failed to seriously investigate crimes allegedly committed by the family's militia, but have even armed and worked alongside its members."" In the Human Rights Watch report, authorities appeared stymied. ""What can we do? This is an influential family,"" a police officer told the rights group. The Philippine government did not immediately respond to CNN's phone and e-mail requests for comment, but a spokesman for the administration of President Benigno Aquino sent a text message to The New York Times. ""We're working on it. The Ampatuan case is being tried, the prosecution is serious. We're quietly laying the groundwork for dismantling private armies, but some cases are harder to fix than others,"" wrote spokesman Ricky Carandang, according to the Times. Also, General Eduardo Ermita, the former executive secretary of the Arroyo administration, disputed the report's contention that his government was slow to prosecute the perpetrators. ""Within days, more than a hundred people were apprehended and charged, including members of the Ampatuan family, not even sparing the patriarch Andal Sr. and his sons Andal Jr. and Zaldy who has since been relieved as ARMM governor. And the trial goes on to this day."" He also challenged Human Rights Watch to present evidence to back the allegation that the military armed the Ampatuans. ""For all intents and purposes, this allegation must be addressed if only to spare the armed forces from being unnecessarily suspected of wrong-doing, better yet to come their self-defense,"" he said. The 2009 political massacre shocked people even in a country that is familiar with election violence. The trial of Ampatuan Jr. and his alleged accomplices has been delayed repeatedly, most recently because of a defense request for more preparation time. The delays have prompted outcries against the political influence of the Ampatuan family. They have ruled Maguindanao for two decades. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","The Ampatuan family is implicated in a 2009 political massacre .

"Rikuzen-Takata, Japan (CNN) -- At a hospital in northeastern Japan, the remnants of lives stolen in seconds are scattered on each of its four floors. Metal beds are bent, I-V bags are filled with muddy water, and blood pressure monitors sit underneath splintered trees. But Takata Hospital nurse Fumiko Suzuki doesn't just see the damage, she hears the haunted screams of the patients she could not save. ""The patients couldn't walk,"" said Suzuki, recalling the moment the tsunami hit. ""I heard someone screaming, 'Auntie, I can't save you. I'm sorry.' Then she ran out of the room."" Suzuki said a glance out of the window revealed a wave as high as the fourth floor. The nurse said she told the patient ""I'm sorry"" as she raced up the stairs. ""If I tried to save this person who was lying on the bed, I would have lost my life as well,"" she said. Suzuki pauses, grief etched on her face. ""It is the biggest regret I have,"" she said of leaving patients behind. The tsunami following the 9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11 engulfed every floor of the hospital just as Suzuki stepped onto the roof. At least 10,901 were killed nationwide. Of the 51 patients hospitalized, doctors and nurses could not move 12 and they drowned in their beds, said Mikihito Ishiki, a medical director at the hospital. One patient died as the hospital staff moved him to the roof while two more died on the frigid roof awaiting rescue. ""Ten of my staff also died with the patients,"" Ishiki said. The doctor lost his staff, his patients and the hospital he proudly called his home. His wife remains missing and is presumed dead. As soon as rescuers plucked the doctor from the engulfed building, he started working from a makeshift clinic on higher ground. The doctor's composure cracks as he lifts a handwritten note from a satellite phone sitting in his clinic. ""Yokosawa is helping us from heaven,"" he reads, referring to a 60-year-old hospital administrator, Shigeru Yokosawa, set to retire in April. After the tsunami warning, Ishiki asked Yokosawa to find the satellite phone on the first floor of the hospital. Satellite phones are vital lines of communication after a natural disaster because phone lines are usually knocked out. Yokosawa got the phone and moments before a massive wave swallowed him, tossed it to a colleague, who ran to the roof. Seconds later, the tsunami engulfed the hospital. His sacrifice is part of the reason Ishiki won't leave this clinic, now fully operational and treating patients across Rikuzen-Takata. His fellow survivors tirelesslesly work along him. Suzuki, who brought her elderly and sick mother to the clinic, said the doctors and nurses can't feel guilty for surviving the disaster. ""When I hear that,"" she said, ""it breaks my heart. It's a natural disaster. They want to save everyone, but in this situation, they can't."" Suzuki said she is grateful to see familiar faces of her colleagues, and hope they realize they are making a difference in the present. She pushes her pain -- the loss of her home, her friends and her relatives -- to the back of her mind as she focuses on her patients. The town has given her not just a refuge from the pain, but donations of clothes for days she's not wearing her nurse uniform. ""Whatever the situation, I will stay here. Talking with the patients will be my cure. I feel like I'm not the one taking care of others, but the one being taken care of,"" she said.","Doctors, nurses focus on caring for patients despite their losses .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's military dissolved the country's Parliament and suspended its constitution Sunday following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak, telling Egyptians it would be in charge for six months or until elections can be held. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said it would appoint a committee to propose changes to the Constitution, which would then be submitted to voters. The council will have the power to issue new laws during the transition period, according to a communique read on state television. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that the generals have made restoring security and reviving the economy its top priorities. ""This current composition is basically a technocratic government to run the day-to-day affairs, to take care of the security void that has happened, and to also address the issues related to the economy,"" Shoukry told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" However, a leading opposition figure said Sunday that the military must explain its plans in more detail or see a resumption of the demonstrations that drove Mubarak from office. ""They need to come out of their headquarters and start talking to the people and tell us what is in store for us,"" ElBaradei told GPS. And a prominent Egyptian activist credited with helping spark the revolution warned against taking too long to establish a new representative government. ""Biggest mistake now is to give the Egyptian people too little too slow. Restoring confidence requires a faster pace,"" Wael Ghonim said on Twitter. Mubarak stepped down Friday after 18 days of protests against his nearly 30-year rule and is now in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The longtime president was himself a product of the military establishment that has ruled Egypt since the 1950s, but his abdication leaves a council of generals led by Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi in charge of the Arab world's most populous nation. Sunday's military communique said new elections would be held for both houses of Egypt's Parliament as well as the presidency. Protesters had blasted the November parliamentary elections as fraudulent, and calls for their annulment were among the major demands before Mubarak's ouster. In the meantime, government ministers are now reporting to the military high command in the same way they reported to Mubarak, Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq told reporters Sunday, in remarks that were carried live on state television. He said he was reviewing candidates to fill vacant government ministries, adding that no one who was not acceptable to the public would be appointed. Sunday marked the first workday since Mubarak's ouster. For the first time since the uprising began January 25, traffic flowed freely around Tahrir Square -- the epicenter of the protests -- and the majority of shops around the square were open. Some protesters remained in the square Sunday, vowing to keep protesting until Egypt is under civilian rule. The Egyptian junta now has to grapple with the economic problems that fueled the revolt, including massive youth unemployment and economic underdevelopment. The demonstrations virtually shut down Egypt's economy, costing it vital tourism dollars as well. New protests at the headquarters of the National Bank of Egypt appear to have forced the ouster of that institution's chairman, Tarek Amer, and two top deputies, who submitted their resignations on Sunday, according to an e-mail shared with CNN by a bank employee. The National Bank's headquarters in Cairo continued to function during Sunday's protests, with disgruntled staff taking turns to work and demonstrate. It was not clear whether the resignations have been accepted. However, Sunday evening, Egyptian state television announced banks would be shut down until Wednesday, and urged workers to consider the national interest. Bank workers complained that members of Mubarak's family put their allies into positions of power at the bank with grossly inflated salaries. Cairo's stock exchange will freeze transactions from former ministers and businessmen who are now under investigation when trading resumes Wednesday, the exchange's chairman, Khaled Serri Siyam, announced in a statement on the government-run website EgyNews. Outside the Interior Ministry, hundreds of disgruntled police officers demanding higher wages, shorter hours, better benefits and more respect faced off with Egyptian troops. The police officers currently earn 500 Egyptian pounds (about $85) a month -- a quarter of what army troops of comparable rank earn, they said -- and face imprisonment if they refuse to work unpaid overtime. Both low-ranking police officers and administrative staff joined in the protest. Mubarak's ouster came three weeks after a similar revolt toppled longtime Tunisian strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. And even as officials hash out the details of Egypt's murky political future, public demands for change have rippled throughout the region. In Yemen's capital Sanaa on Saturday, protesters chanted, ""Yesterday Tunisia, today Egypt -- tomorrow Yemen will open the prison."" And in restive Algeria, anti-government protesters chanted, ""Change the power"" on Saturday. Security forces clashed with the crowds Saturday in Algiers and detained roughly 100 protesters, according to the opposition Algerian League for Human Rights. Shoukry said it was a ""matter of pride"" for Egyptians that their revolution was ""organized and peaceful,"" adding, ""Egypt has always been a trend-setter in this region."" ""The region looks to us in many aspects, and I'm sure also in this regard, many lessons will be learned,"" he said.

"New York (CNN) -- Police say human remains found on a New York beach are not those of a missing woman whose search led authorities to the discovery of four dead prostitutes. ""The remains found off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach, on March 29 have been determined to not be those of Shannan Gilbert,"" Suffolk County police said in a statement Thursday. It is not clear to whom the remains belong. Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, was last seen alive on May 1. As authorities searched for clues about her disappearance last year, they uncovered the bodies of four women in various stages of decomposition. The bodies were stuffed into bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property on Long Island, New York. Police say they are ""continuing the investigation of the remains found on March 29 as well as the investigation of the deaths of four women found off Ocean Parkway in December 2010."" The four bodies were discovered on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach, ""which indicates they were dumped there by the same person or persons,"" Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said in December. ""It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location."" He said police could be dealing with a serial killer. The remains of the fifth body were found about a mile from where the other corpses were discovered, Dormer said. ""There may be clues available now with this body that will help the homicide investigation and will help it move forward,"" he added. The four bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine. All four of the women advertised for prostitution services on the Craigslist website, police said. At least one body could have been there for as long as two years, Dormer added.","Shannan Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, was last seen alive on May 1 .

"London (CNN) -- Prince William and Kate Middleton will go on a royal tour of Canada in June and July, his office announced Wednesday. It will be the first official foreign trip for the couple after they marry in April. They will visit Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and the National Capital Region between June 30 and July 8, Clarence House said. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had extended the invitation for the tour upon hearing of the couple's engagement. ""Canada is delighted that Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton will be travelling to Canada as they embark on their first overseas tour as a married couple. "" Harper said. ""Canada looks forward to welcoming the young couple this summer and providing them with all that our country has to offer -- including, of course, the special hospitality and warmth reserved for members of the Royal Family."" Canada is seen as a safe bet for a royal debut as a married couple. Queen Elizabeth II, William's grandmother, remarked on her trip to Canada last year that for the royals, the country is a ""home away from home."" William is second in line to the British throne. The timing of the visit means they will not be attending the wedding of Prince Albert of Monaco on July 2.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Kepler Meo isn't nervous. As befits a singer playing a principal role in a major opera production, he suffers the last-minute adjustments to makeup, hair and wardrobe. Then finally he is left alone to prepare for this night's performance of Benjamin Britten's ""The Turn of the Screw."" Alone except for his mother. Michael Kepler Meo is just 12 years old. ""It's really fun to sing,"" the 'tween confides, as he runs through a series of scales and brief snatches of the music that he will soon be performing on stage. His voice is high, crisp and crystal clear. A boy soprano. And behind the voice is a power and control that seem almost alien in one so young. Los Angeles Opera Music Director James Conlon briefly peeks into the dressing room to wish young Meo good luck. ""Places please..."" echoes through the dressing rooms and sends Meo scurrying through a maze of backstage cables to the massive turntable stage that will soon deliver him to the spotlight. Michael's professional singing career began just a couple of years ago. He had been singing in a boys' choir in his native Portland, Oregon. It was one activity among many along with soccer and learning guitar. The Portland Opera company was holding auditions for ""The Turn of the Screw"" and Michael's choirmaster suggested he give it a try. ""I had a very vague idea even what opera was,"" Michael remembers, ""All I got was the version I got in school of the fat lady singing."" Michael won the role of Miles, a troubled boy threatened by menacing ghosts in a rambling English country home. It is a pivotal role in the production. He also starred in the premier performance of ""The Golden Ticket,"" an operatic version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Conlon says only a handful of boys are capable of taking on operatic roles. ""You have to find somebody whose voice is strong enough, and somebody who can sing at all levels with a very focused tone. And Michael fits all of those characteristics."" ""He was always making goofy noises all the time, from the time he was a toddler,"" says Michael's mother, Trudy Meo. Meo says she isn't sure where Michael came by his musical talent. ""I'm not musical at all,"" she says, ""When he sings I'm almost useless in helping him."" An opera career has meant occasional separations from the rest of his family, as Michael and his mom travel the opera circuit. ""I don't have too much contact with kids my age,"" Michael says. ""I'm always working with adults ... I miss that a little. But I think it's worth it."" Michael works hard in rehearsals, enjoys the performances and loves the applause. ""He is lucky that he found something that he is so good at at so young an age,"" says his mom. By almost any measure, Michael's rise in the world of opera has been meteoric. As soon as his role in ""The Turn of the Screw"" ends in Los Angeles, he's off to New York and a New York City Opera production of ""Séance on a Wet Afternoon."" But how long can it last? It won't be long before the boy soprano's voice changes. What then? It will be a challenge, but, ""It may be better,"" Michael says. ""In opera you can sing even if you are old."" And Michael is already thinking about a whole new world of roles he could sing as an adult.","Michael Kepler Meo, 12, performs pivotal role in ""The Turn of the Screw""

"(CNN) -- The athletic young man who arrived in Dr. Deepak Chopra's classroom last month for a course in leadership was impeccably dressed in a hunting jacket, polite and unassuming. ""He said he was in the investment business,"" the wellness guru told CNN in a telephone interview. ""He did not say, 'I'm from Libya.' He said, 'I'm from North Africa,' or words to that effect."" But Chopra knew who he was and where he was from. ""We had been informed by the State Department that he was going to be there, that he didn't want to use his official name and we should respect that. So, he introduced himself with his name, but he didn't use the name Gadhafi."" His name was Khamis, the 27-year-old scion of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi who was in the third week of an ""internship"" that took him across the country to hone his leadership skills. Asked to list his hobbies, Khamis Gaddhafi said, ""Adventure and horses."" Someone with knowledge of his program told CNN his 36-day planned internship began in Houston on January 21, when he was to meet with officials from AECOM, the global engineering and design company that sponsored the program. That weekend's options included a 236-mile flight to Hondo, Texas, for hunting at Lonesome Deer Ranch with a return flight arriving in Houston in time for dinner at Capital Grille, a high-end steakhouse. The next day's classes in leadership and program management were to be followed by a visit to the Johnson Space Center, a class in traffic and emergency management and a ""business dinner"" at Willie G's, a steakhouse and seafood place. The week included a visit to the Port of Houston. An official told CNN in a statement that it had granted a request to meet with Gadhafi during his internship associated with his pursuit of an MBA. ""During his visit, he toured several Port Authority facilities and received briefings on trade relations,"" the statement said. Visits with oil company and other business executives were scheduled around lunch at the Coronado Club, which describes itself as ""a bastion of strength and financial solidity in Houston's downtown business district."" On January 29, Gadhafi was scheduled to travel to Los Angeles, where he was to receive a VIP tour of Universal Studios, meet with Silicon Valley and other business leaders there and in San Francisco and then travel to the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Academy spokesman John Van Winkle told CNN that Gadhafi was given ""a standard tour"" during his visit on February 7. The next morning, he was slated to fly to Chicago for more training with AECOM lawyers on such topics as ""global contract management"" and ""foreign corrupt practices training."" It was in Chicago that he attended Chopra's three-day leadership class at the Kellogg School of Business. The author of ""The Soul of Leadership,"" who has advised CNN management, noted to the class the turmoil faced by then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ""We were analyzing in the class why Mubarak was going through this and why it would have a ripple effect. He (Gadhafi) was taking notes extensively."" Chopra added, ""I purposely didn't mention his dad because I thought it would be impolite."" After the class, when Gadhafi and a traveling companion, also from Libya, invited their teacher to visit Libya and meet Gadhafi's father, Chopra said he was tempted to accept. ""I said, 'Wow, these guys are really interested in spirituality.' "" Gadhafi next traveled to Washington, where he met with defense contractors, including representatives of Northrop Grumman. A spokesman for the company, Randy Belote, confirmed that the meetings took place. But, citing company policy, he would not comment on them. National War College spokesman Dave Thomas said Khamis Gadhafi visited there accompanied by a State Department representative, meeting with faculty and deans. Tactics were not discussed, though the ""structure of military education"" was, Thomas said. On February 16, a day after unrest erupted in his country, Gadhafi traveled to New York for more meetings and meals with business leaders. New York Stock Exchange spokesman Richard Adamonis confirmed that Gadhafi visited the exchange as part of a group on February 17. ""Neither he nor the group in question were part of a bell ring, simply a basic tour of the trading floor for the group,"" Adamonis said. But later that day, he cut short his internship -- missing out on a planned tour of West Point, his choice of the Broadway shows ""Mamma Mia"" or ""Jersey Boys"" and a final leg to Boston for meetings with professors at Harvard University. Instead, he returned to Libya to lead the 32nd Reinforced Brigade against rebel forces. On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the department had not approved any of the meetings. ""There was nothing, in fact, for the State Department to sign off on,"" he told reporters. ""This was a private i nternship. We were aware of his itinerary, but that was the extent of it. And our role was limited to meeting him upon his arrival at the airport, which is not unusual in these kinds of situations."" Paul Gennaro, the senior vice president and chief communications officer for AECOM, issued a statement saying, ""The educational internship, which consisted of publicly available information, was aligned with our efforts to improve quality of life, specifically in Libya, where we were advancing public infrastructure such as access to clean water; quality housing; safe and efficient roads and bridges; reliable and affordable energy; and related projects that create jobs and opportunity."" Gennaro said the company was ""shocked and outraged"" to learn of the young Libyan's role in his country's crisis. ""We were aware of the student's family relationship, but we were not informed of any military connection whatsoever,"" he said. It was the company's understanding that Khamis was an MBA student from a university in Spain, he said. Since 2008, AECOM has been involved in a multibillion-dollar initiative with Libya to modernize the country's infrastructure. The company withdrew its expatriate employees and their families from Libya this month. The joint project to train Libyan engineers to build and maintain homes, roads and water systems is on hold, he said. Vice Adm. William Gortney of the Joint Staff on Monday described the brigade led by Khamis Gadhafi as ""one of the most active in terms of attacking innocent people."" Libya's state TV on Monday night broadcast live footage from Gadhafi's Tripoli compound of the former intern dressed in uniform and greeting people. The world events soon changed Chopra's mind about visiting his former student in Libya. ""I believe he is killing people. I mean, it's bizarre. The whole thing is bizarre. After attending a course on consciousness, he goes and leads troops."" He added, ""Why was he in my course? I have no idea.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Angry members of Congress questioned top administration officials Wednesday on why they weren't asked to authorize President Barack Obama's decision to commit U.S. forces to the Libya military mission. The question dominated a classified briefing by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates for the U.S. House, according to House members who attended. A separate briefing for the Senate occured shortly afterward. Other issues raised by the legislators included whether the United States intended to arm the Libyan rebels, and the cost of the mission to U.S. taxpayers, participants told CNN. Clinton and Gates made clear that no decision had been made on arming the rebels, with Congress members from both parties saying they believed it would be a bad idea, according to participants. ""I strongly oppose arming rebels because in that complex tribal patchwork that makes up this insurgency, it is very uncoordinated,"" Republican Rep. Geoff Davis of Kentucky told CNN, adding that Islamic radicals were joining the Libyan opposition. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he wanted to help the rebels, but not with arms. Instead, he called for aerial bombardment of Gadhafi and his inner circle in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, which Graham said would have more impact than sanctions and seizing overseas assets. ""What they would worry about is having their compounds bombed by the most capable air force in the world,"" Graham told CNN. On congressional authorization, the White House has said Obama acted within his authority under the War Powers Act, noting that the president and other officials consulted congressional leaders several times in the run-up to the March 19 deployment of U.S. forces to the U.N.-authorized Libya mission. After Wednesday's briefing, legislators said Clinton told them the administration acted within the requirements of the War Powers Act and needed no congressional authorization for further decisions on the mission. Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York called Clinton's response inadequate. ""Briefing Congress is not the same as authorization,"" Nadler told reporters. ""Briefing is nice, but authorization is required under the law."" Other legislators expressed frustration. ""I can't think of a time in our nation's history where we put our men and women in combat like this without an administration of either party coming to the Congress first,"" said Republican Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon. He repeated a GOP criticism that the administration worked harder to get NATO and Arab League backing for the Libya mission than congressional support. ""If they had time to consult with the Arab League and they had time to consult with NATO, why in the devil didn't they have time to consult with us?"" Walden said. Davis said the briefing made clear that Congress shouldn't expect to be asked for authorization in the future. ""The implication was very strong that they saw no need for any authorization at any time regardless of how long this were to continue,"" Davis said. Democratic Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Washington, conceded that Congress is rarely satisfied with how any administration consults on such important issues. ""You'll never hear a congressman say they've had enough consultation,"" Dicks said. He offered some details from the briefing, saying he expected Obama and Gates to use money already budgeted to the Department of Defense this year instead of seeking supplemental funding that would require congressional approval. ""That would be an easier way to do it,"" Dicks said. ""If he has to get money through (with a supplemental measure), that would set off a lot of debate."" Dicks also said the mission had cost about $550 million so far, mostly due to the U.S. Tomahawk missiles fired and the loss of one jet fighter. The continuing cost would be about $40 million a month, he said. Nadler said Gates convinced him that a massacre in Libya was imminent before the U.S.-led coalition launched airstrikes to enforce a no-fly zone and prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces from attacking the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. ""There was considerable evidence"" of a pending slaughter, Nadler said. ""That was answered to me satisfactorily."" Nadler also said Gates and Clinton made clear there would be no U.S. ground forces involved in the Libya conflict. Asked if Congress supports the mission, Nadler said he thinks there is ""considerable"" support for finishing it now that it's started, but ""that support will erode if it takes a while.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government announced Friday that it will impose sanctions against the regime of Col. Moammar Gadhafi -- part of a series of measures designed to isolate the Libyan regime and loosen the dictator's grip on power. The American embassy in Libya suspended operations for security reasons, though State Department officials stressed that diplomatic ties were not suspended and channels for discussion remained open. ""The flag is still flying. The embassy is not closed. Operations are suspended. Relations are not broken,"" Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy told reporters. State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Janet Sanderson reiterated at the same briefing that Libya's Embassy in Washington is still ""up and running,"" and the department has not been informed of any change in the status of Libya's ambassador to the United States. ""We still continue to reach out to the Libyans where appropriate, both directly and through third parties,"" Sanderson said. Kennedy said all American official employees were withdrawn from the embassy Friday, and only Libyan employees are ""still on the payroll' and still working there. These remaining employees are not authorized to conduct any U.S. government business, he said. Local and national security guards remain at the embassy, Kennedy said, but he would not discuss what measures if any are being taken to secure documents and the like inside the embassy. ""But I can assure you that there is nothing left behind that could be compromised,"" he said. American operations at the embassy will resume when the security situation permits it, Kennedy said. In addition to pushing both unilateral and multilateral sanctions, Washington will use the ""full extent"" of its intelligence capabilities to monitor Gadhafi's regime and gather evidence of atrocities committed against the Libyan people, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. Steps were also taken to ensure that top Gadhafi officials don't steal Libyan financial assets in what may be their final days in power. The Treasury Department advised banks to monitor accounts held by the regime's key political figures and to report financial transactions ""that could potentially represent misappropriated or diverted state assets,"" according to a government statement. Gadhafi's ""legitimacy has been reduced to zero in the eyes"" of the Libyan people, Carney told reporters. ""The status quo is neither tenable nor acceptable."" The point of U.S. action -- particularly the sanctions -- is to ""make it clear that the regime has to stop its abuses"" and end the bloodshed, Carney said. Reports from Libya suggest that possibly hundreds of protesters have been killed. Washington also announced the suspension of all military cooperation with Libya, reversing a course of action taken after Gadhafi's government ended its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. Obama will meet with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Washington on Monday to discuss the full range of diplomatic, legal and other steps that may be taken to bring a halt to the violence, Carney said. The new steps against Gadhafi's government were announced less than an hour after a flight chartered by the U.S. government departed Tripoli for Istanbul. The flight carried personnel from the U.S. embassy and other American citizens. Earlier, a ferry chartered by U.S. authorities carried roughly 300 people to Malta. As U.S. citizens continued to flee the spreading unrest, clashes between Libyan security forces and protesters were reported in Tripoli, which has been a Gadhafi stronghold. Eastern Libya appeared to be largely in the hands of anti-government forces. Obama spoke Thursday with the leaders of France, Italy and the United Kingdom on coordinating an international response to the crisis in the north African nation. In separate phone conversations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama ""expressed his deep concern with the Libyan government's use of violence which violates international norms and every standard of human decency, and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond,"" a White House statement noted. While some critics say the Obama administration has been slow to react to the deteriorating situation in Libya, the statement said Thursday's discussions were to ""coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability."" On Friday, Obama discussed the Libyan crisis with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Earlier in the week, Obama strongly condemned the use of violence against protesters in Libya and said a unified international response was forming. ""The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous, and it is unacceptable,"" he said. ""This violence must stop.""

"Aboard A U.S. Military Aircraft (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates stepped out of a helicopter at Amman Airport in Jordan. He smiled at his staff and the cameras, raised his hands and said, ""Let's go home."" Moments later, the ""Doomsday Plane,"" his link to the Pentagon and the White House from wherever he is in the world, rolled down the tarmac and climbed into a sunny sky. The 67-year-old secretary is on his way out of government after serving eight presidents, but he hasn't announced a departure date yet other than saying it will be this year. And these regular trips are intensive, long days for the former career intelligence professional -- walking the beat, embracing allies, bolstering morale and getting his own fix on the troubles of the day. Gates ended his latest overseas jaunt -- a six-day trip to Russia and the Middle East -- by traveling by helicopter from Amman Airport to Jordan's Royal Palace for a private, no-cameras-allowed meeting with King Abdullah. He said privately, according to aides, what he had been saying publicly on the trip -- that the upheaval across the Middle East was serving up challenges and opportunities, and the key was to sort them out. Overshadowing his stops in Russia, Egypt and Israel was the U.S. and coalition military operation over Libya. He delayed his planned departure on this trip for a day at the start of the air attacks. While in Russia, he found himself in the middle of a political dispute over the Libyan mission. Aides informed him when a U.S. fighter jet and two aviators went down and were rescued near Benghazi. He was briefed on every development as the U.S. Air Force and Navy led the airstrikes. And while many on his plane dozed or ate their meatloaf and mashed potatoes on the flight back to Washington on Friday, Gates was linked to the White House and a National Security Council conference call for the latest deliberations on the military, diplomatic and political calculus of enforcing the Libyan mission. Gates will make appearances on the Sunday talk show circuit and visit Capitol Hill in the coming days to offer public and private explanations of how the U.S. military performed. And perhaps he also will speak about his view of the future. But on the trip, in public statements, and in talking to traveling and local journalists, he was careful and diplomatic. He dispensed with each question about ""the endgame"" of the Libyan missions by saying the goals are clear: creation and enforcement of the no-fly zone and protection of Libyan civilians. About targeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, about working in concert with Libyan rebels, about the risk of a military stalemate, Gates wouldn't bite, saying the future there is for the Libyans themselves to decide. Gates told America's Middle East allies that Washington stands by them. In Cairo, he repeated his praise for the Egyptian military for keeping that country from going over the brink in the mass protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak just last month. He arrived in Israel just after a bus stop bombing in Jerusalem and continuing rocket attacks in the south. Gates repeated the standard line that the U.S. commitment was unshakeable and used the code words for continued aid, saying that the United States would ensure Israel's qualitative military edge. On his last day, he moved briskly from photo-op to meetings. The first stop was the old Roman town of Caesarea, a luxury hotel where guests gawked at the motorcade and the heavily armed, plain-clothes Israeli agents standing watch. Inside, Gates met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who promised that the recent terrorism would be answered with what he called ""great force and great determination to put a stop to it."" And there was also mention of the elusive goal of a peace agreement, with Netanyahu adding, ""we seek to establish security for the establishment of peace."" Gates offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the terror attack and those enduring the rocket attacks in southern Israel. Next stop for Gates, after a wild convoy ride through Israeli traffic, was the West Bank, and a reminder of how many administrations have tried and failed to nudge the sides toward Mideast peace. Now in an armored SUV, he crossed over to newly constructed Palestinian Authority offices in Ramallah. In the diplomatic game, where symbols can substitute for substance, Gates acknowledged that his presence alone made history. ""I understand I'm the first American secretary of defense to visit Ramallah,"" Gates told the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. At the end of his remarks before the assembled media, before a 50-minute closed-door meeting, Gates added that he looked forward to discussing the central -- but elusive -- element of U.S. peace proposals for Israel and the Palestinians, a two-state solution. Later, in Ramallah, crowds of people leaving a mosque at the end of Friday prayers watched the Gates convoy glide past, as the secretary raced on to his next meeting and on to Washington.","Robert Gates recently completed a six-day trip abroad .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama urged the disputed leader of Ivory Coast to step down to prevent more violence as the nation grapples with postelection clashes that have left hundreds dead. ""Last year's election was free and fair, and President Alassane Ouattara is the democratically elected leader of the nation,"" Obama said in a video message late Friday. The west African nation has been embroiled in a political stalemate since incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down after November elections. Election officials and the international community consider Ouattara the rightful winner of the poll. Obama warned that if Gbagbo does not step down, it will lead to ""more violence, more innocent civilians being wounded and killed, and more diplomatic and economic isolation."" Postelection clashes have left at least 462 dead since December, according to the United Nations. Escalated violence and fears of war have forced nearly 1 million residents to flee the commercial capital, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday, with scores more uprooted across the country. ""The massive displacement in Abidjan and elsewhere is being fueled by fears of all-out war,"" said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Clashes have raged since late last year, and analysts fear the country is on the brink of a civil war. The nation was once one of Africa's success stories, but a 2002 civil war plunged it into political instability. ""You have a proud past from gaining your independence to overcoming civil war, now you have the opportunity to realize your future,"" Obama said. Ivorians deserve leaders who can restore their rightful place in the world, the president said. Obama's message comes after the U.N. Security Council discussed a draft resolution introduced by France and Nigeria on a weapons ban in Abidjan. It also calls for sanctions against Gbagbo and his inner circle. Numerous attempts to resolve the political stalemate have failed because Gbagbo has refused to cede power, said Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the United Nations. CNN's Faith Karimi and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","U.S. recognizes Alassane Ouattara as leader, Obama says .

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League (EPL) have confirmed they will vehemently oppose a new move by a supporters' association to bring back standing at football matches. Following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death on terracing, it was made law in England for all top-flight stadiums to be made all-seater -- although terraces are still common place in the lower divisions. However, many supporters believe that the banning of standing up at football grounds has resulted in the atmosphere becoming diluted -- prompting the  180,000-member Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) to launch an online petition calling for the return of standing areas in the top division. Speaking to the official English Premier League website, EPL spokesman Dan Johnson said: ""Our view is that the benefits of all-seater stadia far outweigh the return of standing areas. ""They have led to more women and children attending the games and, no matter how safe standiing can be made, seating is always safer. We will not be encouraging the Government to change the law,"" he added. The FSF held a meeting on Monday with representatives from the police, the Government and footballing authorities, with their chairman Malcolm Clarke arguing that many fans still stand up despite having a seat. However, British Sport's Minister Hugh Robertson told the meeting: ""Should we return to terracing, then the first time there is any significant crowd trouble, or an accident, the minister's head would be on a spike at Tower Bridge before he could draft a resignation letter!"" The FSF has cited the German Bundesliga, where terraces are widespread, resulting in packed stadia and cheaper tickets, as a good example of how standing can be safer at matches. Standing is also still very much evident in Argentina and Brazil, where the most fervent supporters adorn their own respective terraces in club colours, making for a noisy, passionate, and at times, intimidating atmosphere.","The English Premier League oppose a petition to bring back standing at matches .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Four Palestinian militants were killed Tuesday evening in an Israeli airstrike in the Zeitoun neighborhood east of Gaza City, the latest in a series of attacks in recent days that have included two children among the fatalities, Hamas security sources and Palestinian medical officials said. Islamic Jihad said all four militants were field commanders for Islamic Jihad. An Israeli army spokeswoman said that an Israeli military aircraft fired toward the group after identifying a group of militants who were preparing to launch a rocket into Israel. In an earlier incident Tuesday, two adults and two children were killed in the Al-Shajaieh neighborhood east of Gaza City when shells from Israeli tanks hit a house there, the sources said. The children, 11-year-old Mohammed Jihad Al-Hilo and 16-year-old Yasser Ahed Al-Hilo, were playing soccer outside their house when the shells hit, the sources said. Yasser Hamed Al-Hilo, 50, and Mohamad Saber Harara, 20, were also killed, according to the sources. Eight others were wounded, three of them critically, they said. The Israel Defense Forces said the mortar attack was carried out in response to the launch from Gaza of four military-use projectiles into the Shaar Hanegev regional council area. ""It appears that uninvolved civilians were injured as a result,"" the IDF said. The incident was under investigation by the IDF. ""The IDF does not want an escalation of violence in the South,"" an IDF spokesman said. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret over the deaths and injuries of Gaza civilians in Tuesday's Israeli military action and said the strikes were carried out in response to Hamas attacks on Israeli citizens. ""It's unfortunate that Hamas continues to intentionally rain down dozens of rockets on Israeli civilians using its own civilians as shields,"" he said. ""Israel has no intention of bringing about a deterioration of the situation, but at the same time the IDF will continue to act decisively to protect Israeli citizens."" Hamas condemned the killings east of Gaza City. ""The massacre in Al-Shajaieh neighborhood is a war crime and the Israeli occupation bears full responsibility,"" it said in a statement. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad also condemned what he called ""the Israeli aggression against the civilians"" and asked for international protection of civilians. He called the military shelling of residential neighborhoods a ""dangerous escalation that should be ended."" Since Saturday, 10 Palestinians have been killed and at least 37 others wounded in a series of incidents in Gaza, Palestinian medical sources said. Also since Saturday, 61 mortars and rockets have been fired into southern Israel, the IDF said.

"(CNN) -- For days, the wounded just kept coming to the 60-bed central hospital in Misrata, a city under siege from forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. But there were no empty beds, no electricity -- only generator power. No anesthesia or painkillers. A doctor said 109 people have died in Misrata over the past week. Six were killed Thursday by Gadhafi's rooftop snipers -- unseen but too often precise. More than 1,300 others have been wounded since the protests erupted in the western city last month. People flooded the hospital, wounded in war that has raged between the opposition and Gadhafi's forces. The strongman's tanks have been pounding the city and bombs fell Thursday near the hospital, the doctor said. Residents reported a reprieve after coalition airstrikes targeted the Libyan military. But rooftop snipers kept taking aim. And the doctors kept doing their work. They treated patients in corridors, and operated on them even without anesthesia. They sent people with what the doctor called lesser injuries home to recuperate -- including people whose legs and arms were amputated. ""We don't have the space,"" he said, the weariness in his voice apparent even on a poor phone connection from Libya. Snipers surrounded the hospital, he said. Thursday, patients were to a clinic. But the injured in the city could no longer seek help at the hospital. The snipers were shooting at the ambulances. The coalition began airstrikes last Saturday and has been able to establish a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya's coastline. But Gadhafi's forces are far from defeated. They camped on the periphery of Misrata, trying to wrest it from opposition control, and leaving its people, including those at the central hospital, in a dire situation.","A doctor tells CNN that 109 people were killed in Misrata over the past week .

"(CNN)  -- World number one Caroline Wozniacki held off a late charge from home favorite Bethanie Mattek-Sands to reach the third round of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami on Thursday. After cruising through the opening set, the Dane looked to heading for an easy win as she raced to a 5-3 lead in the second, but the flamboyant Mattek Sands produced a brief fight back before Wozniacki eventually closed out proceedings 6-2 7-5. ""It was pretty tough because Beth just went for it,"" the 20-year-old, who received a bye through the first round of the Florida hard-court tournament, told the official WTA Tour website. ""You never know what to expect from her -- she goes for her shots. It's difficult to get a rhythm. I just had to fight.""

"(Mashable)  -- Nearly 6,800 company-operated Starbucks stores in the U.S. will begin accepting mobile payments Wednesday. Customers using the Starbucks Card Mobile app on their iPhone, iPod touch or BlackBerry will now be able to use those devices as tender. The nationwide rollout marks the official launch of the Starbucks Card Mobile payment program, which has been piloted at Target stores and select San Francisco, Seattle and New York Starbucks locations. Starbucks Card Mobile lets users add their Starbucks Cards, track rewards and reload cards as needed via PayPal or credit card. To pay with their phone, app users simply select ""touch to pay"" and hold up the barcode on their mobile device screen to the 2-D scanner at the register. An Android application is also said to be in the works, but the company has yet to disclose a release date. Starbucks is using its own custom-built technology to enable the 2-D mobile barcode scans. The coffee retailer opted for barcode scanning over near field communication technology -- which Google is exploring -- because of its limited availability. The coffee retailer was reluctant to wait for a NFC ecosystem to develop when its customers have expressed interest in mobile payments now, according to Chuck Davidson, the category manager of innovation on the Starbucks Card team. ""Once there are more users, we will adapt,"" he says. In testing, Starbucks assessed the mobile payment option by measuring application speed, transaction speed and total customer wait time, says Brady Brewer, vice president of Starbucks Card and brand loyalty. In all instances, Starbucks Card Mobile was the fastest way for customers to pay. Starbucks is investing in mobile payments, an investment Davidson describes as modest in relation to expectations, because customers have requested the option and have shown a propensity to not only pay with Starbucks Cards -- one in five transactions are made using a Starbucks Card -- but frequently use their smartphones while waiting in line. The company also believes that its customers carry their mobile phones more often than a wallet or purse, and sees Starbucks Card Mobile and the mobile payment program as an opportunity to reach these consumers and build stronger relationships. Starbucks seems confident that its customers will appreciate the new, faster way to pay. Both Davidson and Brewer believe that adoption will spread as customers tell their friends about the new mobile payment option. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Just a month ago, members of the Libyan opposition army were civilians of all ages and from all walks of life. Wesam, 22, was in college. Ahmed, 32, is a husband, father and an engineer. Adrees, 18, was studying business. But now, they're amateur soldiers in the rickety rebel army of Libyan opposition. They say they're united by one mission -- to topple the regime of Col. Moammar Gadhafi. Since protests began in earnest in February, there has been no single, unifying figure in charge of the revolt. People of all ages and tribal affiliations have been taking part. One man told CNN that when government forces began using live ammunition against the protesters, it turned the whole community against them. With the rebels pushing west, gaining momentum and territory, a Libya without Gadhafi appears more likely by the day. But whether democracy will follow is far from clear. Libya has long been a patchwork of tribes and rival sects, kept largely intact in the grip of Gadhafi's autocratic regime. Traditionally, opposition to Gadhafi has been hampered by the fact that Libya's sense of national identity is ""very weak,"" according to Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Tribal loyalty in the sparsely populated North African country has come first -- which made it tough for Gadhafi's opponents to present a unified front. A nationwide network of ""social leadership"" committees set up by Gadhafi in 1993 and composed primarily of traditional leaders and tribal leaders could seek to take charge, according to Ronald Bruce St John, who has written seven books on Libya. Gadhafi tried without success to eliminate the more than 100 tribes in Libya between 1969 and 1980, St John said. In 1993, he began reinforcing the tribal system and recognizing its leaders as important by creating social leadership positions, St John said. If Gadhafi leaves power, ""those tribal leaders will try to find a way to put together some kind of a new government,"" St John said. ""I think you'll see the tribes being the ones that will, in the short term anyway, try to find a way through the obvious chaos that's going to occur."" So far, leadership for anti-government forces has been a group effort. The National Transitional Council, created in early March, is made up of 31 representatives from across Libya -- local politicians, military officials who switched sides, lawyers, doctors, academics and activists. They have settled on Benghazi as a temporary location until the ""liberation"" of the capital, according to a decree the council issued. The council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally, liberate the country, draft a constitution and hold elections. Opposition leaders know the path to democracy won't be easy. But, they say, whoever tries to turn them from their path will face what Gadhafi is facing now.

"(CNN) -- Harry Wesley Coover, best-known as the inventor of Super Glue, has died at his home in Kingsport, Tennessee, a funeral home there said Sunday. He was 94. The cause of death was congestive heart failure. Coover got the idea for Super Glue during a lab accident while working for Eastman Kodak, said Hamlett-Dobson Funeral Homes. He was studying compounds for use in optically perfect gun sights and impact-resistant jet canopies when an assistant complained that new refractometer prisms were wrecked because they got glued together, according to the funeral home. In fact, cyanoacrylate -- the chemical name for the glue -- was rejected by researchers at first because it bound everything together. But Coover saw its potential. The glue was first sold as a commercial product in 1958, according to the Super Glue Corp.'s website. It has since become synonymous with curiously powerful adhesives. Coover was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation last year for his work. He is survived by two sons, a daughter and four grandchildren.","He hit upon the idea of Super Glue during a lab accident .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- An American college student has not been seen since early last Saturday after a night out with friends in the Spanish capital. His father, who has since rushed from San Diego, California, to Madrid, is hopeful the police will find him. San Diego State University student Austin Taylor Bice, 22, arrived in mid-January for a semester of business-course study at a Madrid university, his father, Larry Bice, told CNN late Thursday. The student went out with five friends last Friday night to a popular Madrid discotheque but was the only one in the group refused entry by doormen, his friends say. Spanish newspaper El Pais reported doormen kept him out because he was drunk, but a fellow student told CNN it was unclear why he could not get in. Austin Bice later told an Australian friend waiting outside with him that he would walk home alone and left. That was the last time he was seen by friends. But photographs of him smiling have started appearing in the Spanish media and on posters that have been attached to walls and street signs near the disco, on the western side of Madrid, and in the city center. His friends organized the campaign to put up the posters, which read ""Missing. Austin Taylor Bice. U.S. citizen, 22, 1.95 meters tall and 100 kilograms"" (6 feet, 5 inches and 230 pounds). He was carrying two credit cards and his California drivers license, said his father, who arrived Wednesday in Madrid and has met three times with the Spanish police and twice with U.S. Consulate officials. ""People we've talked to say if it were bad, it would have shown up right away,"" Bice said. ""It's easier being here than at home. I see what's going on."" The elder Bice declined to be interviewed on camera but talked to a CNN reporter at a cafe near the three-bedroom apartment that his son has shared with a young married couple and another single man. ""I'm really, really worried,"" said a Spanish student friend, who gave her name only as Tamara. ""Because it's not common. He is a very responsible boy. So he cannot just go and not say to any of his friends."" A U.S. Embassy official confirmed the missing-person report and said he could not remember the last time an American student here had gone missing in Spain. The U.S.-based Institute of International Education said that in 2007, Spain was the third most popular destination worldwide for Americans studying abroad, after the United Kingdom and Italy. It said there were about 17,000 American students in Spain. Bice was studying in Madrid at the University of Carlos III, which has 18,000 students, of whom 1,500 are from abroad, including about 220 Americans, the school's director of international relations, Carlos Lopez Terradas, told CNN. The police are reviewing closed-circuit camera footage from Madrid's metro system to see if they can spot Bice, Lopez said. Friends say they called Madrid hospitals soon after Bice went missing, but to no avail. His father, an accountant, said, ""It's been hard, real hard. These are the things you hope never happen to you."" He added he would remain in Madrid to closely follow the search for his son ""as long as I need to.""","Austin Taylor Bice, 22, was last seen outside a Madrid disco last Saturday .

"Editor's note: In Subject Matters, we reveal the struggles faced by educators who teach subjects like science, math, English and history, and the solutions they've found. In the last Subject Matters story, teachers discussed their concerns about science education. It's the best of times and the worst of times for English teachers as they find themselves more accountable than ever for the academic success of their students, while balancing new technologies that change time-honored practices of reading and writing. Here are some of the modern challenges that language arts teachers face in their classrooms. Tests are top priority . The federal No Child Left Behind law, passed in 2001, requires states to set standards and assess students' skills as they reach certain grades. Since then, the U.S. Department of Education reports that English language arts and math are tested more than any other subject area. That means English teachers feel extra pressure to have their students perform well on tests, even as they set aside other education goals. Jeff MacCulloch, who teaches at Middle School 256 in New York City, said the pressure to achieve on tests has increased so much in the past 10 years that it influences how he shapes his lessons. Rather than spend an entire class period on in-depth study of one book, he now spends a portion of each class on skill development for test taking. ""We want the student to be able to switch on and off the right strategy for the right prompt. It can be effective for taking a test,"" MacCulloch said. ""But as far as the learning environment goes, it's like training a musician to announce the chords he or she is playing."" Not every English teacher has found success with that model, though. In Detroit's suburbs, Hillside Middle School teacher Alissa Lowman has a different approach. ""We've moved away from specifically teaching to the test, because if you teach the curriculum, you should be hitting what the test is asking the student,"" she said. Natalie Schlittenhardt, an eighth-grade teacher in Pima, Arizona, said results on the statewide tests are really a report card on whether students had a good day on the day they took the test. Everything she does, she said, comes down to three days of testing for which her school receives a grade. Robby Davis, a teacher at Lee County High School in Leesburg, Georgia, said it's problematic to judge schools by students' ability to meet minimal testing requirements. Under the No Child Left Behind law, underperforming schools are put on notice to improve or face reorganization. ""I don't have a problem with teaching to the test, if the test is a good measure of what it said it's going to measure,"" Davis said. Don't forget to write -- and read, too . Because time spent reading at home varies from student to student, kids come into language arts classrooms with varying skills. That means teachers have to make accommodations for the best readers, the weak readers and, in some cases, those who are just learning to speak English. Davis, who teaches students in the 11th grade, said educators shouldn't limit reading requirements to books that students can relate to. Academic reading is done for a different purpose than leisurely reading, he said. ""I'm unapologetic about what I ask them to read,"" he said. Lowman, from Michigan, teaches two novels per year in her middle school classroom, and she maintains a separate reading list to help students choose additional books. ""All students are reading different books at different times,"" she said. Through mini-lessons, she brings those books into the classroom discussion. For example, when they are studying active verbs, students will have to find examples in their individual books. ""It's harder, time-wise, but in the end they are learning more, reading and writing more,"" Lowman said. Christina Gardner, of Millennium High School in New York City, has her students do writing workshops where they edit, provide feedback and revise the papers of their fellow students. Students learning English need more time to give feedback, and generally need to attend after-school writing sessions in order to catch up. ""It's not necessarily the case that English as a Second Language students are not as good at doing this,"" Gardner said. ""In fact, they sometimes work even harder in order to compensate for a deficiency."" But as teachers assign more writing, they set themselves up to spend more time grading papers and have less time to teach. Gardner recently took her students to see the musical ""The Scottsboro Boys"" and assigned students to write a review of the show, a monologue for one of the characters and a reflection on the process. With a class size of more than 50 students, that generated about 150 papers for Gardner to grade. Technology for good, and for bad . When Beverly Fanelli went to elementary school, encyclopedias were her main research tool. Now, students in her fifth-grade class in Macomb, Michigan, use the Internet for research. ""It's just so wide open as to what's available to them,"" she said. Then, there's the whole video game component. When children read, Fanelli said, they take the words on the page and create pictures in their minds. But video games provide visuals with the story, so students don't use their imagination. Just as everyday use of computers has increased, language arts learning has become more intertwined with technology. Students naturally turn to computers for research and writing in ways they wouldn't have a decade ago. Davis, from Georgia, said technology can be a distraction. While research has been redefined by the Internet, his emphasis continues to be on teaching his students to take that information and synthesize it with their own ideas. ""Many of us thought the digital revolution was going to expand students' worlds because, theoretically, it could give them access to the globe,"" said Carol Jago, past president of the National Council of Teachers of English. Instead, she said, social networking sites like Facebook have contracted students' worlds. ""They're just telling people just like them that they had their nails done or that they drank a cappuccino,"" she said. In Clancy, Montana, Sandee Badger said she prefers to have her fifth-graders hand-write their assignments first. At that age, students are weak typists, and their creative flow is easily broken if they are hunting and pecking for letters on the keyboard, she said. While older students tend to have access to computers in classrooms or computer labs, often there aren't enough computers for each student, so they have to share. Gardner has access to a cart that contains 16 computers, but even if they all worked, there wouldn't be enough of them for classes of more than 30 kids. The shortage of computers makes it difficult for students to research and write during class, Gardner said. ""It's hard to maintain a model of writing workshop and maintain the level of expectation for the student,"" she said.","Many English teachers say testing drives how and what they teach .
In higher grade levels, students' reading levels vary dramatically .
Technology can help with research, but using it too much can hurt students, teachers say .
Computers can be more of a distraction if there aren't enough available ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan has one less legal problem to worry about after a prosecutor decided not to charge her in connection with an altercation while she was in a substance abuse rehab program in December. Lohan, who faces a preliminary hearing on a felony grand theft charge April 22, could also go back to jail on a probation violation charge on the same day. But the Riverside County, California, district attorney decided Tuesday not to pursue a possible assault charge against the actress for a December 12, 2010, incident with Dawn Holland, a Betty Ford Center staffer, the prosecutor's spokesman said. ""Our office has completed review of the case, and we will not file charges due to insufficient evidence,"" spokesman John Hall said. Lohan checked herself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California, for substance abuse rehab on September 28, 2010, just days after she dodged jail on another probation violation. A Los Angeles County judge later ordered her to remain in the drug rehab program until January 3 for failing a drug test while on supervised probation for a 2007 drunken-driving charge. An incident three weeks after she was released from rehab led to her latest legal problems. She allegedly walked out of a Venice, California, jewelry store wearing a necklace that she had not paid for, according to police. Lohan rejected a plea deal last week, setting the stage for next month's preliminary hearing and a possible trial.

"(CNN) -- Record-breaking batsman Ricky Ponting announced his resignation as captain of the Australia cricket team on Tuesday. The 36-year-old revealed in a news conference that his decision was motivated by a desire to improve his form without the demands of the captaincy and maintained that he will remain part of the team. Ponting, who is the most successful captain in Australia's history, made the announcement after returning home following his team's quarterfinal defeat in the Cricket World Cup by India. ""I've decided to step down as captain of the Test team and the one-day team as of now,"" he told media at the Sydney Cricket Ground. ""I think it'll keep me a bit mentally fresher than I have been in the last couple of years and I think that if I'm mentally fresh and have got my skills in reasonable order, then I'll be able to certainly bat better than I have in the past six months."" Ponting endorsed Michael Clarke to take over his captaincy -- a reign which saw the Tasmanian lead Australia to 48 victories in 77 Tests during an illustrious career spanning nine years as a one-day skipper and seven years as Test captain. He also helped Australia claim three one-day World Cup tournaments and under his leadership, Australia posted first place in the ICC One Day International rankings. Despite such impressive credentials, Ponting's Ashes record has been less successful, with three series defeats by England under his captaincy -- the last of which was the first Ashes series Australia had lost at home in 24 years. In the face of recent speculation, Ponting maintained that the decision to relinquish the captaincy was entirely his own and made with the advice of those close to him. ""I have thought long and hard about what Australian cricket needs,"" Ponting added. ""We have to be doing everything we can to win back the Ashes in 2013-14 and the World Cup in 2015. ""It is highly unlikely that I will be still playing, so it is the right decision for Australian cricket that the next captain now be appointed. This will give him the opportunity to create his own direction and legacy."" Cricket Australia confirmed that a new captain will be named on Wednesday ahead of the next two major tournaments -- the ICC Champions Trophy and the Ashes Series in 2013-14. Ponting became Australia's one-day captain in 2002 and took over the Test captaincy from Steve Waugh in 2004. He became the most prolific run-scorer of all time, hitting 39 Test centuries and amassing 12,363 runs. The right-handed batsman and close catching fielder was named ICC Player of the Year in 2006 and 2007 -- the only player to win the award twice -- and also scooped the Captain of the Year and Test Player of the Year in 2006 and 2007 respectively.","Ricky Ponting announces his resignation at a news conference in Sydney .

"(CNN) -- India reached the final of the Cricket World Cup for the third time after beating fierce rivals and neighbors Pakistan by 29 runs in Mohali on Wednesday. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will play fellow co-hosts Sri Lanka in Saturday's final in Mumbai, with both teams seeking to win the 50-over tournament for the second occasion in the first all-Asia title match. The semifinal in Punjab province was Pakistan's first match in India since the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks which further strained relations between the two sub-continent nations. Cricket fans in both countries abandoned work to watch the match on television and giant screens in stadiums, while respective prime ministers Manmohan Singh of India and Pakistan's Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani attended the game in a show of diplomacy. When cricket means more than just a match . Veteran batsman Sachin Tendulkar top-scored with a fortuitous 85 as India posted a total of 260-9 in their allotted overs, while Wahab Riaz claimed five wickets for Pakistan to give his team a reasonable total to chase. But India took vital wickets at regular intervals, as 1992 champions Pakistan were bowled out for 231 off the penultimate delivery with Misbah-ul-Haq top-scoring on 56. The victory sparked scenes of jubilation among India fans in Mohali, CNN correspondent Mallika Kapur reported. ""The main roads are blocked by cars. People are sitting on top of them, beating drums and dancing on the roads. Men have taken their T-shirts off and are screaming and shouting. A really electric atmosphere!"" Kapur said. ""Some people are hanging out of car windows -- some are standing on top of cars and waving the Indian flag."" Pakistan prime minister in India for cricket diplomacy . Tendulkar, who scored 98 when India beat Pakistan in the group stages of the 2003 tournament, survived a strong appeal for leg before wicket and was dropped four times before becoming the fifth man to fall with the total at 187. The 37-year-old, the world's highest run-scorer in both limited-overs and Test formats, hit 11 fours from 115 balls faced until he was finally caught by Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi to be the first of two wickets for Saeed Ajmal. It put him second behind Sri Lanka's Tillakaratne Dilshan as the tournament's leading scorer, with 464 from eight innings, and earned him the man-of-the-match award. ""It's always memorable to play against Pakistan, and to be on the winning side five times against them is a memory I will always cherish,"" he told AFP. ""But it was a brilliant effort in the field and by the bowlers today. When we batted we had to make sure we got a fighting total. I thought 310 or 315 would have been a good par score. Then the ball started stopping and spinning and something closer to 270 was par."" Riaz, playing just his 18th one-day international, had taken three of those first five wickets including dangerous big-hitter Yuvraj Singh for a first-ball duck immediately after he dismissed Virat Kohli (9). The 25-year-old left-arm fast bowler was unable to get rid of Dhoni and claim a memorable hat-trick, but he later trapped the India skipper lbw for 25 and finished with career-best figures of 5-46. Riaz also helped to run out tailend batsman Ashish Nehra as India scored only 60 runs in the final 10 overs. Pakistan made a solid start in reply with 44 on the board before Kamran Akmal fell to Zaheer Khan with the final ball of the ninth over, becoming the left-armer's 18th wicket of the tournament. Akmal made a brisk 19 off 21 balls faced, while his fellow opener Mohammad Hafeez scored 43 from 59 before being second man out. At 102-2 the match was still in the balance, but spinner Yuvraj dismissed Asad Shafiq (30) and veteran batsman Younis Khan (13) to turn the tide in India's favor. Umar Akmal tried to get Pakistan's run-rate back to the required level with a quickfire 29 off 24 balls, including two sixes, but when he was bowled by Harbhajan Singh it left his team needing 119 runs from 16.5 overs. Misbah was the last man out, caught in the deep by Kohli off Zaheer, but his runs came off a pedestrian 76 deliveries and he was not able to force the pace until Pakistan's victory bid became almost a lost cause. All the Indian bowlers ended with two wickets each, with Zaheer moving above New Zealand's Tim Southee into second place in the overall standings behind Afridi, who has 21 in total for the tournament.","India to face co-hosts Sri Lanka in Cricket World Cup's first all-Asia final .

"(CNN) -- Once thought to be a leading reformer inside the Libyan government, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi has emerged as one of his father's most-visible defenders. Saif, 38, has never lived a day in which his father Moammar didn't rule Libya -- as its undisputed leader inside the country and an enigmatic, controversial voice for the world. And yet, as the Libyan government faced a stiff popular uprising, it was Moammar Gadhafi's second eldest son -- and not the Leader of the Revolution himself -- who was first to talk to the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it. In early March Saif made it known his feeling about outside intervention into the unrest in Libya. ""We're  not afraid of the America  fleet, NATO, France. You people, this  is  our country. We live here, we die here.  We will never, ever  surrender  to those terrorists. Libyan nation is so united  now. We are  so  strong,"" he said. That was March. This is now. And still, Saif's name makes front-page news. Citing unnamed British government sources, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday that a senior adviser to Saif -- Mohammed Ismael -- was in London for secret talks with British officials. Ismael told CNN earlier this week that he would be traveling to London for family reasons. Calls placed to his mobile phone were not answered Friday. But Guma El-Gamaty, a leader of the Libyan opposition, said Ismael's visit was anything but personal. ""Our sources from Tripoli tell us that Saif has sent Mohammed Ismael to London with a specific offer. The offer is that Colonel Gadhafi will go into retirement, inside Libya, perhaps in his town of Sirte or Sabha in the south and Saif will take over and oversee some sort of reforms,"" he told CNN's Becky Anderson. Asked about the Guardian report, a British Foreign Office spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it. ""We are not going to provide running commentary on our contacts with Libyan officials,"" the spokesman said. ""In any contact that we do have, we make it clear that Gadhafi has to go."" Meanwhile, sources close to Gadhafi have told CNN that any transition in Libya would involve his son, Saif, who has long been seen as a possible successor to his father. Saif has denied any such desire, but others were interested in the idea for some time because he was considered more modern in his thinking, even reform minded by many Libya watchers. But that was before his recent and very public vows to fight to the ""last bullet."" Among his relatives, Saif was seen in some ways as the polar opposite of his father. Whereas Moammar Gadhafi years ago launched a program to ""destroy imported ideologies, whether they are Eastern or Western,"" his son speaks fluent English, earned his PhD from the London School of Economics, written an op-ed . in the New York Times and has been a frequent go-between in talks with international officials. Moammar rarely goes anywhere without a distinctive tribal dress and an ornate Bedouin tent. The well-traveled Saif, meanwhile, is more likely to appear in Western business attire: a suit and tie. While the father runs a nation, his son's main job -- at least before his 2009 appointment as General Coordinator, a position like many in the nation's government with few guidelines -- was heading a charity, the Gadhafi Foundation. And lastly, while the elder Gadhafi is known for his heavy-handed rule in Libya and its restrictions on civil rights and more, Saif Gadhafi fashioned himself as a human rights advocate and pushed for democratic and institutional reforms that could give more power and freedoms to the people. David Held, a professor at London School of Economics and Saif Gadhafi's academic advisor, said Gadhafi knew he had a dilemma. ""He  was torn,"" said Held. ""There was a dilemma in his heart between loyalty  to his father and the regime and on the other hand desperately realizng  that the Gadhafi regime was untenable, unjustified and the reform  utterly crucial."" Still, his status as a leading reformer and pull with foreign diplomats have dropped significantly since the start of the uprising. And for all their differences, Saif's standing in the world is largely defined by his father's role. While some may see the son as more open to change, there's little question that his loyalty remains first with Moammar. ""He's the heir apparent,"" CNN National Security Contributor Fran Townsend said about Saif. ""The question will be, will he be able to retain control in light of the current chaos?"" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, 38, was once thought to be a leading reformer .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- As Moammar Gadhafi's inner circle showed possible signs of cracking Friday, heavily armed forces loyal to the Libyan leader continued pounding cities that were once some of the country's most prosperous places. Officials and analysts said the surge in firepower from the Libyan government sends a message: Gadhafi is determined to prevail, and defections of some of his high-profile allies are making him nervous. ""You're certainly getting evidence that there are a lot of tensions. ... Each person that leaves, that makes it a little scarier for the people that are still remaining. And you may, at some point, get a tipping effect,"" said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of international affairs at Princeton University. On Thursday word emerged that Gadhafi's pick for U.N. ambassador had defected to Egypt -- a day after Libya's foreign minister fled to London and told the government there that he had resigned. Citing unnamed British government sources, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday that a senior adviser to one of Gadhafi's sons was in London for secret talks with British officials. The adviser to Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, Mohammed Ismael, told CNN earlier this week that he would be traveling to London for family reasons. Calls placed to his mobile phone by CNN on Friday were not answered. Asked about the Guardian report, a UK Foreign Office spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it. ""We are not going to provide running commentary on our contacts with Libyan officials,"" the spokesman said. ""In any contact that we do have, we make it clear that Gadhafi has to go."" Rebel fighters also said they remained determined to topple Gadhafi's nearly 42-year reign. But the battles over key cities are far from over. Rebels massed on the outskirts of the government-controlled oil town of al-Brega, which has changed hands six times in six weeks under dramatically shifting circumstances in the country's civil war. Misrata, Libya's third largest city and the final rebel stronghold in the western part of the country, was under siege by pro-Gadhafi forces. Badly damaged buildings lined streets covered with wreckage after weeks of urban combat. Witnesses said most residents fled the downtown area after government forces positioned snipers on tall buildings and used tanks and artillery in the city center. Clearly outgunned, opposition forces have pinned their hopes on more NATO airpower. ""We want to bring a speedy end to this,"" Col. Ahmed Omar Bani, an opposition spokesman, told CNN. ""A strike is not a strike unless it kills."" U.S. officials claim Gadhafi's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes. But the dictator's forces still outnumber rebels by about 10-to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee Thursday. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, also speaking before the House committee, warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance. ""It's pretty much a pickup ballgame"" right now, he said. U.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition. Gates reiterated the Obama administration's promise that no U.S. ground forces will be used in Libya, telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they didn't want such an intervention. But the United States does have CIA personnel on the ground. CIA operatives have been in Libya working with rebel leaders to try to reverse gains by loyalist forces, a U.S. intelligence source said. The United States, insisting it is now fulfilling more of a support role in the coalition, shifted in that direction as NATO took sole command of air operations in Libya. A U.S. intelligence source said the CIA is operating in the country to help increase U.S. ""military and political understanding"" of the situation. But officials leaving Libya may end up playing a more decisive role than troops or CIA agents on the ground. After defecting Wednesday, former Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa was voluntarily speaking with officials in the United Kingdom, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Hague said Koussa's departure from Libya provides evidence ""that Gadhafi's regime ... is fragmented, under pressure and crumbling from within."" Koussa did not tell the Libyan government he was planning to quit before he arrived in Britain, Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Thursday. But Ibrahim downplayed the defection itself, saying Koussa was an old man in poor health who had not been able to handle the pressure of his job. On Thursday an opposition leader and a relative said that the man Gadhafi tapped as the country's U.N. envoy had defected to Egypt. Former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki, who recently served as the president of the U.N. General Assembly, was to replace Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham as ambassador in New York. But he never arrived. Such defections are significant, but not as important as the departure of one of Gadhafi's family members would be, according to Robert Baer, a former CIA operative in the Middle East. ""Crack that clan and he's done. Those elite units will fall apart, the tribe will defect, and it will all be over,"" Baer told CNN's AC360. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Ben Wedeman and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","Britain's foreign secretary says Libya's former foreign minister is speaking with officials .

"Arroyo Grande, California (CNN) -- First, an 11-foot wooden cross was stolen from Saint John's Lutheran Church in Arroyo Grande, California. Then, weeks later, the cross was discovered set aflame in the middle of the night outside the bedroom window of a 19-year-old woman of mixed race. Now authorities are investigating the case as a theft, arson and hate crime, police said Tuesday. The burning cross was erected in a neighbor's large front yard adjacent to the house rented by the woman and her mother. The mystery of who stole the cross and set it afire has deeply disturbed the small coastal town of Arroyo Grande, located midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. It sits in the heart of a wine region, just 47 miles northwest of the vineyards depicted in the movie ""Sideways."" Police Chief Steven Annibali told CNN Tuesday that a cross-burning is unheard of for his community of 17,000, and that only three hate crimes have been reported in his town the past 15 years, mostly for uttering slurs. That figure is the lowest for San Luis Obispo County, he said. With a picturesque mountain backdrop and only about 5.5 square miles in size, Arroyo Grande calls itself ""the gem"" of the central California coast. Authorities have announced a $3,500 reward in the case and even established a ""Justice for All in Arroyo Grande"" fund-raiser to raise that amount. But an attorney for the alleged victim and her mother has criticized the police investigation. ""The family is trying to go about daily business, but they have ongoing concerns about their security and the direction of the investigation,"" attorney Louis Koory told CNN on Tuesday. ""For example, if there are known racist elements in the community, it is not clear that the police are looking at these groups. It appears that it would be a logical starting point for an investigation, if there are known racist groups in the community. The first problem is that the police initially treated this as a prank and may have lost the opportunity to conduct an effective investigation,"" Koory said. Arroyo Grande police have not released the name of the 19-year-old woman, citing confidentiality provisions under California hate-crime laws. Annibali, the police chief, said his agency moved quickly over the weekend following the cross burning, which occurred on a Friday, and is now working with the FBI, the California Department of Justice, San Luis Obispo County District Attorney's investigators and the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Department. His agency is also working with the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP, he said. ""It's funny that he would even say that because we have a very good relationship with the victim and the mother from the start,"" Annibali said about the family's attorney. ""Like with most crimes, you look at who would want to do this, and have you been involved in any activities that would lead someone to do this, or do you know somebody who would,"" the police chief said. ""I'm very comfortable that we handled this appropriately,"" he continued. ""We have been given access to any resources that the FBI has. And for a local agency like this, it's unprecedented."" Annibali said police never called the cross-burning a ""prank,"" saying that word was misattributed by local media. Agencies are now pursuing several leads, and he believes the cross-burning isn't the work of an organized hate group, he said. ""We feel right now that it's people who are local. We don't think it's an organized group or anything like that. It's bloggers who want to raise that issue,"" the chief said. ""There's no active hate groups in Arroyo Grande, none that we're aware of. We're working with the FBI, so we're pretty confident."" Arroyo Grande police submitted physical evidence from the cross-burning scene to an independent crime lab for forensic analysis, authorities said. Authorities are also analyzing an ""accelerant"" used on the cross, Annibali said. In an interview with CNN at her home, the mother said she and her daughter looked out their window after midnight March 18 and were horrified by the sight of a burning cross just 12 feet from their house. ""We were just blindsided. My daughter does not have a beef with anyone. We were both terrified. My daughter had a friend over and we looked out the window and there it was, a huge burning cross,"" the mother said. ""We are just trying to maintain normalcy. We would like to see whoever did this caught,"" the mother said. She added that her daughter ""is doing better now -- I bought her a puppy. She can give some love instead of all that hate and anger."" The cross was stolen from the grounds of Saint John's Lutheran Church between February 5 and March 5, police said. The exact date is uncertain because church members weren't aware of the theft for a month, police said. The cross is ceremonial and wasn't an architectural fixture on the church, police said. At 12:30 a.m. on March 18, local police and firefighters were called about the cross-burning. By the time they arrived, they found large pieces of charred wood in the wet grass, still burning with about 5 inches of flame, police said. Randy Ouimette, pastor of the church where the cross was stolen, said he was disturbed that ""a cross which is revered and gives hope was used to put fear into this family and disgust into the community."" ""First, the cross in Roman times became this symbol of crucifixion, punishment and awful death. Then it became the symbol of resurrection, renewal, the symbol of Jesus Christ of reconciliation, peace and hope. Now to see it used as a symbol of hate, intolerance and rejection is a misuse and desecration,"" Ouimette told CNN. The cross, which was hollow and made of different types of wood, had been used in a local production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" in the community theater, Ouimette said. It was often brought to the beach on Easter mornings and adorned with bright flowers, Ouimette said. Many in the community are outraged at the incident. The Rev. Stephanie Raphael, president of the San Luis Obispo County Ministerial Association, said the group's 35 religious leaders representing Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and others, signed a letter to the San Luis Obispo Tribune condemning the incident. ""Catching someone is less important to me as people coming to grips with the fact that we do not live up to all the ideals of our democracy here in America,"" Raphael told CNN. ""Even in a wonderful place like Arroyo Grande, bad things happen. I think that that is why some people in Arroyo Grande had such a hard time dealing with this: They did not think a cross-burning could happen in their city,"" she said. ""But I think the good thing is that people are talking about this, discussing this, people of all faiths engaging in dialogue about what happened. I think that is very healthy."" The police chief described his community as ""one of the best secret places in California to be."" ""It's not what I would describe as a heavily multicultural community. It's heavily white, but we do have a number of other cultures represented in the community,"" Annibali said.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal have confirmed that the supporter who threw a banana at Brazilian striker Neymar was a German national sitting in a section made up of official Brazilian ticket holders. Neymar complained that he was subject to racist chants after scoring both goals in Brazil's 2-0 win at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium on Sunday, resulting in a banana being thrown onto the pitch. However, on Monday both the Metropolitan Police and the Scottish Football Association praised the behavior of Scotland's fans, rejecting the claims that any racism had taken place. Will Neymar win 2014 World Cup for Brazil? Now the English Premier League club have issued a statement revealing that the culprit was not a Scottish supporter. The statement read: ""After consultation with the Metropolitan Police, Arsenal Football Club can confirm that a German teenage tourist has admitted throwing a banana onto the pitch during the Brazil v Scotland international friendly at Emirates Stadium on Sunday. ""The youngster was sitting in the North Bank of Emirates Stadium, an area of the stadium which was occupied by the official allocation of tickets to Brazil supporters, when he threw the banana onto the pitch during the second half of the match. ""The Metropolitan Police is satisfied there was no racist intent and have confirmed that no further action will be taken on this matter."" The statement backs up the claims of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), who had issued their own statement on Monday denying any racist actions from their supporters. The SFA statement read: ""There was no evidence of such instances but the Scotland supporters have confirmed they booed the player for perceived unsporting behaviour during the match. ""The tens of thousands of Scotland fans who travelled to London were, in fact, commended for creating a carnival atmosphere not just inside the stadium but across the city throughout the weekend.""","Arsenal confirm a banana thrown at Neymar came from a German fan .

"(CNN) -- As record oil prices dominate the headlines, natural gas is an energy sector gaining more recognition. MME's John Defterios (JD) talks with the CEO of Dolphin Energy, Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh (AS) about the importance of the natural gas sector, the impact of high oil prices, and increasing global energy demand. CEO of Dolphin Energy: ""it takes four to five years to bring any extra capacity on stream."" Al Sayegh is head of the largest single energy initiative in the Middle East, linking the three Gulf states of Qatar, U.A.E. and Oman, and producing two billion cubic feet of gas a day, equivalent to 350,000 barrels of oil. John Defterios begins by asking him why his company spent seven years building a giant natural gas plant an pipeline in a region swimming with oil. (AS): It was clear from the beginning, we needed to import gas and the Qataris wanted to export gas. So there was economic alignment. We respected that and they respected our needs, but political will, I believe, these three countries are very close politically and they needed to exercise this closeness and this project provided a fantastic opportunity for us to come together. (JD): It's fascinating. I don't think people realize the scope of this field. The Qatari side of the North Field is 14 per cent of the world's supply of natural gas. This has a long, long shelf life in terms of production, does it not? (AS): It has a very long life. Our transaction is for 25 years but it can go much longer than that. We hope we will be able to produce more from this field to fill our pipeline to its maximum capacity. (JD): There is a lot of political pressure now, or calls from Washington and the European Union for OPEC to provide more oil, more energy to the global market. But what is the reality? Is there is a capacity problem or is there not? What is from your view the reality today? (AS): The reserves in the Middle East are there and the commitment from the governments in the Middle East to produce those reserves, existing production and extract production is there. The reality is, it takes four to five years to bring any extra capacity on stream.   (JD): But did everybody miscalculate the demand realistically from China and India on top of the demand from the existing OECD-countries? (AS): I think it was, nobody knew there is going to be this much growth, and yes,  it was miscalculated. But now, I think, everyone is investing to bring extra capacity on stream. We are doing this in the U.A.E., in Saudi Arabia, in Kuwait, in Iraq and I think the key issue is to keep producing in a sustainable manner without damaging our environment. (JD): Are you surprised personally about and realistically about this oil price of $120 per barrel that we see today? (AS): I would be much richer if I would not be surprised by this level. I think the demand is real, the region itself is growing and of course you have to add what is happening in China and India. I think, people and economies have adjusted to a $100 oil very well and we are happy to continue to provide the capacity and the investment to meet our export requirements. Beyond that anything what I say would be speculation. (JD): I see the tone in the Middle East is much more pragmatic. So there is not a rush to get all this capacity built to get oil to market. Is this a change of attitude that needs to be preserved for future generations now? (AS): Well, as I have mentioned to you, it must be sustainable. Hydrocarbons are a wealth of all these nations and they must produce them in a sustainable way. We are not reservoirs of oil. We are countries, people and with aspirations and futures. In that respect, I think, we are doing everything we can to bring this capacity on stream on time. And there is no reluctance to do this. The only real limiting factor, and you have been in this region, is the ability to build it, the ability to actually physically build it.","Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh is head of the largest natural gas initiative in the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- A 4-year-old U.S. citizen who was unable to enter the country this month because of a possible communications mix-up is expected to attempt the journey again on Wednesday, according to her lawyer. ""It's a grave injustice that she has been separated from her parents for so long and we're here to rectify that situation,"" said lawyer David Sperling, in Guatemala City, Guatemala. Emily Ruiz, the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants living in New York without documentation, had spent five months recuperating from asthma while visiting with her grandparents in Guatemala, Sperling said. When her grandfather accompanied her on a flight back to the United States on March 11, he was stopped by a customs official at Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia for an immigration violation dating back some 20 years, the lawyer said. He was denied entry into the United States, and that placed Emily in the middle of an immigration quagmire. According to her family, immigration officials gave her parents two options: Emily could be sent to Guatemala with her grandfather, or she could be turned over to state custody. She returned to Central America. ""She was basically deported to Guatemala, not in the legal sense, but effectively this is what happened,"" Sperling said. ""We're not here to criticize the government; really, we do not know who is responsible for this."" U.S. Customs and Border Protection said last week that they offered to have the parents pick Emily up. ""CBP strives to reunite U.S. citizen children with their parents. If the parents choose not to take custody of their children, CBP works with other agencies to ensure the children's safety and well being, up to and including releasing them into the custody of other relatives,"" spokesman Lloyd M. Sterling said. ""In this case, the parents were offered to pick up the child, but elected to have her returned to Guatemala with her grandfather."" Officials say they gave Emily's father the opportunity to pick her up, because she is a U.S. citizen. The father, who speaks limited English, said he did not understand if that was indeed offered.

"(CNN) -- Manager Arsene Wenger and midfielder Samir Nasri will both miss Arsenal's next Champions League match after opting not to appeal against one-match suspensions. The pair were handed the bans by UEFA, while Wenger was also fined $14,00, for ""inappropriate language"" towards referee Massimo Busacca following the 3-1 defeat to Barcelona earlier this month. Wenger was enraged by the Swiss official's decision to send off striker Robin van Persie for a second yellow card for kicking the ball away early in the second half. Van Persie was cautioned for taking a shot at goal, just one second after being blown for offside, with the Dutchman protesting that he had not heard the referee's whistle due to the noise of the 95,000 crowd at the Camp Nou stadium. Arsenal eventually lost the tie 4-3 on aggregate and Wenger insisted that he would deny the charge levelled against him. However, the English Premier League club have now decided not to take the matter any further. A statement on the club's official website read: ""Arsenal have decided not to appeal against UEFA bans for Arsene Wenger and Samir Nasri.

"(CNN) -- At least seven people died and dozens were injured as Syrian troops assaulted demonstrators who took to the streets after Friday prayers, witnesses and activists said. Troops used gunfire amid protests in the Damascus suburb of Douma, according to witnesses and opposition sources, and one witness saw at least six dead demonstrators taken into a hospital morgue. Witnesses also said a man was shot in the head with a rubber bullet and dozens were injured. Another death and 10 injuries occurred when troops shot at protesters marching toward the southern town of Al Sanameen, witnesses said. Protests also were reported by witnesses in the cities of Daraa, Latakia, Homs, Baniyas and Kamishli, sources said. Opposition sources cited witnesses in Homs as saying thousands of people had gathered around a mosque. Security forces used tear gas in several locations to try to disperse demonstrators, witnesses said. Anti-government activists had promised demonstrations in Syria on Friday to air their grievances against the Bashar al-Assad government. Tensions have been high as dozens of people have been killed recently in Daraa in the south and Latakia in the west -- both centers of ferment. Thousands of demonstrators from different villages and towns gathered near Daraa and marched toward Al Sanameen. They were 25,000 strong by the time they reached a military checkpoint just outside the city, witnesses said. About 1,000 heavily armed troops at the checkpoint fired on demonstrators forcibly trying to cross the spot and enter Al Sanameen, witnesses said. ""Their blood is on my shirt and we are tending to the wounded as we speak,"" a witness said. Ambulance sirens could be heard in the background during the witness's phone call to CNN. Demonstrators are staying at the checkpoint and demanding they be allowed into the city. According to an eyewitness, the gunfire had stopped and protesters were trying to appeal to soldiers, chanting, ""The people and the army are one hand."" They also chanted, ""With our bloods, our souls we will sacrifice for you, Daraa."" One witness said security forces attacked thousands of protesters at the ""big mosque"" in the center of Douma with electric batons, tear gas and live ammunition. ""I have never in my life seen such violence: men shooting guns into an unarmed crowd without a thought,"" said the eyewitness, who had been hurt in an electric-baton beating and taken to the hospital for a head injury. Along with the six dead, he said, he saw dozens of wounded, many of whom were seriously injured. Another Douma demonstrator claimed his son had been injured in the gunfire. Haitham Maleh, a Syrian human rights lawyer recently freed from prison, said he spoke to rights activists who reported two deaths in Douma. Witnesses said a mosque in Kafr Sousa, another Damascus suburb, had been surrounded by security forces who had fired rubber bullets, and Maleh said he was told about the unrest there. ""Hundreds are now trapped in Abdul Karim Rifai mosque in Kafr Sousa near Damascus,"" he said. ""They called me to say that more than 50 people were injured and taken away from the mosque to security headquarters after being brutally beaten in the street."" CNN could not independently confirm the witness accounts, and it is not known whether the two people Maleh reported dead are among or in addition to the six the eyewitness reported. The Syrian government has made no public comment about Friday's events, though the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing an official source, said armed groups in Douma fired on security forces and civilians, killing ""several"" people and injuring ""dozens"" of others. In Homs, a group shot into a crowd, killing a girl, SANA said. The agency reported protesters and security forces did not clash in Daraa and Latakia. In some Syrian provinces, people took to the streets to call for national unity, SANA said. Activists, who have many political and economic grievances, have been riled in recent days by President al-Assad. They are upset that he failed to announce the lifting of the country's state of emergency during a national TV address on Wednesday and didn't properly address, in their view, complaints and concerns of people in the streets. On Thursday, however, Syria said it will study the idea of lifting the country's state of emergency and promptly investigate the deaths of civilians and troops in two flashpoint regions. Al-Assad ordered the Supreme Judicial Council to form a committee that would conduct ""an immediate investigation in all cases that killed a number of civilians and military personnel."" The committee exploring the lifting of the emergency law is expected to complete the study before April 25. It will be made up of senior lawyers, SANA reported. One of the key demands of the demonstrators who have taken to the streets in the country's major cities is the scrapping of the law, which has been in place since 1963. The emergency law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. It also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations. ""It's extremely disappointing that President al-Assad has done nothing more than repeat the same vague promises of reform that he's been uttering for over a decade,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""What's needed immediately if the authorities are to restore any shred of credibility are concrete actions to dismantle Syria's special courts and abolish provisions that criminalize free speech, assembly and association.""

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett fell off a concert stage and was injured at the end of a show in Sydney, Australia, Wednesday night, according to his manager. Buffett, 64, spent a day in Sydney's St. Vincent's Hospital, but he was released on Thursday, according to a statement posted on his website. While the hospital would not release details of his treatment, an announcer on Buffett's Sirius XM channel ""Radio Margaritaville"" said he received several stitches for a cut to his head. He misjudged where the stage ended because of footlights, the announcer said. A video of the incident posted on YouTube shows Buffett closing his concert in Sydney's Hordern Pavilion with his song ""Lovely Cruise."" ""Thank you, good night and God bless,"" Buffett told his fans. After he put his guitar down, Buffett walked toward the cheering crowd with his arms raised. The video showed the singer taking one step too many, dropping off the front edge of the stage.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, arrived Wednesday in Madrid on an official three-day visit to Spain, just under a month before his son, Prince William, is to marry Kate Middleton in London, a British official said. Charles, the Prince of Wales, will meet with members of Spain's royal family, some of whom will attend the April 29 wedding at Westminster Abbey, a spokeswoman for Spain's royal household said. The visit also will focus on bilateral commercial relations, cooperation on climate change, opportunities for youth and cultural links, said a statement from Clarence House in London, the prince's office. Hosts for the visit will be Spain's Crown Prince Felipe and his wife, Princess Letizia, who will receive the visiting British royalty at the Pardo Palace, on the western outskirts of Madrid, for an opening ceremony with color guard. Pardo Palace is the former residence of the late dictator Francisco Franco and has been used, since Spain's return to democracy, as lodging for visiting foreign dignitaries. It's where Prince Charles and Camilla will stay for their two nights in Madrid. Later on Wednesday, Prince Charles will meet the president of Madrid's regional government and business leaders, members of the British community in Spain and attend a dinner at Spain's Royal Palace in central Madrid hosted by Prince Felipe. On Thursday, Prince Charles and Camilla will attend a lunch hosted by Spain's King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia at their residence, the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid. Prince Charles is expected to make brief speeches only twice during the trip, during a toast at the Royal Palace dinner on Wednesday and at Madrid city hall on Thursday morning, said British Embassy officials in Madrid. Britain and Spain have $53 billion dollars in bilateral trade, with the trade balance in Spain's favor, according to Clarence House, which said Prince Charles will engage in ""commercial diplomacy, including trade and investment promotion."" Up to a million British citizens live in Spain full or part-time and millions more visit annually, British officials said. Prince Charles and Camilla began the week with an official visit to Portugal. After two days in Madrid, they will go to Seville on Friday for more official events, and then have a private weekend in southern Spain, before their official visit to Morocco on Monday, Clarence House and British officials in Madrid said. Prince Charles has made two previous official visits to Portugal, 10 to Spain --- most recently for the 2004 wedding of Prince Felipe to Letizia in Madrid --- and two to Morocco. It is the Duchess of Cornwall's first official visit to Portugal, Spain and Morocco, British officials said.","Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall make an official visit to Spain .

"(CNN) -- Australia's new captain Michael Clarke admits that he will have to earn the respect of the nation's cricket fans after being confirmed as the successor to Ricky Ponting on Wednesday. The 36-year-old Ponting stood down as skipper of Australia's Test and one-day teams on Tuesday following last week's World Cup quarterfinal exit, but will continue as a batsman after being named in the 14-man squad to tour Bangladesh next month. Clarke has long been groomed as Ponting's successor, having filled in when his captain was unavailable or being rested, but acknowledges that he is not the most popular choice to replace him. ""I don't know the exact reasons why it's there, but it is and I've had it probably my whole career,"" he told the Cricket Australia website. When cricket means more than just a match . ""So I certainly don't sit here and think that I can get the whole of this country to like me. People are always going to have their own views, but for me it's about respect. ""It's about earning that respect, leading the team in the right way, playing cricket in the right manner and hopefully I can earn the respect of the doubters that are out there."" Ponting was one of the most successful captains in modern cricket, having led Australia to victory at the 2003 and 2007 World Cups before last week's defeat by India. Clarke, who turns 30 on Sunday, said he was happy to have Ponting in the team for the short trip to Bangladesh, which comprises three one-day internationals in Dhaka from April 9-13. ""Bangladesh is going to be a great test for that, to see how it all unfolds,"" he said. ""I know he will allow me to do my job to the best of my ability, I have a very good working relationship with 'Punter' and I'm confident that if he can continue to play as well as he has done for such a long time, I'm certain it can work.""","Michael Clarke confirmed as new captain of Australia's national cricket team .

"(CNN) -- Hosts Sri Lanka are through to their second successive Cricket World Cup final after beating New Zealand by five wickets in Colombo on Tuesday. The Black Caps struggled throughout their innings, failing to use their allocated 50 overs before eventually being skittled out for just 217 in 48.5 overs. And although Sri Lanka wobbled in their reply, Thilan Samaraweera (23 not out) and Angelo Mathews (14 not out) saw them home with a crucial 35-run stand as the home side made 220-5 off  47.5 overs -- inflicting a sixth semifinal defeat on New Zealand. As well as the significance of a World Cup semifinal, the match also marked the last apperance on home soil for legendary Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan. The 38-year-old, who is the most successful Test and one-day bowler in cricket history, went out in style, taking his 534th one-day wicket off his very last ball. Muralitharan had New Zealand top scorer Scott Styris (57) lbw to send the 38,000-crowd at the R. Premadasa stadium into wild scenes of celebration. It was one of Muralitharan's two wickets, with Ajantha Mendis (3-35) and Lasith Malinga (3-55) also successful as New Zealand rarely threatened to post a score big enough to defend. In reply, Tillakaratne Dilshan (73) and skipper Kumar Sangakkara (54) helped Sri Lanka reach 160-1 to appear in total control. However, the loss of four wickets for just 25 runs threatened to derail Sri Lankan hopes before Samaraweera and Mathews steered them to their victory target. The victory moves 1996 champions Sri Lanka into their third final and, after finishing runners-up to Australia in 2007, they will be looking to make amends when they face either India or Pakistan in Saturday's final in Mumbai. Those two rivals face each other in Mohali on Wednesday in one of the most  eagerly anticipated matches in recent history.","Hosts Sri Lanka are through to their second successive Cricket World Cup final .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Interest in business training programs is at record levels, as the economic downturn sends students flocking back to school. Beyond finance: Rosa Wu plans to keep working in the technology field after getting her MBA. In September hundreds of thousands of students will embark on training courses like MBAs at various business schools around the world. But the surge also comes at a time when the financial crisis has cast fresh doubt on the value of business programs that can cost up to six figures. Many entering students have given up secure jobs to pursue an MBA. They say the degree is the best path for them to achieve their goals, economic downturn or not. However many of them are taking a gamble; the outlook for the global economy is still hazy, and there's uncertainty over whether jobs lost in the financial sector will ever be recovered. Some risk spending upwards of $100,000 for a degree that may not pay off in two years' time. Some are embarking on training out of necessity, perhaps due to a lay off or redundancy. ""Typically when you see increases in unemployment, people go back to school,"" said Dave Wilson, president and CEO of the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC). His organization administers the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), which many MBA programs use as part of their admissions process. Applications for MBAs tend to rise and fall with economic cycles, said Wilson. The GMAC doesn't monitor MBA enrollment figures, but does track the number of times the GMAT is taken. Preliminary figures show that a record 265,000 exams were taken worldwide during the 2009 testing year, which ended in June. Are you planning to take a business training course? Do you think having an MBA is still valuable?  Share your views below . CNN's Executive Education spoke to five students starting their business degree to see how the economic climate is affecting their outlook and expectations. One of those was Alex O'Brien, a former marine officer turned real estate investor. He said that taking time away from the firm he helped start in order to pursue an MBA wasn't an easy decision.  Read more about Alex and other future MBAs » . It wasn't just a matter of spending the money, said O'Brien who is starting classes at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The more pressing question was deciding ""do I really want to give up a good thing now to pursue an unknown?"" he told CNN. When Tara Idiegbe was deciding whether to go to business school, she came across information debating whether MBAs were as valuable as work experience, especially in the current economic environment. ""But then after careful consideration I chose to pursue an MBA -- not because of current speculations -- but because it would help me fulfill my future goals,""  said Idiegbe. After spending nearly five years working as a training and development manager for the investment management division at Goldman Sachs in London, she's headed to Harvard next week. Thomas Traldi gave up a job in environmental consulting to start his MBA at London Business School. ""But I'm not worried too much now because it's a bit too early, and also I hope [the economy] will get better in a couple of years,"" he said. Despite uncertainty about what shape the global economy will be in by the time they graduate, members of the class of 2011 say they still see value in an MBA and that investing in their education is the surest bet they can make. O'Brien decided an MBA would help him take his company to the next level as well as give him a competitive edge down the line. ""It makes sense to give yourself more skills, more knowledge and help yourself become competitive,"" said ""In two years, if the economy is still down, you want to be as competitive as possible."" Plus, business degrees aren't just for those working in finance. There's robust demand for MBAs in health care, non-profit organizations and the public sector, Wilson said. Rosa Wu, who left a position as product manager at Google to begin a degree at Stanford Graduate School of Business, intends to stay in the technology field. While working at Google is a great gig, Wu said she wanted to explore ways of combining technology with other disciplines. She's eager to take advantage of a program at Stanford that allows graduate students from across the university and a variety of fields to take classes together. Chrissy Minyard is one student who does plan to pursue a career in finance. ""The business community in general is under the microscope and I think that business school represents the epitome of what is being examined,"" she said. But it also offers an opportunity for students to focus on the ethics involved in the decisions they make, which will have a positive impact on her education, she said. On a recent evening Minyard, who wants to work in economic development, was getting ready to attend her first event at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Minyard said excitement, more than anything else, characterized her mood. After six years in the working world, she's eager to get back in the classroom and shift gears. ""This is a real chance for me to step back and assess all I've learned in business,"" she said.","Interest in MBA programs on the rise amid economic downturn .

"(CNN) -- Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel has started the 2011 Formula One season as he finished the last, claiming pole position in qualifying ahead of Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. The Red Bull driver's lap of one minute and 23.529 seconds was enough to keep him 0.778 seconds ahead of McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, who will join him on the front row. Vettel's Australian teammate Mark Webber finished third fastest in front of his home crowd, with Hamilton's fellow McLaren driver Jenson Button in fourth position at Albert Park. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will start from fifth on the grid for Ferrari and Vitaly Petrov of Renault will also be on the third row after a lap of one minute 25.247 earned him sixth position. Will tires decide new Formula One season? Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher's qualifying woes from the 2010 campaign continued after he was eliminated at the end of the second round, which means the Mercedes driver will start from 11th position. Schumacher's fellow German and teammate Nico Rosberg qualified in seventh ahead of Ferrari's Felipe Massa in eighth, Kamui Kobayashi of Sauber in ninth and Toro Rosso's Sebastien Buemi in 10th. Vettel recorded the fastest lap without using the newly re-introduced KERS technology, which stores energy created when breaking and converts it into an extra boost of speed. ""We didn't use it today and the reason for that will stay a secret!"" the 23-year-old told Formula One's official website. ""It was a very good day today and so far a very good weekend, and hopefully this will lead to our best Melbourne result ever. Formula One 2011 lowdown . ""The gap (between Hamilton's time and Vettel's time) is almost irrelevant. It could be one thousandth or one second. You only have those eight meters between you and the guy in second position, nothing more, nothing less. And in a long race eight meters may mean very little."" It was a disastrous session for Spain-based team Hispania Racing, who saw both of their drivers fall foul of a rule which states any driver whose best lap is not within of 107% of the fastest lap time in the first qualifying phase will not be allowed to take place in the race. As a result, India's Narain Karthikeyan and Vitantonio Liuzzi of Italy will not line-up on the grid for Sunday's race.","Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel on pole ahead of season-opening Australian GP .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are on course for their first semifinal meeting since 2005 after both progressed at the Masters Series event in Miami. World No. 1 Nadal set up a quarterfinal clash with seventh-ranked Czech Tomas Berdych after crushing Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolv 6-1 6-2 on Tuesday evening U.S. time. No. 3 Federer, who took to the court after midnight following Maria Sharapova's marathon three-hour win in the women's event, defeated Belgium's Olivier Rochus 6-3 6-1 to earn a meeting with 25th seed Gilles Simon -- who has beaten him in two of their three meetings to date. However, the 16-time grand slam champion prevailed in five sets against the Frenchman at this year's Australian Open, and faces a player who needed two and a half hours on court before beating Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. Murray parts company with coaching consultant Corretja . ""It's happened a few times in my career where we waited around forever and I was able to play one of those clean, quick matches,"" two-time Miami champion Federer told the ATP Tour website after extending his record against Rochus to 8-0. Nadal, twice a runner-up in the hard-court tournament, has a chance to avenge his Indian Wells final defeat against world No. 2 Novak Djokovic if he can get past Berdych on Thursday and then possibly Federer -- who he last faced at semifinal stage at the 2005 French Open. ""We know each other,"" the Spaniard said of Berdych. ""We played a lot of times, and I know if I play my best tennis I'm going to have chances against him. ""He can play very, very good, and I have to play very solid all the time with my serve and wait a chance on the return."" Berdych, who lost to Nadal in the 2010 Wimbledon final, battled into the last eight with a 6-3 2-6 7-6 (7-4) win over Germany's Florian Mayer. Djokovic, unbeaten in 21 matches this year, can reach the semifinals with victory over unseeded South African Kevin Anderson on Wednesday. The winner of that match will play 14th seed Mardy Fish, who upset Spanish No. 6 David Ferrer 7-5 6-2 and will next week become the top-ranked American ahead of Andy Roddick. Former No. 1 player Sharapova will return to the top-10 of the women's rankings after an absence of more than two years following her hard-fought quarterfinal win over Alexandra Dulgheru. The Russian, a two-time grand slam champion who has battled injuries since 2008, finally overcame the Romanian 26th seed 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-5) in their first encounter. The 16th seed injured her ankle during the match, but is confident she will be able to play in her second successive semifinal following the defeat by Indian Wells champion Caroline Wozniacki two weeks ago. ""It hurt when I did it. I've iced it a lot, did an ice bath and got it taped. I'll be okay. I'm tough,"" the 23-year-old told the WTA Tour website ahead of her clash with 21st seed Andrea Petkovic, who beat Sharapova 6-2 6-3 at the Australian Open in January and eliminated current No. 1 Wozniacki on Monday. Bosnia-born German Petkovic knocked out another former No. 1, Serbian sixth seed Jelena Jankovic, winning 2-6 6-2 6-4. Second seed and defending champion Kim Clijsters saved five match-points against Jankovic's compatriot Ana Ivanovic before finally prevailing 7-6 (7-4) 3-6 7-6 (7-5) in a fourth-round tie between two former top-ranked players. The Belgium had dropped just seven games to Ivanovic in their previous three matches, but found herself 5-1 down and 0-40 on her own serve in the third set before . Two-time Miami winner Clijsters, who briefly regained top spot from Wozniacki this year, will face eighth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. The winner of that match will take on Russian third seed Vera Zvonareva, who beat Polish No. 9 Agnieszka Radwanska 7-5 6-3 in the opening match on Wednesday.","World No. 1 Rafael Nadal faces seventh-ranked Czech Tomas Berdych in Miami quarterfinals .

"New York (CNN) -- A National Transportation Safety Board investigation has revealed new facts about the Bronx crash that killed 15 people in early March, with the head of the NTSB issuing renewed calls for changes in bus safety and regulation of bus companies. One of the primary findings of the investigation so far is that contrary to bus driver Ophadell Williams statement to authorities that a tractor-trailer may have clipped the bus causing the accident, the NTSB engineer who examined the bus found no evidence to indicate that a truck had come into contact with it, NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman told CNN. The investigation found that the bus, with the 40-year-old Williams at the wheel, drifted to the right before striking a roadside barrier, Hersman said Wednesday in testimony to a Senate hearing on bus safety. After hitting the barrier, the bus rolled and skidded for nearly 500 feet before colliding with a highway signpost that penetrated the windshield and speared the entire length of the bus, killing 15 passengers, according to Hersman. Investigators determined that the bus was traveling at 78 miles per hour at some point between leaving the Connecticut casino and the scene of the accident, while the speed limit at that stretch of roadway was 50 miles per hour for commercial vehicles, Hersman told CNN. A camera was also mounted on the bus windshield when the bus crashed, but it did not record the accident, the NTSB reported in a press release. The crash happened in the early hours of March 12 on the New England Thruway near the border of Westchester and the Bronx. En route from the Mohegan Sun Resort and Casino, the ""World Wide Tours"" bus was bound for Chinatown in Manhattan. ""Unlike when travelers get in their own automobiles, passengers boarding a motor coach place their lives in the hands of the motor coach operator and its driver,"" Hersman said Wednesday of the industry that transports 750 million passengers per year. This accident, along with other recent, serious motor coach crashes in New Jersey and New Hampshire, has led the NTSB to renew its emphasis bus safety recommendations. The first NTSB recommendation is to improve passenger protection with stronger roofs, a redesign of window emergency exits and improved standards for passenger seating compartments. The NTSB also recommended better government oversight of both drivers and vehicles, as well as more advanced vehicle technologies, such as forward-collision warning systems. The Department of Transportation currently is working on rules covering the recommendations, Hersman said in her testimony. The full report of what happened is expected to be completed within 12 months, a spokesman for the NTSB, Peter Knudson, told CNN.","Fifteen people died in a Bronx bus crash in early March .

"(CNN)  -- Lewis Hamilton will take time out from his preparations for the Malaysia Grand Prix to see his disabled half-brother follow in his footsteps and compete on the racing circuit for the first time.

"(CNN) -- The woman who accused three Duke University lacrosse players of rape five years ago was arrested Sunday, suspected of stabbing her boyfriend, police said. Officers responding to a call early Sunday about a stabbing at an apartment in Durham, North Carolina, found a 46-year-old man who had been stabbed in the torso, police said. He was taken to Duke University Hospital for treatment of serious injuries. Officers later arrested the man's girlfriend, Crystal Mangum, 32, at a nearby apartment. She was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, inflicting serious injury, police said. Mangum was placed in the Durham County Jail without bond. Officers said the stabbing occurred during an argument at the couple's shared apartment. In March 2006, Mangum claimed to have been sexually assaulted by three players on the Duke lacrosse team while performing as a stripper for a team party. North Carolina's attorney general later found no credible evidence that the attacks ever occurred and the charges were dropped. The scandal, however, forced the cancellation of the men's lacrosse season that year and the resignation of team coach Mike Pressler. It also led to widespread criticism of Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, who was later disbarred for his handling of the case. Mangum was arrested in February 2010 on attempted murder charges after a fight with her then-boyfriend. She was also accused of arson, identity theft and resisting arrest, among other charges. CNN affiliate WTVD-TV reported the arrest happened after she set fire to a pile of the boyfriend's clothes while her children were at home. In a June 2010 interview with the station, Mangum said her boyfriend had attacked her, and that her involvement in the Duke lacrosse case had influenced police handling of the case. ""I do feel that I am being unjustly treated because of preconceived notions about my character in the media,"" Mangum said at the time. In December, a jury found Mangum guilty of child abuse in the case but could not agree on a first-degree felony arson charge, which could have resulted in a seven-year sentence, WTVD reported.","Police charge Crystal Mangum with assault with a deadly weapon .

"(CNN) -- The Scottish Football Association (SFA) has demanded an apology from their Brazilian counterparts after allegations of racism marred a friendly between the two countries. Brazil striker Neymar scored twice in the game held at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium in London on Sunday but accused Scottish fans of racism after he was booed. A banana was also thrown onto the pitch but police confirmed it was thrown by a German tourist in the crowd and said they were satisfied there was no racial element to it. Will Neymar win 2014 World Cup for Brazil? But Scottish fans were appalled that Neymar suggested after the match he was booed because of his color, stating they had jeered the striker due to his constant playacting. Now Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan wants a formal apology from Brazil saying they were ""dismayed"" by the claims. He said in a statement on the SFA website: ""It is very disappointing that this episode threatened to overshadow an entertaining match, played amidst a real carnival atmosphere created by supporters of both teams. ""Scotland and Brazil have played many times over the years, each time in a colorful and friendly environment, and we feel that it's necessary to draw a line under Sunday's events. ""Scotland's supporters were genuinely upset and annoyed that the unfounded allegations leveled against them threatened to sully their reputation as fair, good humored and respectful spectators. ""As the matter has been resolved, and Scotland supporters cleared of any involvement, we felt it was only right that we acted on behalf of our supporters to request an apology either from the player involved, or the Brazilian FA.""","Scottish Football Association demand apology from their Brazilian counterparts .

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite having CIA agents on the ground and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's exit as stated policy, U.S. officials continue to say the NATO-led military mission in Libya is only for its authorized humanitarian purposes. The seeming discrepancy is part of a delicate diplomatic posture by the Obama administration on the complex overseas operation that involves a U.N. Security Council resolution, a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions. With the military mission shifting Thursday to a new phase of full NATO control after initial U.S. leadership, divisions among alliance partners and within Congress became more evident, exacerbated by the administration's differing military and political goals. President Barack Obama continues to insist that arming the Libyan rebels remained an option under consideration, while NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet ruled it out. At House and Senate committee hearings, Republicans grilled Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen on the U.S. role in Libya. ""To say this is not about regime change is crazy,"" said Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado. ""Of course this is about regime change. Why not just be honest with the American people?"" Obama has said the motivation for launching military action on March 19 was to prevent a massacre of civilians by Libyan military forces descending on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Since then, airstrikes carried out mostly with U.S. planes and missiles have taken out much of Gadhafi's anti-aircraft capability and destroyed ground forces and supply lines. While Gadhafi's forces have pulled back from Benghazi, they reclaimed territory from the rebels in recent days, leading to fears of a prolonged stalemate without stronger military support for the rebels. On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney noted the United States turned over control of the Libya mission to NATO that morning -- 12 days after it began -- to fulfill Obama's pledge to the nation that U.S. leadership would end within ""days, not weeks."" While Carney said the United States and its allies would keep up pressure on Gadhafi's government, he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end. Regardless of when, he said, ""the scope of the U.S. involvement will be limited"" and Obama continues to reject any possibility of sending in U.S. ground troops. At the same time, a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct operations supporting U.S. policy in Libya. A presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations, and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include ""advising on how to target the adversary, how to use the weapons they have, reconnaissance and counter surveillance."" Top administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting Libyan civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions, freezing assets and CIA operations -- aimed at hastening Gadhafi's departure. ""Does the United States have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in Libya or another country? It probably does. We probably do,"" Carney told reporters. ""Is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of Libya's future, the future ... interests of the United States and the region? No."" Obama's dual-track policy, with the military coalition protecting Libyan civilians while the United States pursues ""as a political, diplomatic and economic policy"" the end of Gadhafi's rule, is the best fit for the Libya situation, Carney insisted, citing the international backing for the military mission through a U.N. Security Council resolution and Arab League support. Critics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective. At a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Rep. Chris Gibson, R-New York, said the mission's ""military and political goals are not harmonized,"" while Coffman called it ""just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in U.S. military history."" On the Democratic side, liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio challenged Obama's legal power to commit U.S. forces to a combat role without congressional authorization. ""This is a clear and arrogant violation of our Constitution,"" Kucinich declared on the House floor. ""Even a war launched ostensibly for humanitarian reasons is still a war and only Congress can declare a war."" Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 2008, warned that pulling U.S. forces back to a supporting role under NATO control undermined the military mission at a key moment. ""For the United States to be withdrawing our unique offensive capabilities at this time sends the exact wrong signal both to our coalition partners as well as to the Gadhafi regime, especially to those Libyan officials whom we are trying to compel to break with Gadhafi,"" McCain said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. ""I need not remind our witnesses that the purpose of using military force is to achieve policy goals,"" McCain told Gates and Mullen. ""But in this case, not only are our military means out of alignment with our desired end of Gadhafi leaving power, we are now effectively stopping our strike missions all together without having accomplished our goal."" While Obama administration officials have described the continuing U.S. role in the military mission as supportive -- involving refueling, intelligence, surveillance and communications -- Gates said Thursday that U.S. strike aircraft such as A-10 and AC-130s could still be made available to NATO. However, he added that he believed NATO allies had the capacity to take out Libyan ground forces as necessary under the mission's mandate of protecting civilian populations. Appearing before both the House and Senate panels at separate hearings, Gates said the no-fly zone had been established and now needed to be sustained, but acknowledged ""you could have a situation in which you achieve the military goal but do not achieve the political goal.""

"(CNN) -- Sensing an imminent victory, the government recognized by the international community as the rightful ruler of blood-soaked Ivory Coast said Saturday the other side has committed atrocities, is losing its top generals to defections and is looking for ""cannon fodder"" for its last stand. The claims by Patrick Achi, spokesman for Alassane Ouattara, could not be independently verified by CNN and came amid a backdrop of extreme violence in portions of the country, including the western cocoa-producing town of Duekoue. The International Committee of the Red Cross said 800 people were shot to death there. A United Nations official put the death toll so far at 330. Guillaume Ngefa, the deputy human rights director at the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast, blamed 220 of the deaths on forces loyal to Ouattara, the man recognized by the United Nations and other global powers as the rightful president. Ngefa said pro-Laurent Gbagbo forces killed 100 people. The massacre occurred between Monday and Wednesday as Ouattara's Republican Forces led an offensive through the country to the commercial center of Abidjan, Ngefa said. ""We have evidence, we have pictures. This was retaliation,"" he said, referring to Ouattara's forces. The Ouattara camp denied the accusations. ""The government firmly rejects such accusations and denies any involvement by the Republican Forces of Cote d'Ivoire (the French name for Ivory Coast) in possible abuses,"" it said in a statement. ""The government wishes to establish that the situation is quite the opposite,"" it said. ""Forces loyal to former President Laurent Gbagbo, and its affiliated mercenaries and militias that have engaged in countless atrocities in western Cote d'Ivoire, during their flight before the advance of Republican Forces of Cote d'Ivoire."" Ngefa said so far, 320 bodies have been identified and the actual number could be much higher. He said the dead included civilians as well as mercenaries. Before the Duekoue killings, human right monitors documented 462 deaths in the Ivory Coast conflict. This was the single bloodiest incident yet. The International Committee of the Red Cross sent a team to Duekoue on Thursday and said most of the victims were civilians, said spokesman Kelnor Panglungtshang in Abidjan. ""They saw the bodies on the streets,"" he told CNN. ""There were so many."" Ngefa said a contingent of U.N. peacekeepers are stationed in Duekoue and are patrolling the town. The massacre illustrated the bloody nature of Ivory Coast's conflict, now in its fifth month. The violence erupted after a disputed November election led Gbagbo and Ouattara to both claim the presidency. The international community recognized Ouattara as the legitimate winner but Gbagbo refused to cede power and violence engulfed the nation, escalating this week with a major offensive launched by Ouattara's Republican Forces. Fierce fighting erupted for control of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's largest city. Gbagbo's forces were thought to be on the brink of defeat but regained key areas Saturday. They said they retook control of Ivory Coast's all-powerful state-run television network that has been the embattled president's voice in his standoff with Ouattara. An Abidjan resident, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said the network, which had gone dark after pro-Ouattara forces took control of the building, began broadcasting again Saturday morning. ""In truth, mercenaries, militias and Mr. Laurent Gbagbo's remaining loyalists have suffered a crushing defeat and are in total disarray,"" Achi said in a statement. ""Cornered, they play their last card not from RTI (state TV), but from a television transmitter, placed in a mobile truck, from which they call people, particularly our children, to form a human shield and become cannon fodder for their last redoubt."" The spokesman asked citizens to stay at home and ""remain calm."" Ouattara forces control the ""entire national territory"" and Abidjan, Achi said. Gbagbo's generals have abandoned ""this crazy undertaking"" and joined Ouattara's army or are refugees, the spokesman added. State television said an overnight curfew is in effect until Monday. The station, controlled by Ouattara supporters, broadcast reports by the head of the armed forces and police, saying they have sided with Ouattara. An American teacher, holed up in her Abidjan apartment, told CNN she was frightened and was trying desperately to get help from U.S. or French officials to help evacuate her. She said she last went to school Thursday and by that afternoon, she could hear the rattle of gunfire and the boom of explosions everywhere. She, too, was not identified for security reasons. ""I am very scared,"" she said, ""because the shelling is intense."" A U.N. peacekeeping patrol came under attack from Gbagbo's forces Saturday in an Abidjan suburb, a U.N. statement said. In the exchange of fire, five members of Gbagbo's forces were shot, the statement said. Gbagbo adviser Abdon Bayeto blamed the United Nations and global leaders -- including France and the United States -- for Ivory Coast's bloodshed by recognizing Ouattara as the legitimate president. Ouattara knows he lost the election, Bayeto told CNN, adding that Gbagbo is a true democrat. ""For 30 years there was no trouble in the country,"" he said. ""We are going to be victorious."" Gbagbo's whereabouts were unknown. He has not recently appeared in public and the French ambassador said his residence was empty. Some 1,400 foreigners, including 500 French citizens, have sought refuge at a French military camp, an unnamed spokeswoman for the French Defense Ministry said Saturday. The violence has also displaced 1 million of Abidjan's 4 million people. ""The situation on the streets has deteriorated to such an extent that it's just become too dangerous to go outside,"" said Henry Gray, a field coordinator with Medicins Sans Frontieres, a humanitarian medical group known in English as Doctors Without Borders. He said doctors were treating civilian casualties, many of them for gunshot and machete wounds, in several western towns. ""There's a lot of pillaging and looting going on, and if you're out on the streets, you're basically a target,"" Gray said. Abidjan, said Gray and others interviewed for this report, was now a shadow of its former self. Renzo Fricke, emergency manager with the group, said 15,000 displaced people remain at a Catholic mission shelter in Duekoue. ""These people are terrorized, and they lack everything, including food,"" Fricke said in a statement. ""They fear for their lives if they leave the confines of the mission to search for food.""

"(CNN) -- There'll be an old familiar face on ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" tonight -- at least to anyone born before 1998. Chewbacca, the most famous Wookiee of the Star Wars universe, is making his debut on the animated show's Season 3 finale. And this time, he's not voiced by some bear in San Diego, California, like Chewbacca was in the 1977 ""Star Wars"" movie (now referred to as ""A New Hope."") The original guy-in-the-hair-suit, Peter Mayhew, voices the furry alien he brought to life all those years ago, and according to him, Chewie is a little bit younger and less experienced than the Wookiee most fans are familiar with. ""You take the 'Clone Wars' Chewie and put him up against a picture of the 'Star Wars' Chewie and they're nearly identical,"" he said. ""The magic is around the eyes, but also they got the character right."" That's probably because ""Clone Wars"" supervising director Dave Filoni made sure Mayhew came to the Skywalker Ranch so the show's artists could learn how the original Chewbacca walked, moved his head and made facial expressions. ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" is an animated show from Lucasfilm and Cartoon Network (whose parent company, Time Warner, also owns CNN). It chronicles the adventures of the Jedi knights -- including a pre-Darth Vader Anakin Skywalker -- during a time of unrest in a galaxy far, far away. The movies, ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002) and ""Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) feature action from ""Clone Wars,"" as well, but the cartoon takes place before the latter. ""Clone Wars"" has also been diving into characters from what George Lucas and fans refer to as the ""Star Wars"" extended universe, something Filoni is thoroughly geeking out about. ""The EU presents a ton of different ideas on all kinds of levels, and I don't think I would say there's anything that's out of bounds. But I am very careful with it because there are huge, huge fans of those things in very specific niches,"" he said. ""Like [the near-human Jedi tracker] Quinlan Vos was such a big deal, I thought, when we brought him out,"" he said. ""The interesting thing that I've come to realize is that a lot of kids' first contact with Star Wars is 'Clone Wars.' So they have a completely different point of view than like the older fans that I'll talk to at conventions. And those two groups have completely different concerns,"" Filoni said. 'Robot Chicken,' Lucas and 'Buffy' For example, many young fans of ""Clone Wars"" believe that the clones and Anakin Skywalker are really good guys, he said. But older fans who have seen ""Revenge of the Sith"" know that the ultimate betrayal is brewing. And older fans know about Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Darth Vader and other characters that, although are not portrayed in ""Clone Wars,"" are tied to the events that unfold within the cartoon series. Tonight's introduction of Chewbacca might be the first time some kids come into contact with the tall, lovable Wookiee, Filoni said. ""So now, they'll know him as this character that was on the 'Clone Wars' with the sofitano, and when they see 'A New Hope' they'll look at him and go, 'Oh, that's the guy that was with the [Anakin Skywalker's Jedi padawan, Ahsoka Tano],' which is completely different from how we older fans remember it,"" he said. Mayhew, always mobbed at fan conventions, knows that today's children will love Chewie just as much as children in the 1970s and 1980s did. ""I think it's because he is so friendly,"" Mayhew said. ""And he is a cuddly teddy bear. He's like the next door neighbor who looks after everybody. He's the big brother, the security blanket, and this appeals to a lot of people. Chewie is very special to a lot of people, and especially to me."" How Katie used ""The Force"" Older fans love Chewbacca for his heroism, said Kathleen Saracen, the manager of Titan Games and Comics in Smyrna, Georgia. ""In a nutshell, he goes on to be a great hero and he dies saving a lot of lives,"" she said. ""He gets one of the coolest deaths in the Star Wars universe. A planet crashes into him. Well, a moon, technically."" Filoni knows there are those fans who scrutinize the introduction of Chewbacca. ""When we do a character like Chewbacca and there's an immense amount of continuity going on with the icon characters like that, we have to be very careful. So in some ways the less I say about specifics the better, you know? I don't even have to get in to some of that stuff to tell the stories that I'm telling,"" Filoni said. Why would some fans be so worked up about whether or not ""Clone Wars"" gets Chewbacca right? ""We really grew up with these movies,"" Saracen said. ""These were the things we turned to when we were bored or we were upset. In my case, my parents weren't home, and these were my babysitters sometimes. Certainly not every day, but I definitely watched ""Star Wars"" a ton when I was growing up. And I think it inhabits a place in your psyche and your heart where you sit down, you watch it and everything's OK.""","Ready for a dose of Chewbacca?

"Cancun, Mexico (CNN) -- Delegates at the United Nations climate change conference in Cancun, Mexico, approved an agreement early Saturday, despite objections from Bolivia and with praise from the United States government. On Saturday, the White House said President Barack Obama congratulated Mexican President Felipe Calderon on the conference's conclusion in a phone call. ""Obama congratulated President Calderon for his leadership and Mexico's excellent work chairing the Cancun conference to a successful conclusion,"" the White House said in a statement, ""that... advances the effort to address the challenge of climate change."" Bolivia's government, meanwhile, claimed rich nations ""bullied and cajoled"" other countries into accepting a deal on their terms. Protesting the overrule of its country's vote, Bolivia's Foreign Ministry called the Cancun text ""hollow"" and ineffective in a written statement. ""Its cost will be measured in human lives. History will judge harshly,"" the statement said, adding that developing nations will face the worst consequences of climate change. The agreement includes plans to create a $100 billion fund to help developing nations deal with global warming and to increase efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation. Mexico's Calderon hailed the deal, the culmination of an marathon overnight session at the end of two weeks of talks. ""It begins a new era of cooperation in climate change. They are the first steps in this long and renewed campaign,"" he said. Christiana Figueres, the UN's chief negotiator at the conference, said the results had ""reignited"" hope in climate change talks. ""Nations have shown they can work together under a common roof, to reach consensus on a common cause. They have shown that consensus in a transparent and inclusive process can create opportunity for all,"" she said in a statement. But Bolivia said Saturday's agreement did not go far enough. A key sticking point was the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012 and sets greenhouse gas emissions targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European Union. ""For us, this is not a step forward. It is a step back, because what is being done here is postponing without limit the discussion on the Kyoto Protocol,"" Bolivian Ambassador Pablo Solon told delegates early Saturday. The agreement does not specify what will happen once the Kyoto Protocol expires, postponing the debate until the next scheduled climate talks in South Africa in 2011. Despite Bolivia's objections, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa, who chaired the summit, said a decision had been reached and swiftly banged her gavel, saying the text had been approved. ""It is less than what is needed, but it represents a significant step in the right direction,"" Calderon told delegates. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. President Barack Obama praises conclusion of the Cancun climate conference .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Rosalind Cron left home in the 1940s to join a teenage girl jazz band called the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, she had no idea what it would be like, as a white girl, traveling with the predominantly black band. At the time, Cron said she thought ""Jim Crow"" was a man they were supposed to meet in the South. ""I didn't realize it was a law, and a very strict law -- laws, plural,"" she said. State and local ordinances that mandated separate public facilities for blacks and whites made it illegal for Cron to share facilities with her band members. Cron felt the discrimination because she lived on their tour bus with the other girls, hiding her race. For three years, she said, they were like her sisters. She spent several hours in jail in El Paso, Texas, in 1944 when authorities didn't believe the story she had made up that her father was white and her mother was black. ""They went though my wallet and there was a picture of my mother and dad right in front of the house,"" she said. She was sprung a few hours later when the band's manager brought two black girls to the jail who claimed to be Cron's cousins. By that time, according to Cron, the authorities that were holding her were glad to get rid of her. ""They just told us never to return. And as far as I know, we didn't,"" she said. The risks were worth it to play her saxophone with what became known as the nation's first integrated, female jazz band. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm were founded at Piney Woods School in Mississippi in 1937, in part as a way for the students to help pay for their education. They recruited members of different races to help with the ""international"" part of their image. Willie Mae Wong had a Chinese father, a mixed-race mother, and no visible musical skills when she was recruited to the group as a 15-year-old. She was out on the street playing stickball when they picked her up. ""The director of the music was named White,"" Wong said. ""They called me 'White's Rabbit' because he had to spend more time with me to teach me the beat."" The name ""Rabbit"" has stuck to this day. In 1941, the group separated from the school and went professional. They traveled on a bus to gigs across the United States, including venues like the Apollo Theater in New York and the Howard Theater in Washington. During World War II, the Sweethearts traveled to France and Germany as part of a USO tour in 1945. Pictures and mementos from the International Sweethearts of Rhythm are on display at the Smithsonian's American History museum for their 10th annual Jazz Appreciation Month celebration in April. Six members of the band were in Washington this week to reminisce. ""It was a privilege to come from Mississippi and go and see the other parts of the world,"" said Helen Jones, who played the trombone from the band's founding until it disbanded. ""All I ever wanted to do was play a trumpet,"" Sadye Pankey told a group gathered at the museum. And as for music education today, she feels bad for today's students. ""Some of our schools in our country now have abolished the music, and it's not fair,"" she said. Cron told the group that if music is your passion, you need to stick with it. ""Don't let anyone come between you and your horns, or music,"" she added.","International Sweethearts of Rhythm toured in the U.S. and Europe in the Big Band Era .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal is looking forward to renewing his ""special"" tennis rivalry with Roger Federer in the semifinals of the Masters Series event in Miami on Friday. The duo, who have won 110 ATP Tour titles between them, will meet on U.S. soil for the first time since 2005 -- which was also the last year they clashed at the last-four stage of a tournament, the French Open. Nadal battled past Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych in Thursday's second quarterfinal after No. 3 Federer received easy passage when Frenchman Gilles Simon retired with a neck injury while 3-0 down in the opening set. Nadal was beaten by Federer in five sets in the 2005 Miami final, having stunned the Swiss as a 17-year-old in the third round of the same event the previous year. Since then Nadal has won 13 of their 20 clashes -- 12 of them in finals. ""Very few times we've played in the semifinals of a tournament. The rest of the matches are finals and important for big titles,"" the Spaniard told the ATP website. Boxer Haye tips Murray to fight back . ""It's always special to play against him and have these matches, very important matches for both of our careers: finals of Roland Garros, finals of Wimbledon, of Australian Open, a lot of finals in Masters 1000s. ""That makes the rivalry very, very special. I don't know if rivals in the rest of the history of tennis played as many matches as we've played."" Nadal will go into the showdown troubled by a worrying problem in his right arm, which affected his movement in the 6-2 3-6 6-3 win over last year's runner-up Berdych -- who he also beat in the 2010 Wimbledon final. ""First time in my life I felt something like this, it's really strange. Especially since the left arm I could do aggressive movements, but the right was really strange. Seriously, I couldn't understand during the match what happened,"" the two-time Miami runner-up said. Federer, also the 2006 champion at Crandon Park, has a 5-2 advantage over Nadal in hard-court events. ""I think in the beginning, early on in my career when I became the world No. 1, I didn't really have that rival, and I was very happy about it,"" the 16-time grand slam champion said. Tired Clijsters crashes out in Miami . ""I was just able to win, win, win, and dominate and go on and lose, you know, 10 matches in two years kind of thing. That was quite incredible. So in the beginning I guess I struggled to embrace the rivalry I had with Rafa. ""Only later on I was able to say, 'This is actually quite cool.' Sleeveless, pirate pants, you name it -- long hair, lefty, spins, more with the flat shots and so forth, and double-handed against one-handed, lefty against righty. I think it all kind of made sense, and I was able to embrace it then. ""I think we had some good times in the past, and they have changed into what it is today. Really respectful and helping each other for good causes, foundation matches, you name it, for tsunamis. We've done so many things together. It's been a lot of fun."" The winner of the Nadal-Federer tie is likely to face a player who is threatening to end their dominance of the men's game, Novak Djokovic. The Serbian is unbeaten in 22 matches this year, and defeated both icons on his way to victory at Indian Wells last time out. His semifinal win over Federer in the California desert lifted him to second in the rankings, and he will be seeking his second Miami title if he can beat new American No. 1 Mardy Fish for the sixth successive time in Friday's opening semifinal. In the women's event, two-time runner-up Maria Sharapova will play 2009 champion Victoria Azarenka in Saturday's final. Sharapova, who will return to the top-10 for the first time since 2009 following her recent run of good results, avenged her Australian Open defeat by Germany's Andrea Petkovic. The Russian triumphed 3-6 6-0 6-2, winning 11 games in a row after losing the first set. ""I'm really happy I'm back in the finals here,"" the 2005 and 2006 losing finalist said of her first Miami outing in four years. ""I'm almost lucky to be here. I had a tough one the other night and another three-setter today. Andrea has been playing the best tennis of her career and beat some good players here, so I was really happy I was able to change things around after losing the first set."" Eighth seed Azarenka of Belarus followed up her win over defending champion Kim Clijsters with a 6-3 6-3 win over Vera Zvonareva that ended the Russian's hopes of reclaiming the No. 2 ranking from the Belgian this weekend.

"(CNN) -- International investors looking to tap into Zimbabwe's economy should not be deterred by its political problems, the country's finance minister has said. Tendai Biti, who's been trying to steer Zimbabwe onto a path of economic stability -- a task he's described in the past as the most difficult job in the world -- has been on a mission to drum up foreign investment to help boost the country's fragile economy. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow, Biti said there's no doubt his country ""needs to get its politics right, which is why an election is inevitable in Zimbabwe."" He stressed, however, that the country's doors are still open to foreign investments, urging the international community to engage more with Zimbabwe. ""What is also undisputable is that despite the political, it is still a place where one can actually invest and can actually get good returns,"" Biti said. Two years ago, a coalition government was formed between Biti's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. There were hopes that the stabilization brought about by the political agreement would see new foreign investment in the country. But political uncertainty and lack of clarity in financial policies still represent major concerns for foreign businesses. Zimbabwe's Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act, which was passed by a Zanu-PF-controlled parliament last year, requires foreign businesses to submit plans within five years for transferring 51% of their investments to black Zimbabweans. But Biti says the law doesn't mean expropriation of foreign companies. ""There's a lot of mistrust in the Zimbabwean economy, but mistrust comes out of ignorance,"" he says. ""You have to understand what you are dealing with and a lot of people don't understand what they're dealing with, because there's a lot of negativity that has jumped out on the internet and in the newspapers."" Biti, who inherited an economy battered by record hyperinflation and 90% unemployment, says he doesn't underestimate the political difficulties that still exist in the country and the uncertainty over the power-sharing agreement. ""I'm not sweeping it under the carpet, which is why we need a new constitution, which is why we need the rule of law, which is why we need respect for each other, including respect for property rights,"" he says. Last year, Biti's efforts to improve Zimbabwe's economy seemed to be given a boost when the country was allowed to sell diamonds from the Marange diamond fields, 66,000 hectares of land near Zimbabwe's border with Mozambique. Overall, Zimbabwe says it has a stockpile of Marange diamonds estimated to be worth about $1.7 billion. But according to Biti, the precious stones have not yet proven to be the ""El Dorado that many people thought,"" contributing only $35 million to the country's coffers last year. ""Part of the problem lies in the illegal smuggling that we think is still happening, and part of the problem lies in the fact that we need the Kimberly Process stamp of approval,"" says Biti, referring to the group which monitors trade in the precious stones to stop the use of blood diamonds to fuel conflicts. Zimbabwe's harvest of diamonds in the Marange district has sparked controversy in recent years after accusations by groups such as Human Rights Watch and Global Witness that military-run syndicates were funneling money from the diamond fields to Mugabe's party. But Biti says he has no evidence of that. ""What I can tell you is that this is such a fungible mineral found over a huge space of land, close to a very long border in a very inaccessible mountainous region, so anyone and anybody can smuggle,"" he says. He adds, however, that there should be action to tackle the problem. ""We are not the first country to discover diamonds, which is why we want to be part of the Kimberly Process certification scheme, "" he says. ""We believe we can comply, we believe we can operate consistent within the international standards.""","Tendai Biti has been leading Zimbabwe's efforts to stabilize its economy .

"(Parenting.com) -- My 3-year-old twin boys and I are camped out on the terminal floor at the Denver airport, halfway through a five-hour flight delay and surrounded by plastic planes, action figures, and lollipop wrappers. Soon another set of young boys is lured to our sticky little campsite by the tinny, baritone catchphrases coming from a Buzz Lightyear toy. ""Twins?"" their mom asks, after the four boys negotiate the rules of engagement (the newbies could play with Buzz but not Spidey). ""Mine, too,"" she confirms. With common ground established, we begin sharing the complaints of our kind (""I have to buy two of everything!""). Parenting.com: Answering kids' toughest questions . As our kids play superheroes, I'm introduced to her husband, who shares the same strong Boston accent of his wife. We're all chatting amiably when my wife, Emily, returns from checking on our flight status. ""You guys sisters?"" the mom asks. And here is the moment I hate: the Explaining of the Situation (EOTS). Most of the time, the EOTS is not a big deal at all, but then again, we live in New York City. Not just New York City, but a liberal enclave in Brooklyn called Park Slope, where, depending on the time of day at the local playground, same-sex parents just might outnumber straight ones. I recognize, though, that not everyone is down with two women or two men raising kids together, so there's the chance this family might quietly pack up their stuff and build their own campsite somewhere else upon the EOTS. Will our impromptu party suddenly become unbearably awkward? ""No, we're not sisters,"" I say, as I have hundreds of times before (Emily and I do look somewhat similar). ""We're partners."" My new friend brightens and says, ""Oh, who carried?"" Who carried?! After I tell her that it was me who carried, we swap birth stories. Her husband leans over to tell Emily that he gained 25 pounds worth of sympathy weight. ""Did you have the same problem?"" he asks. Clearly, the only person there with any judgments or preconceived notions was me. I shouldn't have been surprised. In the five years that Em and I have been married (no, it's not legal), and in the three and a half years since we had the boys, that's pretty much the way it's gone. Parenting.com: 5 tantrum stoppers that actually work . We've received nothing but love, support or, surprisingly, plain old indifference from friends, family and strangers. That apathy says a lot about how much a part of the social fabric we have become. Truth be told, we're neither sensational nor worth remarking upon. We're just the New Normal. At home with June and Jane . There are approximately 1 million gay families raising approximately 2 million kids in the United States, according to the Family Equality Council, though it's hard to know our exact numbers since census data doesn't exactly count us. We have the highest population percentages in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, and Boston, but we're not just on the coasts or in major urban centers. Utah, Hawaii, Wyoming, and Nevada all rank as top-ten states with the largest number of same-sex spouses per 1,000 households. In fact, nearly 30 percent of the people who responded to a recent Parenting.com poll have a friend or relative who's a same-sex parent. ""You can throw a dart at the map and find at least one set of same-sex parents wherever it lands,"" says Ellen Kahn, the family project director for the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender civil rights organization. Parenting.com: What to do when your kids is bullied . Wherever we live, it turns out that we're raising some pretty well-adjusted kids. The U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS), which followed the children of 154 lesbian mothers over 25 years, reported that our teens had fewer behavioral problems and better school performance than their peers with straight parents. Nanette Gartrell, M.D., the lead NLLFS researcher, was not surprised by the results. ""The children we studied were highly desired,"" she says. ""They didn't result from a broken condom or too much alcohol. Their parents worked hard to have them and didn't take the privilege of having kids lightly. They took parenting classes and educated themselves. That's what makes for a good outcome, no matter what the family structure. They built strong communities for their families from the beginning."" I don't think any gay parent thinks her or his kids are better than anyone else's. But what the findings do prove is that our offspring are no more likely to be messed up than anyone else's. We're not raising freaks. Our kids are totally, boringly normal. And that's a salient argument against those who think that having gay parents is patently unhealthy for children. The fight to be normal . It would be naive, of course, to say that it's all rosy for gay Americans and their families. Most polls show that about 50 percent of the country is still opposed to legalized marriage for gay couples, and the lack of marital rights has a huge impact on financial and legal status once kids are brought into the mix. Parenting.com: How to teach spirituality to kids your own way . Without a federally or state-recognized union, the biological children of one partner have no legal connection to their nonbiological parent. In order for the nonbiological parent to ensure medical benefits for his or her own kids, or to assume custody if, God forbid, his or her partner dies, they have to go through a process called second-parent adoption. Emily and I did this. In a nutshell, you fill out a lot of paperwork with your lawyer, a social worker makes several visits to your home, and then you appear in front of a judge to testify on your own behalf. It's a humiliating and costly ($2,000 to $3,000) process. Legal issues aren't the only ones same-sex parents face. Denise Freeman DeCandia and her partner, Cari DeCandia, were both raised Christian and value their faith. So when Denise gave birth to their son, Cortland, eight months ago, it was important to them and their families to have him baptized. They began looking for more liberal denominations near their Cary, North Carolina, home. So far, they've asked four churches to baptize their son, and received refusals from all of them. One reverend wrote Cari, ""We'd be delighted to have you visit us...but unfortunately I would find it impossible to baptize a child being raised in a same-sex partnership."" He closed the note with the words ""Every Blessing."" The rest of U.S.: America's opinion . So, yes, there's room for improvement. When I wrote a story for Babytalk (Parenting's sister publication) about my pregnancy, we got a letter from a woman who said she ""threw up in her mouth"" when I mentioned Emily. I laughed it off, but it really stung. Fortunately, we received dozens of positive letters to counteract the effect of the handful of negative ones. Parenting.com: The best remedies for rude tween behavior . In fact, a recent survey by the Pew Research Center and commissioned by Time magazine found that most Americans' view of what constitutes a family is loosening. Three out of five people said they view a same-sex couple with kids as a family, too. Kendra Martin, a mom of two in Hayesville, a small mountain town in North Carolina, is a classic example of the shifting attitude. Her cousin is a lesbian who has an 8-year-old son with her partner. Before the boy's birth, Martin admits she was worried about how he would fare. ""I was concerned it would be hard for a son not to have a father, and I thought he would be teased by his peers. I just thought, 'Why bring someone into the world when you know he'll have challenges?' But I've realized their son has no more difficulties than any other child. I've learned all kids get teased, and it's the parents' job to help them deal with hardship. All parents have the same issues."" ""Polling clearly shows that Americans are more comfortable than ever with gay people becoming parents,"" says Jennifer Chrisler, executive director of the Family Equality Council, who has two kids with her wife, Cheryl Jacques. ""The bottom line is that we are parents first, and that creates a common ground. Bedtime, bathtime, playground, homework: We all speak the same language. To our neighbors, we're not the 'lesbian moms.' We're Jen and Cheryl, raising Tim and Tom."" In other words, with all of the demands they bring and liberties they curtail, our kids -- in the end -- may be what forces us all to simply be what we are: a family.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli settlers damaged cars and tried to burn down a house in Palestinian villages in the West Bank Monday night and Tuesday, police told CNN. The actions followed removal of three illegal shacks in a Jewish settlement. These incidents are what some Israelis call ""price tag"" actions: Any activity against settlements and outposts is met by violence against Palestinian property. Israeli police removed three illegal shacks Monday in the Jewish outpost of Havat Gilad. Police and civil administration representatives were stoned by the settlers on the scene. Eight people were arrested in the incident, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. Monday night, Israeli settlers blocked roads in Jerusalem, demonstrating against the outpost's removal. The demonstrators burned tires and clashed with police. Twenty-three demonstrators were arrested, Rosenfeld said. Three other settlers were arrested in the West Bank, he said. There were also several incidents of torching cars in villages around Hebron on Monday night. On Tuesday, people tried to burn down a house in the village Hiwara, south of Nablus. The incidents are under investigation, Rosenfeld said. ""We call upon the international community not to remain silent ... the people call us on a daily basis to protect their lives because they are afraid (of) the settlers,"" said Ghassan Douglass, a Palestinian official in charge of the settlement activity north of the West Bank. The Palestinian owner of the burned house, Rami Edmaidi, told CNN that a group of Israeli settlers broke the window with an iron club, threw a Molotov cocktail into the bedroom and fled. Due to the thick smoke, his brother and sister-in-law had to be taken to the hospital for breathing problems, he said. Edmaidi said this is not the first time incidents like this have occurred. ""Yesterday my uncle's house was also attacked by the same settlers."" Douglass told CNN the situation has worsened since February 18, when the United States vetoed a U.N. resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank. ""This Thursday the (Israeli) right wing are calling for the day of rage. There isn't any international party able to stop them either."" American-sponsored talks between Israelis and Palestinians fell apart in September when Israel resumed settlement construction in the occupied West Bank after a 10-month freeze. Palestinians have indicated they will not resume talks until all Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is frozen. Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel, which annexed the eastern part of Jerusalem in 1967, considers the entire city to be its sovereign capital, a claim not recognized by many in the international community.","After 3 illegal shacks removed, settlers get violent, police say .

"(CNN) -- Mahela Jayawardene has told CNN that cricket has helped the World Cup-chasing Sri Lanka team recover from their darkest hour. As the co-hosts prepare to square off against rivals India in the Cricket World Cup final on Saturday, the batsman said the terror attack unleashed on his team in Pakistan two years ago is never far from their minds. Jayawardene was one of six Sri Lanka players to be injured when masked gunman fired on the team bus in Lahore. Six police officers and two civilians were killed in the attack. Though the events of 2009 will never be forgotten, the 33-year-old says the team have moved on as they eye their second World Cup triumph. Jayawardene told CNN: ""Once you go through an episode like Lahore, I think you always do think about it. ""I mean I wish that is something no one has to go through but I think the Sri Lankan team has moved on after that and playing cricket has helped us to do that as well."" The final is to be held in Mumbai which has also been blighted by terror. A co-coordinated shooting and bomb attack in 2008 killed 164 and injured over 300. But Jayawardene says Sri Lanka will be focused firmly on cricket on Saturday. He said: ""Security is always important and there are experts to handle that so we let them do their job and we accommodate that and we try to focus on the game and what we can control -- that's the only thing we can do."" Even for a cricket-mad region the hype surrounding the final has gone into overdrive, with the co-hosts set to battle it out at the Wankhede Stadium in front of a huge television audience. Jayawardene says India and Sri Lanka were destined to meet each other. ""I don't think anyone scripted it better than this, it's absolutely fantastic,"" he said. ""I mean you work so hard for quite some time to get to this situation and you know you're just one step away from being World Champions."" Jayawardene and his teammates will have to brave a fierce atmosphere inside the stadium but he says Sri Lanka want to repay their own fans for ""brilliant"" support throughout the tournament. ""We have a different way of celebrating our cricket with a lot of music, a lot of dancing and a rich culture in that as well, and that goes down to our school cricket as well,"" he explained. ""When you have a big game, you have these bands playing, lots of music, lots of rhythmic moves where all the cricketers, even on the field, we feel that rhythm, so we had that in Colombo for the quarterfinals, the semifinals, the entire group stage, all the stadiums were fully packed for each of our games, so the Sri Lankan fans have done their bit -- it's up to us now."" As one of Sri Lanka's experienced players Jayawardene says it is vital he and the other veterans of the team help to ease any nerves the younger stars have been feeling since the semifinal success over New Zealand. ""We wanted them to enjoy the moment as well because these kinds of moments don't come our way very often but at the same time, especially playing in India, there will be a lot of distractions, a lot of people want to know how you're doing and at the same time, there's a lot of things happening in India. Are you going to the World Cup? Go to CNN iReport to send video and photos. ""Definitely, I think once you play in a final you know how to absorb that pressure and how to try to control things better. There are already about five or six guys who have already done that at the highest stage so hopefully the nerves will be calmer.""","Mahela Jayawardene says Sri Lanka want to win the World Cup for their 'brilliant' fans .

"(CNN) -- Japan's national football team will not play at the prestigious Copa America tournament in July due to the earthquake and tsunami that caused devastation in the island nation last month. The 2011 Asian Cup champions had been one of two countries invited to take part as guests at the 12-team South American event, due to be held in Argentina from July 1-24. But Japan Football Association president Junji Ogura traveled to Paraguay on Monday to meet his South American counterparts and ask that the ""Samurai Blue"" not participate alongside Mexico. ""He believes the priority now is to try to save lives and reconstruction,"" CONMEBOL spokesman Nestor Benitez said in a statement on Monday. ""On top of that, the Japanese FA has organizational problems due to damage to infrastructure."" Marvelous Mourinho record falls -- but will it ever be beaten? Japan's J-League has been suspended for five rounds until April 23 to save the electricity used to stage night matches, as the country tries to rebuild with more than 11,000 people killed and over 15,000 missing -- while problems still remain at a crippled nuclear power plant. Japan had been due to play in Group A with Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia, but a team from the Central American region such as Honduras or Costa Rica may now be invited. ""We had asked to be invited to the South American championship, first of all. Therefore, it is not for us to make a decision unilaterally,"" Ogura told Japanese media before heading to Asuncion.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You can almost picture it now: Paris Hilton swallowed up by a tight-fitting futuristic designer space suit -- one hand waving at the on-flight camera, the other clasping a Dior ""space traveler"" handbag. Tighter fit: Massachusetts Insititute of Technology researchers are working on a new, sleeker space suit. Oh yes, with the age of space tourism upon us, space fashion looks set to become the next step into this infinite world of adventure. One factor certain to drive the fashion-crazy towards space concepts is the super-wealthy space tourists (reportedly paying a minimum price of $200,000 per seat) who are set to make trips into orbit an everyday occurrence for those with deep pockets. And space-inspired fashion is already making cosmic waves in the design world. Earlier this year a space fashion show was held in Yokohama, Japan and  featured at the Japan Aerospace 2008 exhibition. Last year Louis Vuitton held an exhibition at the Espace Louis Vuitton in Paris titled ""The Temptation of Space"" which included an installation by legendary French designer Philippe Starck. That show followed two international space fashion shows in Japan and the U.S. David Jankowski, president and founder of DestinySpace, one of the organizations actively involved in the world of apparel for the final frontier, said space fashion is more than just a fad. ""Space fashion is important and will be in the next generation of space suits. I don't know how much we will see at the beginning because simpler versions of space attire are going to be what people are interested in,"" he said. ""But there will be some sense of fashion involved. I would like something futuristic if I was going up into space."" Jankowski said the organizer of the space fashion shows, Misuzu Onuki, had gone to great lengths to prepare the shows, and they had attracted massive amounts of interest. Forecasting that space travelers would soon become fashion-conscious, Jankowski likened the situation to the beginnings of commercial air travel. ""Women had certain dresses and jackets to wear just for flying in the airplane. Back then it was this brand new experience and you had to dress for it."" And there is no doubt space fashion is being taken seriously. DestinySpace and a similar company called Rocketplane are looking at forming a space fashion organization with other partners, while the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is looking at a new slim-fit space suit. NASA also is looking to design a new ""Constellation"" suit especially for space travelers. Jankowski said the space fashion shows were important for a variety of reasons. ""The event got people to start thinking about space tourism. The whole reason behind the show was to get people thinking about it and make it something that everyone can participate in."" While space travel may be inaccessible to many, a fashion show is something the average person can participate in, he said. The shows had produced a variety of results, Jankowski said. ""Some of those I can see being worn in space, but others just weren't practical. Some of the bigger gowns were 'space-inspired fashion,' but people need to be comfortable and free in space, so I'm not sure they would work."" So where will the line between fashion and practicality fall? Jeff Feige of U.S. space suit designers Orbital Outfitters felt there would be a move towards fashion-oriented space suit design in the next few years. ""I think we will see a move towards thinking about the fashion side of things, but at the same time people still want something that works,"" he said. ""At the end of the day it's survival equipment, so how can you make that look good? You just do the best you can."" A company related to Orbital Outfitters, Global Effects, has made space suits for many major space-related movies, including ""Apollo 13"" and ""Armageddon."" ""If you name the space film, we have probably made the suits for it,"" Feige said, reeling off a list. He felt the focus of space fashion will become more concentrated on real space hardware, rather than just space-inspired fashion. In terms of design changes, Feige said a move towards a slimmer suit was inevitable. ""What we have started doing is making them less baggy when they're not in use."" However, with standard suits designed using ""mechanical counter-pressure,"" where the wearer was literally in a bag full of gas, Feige was still unsure about how the MIT technology would develop. ""MIT's suit uses the material to push on you. That works well for the arms and legs, but wherever you have non-uniform parts of the body, it's not so good,"" he said. He said there were some production issues facing all space suit-making projects. ""The technology is not so hard, it's how to make lots of them and how to make them more cheaply."" Still, Feige was confident that more space travelers would mean more demand, more companies, more technological breakthroughs and eventually more fashionable suits.","NASA, Orbital Outfitters and MIT all involved in designing new space suits .

"(CNN) -- Three men whose achievements are being recognized for their role in changing the world are the inaugural winners of the Gorbachev awards. The three winners, including CNN founder Ted Turner, were personally selected by Mikhail Gorbachev and honored at a gala event to celebrate his 80th birthday in London on Wednesday. The other winners are Timothy Berners-Lee, the British physicist and computer scientist credited with inventing the World Wide Web; and Evans Wadongo, a Kenyan engineer who invented a solar lamp that would become a clean, healthy alternative to wood fires as a source of light for tens of thousands of Africans. Wadongo was also named a CNN Hero in 2010. ""These three people have each, in their own way, changed the world for their fellow men and women in ways which affect all our lives,"" Gorbachev said in a news release. The awards are the centerpiece of the Gorby 80 gala concert, which brought together artists from all over the world to honor the former leader of the Soviet Union. The event was hosted by actors Sharon Stone and Kevin Spacey. The concert raised money for cancer charities, including MacMillian Cancer Support in England, and the Raisa Gorbachev Children's Institute for Transplantology and Hematology in St. Petersburg, Russia. The awards have been organized into three categories reflecting reforms Gorbachev undertook as the Soviet leader. Berners-Lee was given the award for perestroika, or reform, for inventing the World Wide Web in 1989, changing the way the world shares information. The award for glasnost, or openness, was given to Turner, who helped transform the world's media with his 24-hour global news operation. Wadongo, 25, won the award for contributions to modern science and technology, or uskoreniye. ""Each and every one possesses the ability to make a difference and the Gorbachev Awards have been established to those people who achieve this and to provide inspiration to all of us to try,"" said the former Russian president and Nobel Peace Prize Winner.","CNN founder Ted Turner one of three men honored with Gorbachev Awards .

"(CNN) -- Argentina star Gonzalo Higuain has made a surprise return to Real Madrid's squad for Saturday's La Liga match against Sporting Gijon, but the Spanish giants fear Cristiano Ronaldo could be ruled out of their next two games. Ronaldo, who has scored 27 goals in 27 league matches this season, has a hamstring problem which could see him miss Tuesday's European Champions League quarterfinal first leg against Tottenham Hotspur in the Bernabeu. The 26-year-old has been joined on the sidelines by France striker Karim Benzema and Brazil defender Marcelo and the trio look certain to miss this weekend's match as well as the clash with English Premier League Spurs. ""Regarding Cristiano, Marcelo and Benzema, they will only be available to play against Bilbao [on April 9]. That is what the reports that the medical staff say,"" coach Jose Mournho told the club's official website. Higuain, 23, underwent surgery in January for a slipped disc he suffered in November and initially returned to training in February. ""Not even the best forecasts could have predicted that Higuain would be ready to play so quickly,"" Mourinho added. ""We are very happy for him. His recovery is an important and positive surprise. His rehab was a well-organized process. It's a great surprise because we may have as many as 15 matches left to play and he is an important addition."" The nine-time European champions are currently second in the Spanish La Liga table heading into their contest with Sporting, five points behind arch rivals Barcelona. Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp also has injury worries, with winger Gareth Bale and central defender William Gallas both doubts for the Madrid clash. Bale, who has scored four goals in Europe's premier club competition this season, has a hamstring problem, while France international William Gallas is battling an injury to his knee. When asked whether the duo, who have been ruled out of Saturday's English Premier League clash with Wigan, would feature against Real, Redknapp told Spurs' website: ""We'll have to wait and see. ""Gareth's hamstring is still tight and you can never tell with a hamstring injury, until you really push it, you are not sure. William is struggling at the moment."" Tottenham, currently fifth in England's top flight, are battling with Roberto Mancini's Manchester City for fourth position and a place in next season's Champions League. City, who are four points ahead of Spurs in fourth place, have been hit with their own injury blow, with the news Germany defender Jerome Boateng could be out for the rest of the campaign. Boateng, who joined City from Hamburg in June 2010, will require an operation on a knee injury sustained while playing in Germany's win over Kazahkstan on Saturday.","Gonzalo Higuain has returned to the Real Madrid squad for their match with Gijon .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Notions of a cease-fire in Libya quickly faded Saturday as a battle raged for control of the oil town of al-Brega, where rebel fighters claimed they had lost fighters and vehicles to NATO airstrikes. Airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters, spokesmen for the Libyan opposition said Saturday. Seven others were wounded. NATO was investigating the incident, a spokeswoman said Saturday. ""NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously, but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground,"" NATO's Oana Lungescu said. ""Clearly, if someone fires at one of our aircraft, of course they have the right to defend themselves."" Rebel spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said opposition fighters had retaken al-Brega after a night of heavy fighting with Moammar Gadhafi's forces. But it was not immediately clear who commanded control Saturday of the coastal city that has now changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war. Meanwhile, in Misrata, east of Tripoli, two mortars landed at a medical clinic Saturday evening, causing one death and numerous injuries, said a medical official with the city's main hospital. The doctor, who was not identified for security reasons, told CNN the clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks, but was being guarded by opposition ""fighters and young people."" One person was killed and 15 injured, said the doctor, who was caring for the wounded. Five had serious injuries, including head and chest trauma, he said. Forces loyal to Gadhafi showed no signs of backing down after officials spurned an opposition cease-fire proposal. Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on Friday that rebels were not ""really serious"" about the offer, which he said included ""silly conditions."" ""They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people, who are holding up arms, who are tribal, violent, no unified leadership, al Qaeda links, and no one knows who they are. If this is not mad, then I don't know what it is,"" he said. ""We will not leave our cities. We will not stop protecting our civilians."" His comments came after Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out cease-fire conditions that included freedom of expression for the Libyan people and the removal of snipers, mercenaries and militias from western cities. Ultimately, he said, the opposition's goal remains regime change in Libya. Ghoga sought to clarify the opposition's position Saturday. ""There is no, and was no, negotiation on a cease-fire with Colonel Gaddafi's dictatorship,"" he said at a Bengahzi news conference. He repeated the opposition demands that Gadhafi halt all military action, end the sieges laid on cities like Misrata and allow free speech and assembly. Sources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle. They said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition. Any transition, they said, would involve Gadhafi's second son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting. The Libyan sources told CNN that for now, Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels. U.S. officials claim Gadhafi's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes. The dictator's forces, however, still outnumber rebels by about 10 to 1 in terms of armor and other ground forces, according to Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman.

"(CNN)  -- Novak Djokovic extended his winning run to 23 matches with a 6-3 6-1 victory over American Mardy Fish to reach the final of the Masters 1000 tournament in Miami Friday. The Australian Open champion will play either Rafael Nadal or Roger Federer, who were playing in the night session, in Sunday's final. The Serbian beat world number one Nadal to claim the prestigious Indian Wells crown last month. The world number two saved two break points as Fish made a strong start, but after a brief rain delay it was Djokovic who seized the initiative with an immediate break of service. ""I told Mardy at the end I got saved by the rain,"" Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website. ""It really seemed like that. After I went back to the locker room I had 45 minutes to get it together and I felt much better after I came back to the court."" 14th seed Fish, who has succeeded Andy Roddick as the highest placed American in the rankings, was unable to respond as Djokovic closed out the opening set. He was broken immediately at the start of the second set and a further break in the fifth game left him no way back. The 23-year-old Djokovic eventually closed out victory in just 90 minutes as he continued his superlative start to 2011.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The use of U.S. strike aircraft in Libya is set to expire Monday as uncertainty lingers about whether Western allies will arm opposition members trying to oust Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi. Over the weekend, fierce destruction permeated the city of Misrata, which has been choked off by pro-Gadhafi forces surrounding the city. ""We need a lot of help in Misrata. There's so much death there,"" said Mustafa Abdul Hamali, a 46-year-old taxi driver who lost half of a leg. ""I was driving in my car with my wife, and my car just blew up. I don't know what happened."" Khalid Moteridi, a 32-year-old businessman-turned-rebel fighter, said the situation in Libya's third-largest city has turned dire. ""It¹s a tragedy by all means,"" he said. ""No electricity, no food, no water. We¹re trapped from all sides by the Gadhafi forces."" A doctor in Misrata told CNN government forces shelled a clinic, leaving one dead and 15 injured on Sunday. Last week, a hospital official said 398 people have been killed since the Libyan conflict began last month. He feared there were more deaths that his hospital didn't know about. Some rebels from Misrata got a bit of a reprieve Sunday, when a Turkish hospital ship picked up more than 300 of the wounded fighters. Their injuries included amputated limbs, broken bones and shrapnel wounds. The ship is destined for the Turkish port of Cesme, where the patients will receive medical attention, opposition officials said. It made a stop in the rebel capital of Benghazi to pick up more patients and supplies, and was greeted by cheering supporters of the opposition. Men wearing head bandages and eye patches waved back at the crowd. West of Benghazi, the tug-of-war for control continued in the oil town of al-Brega, which has changed hands six times in six weeks between government and opposition forces. Rebel fighters retreated east of al-Brega on Sunday, reporting an ambush, roadside mines and a need for more ammunition. Libyan rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained, better-armed forces of Gadhafi, who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. ""We were fighting with light weapons, but they had so much more,"" Moteridi said. ""Artillery, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank rockets -- that's how they were fighting back."" U.S. and British officials have said they have not decided whether to arm rebel fighters. Both countries participated in airstrikes to weaken Gadhafi's military resources before NATO officially took command of the international operation. Due to poor weather conditions in recent days, the United States approved a request by NATO to extend the use of some U.S. strike aircraft, NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said Sunday. ""This is a short-term extension, which expires on Monday,"" Lungescu said. Over the weekend, opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles. ""Based on the information we have, they (the opposition forces who were hit) heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was, and that's when they got hit,"" rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said. ""They were told to stay back, but they jumped the gun."" Lungescu said Saturday that NATO was investigating the incident. ""NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously, but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground,"" she said. Meanwhile, a trip to Europe by Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi indicated Gadhafi's regime might be willing to take diplomatic steps. Libya asked Greece to allow a special envoy to travel there to communicate a message from Gadhafi, Greek foreign ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras said. The nature of that message was not immediately known. ""From what the Libyan envoy said, it is clear that the administration is looking for a solution,"" Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after the meeting. He said Obeidi is expected to continue talks in Turkey and Malta . Despite the unyielding conflict, Moteridi, the rebel fighter who was shot twice in the legs by a sniper, said he won't give up. ""I'll go back to Misrata when I get better, God willing, and ... Gadhafi and his gangs will be defeated."" CNN's Reza Sayah, Ben Wedeman, Nic Robertson and Eve Bower and journalists Houda Zaghdoudi and Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report .","Injured Misrata resident: ""There's so much death there""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- For the second day in a row, a hardline Islamist politician escaped an assassination attempt in northwest Pakistan. Fazal Ur Rehman, the head of Jamiat-e-Ulama-e-Islam, was headed to a rally in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when a man walked up to his convoy and blew himself up, authorities said. The bast killed 12 people, including three policemen and two women, said Nisar Murrawat, the police chief of the Charsadda district where the attack took place. It also wounded 16 others, but Rehman said he was unharmed. Charsadda is 25 kilometers northeast of Peshawar, the capital of the province. A day earlier, 10 people, including two policemen, were killed when a suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up at another political rally where Rehman was scheduled to speak. Rehman said he has not received any threats nor does he know who is targeting him . Moulana Amjad Khan, a party spokesman, said the Thursday rally was the last in a series to protest against un-Islamic laws in the country, the influence of the United States and drone strikes. Jamiat-e-Ulama-e-Islam was a former coalition partner of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party. Security forces have been battling an insurgency led by the Pakistani Taliban in the province, formerly known as the North West Frontier Province.","Rehman was headed to a rally when a man blew himself up near the lawmaker's convoy .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it is increasing its nationwide monitoring of radiation in milk, precipitation, drinking water, and other outlets in response to the ongoing nuclear crisis in Japan. The EPA already monitors radiation in those potential exposure routes through an existing network of monitoring stations across the country. Results from a screening sample of milk taken March 25 in Spokane, Washington, detected radioactive iodine at a level 5,000 times lower than the limit set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the EPA said. The I-131 isotope has a very short half-life of about eight days, the EPA said, so the level detected in milk and milk products is expected to drop relatively quickly. The tests confirm that the milk is safe to drink, Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire said. ""This morning I spoke with the chief advisers for both the EPA and the FDA and they confirmed that these levels are miniscule and are far below levels of public health concern, including for infants and children,"" Gregoire said in a statement. ""According to them, a pint of milk at these levels would expose an individual to less radiation than would a five-hour airplane flight."" FDA senior scientist Patricia Hansen also said the findings are ""miniscule"" compared to what people experience every day. At least 15 states have reported radioisotopes from Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in air or water or both. No states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide, a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine. Iodine-131 has been found in eastern states from Florida to Massachusetts as well as in western states like Oregon, Colorado, and California, according to sensors and officials in those states. None of the levels poses a risk to public health, they said. The Japanese plant has been leaking radiation since it was damaged in the earthquake and resulting tsunami earlier this month.","The Environmental Protection Agency is increasing monitoring nationwide .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid could be without star striker Cristiano Ronaldo for the next three weeks due to the Portugal captain's hamstring injury. The world's most expensive player started in Saturday's Madrid derby despite coming off with an injury against Lyon in midweek, but left the field in the second half of the 2-1 win over Atletico. He had returned against the French team after sustaining a thigh injury during Real's 7-0 defeat of Malaga on March 3. Coach Jose Mourinho admitted he had taken a risk by playing the club's 26-year-old top scorer, saying: ""I didn't want the championship to end today and Cristiano Ronaldo is very important to us."" A statement on Real's website revealed that the former Manchester United player will miss Portugal's home friendly games against Chile on March 26 and Finland three days later, both in Leiria. He is likely to miss Madrid's next La Liga game against Sporting Gijon the following weekend, and is battling to be fit to face English club Tottenham in the first leg of the European Champions League quarterfinal on April 5. ""After a medical control and scan at the Sanitas hospital, Cristiano Ronaldo is suffering from a first-grade lesion to the hamstring in his left leg. The player will be out for three weeks,"" the club said on Sunday. Meanwhile, Villarreal moved up to third place in La Liga with a 1-0 victory at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Marco Ruben's 58th-minute header put the Yellow Submarine above Valencia on goal difference ahead of the visit by league leaders Barcelona on April 3. Valencia remained on 54 points, 24 points behind Barca, after suffering a third successive defeat, losing 1-0 at home to Sevilla. Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic fired in a left-foot volley in the 70th minute to boost seventh-placed Sevilla's hopes of qualifying for Europe, leaving the club behind Bilbao on goal difference. Valencia, beaten 4-0 by Zaragoza last weekend following the club's Champions League exit, went close to scoring as Brazilian striker Jonas Goncalves hit the post and Juan Mata had an effort pushed onto the bar by Sevilla goalkeeper Javi Varas. Fifth-placed Espanyol suffered a seventh defeat in nine games as Malaga moved off the bottom with a 2-0 home victory. Venezuelan striker Jose Rondon scored both goals to move to 12 this season as his team won back-to-back matches for the first time in 2010-11. Hercules dropped to the bottom after a 4-0 home loss to 10th-placed Osasuna, with the promoted club left level on 26 points with Almeria -- who lost 1-0 to fellow strugglers Sporting Gijon. Racing Santander stayed a point above Gijon after beating Real Sociedad 2-1. Levante joined Osasuna and Sociedad on 35 points with a 1-0 win at Deportivo La Coruna thanks to a last-minute winner by striker Ruben Suarez.","Cristiano Ronaldo ruled out for the next three weeks due to a hamstring problem .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A former South African rugby star who is charged with the murder of three people in Durban on Monday will undergo mental observation, police say. The man, who played for a top provincial team, the Blue Bulls, allegedly hacked his victims to death with an axe, decapitating one of them. Investigators say his fourth victim escaped and is helping them with their probe. Media reports claim the player went on a killing rampage after his daughter was raped and infected with HIV. Police, however, say his motive is still under investigation. The player was nabbed in the early hours of Wednesday morning on South Africa's East Coast. Police allegedly found his bloodied murder weapon in a dog kennel at the home where the arrest took place. Bloodied clothes and a car linked to the crimes have also been found. Prosecutors have asked that his name not be released before he appears in a lineup. Five witnesses will be asked to identify him before his next court appearance on April 7. ""Our fear is that if his name is released, someone might be able to get hold of his picture on the internet, publish it and then destroy the credibility of our eyewitnesses, who could be accused by the defense of having seen him in the media and not in person,"" prosecutor Martin Mtambo told CNN. According to police, there have been over 100 serial killings in South Africa since 1936, with the bulk of them in the mid-1990s. Since 1996 the South African police force has had a specialized unit dealing specifically with psychologically motivated crimes. This month the Johannesburg high courts handed down 16 life sentences to 42-year-old Jack Mogale, who was found guilty of a year-long murder spree that saw him rape 19 women and kill 16. Lawyers for the former Blue Bulls player want the court to determine whether their client is fit to stand trial. The team is no stranger to controversy. One of its stars, Bees Roux, goes on trial for murder in August. He is accused of beating a policeman to death last year. Team manager Ian Schwartz, who is currently in New Zealand, has refused to comment on the latest case.","Police say three people were killed with an axe on Monday; fourth victim escaped .

"Bandung, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian pop star Nazril ""Ariel"" Ilham was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison Monday for his involvement in sex videos that authorities said featured him and two other top Indonesian celebrities. As part of his conviction under the country's anti-pornography law, Ariel will also have to pay a $28,000 fine. Prosecutors had asked for a five-year jail sentence. He will appeal, his lawyer said, adding that there was no clear evidence that Ariel distributed the videos. Ariel, the frontman of the rock band ""Peterpan,"" was the first high-profile offender of the pornography law that went into effect in 2008 and carries a maximum penalty of 12 years. The first video surfaced on several websites last year and went viral through social networking sites Facebook and Twitter. It allegedly featured Ariel and girlfriend Luna Maya -- a model and TV journalist who interviewed Hillary Clinton on her show ""Dahsyat"" during the U.S. secretary of state's visit to Indonesia in 2009. After the release of the second video allegedly featuring Ariel and Cut Tari -- a soap opera star and TV journalist -- the term ""Ariel Peterporn,"" a spin on the singer's name and his band, became a top trending topic on Twitter. At the time, all three celebrities publicly denied appearing in the tapes, saying the people in the footage just looked like them. The videos sparked protests by conservative Islamic groups and others around the country condemning the celebrities. When the district court judge read the sentence in the packed courtroom Monday, hundreds of hardliners who gathered outside the courthouse booed. ""Ariel is guilty,"" some chanted, as about 1,000 anti-riot police personnel stood guard. ""He should have gotten at least five years,"" said Chep Hernawan, head of the Alliance of Islamic Movements. ""We're extremely disappointed."" Noted feminist and author Julia Suryakusuma said the protests are sending the wrong message. ""This is also sending out the message that if you're loud enough, then you'll get heard and that's not the way it should be,"" she said. Later Monday, the court sentenced an employee of Peterpan's music label to two years in prison. Prosecutors said the employee, Reza Rinaldi, was the one who uploaded the videos on the Internet.","NEW: The employee who uploaded the videos is also sentenced .

"(CNN) -- Houston prosecutors will ask a court Thursday to formally exonerate a Texas man after DNA tests ruled out his guilt in a rape for which he served 17 years in prison. George Rodriguez was freed in 2004 after an appeals court found that faulty scientific evidence had been used against him in his 1987 trial. Prosecutors didn't retry him, citing concerns about having the victim -- who had identified Rodriguez as one of her two attackers in a police lineup -- testify again. State officials had denied his request for a pardon, but Harris County District Attorney Patricia Lykos agreed to review his case after she took office in 2009. New DNA tests on the forensic evidence in the case came back February 22 and conclusively ruled out Rodriguez, now 50, Lykos said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""When this scientific inquiry began, there was no legal requirement or mandate for any further work to be done by our office, because the case had been dismissed,"" Lykos said. ""Instead, we acted on the most important obligation of all -- to see that the truth emerges, and that justice is done. Today, we can state that an innocent man has been vindicated."" The Harris County District Attorney's office will ask a judge to formally declare Rodriguez innocent at a Thursday hearing, she said. Lykos, a Republican, campaigned on promises to reform the prosecutor's office in Texas' largest city, and she has drawn praise from defense lawyers for creating a post-conviction review process to examine new evidence. The Innocence Project, which won Rodriguez's release in 2004, gave her an award in 2010 for that program. Another man, Manuel Beltran, is now serving a 60-year prison term in connection for rape. The DNA testing also confirmed that another man, now dead but long considered an alternative suspect, also assaulted the victim, who was 14 at the time.","George Rodriguez was released in 2004 but never formally cleared .

"Editor's note: This is another in a series of Business Insider commentaries debunking common tech myths. (Business Insider) -- Google loves to talk about how ""open"" it is. But the reality is that it's actually not always open; only when it's convenient to Google. And, anyway, ""open"" isn't necessarily better. For example, Google especially loves to boast that its Android software for phones and tablets is ""open."" You'd think that means that anyone would have control over their phones, to install all the apps they want, change the way it looks, and update to the latest version of Android. But that's not what it means. It really means that Google's close partners -- mobile operators and phone manufacturers, but not consumers -- can chop up Android to their liking. That's why many new Android phones ship with pre-installed ""crapware"" apps. It's why some have shortcomings, like the inability to install apps that aren't from Google's official app market. And it's why most Android owners have to wait a long time for Android software updates -- if the updates are ever made available for their specific phones. Meanwhile, despite all the talk about Android being ""open,"" there are even some things that Google's huge Android partners can't change. For example, when Motorola wanted to swap out Google's built-in location services on its Android phones for a competing service from a startup called Skyhook Wireless, Google effectively forced them to stop, according to a lawsuit that Skyhook filed against Google. What's ""open"" about allegedly forcing your partners to use Google's tools and guidelines instead of competing tools? Android is just one example. Google has recently been inconsistent about its definition of ""open"" when it comes to web video technology, too. And if Google were really serious about being ""open,"" they'd share their search and advertising algorithms with the world. Now that would be ""open."" But of course Google would never do that -- that's proprietary information that can't fall into the hands of competitors. Google has every incentive to keep its core business information ""closed,"" and it will likely continue to. The more we look, the more we see that ""open"" Google is really more like ""open when convenient or favorable to Google."" This is perfectly fine: Google is a for-profit company and can do whatever it wants. But anyone who thinks its actions are transparent or truly ""open"" is pretending. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Frommer. Copyright © 2010 Business Insider.","Google has been inconsistent when it comes to web video technology .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A woman who was dragged away by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's officials after telling journalists that some of his troops had raped her will finally be seen by journalists in the coming days, a government spokesman said Thursday. Eman al-Obeidy will ""hopefully"" be visited by two or three female journalists by Saturday, Mousa Ibrahim said. He added that he did not know where she was Thursday. ""The only place she will be other than her family house"" is a shelter for women who have been raped, kidnapped, or otherwise victimized, he said. ""Maybe she is there."" But al-Obeidy's mother, Aisha Ahmad, told CNN Thursday that she still has not heard from her. Ahmad said she is concerned the government will portray her daughter in a negative light. Ahmad said she no longer fears Gadhafi. ""If I were to see his face, I would strangle him,"" she told CNN in a previous interview at her modest home in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk. It was on Saturday that al-Obeidy, a 29-year-old law school graduate, burst into the Rixos Hotel as foreign journalists were having breakfast. Her face and legs were bruised. She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh. She said she had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men. Her visible injuries appeared to support her claims, but CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy's story. ""Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me,"" she said. ""My honor was violated by them."" Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be rope burns on her wrists and ankles. Government officials tried to subdue her, but she persisted. Even a member of the hotel's kitchen staff drew a knife. ""Traitor!"" he shouted. Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head. One government official who was there to facilitate access for journalists pulled a pistol from his belt. Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment. Some journalists were beaten and kicked. CNN's camera was confiscated and smashed beyond repair. As security forces dragged her away, al-Obeidy warned: ""If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it."" The Libyan government first said al-Obeidy was mentally ill and drunk. Officials called her a prostitute. Later, the government changed its story and said al-Obeidy was sane enough to withstand legal proceedings. Libyan government spokesman Mousa Ibrahim said the men accused of raping al-Obeidy are being investigated, but the suspects, in turn, have filed countercharges for slander. Ahmad said she received a call Sunday from a man who offered her a bribe to reject al-Obeidy's claims and persuade her daughter to change her tale. Ahmad refused. She stands by her daughter, she said. So does her entire family and tribe. To show their support, the family held an in-absentia engagement ceremony for al-Obeidy at a mosque in Tobruk on Monday. The attempt to discredit al-Obeidy as a promiscuous, un-Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor, said Mona Eltahawy, a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues. For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing. ""No one would do that unless they were raped, and especially in a conservative society,"" Eltahawy told CNN on Tuesday. Al-Obeidy's act ended up being as significant as that of the discontented fruit vendor in Tunisia who set himself afire and sparked revolt in the entire region, Eltahawy said. The way al-Obeidy spoke out was unprecedented and she has already been hailed as a hero on social networking sites. Ahmad challenged Gadhafi to air video of her daughter on state television as proof of her well-being. She also said she was worried about her other daughter, with whom al-Obeidy was living. A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy's sister's house Monday, but were blocked by security forces. The sister's mobile phone has apparently been turned off, a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN. Al-Obeidy's story raced around the world after she stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning. Ahmad said she has not been able to stop crying. She hasn't slept or eaten. She sees only her daughter's distress shared so publicly at a pivotal moment of her nation's history.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- First come the blackouts, then come the blues ... at least from worried business owners in disaster-hit Japan. In the end, the rolling outages may wind up being a bigger drag on the Japanese economy than the initial damage from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The area that relies on electric power from the Tokyo Electric Power Co., including Tokyo, accounts for more than half the economy of Japan, so any outages have long-ranging and sometimes unexpected consequences. A fast-food noodle factory in Saitama, just north of Tokyo, is but one example. For 63 years, the Kuritaeimu Derica has turned out precooked noodle dishes with fresh ingredients for sale in convenience stores. But managing director Sawako Kurita said the family business is at risk of shutting down and cutting hundreds of employees. Kurita's problems run all up and down the intensely choreographed production chain. Each day 300 workers at the spotless suburban factory turn out 80,000 packages of 120 varieties of noodle dishes, relying on dozens of vendors for ingredients. The factory lost some food and flour during the quake, but Kurita said the days afterward were far harder to deal with at the plant. Dozens of foreign workers fled back to their home countries after word spread of the dangerous and still ongoing nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Then pre-announced blackouts forced the factory to shut down for three-hour periods, often during peak production. And Kurita said it takes hours before and after each shutdown to get the machines up and working. ""Our factory has no windows so we can't leave our workers inside,"" Kurita said. ""We have to take them out to the office or the cafeteria, and for three hours we give them some food and drinks because we feel bad for them just waiting to start again."" The hourly employees get no pay for the wait. And most are mothers, often with children in the company day care center who don't have flexible schedules to work around blackouts. Sayuri Kimura, 38, said she's worried about the cuts and how to provide for her young son. ""I think the planned blackouts are inevitable, and it seems working hours and income will go down, so we're all worried about that,"" she said while on break at the factory. And the problem's not only in Saitama -- the ingredients from farmers are also in constant flux. Kurita explained they are scrambling to buy vegetables and meat from areas outside the affected prefectures where they had relied on food from before. Fuel shortages and quake-damaged roads also hamper deliveries, blackouts let fresh foods spoil, and sometimes trucks are stuck behind electrically powered warehouse doors. Then there are problems with how to get the goods to customers. Kurita said many stores are shut and customers are short of cash across the Tohoku area, meaning revenues are taking a hit. Tokyo Electric has been able largely to avoid blackouts in recent days as cool weather and customer cutbacks have led to nearly a 25% reduction in demand around Tokyo, the company said. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Tuesday that he prefers industry and individuals to cut back voluntarily, but Tokyo Electric has warned that as temperatures rise and air conditioners get switched on, companies may be forced to trim power use by a fifth, or face mandatory cuts. At the Kurita factory, a few small generators sit outside with makeshift power chords snaking along the floor to ensure they can keep phones and computers working to take orders. But a generator large enough to power the factory would take months to find and deliver, and regulations ban big units near the apartments that crowd all around the plant. Kurita said she's tried to bring aid to the worst-hit tsunami areas, personally delivering tens of thousands of noodle packs to the survivors in the Tohoku region. But she said now the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric must help her and other small businesses out. ""As you see in the factory, all the products come down a line, so if we're asked for a 20% reduction in power we have to stop everything,"" Kurita said, sighing. ""We didn't suffer badly in the quake and have to do our part to help ... but we can't afford to cut 20% and keep on in business.""","Rolling outages have long-range and unexpected consequences to Japan's economy .
