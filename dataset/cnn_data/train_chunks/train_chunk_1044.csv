"Andy Murray has been confirmed as the No 8 seed for the US Open, which begins on August 25. Murray was set to be seeded No 9 until the withdrawal of defending champion Rafael Nadal through injury on Monday moved the Brit up one place. However, it is still Murray's lowest Grand Slam seeding since he was No 12 at Wimbledon 2008. Promotion: Andy Murray has been confirmed as No 8 seed for the US Open following Rafael Nadal's withdrawal . On the sidelines: Defending champion Nadal was forced to pull out of the tournament through injury on Monday . VIDEO Injury forces Nadal out of year's final grand slam . Murray's promotion means he faces an easier draw in the last 16 against an opponent seeded between nine and 12. Potential last-16 opponents include Latvian Ernests Gulbis or Frenchman Richard Gasquet, rather than big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic or his Wimbledon conqueror Grigor Dimitrov. Top seed Novak Djokovic is projected to meet Roger Federer in the final, the Swiss also benefiting from Nadal's withdrawal as he replaced the Spaniard as the No 2 seed. Rematch?

"Lawyers for accused balcony killer Gable Tostee say possible delays of up to six months in preparing the police case against the Gold Coast playboy are causing his defence team 'great concern'. As tensions emerged between Tostee's new legal team and investigators, police said rushing the presentation of the brief of evidence would be 'setting the prosecution up to fail'. Lawyers for Tostee complained on Friday about police delays in gathering evidence, as detectives said they were still seeking overseas witnesses and evidence in the murder case of 26-year-old Warriena Wright, who allegedly fell to her death from Tostee's high rise Surfers Paradise apartment on August 8. Defence lawyer Kate Clark told Magistrate Kerry Magee in Southport Magistrate's Court she was 'seeking explanations for the delay' in police putting together their case against Tostee. Ms Clark said examining the electronic evidence against Tostee alone could delay the case by four to five months. Scroll down for video . Gable Tostee was two months ago charged with the murder of Warriena Wright after she allegedly fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge . New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright allegedly met with Tostee after the pair met on mobile dating app Tinder . Ms Clark appeared for Robertson O'Gorman solicitors, Tostee's new legal firm after he recently sacked his previous lawyers. Ms Clark told Magistrate Magee that only the preliminary autopsy report on Ms Wright's body, analysis of mobile phone records, some witness statements and photographs of the crime scene and the post mortem examination were available. Delays in presenting other evidence against Tostee were causing the defence 'great concern', Ms Clark said. 'I am seeking a review of the mention date so I can better understand the delay in the brief,' Ms Clark said. She sought a 14 day adjournment but police prosecutor Sergeant Michael Campbell sought more time. Sgt Campbell said there had been 'difficulties' preparing the brief of evidence and that police were working with international agencies and witnesses. A quick turnaround in presenting the brief would be 'setting the prosecution up to fail', he said. Gable Tostee posted this message on Facebook while in police custody . Gable Tostee was an active Tinder dater in the months leading up to his meeting Warriena Wright on August . It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly went to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink . Magistrate McGee asked for further evidence in the police case against Tostee, who did not make an appearance via audio visual link from Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre, be provided by November 14. She remanded Tostee, who has been in custody since August 15, until January 12. Ms Magee also stood over four other charges the 28-year-old allegedly committed in two separate overnight drunken incidents in the months before his alleged Tinder date with Ms Wright. The court heard that the latter two offences were alleged to have occurred during a car pursuit from NSW over the Queensland border and that Tostee is due to appear in a northern NSW Court next month over related charges alleged to have been committed in that state. Ms Clark said police analysis of evidence also needed to be expedited for the resumption of Tostee's bail application, which has yet to be listed. Last month, transcripts of an alleged tape recording of Ms Wright's final hour and a half in Tostee's company were tendered to the court by the Crown during his bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court. The application, which has been adjourned to allow the accused's defence team to compile a report on Tostee's mental state and alleged autism, has yet been given a date to resume. Details of the transcript, which Tostee's new legal representatives described as 'prejudicial' and a 'threat to justice' in the murder case, included what prosecutors claimed were 'sounds consistent with the deceased being held down and her airway restricted'. It is alleged in the documents submitted by the Crown to the court that sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'. The transcript filed at the bail hearing allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall . Police opposed the bail application for Tostee, claimed he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright . It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer . Noises of an apparent struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier. Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath. The Crown brief says 'the sounds of restricted breathing continue for 78 seconds'. During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle. The Crown alleged in the brief: 'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying 'let go, let go'. The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him. 'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out 'no' repeatedly,' the Crown briefed claimed. 'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.' The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit. 'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams 'just let me go home'. '[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, 'I would but you have been a bad girl'. 'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door. The Crown brief continued: 'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.' Tostee has maintained his innocence.

"Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini is set for an extended spell on the sidelines. The £27.5million man is believed to have suffered an injury in training and was photographed hobbling on crutches and wearing a protective boot. Sportsmail understands that the early prognosis is that the Belgium star has not broken his ankle but there are fears in his native land that he has suffered ankle ligament damage.

Fellaini has endured a traumatic 12 months at Old Trafford since signing from Everton on deadline day last summer. He is still to score a competitive goal and made only 16 starts amid poor form and injury problems in his first campaign at the club. It is understood that new manager Louis van Gaal signalled his intention to sell Fellaini at the beginning of the summer but United's attempts to move the player may be doomed following this latest set-back. Replacement: Fellaini came on for Ander Herrera during United's 2-1 defeat by Swansea . Napoli are interested in Fellaini but they are looking to take him on loan, rather than the permanent deal that United are hoping for. With Michael Carrick ruled out until the beginning of October, Van Gaal has only Ander Herrera, Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley to choose from in central midfield, so he is keen to find a high-quality recruit before the transfer window closes. United continue to deny they have any interest in Arturo Vidal of Juventus, but Ajax’s Daley Blind — who can operate at left back or in holding midfield — remains a target and Roma’s Kevin Strootman could be on the agenda in January.

"Ukraine today accused pro-Russian rebels of hitting a refugee convoy of buses with rocket fire near the eastern city of Luhansk, killing people trapped in the burning vehicles, but the separatists denied responsibility. Government forces kept up pressure on the separatists in fighting overnight into Monday, blockading or recapturing rebel-held positions after international talks failed to reach agreement on a ceasefire. Ukrainian military spokesmen said rebel missile fire on the buses had caused an unknown number of casualties. The attack came as NATO's top commander warned Putin that the alliance would respond militarily if Russia infiltrate its soldiers into an alliance member country it did when it seized Crimea. Scroll down for video . Taking shelter: Ukrainian refugees stand near tents at a camp around 10km from the Izvarino Russia-Ukraine border checkpoint in Rostov region, Russia after fleeing the fighting in eastern Ukraine .

Patient wait for supplies: Ukrainian refugees stand in a queue for food at a camp about 10km from the Izvarino Russia-Ukraine border checkpoint in Rostov region, Russia . Innocent victim: Four-year-old Alexander walks with a toy at a temporary tent camp set up for Ukrainian refugees outside Donetsk in Russia's Rostov region near the Russian-Ukrainian border . Military spokesman Anatoly Proshin . told Ukrainian news channel 112.ua: 'A powerful artillery strike hit a . refugee convoy near the area of Khryashchuvatye and Novosvitlivka. 'The . force of the blow on the convoy was so strong that people were burned . alive in the vehicles - they weren't able to get themselves out.' 'Many . people were killed, among them women and children,' Colonel Andriy . Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's national security council, added at a . briefing.

Russian-made Grad missiles. 'The . Ukrainians themselves have bombed the road constantly with airplanes . and Grads. It seems they've now killed more civilians like they've been . doing for months now. 'We . don't have the ability to send Grads into that territory,' said Andrei . Purgin, deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's . Republic.

Russian troops sit on military vehicles on the roadside outside Kamensk-Shakhtinsky near the Ukrainian border . Russian armoured vehicles pass a watermelon plantation near the Russia-Ukrainian border at the Russian town of Donetsk. Ukraine has accused Moscow of pushing more military equipment over the border . The International Committee of the Red . Cross, which is to take responsibility for the aid convoy when it . enters Ukraine, has demanded security guarantees from all sides, . including the rebels, for the mission. As of midday, there was no indication that the guarantees had been given. Fighting across eastern Ukraine has forced nearly 344,000 people to flee their homes, according to UN figures. The UN says about 155,800 have left for other places inside Ukraine while 188,000 more have crossed into Russia. The flow of refugees only seems to be growing. The . UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than . 22,000 people fled Donetsk last week compared to 6,200 the week before. Mobilising: Several Russian armoured vehicles drive in a column around 10km (6.2 miles) from the Russia-Ukrainian border control point at Donetsk, Rostov-on-Don region . City officials have released even higher numbers. Donetsk, the largest Ukrainian city still under rebel control, has seen at least 300,000 of its pre-war population of one million leave their homes, while Luhansk has only 250,000 of its 420,000 people left, local authorities have said. Russia's foreign minister earlier said he expects the extensive humanitarian aid mission for eastern Ukraine to enter the country in the near future. Speaking at news conference in Berlin, where he met a day earlier with his counterparts from Ukraine, France and Germany, Sergey Lavrov said Monday that all questions regarding the mission had been answered and that agreement had been reached with Ukraine and the ICRC. It was not clear if Lavrov was referring to the security guarantees. The humanitarian aid convoy from Russia has been watched with suspicion by Ukraine and Western countries, who suggest it could be used to spirit in weapons for the separatists, who are gradually losing ground to Ukrainian forces. Aid on its way: Lorries that form part of a Russian humanitarian convoy are parked close to a checkpoint at the Ukrainian border, some 30 km outside the town of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky in the Rostov region . Tensions grow: Ukrainian authorities fear the humanitarian aid convoy may be used to smuggle in arms to the pro-Kremlin insurgents . Reports of fresh successes by the Kiev military followed a breakthrough for government forces at the weekend when troops raised the national flag in Luhansk, a city held by the pro-Russian separatists since the onset of the conflict in April. Despite Western sanctions, the crisis has defied attempts at an international settlement and turned into the worst between Russia and the west since the end of the Cold War. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said all issues around a humanitarian convoy sent by Moscow to relieve needy areas of eastern Ukraine had been resolved at international talks in Berlin. But he said no progress had been made in his talks with the Ukrainian, German and French foreign ministers on a ceasefire or a political solution. 'We are not able to report on positive results on reaching a ceasefire and on the political process,' he told a news conference. Threatening all-out war: NATO's top commander General Philip Breedlove (pictured) has warned Russia not to smuggle troops into a member nation like it did in Crimea or it will respond militarily . Russia says it would like a ceasefire to allow aid to get to people trapped by the fighting. A 280-truck convoy sent by Russia and carrying tonnes of humanitarian aid has been stalled at the Ukrainian border since last week as Kiev has insisted on formalities so it can be properly distributed by the Red Cross. With the rebels now apparently losing ground by the day to government forces and with the leadership of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko likely to be keen for a victory by Independence Day next Sunday, it is doubtful Kiev sees any advantage in agreeing to a ceasefire now. Earlier, NATO's top commander warned that any Russian bid to infiltrate its soldiers into an alliance member country will immediately trigger a 'military response'. The alert suggests that if Moscow was to use in a NATO country the tactics the West says it deployed to seize Crimea and destabilise eastern Ukraine, then it could trigger war between east and west. U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, spoke as the Kremlin is accused by Kiev of infiltrating its troops and weapons into Lugansk and Donetsk regions where retreating pro-separatist rebels still control sizeable territory. Moscow strongly denies the claims. Late-night talks near Berlin involving the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, Sergei Lavrov and Pavlo Klimkin, were described as 'difficult' but with 'some progress' made. In an interview with Die Welt, Breedlove expressed the fear that Russian troops wearing unmarked uniforms - dubbed 'little green men' when they were deployed in Crimea - could be used in NATO countries with Russian-speaking populations. 'If we see these actions taking place in a NATO nation and we are able to attribute them to an aggressor nation, that is Article 5. Now, it is a military response,' he said. The commander warned it was 'most important' to prepare NATO members 'for the problem of ""little green men""' and that this work 'happens now'. No countries were named but the three Baltic NATO member states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - former part of the Soviet Union - all have significant Russian speaking populations. Attempts at diplomacy: Late-night talks near Berlin involving the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, Sergei Lavrov (pictured) and Pavlo Klimkin, were described as 'difficult' but with 'some progress' made . NATO's article 5 sees an attack on one . state as an attack on the alliance as a whole, and vows action . 'including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security . of the North Atlantic area'. Negotiations were again underway today . over the Russian 'humanitarian' cargo which is held up at the border . with rebel held eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Moscow of pushing more military equipment over the border, including three missile systems.

Moscow . continues to deny sending military equipment or personnel into . Ukrainian territory, but large convoys have been seen massing on the . Russian side of the border. The Ukraine crisis has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War and set off a round of trade restrictions that are hurting struggling economies in both Russia and Europe. NATO has taken a series of steps to reinforce its military presence in eastern Europe since the crisis began. Longer term measures are expected to be agreed at a NATO summit in Wales in September.","Rebel leader denied his forces had the capability to conduct such an attack .

"U.S. airstrikes in Syria in September that were aimed at a faction of al-Qaeda militants said to be plotting attacks against the West failed to deliver a decisive blow against them, U.S. officials familiar with the operation said late this week. While U.S. intelligence agencies are still assessing the results of the Tomahawk cruise missile strikes, three U.S. officials said indications are that many suspected leaders and members of the Khorasan Group escaped, along with high-tech explosive devices they were said to be preparing to attack civil aviation or similar targets. 'They thought people were there but they were not there,' said one U.S. official familiar with the Obama administration's plan. This official and others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the Sept. 22 airstrikes, many details of which are classified. Scroll down for video . Strike: In September a US-led coalition launched air strikes in Syria against members of ISIS - the extremist Islamic group occupying territory in Iraq and Syria - but also went after a little-know group called Khorasan . Aftermath: Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby maintained that strikes on ISIS and Khorasan - who officials had said were trying to sneak bombs onto US planes - were 'very successful' Target: The airstrikes targeted Khorasan's facilities such as training camps and explosivies and communications facilities . However officials say many suspected leaders and members of the Khorasan Group managed to escape the bombings - and take high-tech explosive devices with them . The targets of the strikes were fighters from the Khorasan Group, which is how the U.S. government refers to a cell of al Qaeda veterans who had relocated to Syria from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. At the time of the strikes, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said they were conducted to 'disrupt imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western targets'. Federal Bureau of Investigations director James Comey told reporters on September 25 that he was 'not confident' that the plots against the United States had been disrupted. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the strikes' effectiveness. In the aftermath of the strikes, U.S. officials have dialed back their warnings, saying that any planned attacks by Khorasan may not have been imminent. The U.S. government still maintains that the group is sufficiently skilled and well armed to launch a surprise attack against the West. The sources who spoke about the strikes said that since the raids apparently missed their main targets, Khorasan members are likely still actively planning attacks. The U.S. attack on the Khorasan Group's base was part of the first night of air strikes that were launched in Syria last month by the United States and allies. Subsequent strikes have primarily targeted militants from Islamic State, which has seized territory in Syria and Iraq. The Khorasan base targeted in the strikes was part of a larger encampment operated by the al Nusrah Front, al Qaeda's designated affiliate in the region, near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, U.S. officials have said. Taking aim: The Khorasan Group is an al Qaeda cell in northern Syria . Failed: 'They thought people were there but they were not there,' one official said this week of the strikes . Some of the officials who disclosed the airstrikes' limited impact said they blamed news leaks for helping tip off Khorasan's leadership that it was in Washington's crosshairs. U.S. media reports published in the two weeks before the strikes disclosed the American government's concern about Khorasan and Muhsin al Fadhli, one of the group's alleged leaders. Previously, their names had not been widely used in public. 'Discussion and speculation in the media about this group, Khorasan, tempered expectations for what could be accomplished in the strikes,' said one of the sources, a U.S. intelligence official. Since the U.S. attacks, conflicting reports have circulated on social media and elsewhere about whether al Fadhli was killed in the air strikes. U.S. officials said on Friday they were not sure if Fadhli was dead or if he had himself declared dead and was still operating in the shadows. The U.S. officials described Khorasan as a group of a few dozen veteran militants who had fought with core al Qaeda forces in such places as Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group recently relocated to al Nusrah-controlled territory in Syria because they regarded it as a safe haven where they would have time and space to hatch plots. Khorasan is playing no direct role in Syria's civil war, U.S. officials have said. Bombed: The targets of the strikes were fighters from the Khorasan Group, which is how the U.S. government refers to a cell of al Qaeda veterans who had relocated to Syria from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region . To carry out attacks outside Syria, Khorasan's members built or acquired explosives designed to evade Western security measures, including airport checkpoints, U.S. security and intelligence officials said. In response, officials have said, U.S. authorities this summer publicly ordered stepped-up security checks on devices such as mobile phones and computers carried by passengers boarding international flights to the United States. Where Khorasan members acquired sophisticated bomb-making skills is the subject of debate. Some of the officials said the know-how came from al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, which has produced innovative devices in the past, including bombs hidden in underwear and printer cartridges. But other officials said that the Yemen affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, would not want to supply other groups with its most advanced technology because it wanted sole credit for designing and using it.","The Khorasan Group is an al-Qaeda cell in northern Syria .

"A male student was shot by a fellow pupil outside a North Carolina high school just minutes before classes began Tuesday morning, and the shooting suspect then waited for police to arrive, authorities said. Bernard Miller, 16, was shot at around 7:40 a.m. as the two male students argued in an on-campus courtyard at Albemarle High School, Albemarle Police Chief William Halliburton said at a news conference. The shooter, identified as Jalen Russell by WSOC TV, put down his gun after firing two shots, walked into the principal's office and waited for police. Halliburton said. Scroll down for video . The victim: Bernard Miller (pictured left and right) was shot in the leg today by a fellow student . 'We had the suspect immediately in custody,' said Halliburton, who had 20 officers from several jurisdictions at the school about 35 miles east of Charlotte within minutes. The chief said he was told Miller was shot in the hip and lower abdomen. He provided no additional details on Miller's condition. The school was on lockdown Tuesday morning as investigators spoke to witnesses. The chief said he doesn't think any other students were involved in the argument or shooting, but they haven't finished their interviews. Halliburton also said the shooting was not part of a bigger threat to the high school. 'This was a personal, one-on-one confrontation,' Halliburton said. Parents have been asked to pick up their children at nearby Albemarle Baptist Church. Classes have been canceled for the day, and school officials haven't decided if students will be back Wednesday. Student Brittany Montgomery told WBTV-TV that she heard the students arguing, then heard three gunshots. Montgomery said a friend of hers broke down as she rushed to help the wounded student. 'I told her to calm down. He's going to be OK. He's just shot in the leg,' Montgomery told the TV station. Halliburton said his officers along with Stanly County deputies were helped by a school shooting exercise they performed at Albemarle High School several months ago. 'Many of those same faces who were out on that training scenario were there today,' the chief said. Also on Tuesday, a high school student in Kentucky was injured and one person was being sought after a shooting at a high school in southern Louisville. The student had non-life threatening injuries and was reunited with parents at University Hospital, Officer Phil Russell said. He didn't say if the injured student and shooter knew each other or if the shooter was a student at Fern Creek Traditional High School. Russell said the suspect left the 1,400-student school immediately after firing the shot.

"Having kept his job on the basis that he provides more entertainment, Sam Allardyce can be quite pleased with this start to the season. There was no shortage of incident at Upton Park. Unfortunately for Allardyce and West Ham, they were on the wrong end of the fun supplied by two red cards, a penalty miss and a winner in the second minute of added time. Tottenham new-boy Eric Dier settled the derby, sprinting forward from right-back to collect a pass from Harry Kane, skip around goalkeeper Adrian and roll the ball into the net. Cue delirium from Spurs fans and familiar grumbles from the East End natives. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the brilliant moment a pitch invader takes free-kick in West Ham vs Tottenham match .

West Ham (4-1-4-1): Adrian 7; O’Brien 6 (Demel 62, 6), Collins 6, Reid 7, Cresswell 7; Noble 6; Downing 7, Nolan 6, Kouyate 6, Vaz Te 5 (Diame 67, 6); Cole 6.5 (Valencia 81). Subs: Jaaskelainen, Burke, Poyet, Zarate. Booked: Collins, Kouyate. Sent off: Collins. Manager: Sam Allardyce 6. Tottenham (4-2-3-1): Lloris 8; Naughton 6, Kaboul 7, Dier 7, Rose 6; Capoue 6, Bentaleb 5; Eriksen 6, Lamela 6.5 (Holtby 61, 5), Lennon 6 (Townsend 61, 6); Adebayor 6 (Kane 83). Subs: Friedel, Dawson, Davies, Soldado. Sent off: Naughton . Manager: Mauricio Pochettino 7. Man of the match: Hugo Lloris . Referee: Chris Foy 5. For Dier, it is a dream-like debut after his transfer from Sporting Lisbon, having started the game at centre-half and finished as a rampaging full-back. ‘I would’ve been happy with a clean sheet,’ said Dier. ‘I wasn’t expecting to get up the other end and score. I’m not sure I got there, I just made a run inside and it [the ball] found me. I’d like to score more goals, so I’m happy.’ For Mauricio Pochettino, this flattering win was a perfect start to life as Daniel Levy’s ninth Spurs boss in 11 years. His team were a man down and under pressure for 33 minutes after Kyle Naughton had been dismissed but before James Collins was also sent off. ‘The important thing is to never give up,’ said Pochettino. ‘There are times in football that are difficult to manage but the team believed. We kept our offensive players on the pitch. We didn’t change. This was the signal from the dugout.’ West Ham had been the better team and ought to have been ahead when, after half an hour, Kevin Nolan spun over a dropping ball, connected with a half-volley on the turn and the ball crashed into the hands of Naughton. Referee Chris Foy hesitated. Here was a dilemma. The distance between ball and hand was short and the ball had travelled at incredible speed. Naughton had no chance to adjust but the shot was hurtling towards goal. Assistant referee Michael McDonough was flagging but wanted to indicate a corner, rather than a penalty. Foy, however, once his mind was made up, pointed to the spot and sent off Naughton. ‘The card was unfair,’ said Pochettino. ‘But the most important thing was the team kept calm and carried on.’ Back in the game: Erik Lamela, who started for Tottenham, tries to beat West Ham forward Ricardo Vaz Te .

Nabil Bentaleb          90           11.5        7.1 . Danny Rose             90           10.8        6.7 . Pochettino admitted that he was not so calm on the touchline, however, saying: ‘Yes but it’s difficult on the line because it’s impossible to run and it’s impossible to jump, but the team deserved the three points. It was always in our mind, even at 10 v 11, that it was possible to win. That is our philosophy.’ The excitement at Upton Park was quickly punctured when Noble sent Hugo Lloris the wrong way from the spot and rolled his penalty wide. Allardyce’s team continued to create and squander chances — no player was more wasteful than Ricardo Vaz Te — and Lloris was inspired in the Spurs goal, making two brilliant second-half saves to deny Stewart Downing, the second shortly before Dier’s winner. The numbers were levelled when Collins was sent off for a second yellow card for two innocuous fouls. His first was for a nudge on Erik Lamela on half-way, his second for a block on Emmanuel Adebayor, when the Spurs striker was looking to be fouled, without support, 25 yards from goal. ‘There were three big factors,’ said Allardyce. ‘One is not being clinical enough after creating chances. Then poor Mark Noble misses a penalty for the first time in my time at the club. Then allowing ourselves to go to 10 v 10. ‘I can’t fault the performance but we were very naive. We had enough to win and paid the ultimate price. This league will punish you.’ As for keeping the owners entertained, he added: ‘We had 20 attempts on goal and the opposition hardly had any. We haven’t deserved to lose. We played very well and we have a lot of players to come back. On that performance our season will be a good one. ‘If they were going to sack me after one game they might as well have done it at the end of last season.

What made a real difference was the talk that our captain Goldie Sayers gave on Monday night.

Porter got out of the blocks powerfully and maintained her lead over France’s Cindy Billaud, who finished strongly to take silver. The 26-year-old, who won World Championship bronze in Moscow last year and silver at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, said: ‘This is my first gold medal for Britain so I couldn’t be happier. I just focused on myself. ‘We all train to get the gold — I focused on my lane and performed well when it mattered the most.’ Germany’s Cindy Roleder took bronze in 12.82sec.

"Adam Gemili said Britain’s new generation of sprint stars are gunning for the Jamaican and American teams who dominate on the world stage after winning three of the four sprint relay titles in Zurich and adding bronze in the women’s 4x400m. The women’s 4x100m team set a new national record of 42.24sec in the last race of these championships and the men’s 4x100m quartet — who earlier won their title in 37.93sec — dashed to embrace them.

That form translated into the relays. Gemili anchored the 4x100m team, dipping on the line and only two-tenths off the British record.

"From smart boxes to cable services, there are more ways than ever to watch television. Now, network operator EE has launched what it claims is the UK’s 'most advanced TV service' that combines live and recorded programmes across TV sets, mobiles and tablets. It uses a specially-designed EE TV smart box, which is free on contracts that start at £9.95 a month. Network operator EE has launched what it claims is the UK’s 'most advanced TV service' that combines live and recorded programmes across TV sets, mobile and tablets (pictured) The company hopes to compete with rivals BT and TalkTalk, which have won over customers by offering premium programming as part of their respective broadband packages.

EE TV also lets viewers watch programmes on their home TV, as well as on up to three smartphones or tablets simultaneously. This means four different programmes, in four different rooms, on four different devices could be viewed at the same time. The user interface of the box is designed to mimic that of a smartphone. ‘Live windows’ gives instant access to a visual menu including a TV guide, recorded content and on-demand services. EE TV requires a smart box (pictured) to offer the functionality, and this box is free on packages starting at £9.95 a month. The TV box has a 1TB hard drive that stores up to 600 hours of standard TV, or 300 hours of HD . Claim: EE claims its TV services is the 'most advanced service' in the UK. Multi-screen experience: Users can pause, rewind or record live and pre-recorded programmes simultaneously on up to four devices – from TV to smartphones and tablets. Remote control: Viewers can use their phone or tablet as a remote control. The EE TV app lets users browse and watch programmes, plan ahead or manage recordings without interrupting what’s on the TV. Replay and restart: Using the replay feature, the service records the user’s six favourite channels so they can view anything from the past 24 hours. Users can click ‘restart’ to catch the beginning of a missed show. Content: As well as the 70 channels offered on Freeview, EE TV offers catch up services such as BBC iPlayer, 5OD and Wuaki.tv. Daily Motion, You Tube and The Weather Network are also available. TV box: The TV box has a 1TB hard drive that can store up to 600 hours of standard TV, or 300 hours of HD. Future-proof: EE TV is HTML 5 compatible and new content and apps will be updated and developed. Price: The box is free for EE mobile customers who sign up to an EE Broadband plan from £9.95 a month. Availability: The box will become available in EE stores in the coming weeks. The system is designed to make programme clashes a thing of the past. A multi-screen system lets users stream live and recorded content directly from the EE TV box’s hard drive, using a new remote app for iOS and Android devices. A replay feature will additionally let customers view the last 24 hours of TV, and organises recent shows by genres or channels – even if they are not yet available on catch-up services, . Like some other TV boxes, a MultiRecord function means four programmes can be recorded simultaneously. Programmes are stored directly on the EE TV box, which has a 1TB hard disk drive, with space for up to 25 days of TV content. The service will let people to use their smartphone or tablet as a remote control. For example, viewers will be able to use the EE TV app to navigate the guide and select the content they want to watch on their mobile device, without interrupting what is displayed on the TV screen. EE, which is jointly owned by Orange and Deutsche Telekom, said its smart box is worth £300 but will be free for all EE mobile customers who sign up to an EE Broadband plan. Customers with existing pay monthly mobile plans who sign up to EE TV and home broadband will receive a boost in their 4G allowance by up to 20GB, depending on their plan. The company has designed EE TV for people with 4G access on their mobiles and tablets. It added that video content already makes up more than half of EE’s 4G mobile network activity. ‘Today we’re announcing the most advanced TV service the UK has ever seen. 'How, where and when people watch TV and movies is changing, and mobile technology is driving that change, said Olaf Swantee, chief executive of EE. ‘[EE has] unrivalled insight into people’s changing viewing habits. 'It’s helped us create a service that has mobile at its heart, and makes the TV experience more personal than ever before. The service is focused on mobile viewing so tablets and smartphones will ‘work seamlessly’ with home TVs, allowing customers to access Freeview, live and catch-up services across multiple devices. A TV menu is shown on a tablet . ‘With EE TV, not only can you watch different streams of live and recorded content, on multiple screens simultaneously, but your mobile becomes the remote. 'This gives each viewer the chance to watch, queue and view what they want, when they want. It’s a completely new way to enjoy your favourite programmes, films and internet content.’ EE’s service will be similar to other offerings on the market. That model has proved popular in recent years to customers who want more than the basic television service, but are not willing to pay for the full TV subscription services offered by the likes of BSkyB and Virgin Media. BT, for example, has helped grow its broadband business since launching a high-profile sports service. EE has repositioned itself in recent years, stealing a march on its competitors by becoming the first mobile operator in Britain to offer superfast 4G services, nearly a year before rivals Vodafone and Telefonica's O2 were able to compete.

A multi-screen allows users to stream live and and recorded content directly from the EE TV box’s hard drive using a new remote app for iOS and Android devices. The box's TV guide is shown . Commenting on the launch, Paolo Pescatore, Director of apps and media at market intelligence firm CCS Insight, said it is ‘hugely significant’. ‘It demonstrates the growing need for telcos to offer multi-play services. It's a logical move from EE and one that's in direct response to BT launching its mobile service next year.

"Thousands of terror suspects in the UK are being monitored by the security services, it has been claimed. Far more militants than previously thought are under surveillance, according to the Mayor of London. Boris Johnson said the threat from Islamist extremists may be greater than officials have admitted. It had been believed that the main danger came from some 500 jihadis who have travelled to Syria and Iraq from Britain to join Islamic State or Al-Qaeda. About half of these have since returned to the UK. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson said the threat from Islamist extremists may be greater than officials have admitted and claimed 'there are probably in the low thousands of people that we are monitoring in London' But Mr Johnson told the Daily Telegraph the danger was much more widespread than the relatively small numbers of extremists who have gone abroad to fight. ‘In London we’re very, very vigilant and very, very concerned,’ he said. ‘Every day – as you saw recently, we had to raise the threat level – every day the security services are involved in thousands of operations. ‘There are probably in the low thousands of people that we are monitoring in London.’ Speaking about IS, the jihadist organisation that has beheaded two British hostages, he said: ‘London has a particular concern, because probably of the five or six hundred that are out there, we think a third, maybe more – maybe half – come from the London area. ‘If and when they come back, we have a real job to deal with them.’ Mr Johnson gave the interview to promote his new biography of Sir Winston Churchill, The Churchill Factor. He said he believed the wartime leader would have approved of Parliament’s decision to back air strikes on Islamic State in Iraq. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, of the Met Police said policing methods would not change . More than 200,000 police officers and staff were warned last night that they could be directly targeted by terrorists. Chief constables in every force across Britain are putting extra measures in place to protect those on the frontline. They have urged officers to be extra vigilant in the face of the growing threat posed by violent Islamic fundamentalists. Police were told to take every precaution while off-duty and not to unnecessarily identify themselves as police officers. The warning included reminders not to speak about work in public and to remove items such as identification cards. Officials refused to discuss details of the warning, but counter-terrorism police are thought to have received information that officers could be terror targets. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, of the Metropolitan Police, said the threat would not change policing methods. He added: ‘We are informing officers and staff of the heightened risk and reminding them to remain vigilant.’ ‘I think he would be appalled by the spectacle of these cowards executing journalists, and I think he would have wanted to do something to set them back a long way, and if need be, to neutralise them altogether,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘He was a great believer in air power – don’t forget he invented the RAF – so I think he’d do exactly what the Prime Minister is doing.’ Mr Johnson said Mr Churchill would have been ‘very tough’ on home-grown terrorism, and would have taken ‘personal charge’ of the situation. ‘Had he been Home Secretary now, he would be absolutely appalled to think that these people could be carrying British passports and yet be loyal to another state.’","Far more militants than previously thought are under surveillance .

"French club Metz are ready to lodge a complaint with UEFA after their proposed deal with West Ham for Diafra Sakho collapsed. It is understood a fee of £3.5million and personal terms had been agreed for the striker but West Ham have stepped back from a deal for the 24-year-old angering the French side in the process.

According to the statement released by Metz, West Ham switched from wanting a permanent transfer to a loan deal with the option to buy. Metz have branded West Ham 'disrespectful' for their conduct during talks and are considering their legal options as Sakho missed the club's opening Ligue 1 fixture on Saturday, a goalless draw with Lille, to undergo his medical. 'The English club unilaterally decided to propose a loan deal with an option to purchase instead of a permanent deal, which does not correspond to FC Metz's expectations and contradicts all the terms that had been agreed last week between the two clubs,' a statement from Metz read. 'FC Metz regret this clear lack of respect, which is unacceptable, from West Ham towards FC Metz and also the player. 'As a result, FC Metz reserve the right to approach the international sport court and assert their rights and defender their interests. FC Metz had released Diafra Sakho from his professional duties during matchday 1 of the Ligue 1 championship by giving him leave to take a medical in England to complete the last stage of the deal.'

"Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, has been jailed for a minimum of 22 years for murdering his nine-week-old daughter, Aukse . A father who murdered his nine-week-old daughter by biting her forehead and launching her against a wall in a 'brutality that defies belief' has been jailed for life. Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, left little Aukse to die in agony in her cot for up to six hours after beating her to death at the family home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. The savage attack took place in September last year, on the first day Aukse's mother had returned to work since giving birth. The Lithuanian delivery driver left his child with a catalogue of shocking injuries, including a bite on her forehead. The baby was also left with internal bleeding, head injuries, five fractured ribs and a lacerated liver due to being violently shaken and thrown against a hard surface before her death. Today, Medvedevas was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years after being convicted at the Old Bailey last week of murder. He had previously denied the charge, claiming his daughter had died accidentally by falling out of bed. He changed his plea to guilty two days into his trial. Dzesika Urbikaite, 22, the child's mother, wept in court today as Judge Timothy Pontius told the court that baby Aukse suffered considerably for hours before her eventual death. He said the circumstances 'demonstrated a callousness that is as incredible as it is inhuman'. He said: 'The murder of any human being is always a tragedy, the murder of a defenceless child of any age, the more so. 'The murder of a helpless infant only a few weeks old in circumstances of brutality which almost defy belief is an appalling crime beyond comprehension.' He went on: 'This defendant has, albeit belatedly, accepted that he can't pretend with any chance at all that he can fool a jury that he didn't intend to cause harm to his daughter, when he gripped her, shook her aggressively, and threw her against a hard surface. This caused serious eye and brain injuries. 'The responsibility - his alone - for so horrific a crime will, I imagine, weigh heavily upon his conscience for the rest of his life and so it should. The extent and nature of the injuries set out are clearly shocking.’ The court had previously heard how Ms Urbikaite, an agency worker, had returned to the house she shared with Medvedevas  to find their daughter dead in her cot. She rushed the youngster to hospital but doctors were unable to revive her. She was pronounced dead the same evening. Defence lawyer Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC told the court that Medvedevas had shown 'heartfelt' remorse for what he had done to his own daughter. The Lithuanian delivery driver, pictured left, carried out the murderous attack on the day the child's mother Dzesika Urbikaite, 22, pictured right, returned to work for the first time since giving birth . The father, pictured here with Ms Urbikaite, left his child with a catalogue of shocking injuries, including a bite on her forehead, internal bleeding, head injuries, five fractured ribs and a lacerated liver . She said: 'The horror of having realised that his child was badly hurt will never leave this young man. What he does recall is holding her. 'He recalls she died in his arms and afterwards he was terrified as to the hurt he had inflicted on her and his girlfriend who he loved very much. He was in a state of utter terror and hurt.' She said the defendant was a 'loving and caring' man who had suffered a 'clear mental disturbance'. At the time of the murder he was struggling to find work and 'matters were really at quite a desperate state' financially, she said. Jurors had previously been told how Medvedevas had denied causing the fatal injuries when questionned by police, but that he gave no explanation about how they were caused. He later claimed that Aukse had fallen off the bed and hit her head while he was asleep. Then, on the day his trial was due to start in May, he produced a radically different account, accepting for the first time that he caused the injuries, the court heard. He said he had shaken his daugher and thrown her on the bed. From there, she fell to the floor, he claimed. But the prosecutor said that Medvedevas had still failed to account for all the injuries Aukse suffered. An examination of one of the bite marks showed it matched the defendant's teeth imprint, the court heard. Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC had told the court that baby Aukse was a 'helpless infant, entirely dependent upon the love and care of her parents'. He said: 'She suffered very serious and extensive injuries - to her head and body, both externally and internally. 'The nature of these injuries tells you what the person who inflicted them intended. 'All those injuries occurred when she was in the sole care of her father. The court had previously heard how Ms Urbikaite, an agency worker, had returned to the house she shared with Medvedevas, pictured together above, to find their daughter dead in her cot . 'As he committed those acts of violence against Baby Aukse, he must have intended to kill her or to cause her really serious harm - that is murder.' After changing his plea during today's hearing, the judge told the jury that they had heard Medvedevas' 'clear and voluntary confession of guilt'. He told them: 'This is a distressing case and a tragic one. You are relieved of the burden of listening to that evidence.' After the sentencing, Superintendent Jon Hutchinson, of Cambridgeshire Police, said: 'The appalling nature of this crime has been reflected in the sentence handed down to Medvedevas today. 'Medvedevas did not want to look after his daughter and his response was brutally violent. The baby's injuries were likened to those suffered in a car crash or as a result of being dropped from a one-storey building. 'He failed to seek assistance that could have saved her life and then refused to tell the truth on arrest and right through the legal process. 'Aukse's mother is continuing to rebuild her life and I hope the conclusion of the legal process today and the knowledge that justice has been done makes that process a little easier.'","Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, killed nine-week-old Aukse in September last year .

"Newcastle summer signing Remy Cabella struck two minutes from time as the Toon rescued a 2-2 draw at Championship side Huddersfield in a pre-season friendly. Daryl Janmaat made his debut for Alan Pardew's side while Facundo Ferreyra also made his first start since joining on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk.

The Toon opened the scoring in the 16th minute as Remy Cabella and Yoan Gouffran neatly exchanged passes before squaring for Riviere to turn home at the back post.

"Wayne Rooney will proudly lead out Manchester United against Swansea on Saturday, and in a little over two weeks he could be given an even greater honour. For the 28-year-old now looks to be the prime candidate to be England's next captain having  been confirmed as United's new skipper on Tuesday. Roy Hodgson admitted earlier this week that the man who leads out England at Wembley against Norway on September 3 will replace Steven Gerrard as leader of the national team. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . Leading the way: Wayne Rooney captain Manchester United against Valencia on Tuesday evening . Stamping his authority. Wayne Rooney directs play during United's win over Valencia . Stepping up: Wayne Rooney will take on extra responsibilities for club and possibly country this season . VIDEO Rooney selected to lead Red Devils' revival . And Rooney looks to be that man now. In truth, Hodgson's options are limited with only Joe Hart, Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka as realistic alternatives to Rooney. Another option would be current vice-captain Frank Lampard, but Hodgson seemed to rule him out earlier this week when hinting he may plump for Rooney. 'Frank is the vice-captain and there is Wayne Rooney, so there are two candidates,' said Hodgson. 'At the moment, Frank's concentration has to be on this Manchester City job and in New York, where he could very well be captain. Honour: Wayne Rooney captained England against San Marino in October 2012 . Changing of the guard? Wayne Rooney (second left) now looks to be man to take over from Steven Gerrard . Disappointment: Steven Gerrard's England career ended with England's exit at the World Cup . Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard in action for England against Uruguay at the World Cup . 'I don't think I can expect him to say, ""Please make me captain because in 2018 I want to lead the team out"", because I don't think he will be thinking that himself.' At 28, Rooney will still be around for the next World Cup in Russia. Hart, who will be 31 in 2018, will in all likelihood also be around, but Cahill and Jagielka will be 32 and 35 in four years and may have found themselves usurped by younger centre-backs such as Phil Jones, Jon Stones and Calum Chambers. That seemingly leaves a straight battle between Rooney and Hart, and United boss Louis van Gaal has done Hodgson a huge favour. Had Van Gaal plumped for compatriot Robin van Persie as his captain at United it would have been almost impossible for Hodgson to make Rooney his skipper. Passion play: Joe Hart is seemingly the other leading candidate to captain England . Down and out: Gary Cahill is another name that Roy Hodgson is reported to be considering as England skipper . Experienced: Phil Jagielka has captained his club side Everton for many years . Now, however, it is almost impossible for Hodgson not to choose Rooney over Hart - or any other candidates he may be considering. Already one of the obvious leaders on the pitch, captaining United week-in-week-out will surely give Rooney the vital experience he needs to lead his country. What kind of captain he will turn out to be - possibly more David Beckham than John Terry - is still unknown, but he seems to be the only game in town now for Hodgson.","Louis van Gaal appointed Rooney as United captain on Tuesday .

"Rangers fans last night reacted with horror to the prospect of Charles Green returning to the club as a front-man for American billionaire George Soros. New York-based Soros is said to have told Green to make his move within the next seven days by offering shareholders 20p per share in order to become the club’s biggest shareholder. If that move fails, it’s believed Soros and Green will offer the current board a £10million loan at five per cent interest, with the Murray Park training ground taken up as security over the deal. Possible return: Green says he doesn't want to go back to Rangers, but claims he may have to soon . ‘I’ve got a number of people ready to invest in Rangers,’ Green told the BBC. ‘I’ve told people this is a great club and a great opportunity. It’s one of the world’s biggest brands in terms of football. ‘I don’t want to go back to Rangers, I left unhappy last year and know it wouldn’t be right to go back. However, to see where the club is now is a disaster. ‘Why Charles Green? I’m not applying to be the Messiah but I won’t let the club continue to slide and become a laughing stock. What I’m saying is if someone else can raise the money then great - if not, I’ll do it. ‘It’s a disjointed fan base and someone needs to stand up and say how it is. I’ve made loads of mistakes I’m not saying I’m a good guy but I’m certainly not the worst guy. Billionaire: American George Soros is planning to invest up to £10million in the Glasgow club . ‘I wouldn’t be involved at executive level or operationally but if I bring investors in, they’ll want some kind of representation on the board. That could be me or someone else.’ On the opposition from fans, Green added: ‘Raising cash is what I do. It’s what I’ve done for 30 years and it’s all I do. What is important is that the club is saved. If the club doesn’t raise cash, then it won’t be able to continue to trade. ‘If some fans would rather the club goes back into administration then they are not real fans. Sit and wait and see what happens - if I don’t raise the cash then that’s it but if I do the club will be stronger. ‘Rangers will get back to the Scottish Premiership and when they do, they need to be competitive. When they get there, no-one wants to see them weak and humiliated. ‘Fans need to unite. One week it’s the Sons of Struth and then the Union of Fans - there is no union of fans. ‘I’d love to see all the fans unite and hate me - at least then they’d be united. It’s a disjointed fan base and someone needs to stand up and say it how it is.’ Split: Manager Ally McCoist publicly fell out with Green last season, resulting in the CEO leaving the club . Green still has close links to the club via Sandy Easdale, the man to whom he is said to have sold his shareholding last year. The Yorkshireman, however, is eyed with suspicion by a large section of the Rangers support. Green and his cohorts, including finance director Brian Stockbridge, were seen to benefit greatly from huge remuneration packages that went some way to ensuring the £23m raised by a share issue in December 2012 quickly evaporated. He left the club initially in April last year after a public spat with manager Ally McCoist and following his casual use of racist language - only to return three months later in a consultancy role. Alleged business dealings with Craig Whyte damaged his reputation with the Rangers support and he left for a second time last August. Rumours that’s he’s still heavily involved behind the scenes and is close to a public return have lurked ever since. Champions: Despite the off-field turmoil Rangers won the League 1 title last season comfortably . Last night the Union of Fans, the Rangers supporters umbrella group, stated it was unequivocally opposed to his return. ‘Simply put, Charles Green is not welcome at Rangers and we believe any attempt by him to return would see a huge number of Rangers fans seriously consider a full boycott of the club,’ a statement read. ‘Mr Green lied to the Rangers fans on more than one occasion. He presided over a period of mismanagement which has once again left the club on its knees financially. ‘At all times he acted in his own and his original investors interests and never in the interests of the club. ‘If he is indeed genuinely attempting to return then it will simply be to extract whatever more he can on behalf of the faceless investors he still represents. Looking ahead: Rangers hope their stay in the Championship will be a brief stop on the way back to the SPL . ‘It appears Mr Green is struggling to maintain his grasp on reality if he thinks Rangers fans will accept a further pillaging of the club by his clients. ‘We expect the board to completely rule out any attempt from any further associates of Mr Green to get involved with Rangers. We also expect them to confirm that no members of the PLC or “football” board have been involved in any attempt to bring further associates of Mr Green into the club. ‘The £10m, even if it exists, is a sticking plaster on a gaping wound and made all the worse by Green’s record of syphoning any money invested in the club straight back out.’ Yesterday’s developments comes at the end of a week in which the board confirmed it hoped to raise £4m via a fresh share issue to cover a funding gap. Existing shareholders will be given the first option on purchasing shares with institutional investors being asked to underwrite the scheme. 2012: May 13 - Administrators announce a deal to sell the club to a consortium led by Charles Green. June 12 - HMRC announces it will reject a CVA offer and force the club into liquidation. June 14 - Green completes £5.5million purchase of Rangers' assets and business, hours after a consortium led by former manager Walter Smith makes a late bid. June 19 - Smith's group officially ends attempts to buy the newco club from Green. July 29 - Green claims ""bigotry"" was one of the reasons behind his newco club being denied a place in the Clydesdale Bank Premier League. He escapes with a censure. October 10 - The SFA delivers a ""not proven"" verdict after Green allegedly questions the integrity of an independent commission appointed by the SPL to determine whether oldco Rangers broke rules in relation to alleged undisclosed payments to players. December 18: Rangers announce more than £22million has been raised through a share issue. 2013: January 9: Green says Rangers should attempt to quit Scottish football if league reconstruction plans are approved. March 4: Green claims Rangers are well equipped to meet the challenges which lie ahead despite posting losses of £7million for the last seven months of 2012. March 8: Green refers to the current squad of players as ""probably the worst Rangers team you have ever seen"" in a radio interview. April 5: Green insists there was never any possibility of Craig Whyte being involved in his consortium after the former owner claims he was behind the original Ibrox newco. April 7: Manager Ally McCoist defends his Irn-Bru Third Division champions by refuting Green's ""worst Rangers team"" claim. April 8: Green accuses Show Racism the Red Card of a ""knee-jerk reaction"" after the group criticises Green for using what they deem to be ""racist and offensive language"". April 11: Green apologises ""unreservedly"" for alleged racist comments after being served with a notice of complaint by the SFA following remarks in a newspaper article. April 12: Green issues a statement refuting claims from former owner Whyte that he was involved in Green's takeover of the club. April 13: The Rangers board announce they will commission an independent investigation into Green and commercial director Imran Ahmad's management of the club. McCoist welcomes news of the investigation, insisting fans ""deserve the truth"". April 19: Rangers confirm to the London Stock Exchange that Green has offered to resign from his position as chief executive with immediate effect. 2014: August 8: Green announces he is aiming to raise £10million to invest in Rangers.","Green left the club in April last year after financial troubles .

"Corinne Diacre became the first woman to coach a men's professional football team in a competitive match in France on Monday but saw her Clermont side lose 2-1 at Brest in the second division. Diacre's managerial stint in men's football got off to a perfect start when Souleymane Sawadogo finished off a counterattack in the ninth minute, prompting only a small smile from his coach in celebration. But the match changed in the second half when Bruno Grougi converted a penalty for Brest, and Alexandre Alphonse then scored the winner for the home side. 'It's never nice to lose, that's obvious,' Diacre said. 'But Brest played well. We made a couple of mistakes for their goals. But we did good things too, which is a good sign for the future. You can't ignore Clermont this season.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Corinne Diacre take her first training session . Landmark moment: Corinne Diacre became the first woman to coach a men's professional football team . Bunch: Brest's coach Alex Dupont  offers flowers to Diacre before the first game of the season kicked off . A look of shock? The female coach appeared surprised as Dunpont approached her with the bouquet . Rafa Benitez hands? Diacre issues colourful instructions to her players on the touchline . Not bothered: The 40-year-old didn't look fazed by the historic occasion on Monday night . Diacre urged her players on loudly from the touchline and Clermont almost equalized but was denied by the woodwork and a fantastic save on the line by Brest goalkeeper Alexis Thebaux. 'We didn't know how to keep the ball today, that was one of our weaknesses,' Diacre said. 'We didn't use the ball well, we didn't develop our game as we could have, as we should have. That's what put us in danger. There are plenty of positive things. I have a young team and I'm happy with my players because they gave everything.' The former defender also celebrated her 40th birthday Monday and was given a bouquet of flowers and a kiss on the cheek before kickoff by her Brest counterpart, Alex Dupont. Talking tactics: Diacre has a chat with midfielder Brandon Agounon during the 2-1 defeat against Brest . The first of many! She celebrates with the Clermont coaching staff after their side score during the defeat . Tricky business: Diacre said afterwards that she expects Clermont to surprise in the second division . Diacre was appointed as Clermont coach at the end of June, replacing another woman - Helena Costa - who quit before coaching a game after claiming male colleagues sidelined her and used her as a 'face' to attract publicity. Costa had been the first female manager to be appointed in the highest two divisions of any professional European football league. Italian third-division side Viterbese hired Carolina Morace in 1999, but she resigned after two matches. Diacre made 121 appearances for France and also captained the national side. She served as its assistant manager for three years before taking charge of Soyaux, the club where she spent her entire playing career.","Brest beat Clermont 2-1 in the French second division .

"Italy and Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini has joined the criticism of the Italian football federation (FIGC) presidential candidate Carlo Tavecchio after the 71-year-old referred to African players as 'banana eaters.' As the row continued to fester a week after the comments were made, Chiellini said that the position needed somebody with 'decorum and personality' and that Tavecchio's rival Demetrio Albertini, a former Italy midfielder, was the only suitable candidate. The election to replace Giancarlo Abete, who quit following Italy's group stage exit at the World Cup, is due to take place on Aug. 11. Blast: Giorgio Chiellini has criticised Italian football federation presidential candidate Carlo Tavecchio . Controversy: The 71-year-old referred to African players as 'banana eaters' last week . 'I read his (Tavecchio's) words the day after and they left me disconcerted,' Chiellini said. 'I asked...how Italian football could be heading towards this election and if there was any solution. 'I have nothing personal against Tavecchio but at the moment, the only adequate person for the role is Albertini.' The 29-year-old continued: 'We mustn't let Italian football embarrass itself again. The national team is bigger than Tavecchio but we must avoid having a certain type of figure for these roles. 'We need a person with a certain decorum and personality to perform certain roles.' FIGC vice-president Tavecchio has received a wave of criticism for his comments, which came at the summer assembly of Italy's amateur leagues (LND), and FIFA has asked for an investigation. Preferred: Chiellini says Tavecchio's rival Demetrio Albertini is the only credible candidate for the job . He made the comment as he suggested that Italy should replicate England's stringent requirements for non-EU players. 'In England, they identify the players coming in and, if they are professional, they are allowed to play,' he said. 'Here instead we get 'Opti PobÃ ', who previously ate bananas and then suddenly becomes a first team player with Lazio.' Tavecchio, who initially had the support of all Serie A clubs except Juventus and AS Roma, has seen his backing drop since the incident, although many clubs, including AC Milan, still back him.","Tavecchio referred to African players as 'banana eaters'

"A man who murdered an underworld figure, dismembered his body, and dumped it in the ocean off Perth will spend 23 years behind bars. Aaron Carlino shot 56-year-old Stephen Cookson twice in the head with a rifle as he slept on the couch in their East Perth apartment on December 15, 2012. After the murder, the 30-year-old visited a brothel and a boxing match, then took more than a week to cut up the body into six pieces using an angle grinder and a knife, bury it on a private property, dig it up and dump it at sea. Aaron Carlino (pictured)has been sentenced for the murder of Stephen Cookson and will spend 23 years behind bars . Aaron Carlino shot 56-year-old Stephen Cookson (pictured) twice in the head with a rifle as he slept on the couch in their East Perth apartment on December 15, 2012 . The crime was discovered after Mr Cookson's plastic-wrapped severed head washed ashore on Rottnest Island (pictured), where it was discovered by a young girl beachcombing with her family . The crime was discovered after Mr Cookson's plastic-wrapped severed head washed ashore the following month on a Rottnest Island beach, where it was discovered by a young girl beachcombing with her family. 'But for that fortuitous event, you might never have been caught,' Supreme Court of Western Australia Justice Stephen Hall said in handing down the sentence on Thursday. Carlino pleaded guilty to manslaughter, saying he acted in self-defence after months of abuse by his mentor, but that was rejected by the prosecution. During the trial, the jury heard a cash-strapped Carlino moved in with Mr Cookson after being promised payment of $500,000 to act as his driver, but soon became his personal assistant. Carlino said he had amassed large debts during the global financial crisis as a result of a failed bar venture, and claimed he wanted to learn about legitimate business from Mr Cookson. Aaron Carlino used an angle grinder (pictured) and a knife to dismember Stephen Cookson's body . After the murder,  30-year-old Aaron Carlino (pictured) visited a brothel and a boxing match, then took more than a week to cut up the body into six pieces using an angle grinder and a knife, bury it on a private property, dig it up and dump it at sea . Mr Cookson's severed head, wrapped in plastic, washed up on a beach at Rottnest Island (pictured) Justice Hall did not accept Carlino's assertion that he did not know his flatmate was a drug dealer. The judge cited in his testimony that Mr Cookson had told him he 'knew too much' when he complained about the heavy-set older man's gambling and asked if he could leave. Justice Hall accepted Carlino had been assaulted by Mr Cookson on that occasion - including having a spoon jammed into his eye amid threats it would be ripped out. Mr Cookson also said he'd previously killed people, but it was not reasonable for Carlino to believe that meant he was next. 'You did fear him but your reason for staying was more complex than that,' the judge said. 'You ... still held out hope of being paid at the end of the year.' But he eventually became angry and frustrated he had not received his money, Justice Hall said. He said he accepted Carlino was traumatised by ill-treatment at the hands of Mr Cookson, but not to the extent that he did not know what he was doing or that it was wrong. While Carlino felt trapped in a demeaning and abusive relationship, there was no real justification for what he did, the judge said. He should have told police or his loving family, Justice Hall said. 'These events are of utmost seriousness,' he said. Carlino's family wept as the sentence was handed down. While the trial took three-weeks, it took the jury just a few hours to find Carlino guilty of murder.","Aaron Carlino, 30, who murdered an underworld figure, will spend 23 years behind bars .

"Fatal crashes in which mobile phone use has played a part have risen by nearly a third in one year – as users do not fear getting caught, a report reveals today. The AA warns that drivers who use mobile phones are at ‘epidemic’ proportions – and the rising number is frustrating the law-abiding motorists who see others ‘getting away with it’. The motoring organisation has found that one in ten of all motorists have been so annoyed about seeing another driver using their mobile phone at the wheel they have beeped their horn, flashed their lights, gestured or shouted at them. But the latest figures from the Department of Transport show they may be fighting a losing battle. Motorists caught using their phones face three points on their licence and a fine of up to £1,000 (stock image) The number of fatal accidents in which a driver using a mobile was a contributory factor increased from 17 in 2012 to 22 in 2013 – a rise of 29 per cent. Meanwhile, all accidents in which phone use played a part rose from 378 to 422 – up 10 per cent. It is currently legal to use a mobile while driving – but only if you use a hands-free device. If you are caught holding your phone, you face three points on your licence and a fine of up to £1,000. Jim Kirkwood, of AA DriveTech, a driver education service, said: ‘The use of hand-held mobile phones is an epidemic among drivers who appear to be addicted to using their phone whenever and wherever they please. ‘Drivers who use their hand-held phones are at best risking points, a fine or attending an educational course, but at worst they are risking death and serious injury.' People use their mobile phones for a whole range of functions and the latest figures suggest the Department of Transport may be fighting a losing battle . RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘Mobile phone use has been a problem for some time and there’s not been enough action to tackle it. ‘Using a hand-held phone or texting while driving must be made socially unacceptable.’ AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ’The last thing we want to see on our roads are mobile phone vigilantes taking the law into their own hands. ‘But motorists are becoming increasingly frustrated that the law appears not to be being enforced.'","Figures suggest Department of Transport may be fighting losing battle .

"A judge has ruled that a Long Island woman who broke up with her boyfriend can keep the $10,000 ring he gave her because he never proposed to her. The judge said Debbie Lopez of Valley Stream, New York, wasn't bound by a law requiring women to return engagement rings because it was 'given as a gift and not in contemplation of marriage.' Joseph Robert Torres, of Yonkers claims he proposed to the mother of his six-year-old son in 2010 at the Rockefeller Center and their son handed her the ring. A judge has ruled a woman  can keep the $10,000 ring he gave her because he never proposed to her (file) But Ms Lopez, 48, told the New York Post: 'When he gave it to me, he said it was a gift for being a great woman, a good mother of his child.' The attorney for Joseph Robert Torres, of Yonkers, said in court papers that her client was 'stunned' by the ruling. Joseph Robert Torres, of Yonkers claims he proposed to the mother of his six-year-old son in 2010 at the Rockefeller Center and their son handed her the ring . Rules regarding the ownership of rings can vary state to state. In certain states, determining who gets the ring rests on who called off the wedding. Most courts have found that giving an engagement ring on a birthday or a holiday, just makes the ring a simple gift. Some states say engagement rings are conditional gifts that must be returned to the gift giver if the condition does not take place. Courts in some states say a gift, once given, cannot be taken back. There can be an exception in the case of family heirlooms - a ring may be returned to the husband's family if they are family in this case. Traditionally outside the court of law many people hold that if a woman returns the ring if she cancels the wedding, but keeps it if her fiancé makes the break. She said Torres asked Lopez to marry him and she said 'absolutel . Lopez wore it on her left ring finger and even told friends 'Maybe, I don't know yet,' when asked if she was engaged, according to court records. There is no uniform law in the United States regarding engagement rings. Alton Abramowitz, a New York-based attorney and president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers told CNN that laws vary by state, but many consider the ring a 'conditional gift' until the couple actually get married. In certain states, determining who gets the ring rests on who called off the wedding and some states treat an engagement ring given on a holiday differently than one given on a non-holiday. In 2013 NFL star Mario Williams, defensive end for the Buffalo Bills sued his ex-fiancee Erin Marzouki is to get back a $785,000 10-carat diamond engagement ring. Eventually the suit was settled and Williams apologized for suing her, while she apologized that text messages from him were released to the media - it is not clear who ended up with the ring.

"Workers at one of Britain’s biggest family pub chains were told they had been banned from wearing poppies, it was claimed today. Brewers Fayre employees were allegedly told the ban was down to concerns over health and safety, with waitresses and barmen at different pubs claiming nobody was allowed to wear the poppies. But the 150-pub firm - owned by Whitbread - has insisted that it is only staff in kitchens or food preparation areas who should not wear the poppies, over fears their pin could fall in food. Chain: Brewers Fayre employees at pubs including the Home Farm (above) in Hessle, East Yorkshire, were allegedly told the ban was down to concerns over health and safety . However the company has taken the step of apologising to its staff - if they believed that all team members were banned from wearing poppies, saying this was ‘not our intention’. One waitress at a Brewers Fayre in Aldershot, Hampshire, who gave her name only as Sam, 21, said she was angered by the poppy ruling and had lost a friend in the conflict in Afghanistan in 2012. She told The Sun's Katie Hodge, Andrew Parker and Rachel Dale: ‘I’m disgusted. The worst thing you can say is “you can’t wear a poppy”, especially to someone who lost a pal or relation.’ Chef with a poppy: Celebrity restaurateur Gordon Ramsay launches a Poppy Appeal campaign in 2004 . A Brewers Fayre barman at the Highwayman in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, and the company's staff at the Home Farm in Hessle, East Yorkshire, both claimed Whitbread said ‘nobody’ could pin a poppy to their shirt at work. But a Whitbread spokesman told MailOnline: 'It is certainly not our intention to prevent our team members from wearing poppies whilst at work. We are extremely sorry if we have led any team members to believe that is the case and if we have caused them any distress. 'The only thing we stipulate is that in order to abide by food safety legislation, we ask team members who work in or have to pass through a food preparation area to wear poppies with a secure clasp rather than those secured by a single pin. 'We encourage all our restaurants to observe the annual two minute silence and to support the British Legion's campaign by displaying poppies for sale in their bar area.' A Royal British Legion spokesman could not immediately comment when contacted today. Last weekend it was reported how Welcome Break had slashed the amount of time Poppy Appeal collectors are allowed at their motorway services from two weeks to just three days. Volunteers have sold poppies for the whole fortnight of the appeal for the last ten years - but this year they have been told they can only have three days up to Remembrance Sunday. Welcome Break said the cutback was because they have picked Children In Need as their chosen charity this year. But Royal British Legion collectors said it would lead to a huge drop in donations. Separate case: Welcome Break has cut the amount of time collectors can spend at their motorway services to three days. A Royal British Legion branch last year raised £6,000 at the Gordano Services (above) in Somerset . One of the local branches affected is at Portishead, Somerset, where last year volunteer collectors raised £6,000 at the nearby Gordano Services. Brian Clayton, vice president of Portishead's Royal British Legion branch, said: ‘There was no warning. We just had volunteers turn up there and they were told they were not allowed to collect. ‘This will be a great loss to us - probably about 30 to 40 per cent. I have been a member of the branch for 17 years and for most of that time we have had a presence at Gordano for a fortnight, nine to five, seven days a week. It is very disappointing not to be given any notice.’ A Welcome Break spokesman pointed out that collection tins and boxes will still be allowed but access to poppy sellers will be restricted. ‘We continue to support the Poppy Appeal at all 27 of our locations across the UK,’ he said. ‘Whilst we have the utmost respect for the Poppy Appeal, and will display collection boxes at every available opportunity, we don't want to overload our customers with charitable requests.’","Some waitresses and barmen claiming nobody was allowed to wear poppies .

FILIPE LUIS IN A NUTSHELL . Luis was so desperate to force his Chelsea move through that he was banished to train with the Atletico Madrid reserves. In July, he got his wish, and was  brought in to replace the departed Ashley Cole, who left for Roma. Luis doesn't make the top 10 most expensive signings of the summer. He isn't  the most expensive left back, nor is he Chelsea's priciest purchase, yet there can be few as shrewd. The defender is nothing if not consistent. He proved that with Atletico during his four years, and will need to do so with Chelsea as they push for the Premier League this season. Already a La Liga champion, he now seeks Premier League glory. And at £6.2million, he may be worth backing. Ready? Filipe Luis will be hoping you back him in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game ahead of the new season .

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE LUIS IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . It's always best to have statistics to back up theories, so let's look at Luis's from his final year in La Liga with Atletico. Luis made 32 appearances in a defence that conceded just 26 goals to guide Diego Simeone's men to their first title in 18 years. He kept his territory on the left as good as any other in the world, and it is that which has deemed him worthy of replacing his predecessor. He kept a pass completion rate of 80.3 per cent, made 131 tackles and intercepted 49 times. Chelsea can be as good as any at the back and, with four points for every clean sheet, Luis is bound to rack up a sizeable total. HE'S AMBITIOUS . Immediately, Luis is itching for trophies. The 29-year-old is gunning for Champions League glory after suffering heartache in last season's final with Atletico, where rivals Real won 4-1 in extra time. 'Last season was brilliant but I’ve come here to do exactly the same,' Luis told the Chelsea website. ‘I want to go one better in the Champions League and, in terms of the Premier League, I want the trophy badly. ‘Chelsea is the best club for me to do that. We have the best coach and an amazing squad, we have some brilliant players and I hope the supporters will see the Premier League trophy at Stamford Bridge at the end of the season.’ But how will he get you points? Easy. Two points for every appearance, three points for a win, 10 points for every goal he scores, three for an assist and four for every clean sheet. It all adds up.

They are expected to thrive, and it is Mourinho himself who says so, insisting that Luis is ready to go directly into the squad and do his part. 'We have the squad that we want to have,’ said the Chelsea manager. ‘We don’t say it’s perfect, we don’t say it’s the best. There is no manager in the world that says his squad is perfect and could not improve in certain positions. ‘We say we like very much our squad.

"Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims . A Church of England Archbishop covered up the crimes of a serial child sex abuser, a damning report by a judge said yesterday. The former Archbishop of York, Lord Hope, allowed the Very Rev Robert Waddington to escape exposure or punishment for his actions. The judge said Lord Hope’s ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’. Judge Sally Cahill said: ‘Because of the actions he took, and his inaction on other occasions, opportunities were missed for an investigation which may have led to a prosecution during Robert Waddington’s lifetime.’ Waddington died in 2007. One of his victims committed suicide in 1989. Lord Hope had been second only to the Archbishop of Canterbury in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church while in the post from 1995 to 2005. The 74-year-old remains an active Honorary Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Bradford. The report listed seven breaches of Church safeguarding rules by Lord Hope in 1999, five in 2003 and six in 2004. It added that the Bishop of Manchester, the Right Rev Nigel McCulloch, did not take any action out of respect for and obedience to his superior, Lord Hope. The judge’s 126-page report into the way the Church behaved blamed ‘cumulative’ failings by Lord Hope. Claims by Lord Hope that he followed guidelines on abuse were rejected, with the judge saying his failings included ‘not following the Church’s policies’. The judge’s report was drawn up following the decision last year by former Manchester chorister Eli Ward to speak out. He told how from the age of 11 he was groomed and then sexually abused by Waddington. The assaults began in 1984, shortly after Waddington became Dean of Manchester, the cleric in charge of the cathedral. He held the job for nine years. Seven victims who complained about abuse by Waddington between 1955 and 1996 were listed in the report. A head chorister from Carlisle, where Waddington worked in the 1970s, was said to have taken holidays with the clergyman and visited his home. After leaving university the boy, named as Peter and nicknamed Tweet, developed depression and schizophrenia before committing suicide in 1989. Robert Waddington died in 2007. He had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . Judge Cahill said: ‘There is no information that we have received which leads us to doubt the veracity of the accounts we have heard and read from the alleged victims.’ The present Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu, who took over from Lord Hope, said: ‘I am deeply ashamed that the Church was not vigilant enough to ensure that these things did not happen, failing both to watch and to act, when children were at serious risk.’ The Archbishop made a ‘whole-hearted apology’ to the victims, adding: ‘The report is the result of painstakingly meticulous research and, as such, deserves the utmost attention.’ In a statement, Lord Hope described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ and said he was ‘disappointed’ with it. He accused the judge of criticising him unfairly and misunderstanding Church policies. Lord Hope added: ‘This report makes clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. If either of the two persons concerned feel in the light of this report they have been denied the justice they deserve then on behalf of the Church, I offer my personal and profound apology.’ Judge Cahill made a string of recommendations for reforms to CofE child protection policies. Archbishop Sentamu also said the Church would in future ensure that cathedral choirboys are always chaperoned by ‘suitably trained adults’ and that priests may be required to report to police if they hear confessions of child abuse. The Church of England declined to publish Judge Cahill’s report online, which means it is not easily available to the public. The Church said this was ‘at the request of some of those interviewed by the inquiry’. Church officials said the request was made by victims of Waddington.","Report claims Church of England Archbishop covered up abuser's crimes .

"When Louis van Gaal was a talented midfielder of just 17, he had to make a choice that would define his entire life. Making the Ajax first team that at the time boasted the likes of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens or follow his family's wish and train to be a PE teacher. Van Gaal being Van Gaal, he decided to do . both. Enrolling at the Academy of Physical Education to attain his . coaching qualifications, he simultaneously trained with Ajax - and he looked every inch the PE teacher when putting his Manchester United squad through their paces in America. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis van Gaal supervising Manchester United training . Tied up: Manchester United's players had elastic bands attached to their waists for some resistance training . Uncompromising: Louis van Gaal keeps a close eye on the performance of his Manchester United players as they took part in a circuit training session ahead of their International Champions Cup final against Liverpool . No slacking: The Dutch manager watches on as the players are put through their paces in Miami . Push up: Van Gaal makes a point as the players perform one-handed press-ups using basketballs . Test of strength: Striker Javier Hernandez gets to grips with the weights during the training session. The Mexican scored United's third goal in their 3-1 win over Real Madrid on Saturday . Strongman: Wayne Rooney takes his turn to lift the weights as pre-season training continues apace . Barking the orders: Van Gaal watches on as his assistant Albert Stuivenberg issues instructions . Hard work, lads? The players certainly looked as if they'd been put through a hard session . The Sun Life Stadium in Miami resembled a 'Boot Camp' as the players were put through a gruelling session of circuit training. A stopwatch . and a whistle round his neck, van Gaal wore an unrelenting critical . glare as his players sprinted and slalomed through cones, lifted weights . and medicine balls, and took part in resistance training with an . elasticated band around their waists. The . scrutiny was intense. Nobody was allowed to slacken off for a second. If they did, he would issue a stern rebuke or send assistant Albert . Stuivenburg to do it for him. When the players were granted a pause in the sticky Florida evening they looked knackered. VIDEO Van Gaal demands a lot - Fletcher . Ambitious: A young van Gaal (circled) lines up for amateur side SV De Meer. He harboured dreams of playing for Ajax but also continued with his studies to become a PE teacher from the age of 17 . Good start: United have won all four matches under van Gaal's stewardship so far, against the LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid .

Hold on: Keepers Sam Johnstone (left), Anders Lindegaard (middle) and David de Gea take part in the resistance training part of the circuit . Roll with it: The players also used medicine balls and barbells during the circuit . Weighed down: Javier Hernandez smiles as he carries a weight . VIDEO Van Gaal happy with squad . It has become clear on United's American tour that van Gaal is not only trying to instil a new tactical awareness in his players but also make them the fittest and strongest in the Premier League. He had no problem with publicly embarrassing new signing Luke Shaw by saying he wasn't fit enough and made him train on his own to catch up. It doesn't matter if you're the new £31m signing. Even striker . Robin van Persie, the 'teacher's pet', has been told to prove his . fitness before being allowed anywhere near the team. Instructions . are short and sharp, delivered in an authoritative tone. He's not . looking for a discussion, this is what's going to happen. His biographer Maarten Meijer captures this 'schoolmasterly' approach well in his recent book. Slalom: Sam Johnstone steps through the cones as Kagawa waits for his turn behind . Quick step: Kagawa, who set up Hernandez's goal against Real, gets his feet moving . Jog on: Wayne Rooney and Tom Cleverley take part in the warm-up . Return: Darren Fletcher is enjoying his first pre-season in two years following struggles with illness . Get moving: The players size up the circuit as training gets underway in Miami . In form: Ashley Young has scored four times on the American tour as he bids for a first team spot . Thoughtful: Assistant manager Ryan Giggs watches on as the squad train . 'The . experience of daily interacting with often unmotivated or emotionally . troubled youths at school has given these trainers a cutting edge,' he . writes. 'This skills can be recognised in the way they deal with their adult charges - pro players - who can be just as testy and demanding as high school boys, and who intermittently require patient understanding and tough discipline. 'Van Gaal's critics are perturbed by what they consider the coach's schoolmasterly style and tone. 'In their view he is still the high school teacher: ever the smart-aleck, autocratic, comfortably convinced of the superiority of his own opinions, and no one should dare to criticise master van Gaal's methodology.' Van Gaal has always refuted these PE teacher comparisons but, watching him stood, hands planted on hips with an unchanging, unimpressed expression, as his United players are sent round the circuit, it's hard to believe him. LANGUAGE - Twelve different nationalities are represented in Van Gaal's squad, but they have been told to speak English to each other. Van Gaal himself is fluent in English, Spanish, German and Dutch. TABLES - Van Gaal sees meal times as a good time for squad bonding, so he has replaced rectangular tables with circular ones to encourage interaction. MEETINGS - Each night at 10:30pm, Van Gaal sits down with his coaches and senior staff to discuss player progress and plans for the following day. CAMERAS - High-definition cameras have been installed at United's training ground and they have also been evident on the pre-season tour of America to track the players in training. NEW PITCHES - Desso training pitches have been laid at Carrington and new trees have been planted to protect them from wind - a problem raised by Van Gaal in his first interview as United manager.","The Man United squad were put through circuit training at Miami's Sun Life Stadium as they prepare to play Liverpool in International Champions Cup .

"Frank Lampard will never be replaced at Chelsea, says his mentor Jose Mourinho. The Blues' record goalscorer left the club after 13 glittering years this summer, and has since joined title rivals Manchester City on a short-term loan from sister club New York City FC.

'But I think we can never say – in spite of Cesc, who is a fantastic player as you know – that, ""This guy is coming to replace Frank,"" because Frank is Frank and one day he will be alongside Peter Osgood in terms of a statue being built for him, because he’s fantastic.' Mourinho also admitted Chelsea have a real fight on their hands if they are to reclaim the Premier League title.

"It was bought by the King after he married Priscilla in 1967 and became one of his favourite cars to cruise around Memphis in - but Elvis Presley's red Cadillac  has sold for just £55,000. The famous 1967 Coupe de Ville took the singer and his new wife from Las Vegas back to his Graceland mansion in Tennessee after their wedding. The iconic couple regularly took the car to Elvis's 163-acre Circle G ranch in Mississippi where they spent some of their honeymoon. The 1967 Cadillac 1967 Coupe de Ville, owned by Elvis Presley was bought by a private collector at a sale in Las Vegas for just £55,000 . It was bought by a private collector at a sale in Las Vegas held by classic car auctioneers Barrett Jackson on Thursday. Elvis, who by that point was earning $1 million a movie, became known for his love of Cadillacs and would often splash out on the chrome-covered cars as gifts for friends and family. He once even bought a Cadillac for a total stranger who he had spotted admiring his own car. The red 1967 Coupe de Ville is said to have some of the best documentation of any of Elvis' cars, with registration papers clearly showing it listed as belonging to him and giving his address as Graceland, Memphis. An old photograph of the Cadillac taken when Elvis Presley owned it . Just married: Elvis Presley sits cheek to cheek with his bride, Priscilla, following their wedding on May 1 1967 in Las Vegas, Nevada . The Presleys drove the car from Las Vegas back to the singer's Graceland Mansion in Memphis following their wedding . It was owned by American collector Mike Moon since 1979 and had been on display at The Elvis Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The mint condition motor boasts a huge 8-cylinder engine, a three-speed automatic gearbox and black leather interior. Craig Jackson, director of Barrett Jackson, said: 'Elvis and Cadillacs go hand in hand - he was famous for the amount of Cadillacs he bought. 'He bought a lot of Cadillacs for other people and gave a lot of them away too but this was one he kept for himself. 'People would see Elvis driving this car around Memphis.

'It's got more documentation signed by Elvis than pretty much any other car he owned. 'This car has been in several museums over the years. It is unique because it hasn't been passed through private collectors until now.'

"Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, warned today the war against cancer has lost momentum . The system for researching new cancer treatments is ‘broken’, one of Britain’s top academics has claimed. Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, accused ‘risk averse’ pharmaceutical firms of only developing drugs they know will turn a profit. Speaking at the World Oncology Forum in Switzerland, the professor said the war against cancer has lost momentum, despite huge theoretical advances in the laboratory. ‘There have been some impressive advances in the personalised treatment of cancer,’ Professor Workman said. ‘But overall progress has failed to keep pace with the dramatic advances over the last 20 years in our knowledge about cancer biology and genetics. ‘We could, and should, be doing much better. ‘It is my contention that the whole model of cancer drug discovery – in which private companies and academia should be working together to take the most exciting, innovative new drugs to patients – is broken and in need of help.’ Professor Workman, 62, whose own career has focused on the search for cancer treatments, said pharmaceutical giants were only interested in ‘the low hanging fruits’ of cancer which are easily treatable. He claimed theoretical scientists have identified 500 cancer-related proteins which could be attacked by drugs - but only 5 per cent of these treatments have so far been developed. A major problem, he admitted, is finance. Clinical trials are hugely expensive, he said, so companies are unwilling to invest in ‘risky’ drugs which might not be successful. ‘The key to driving faster progress in cancer treatment is incentivising private companies, and the academic organisations that work with them, to take the risks they need to take to discover the truly innovative treatments of the future. ‘In return, pharmaceutical companies will need to accept that they are receiving help from governments, regulators and health services, and they can’t expect to set prices that squeeze every penny of possible profit from those same public institutions.’ He called for the Government to intervene to make things easier for the big drugs companies. He suggested tax breaks for companies which invest in treatments for rare and childhood cancers, where it is less profitable to develop drugs. He also called for a quicker and simpler drugs authorisation system, tax credits for research and development and stronger patents so companies can see a return from their investments. He explained that overall progress has failed to keep pace with the dramatic advances over the last 20 years in understanding the disease . But he also called on universities and drugs firms to change the way they do clinical trials to bring down the cost. More targeted and smaller clinical trials will reduce the initial outlay, and sharing the cost and risk of trials between universities and companies could benefit all parties, he said. ‘I see our broken model of drug discovery and development as the biggest challenge in our efforts to get exciting and game-changing new drugs to patients,’ he said . ‘Until we fix it, we will not see the number of really innovative treatments – capable of making a big impact on the lives of patients – that we should be expecting.' The Government said it had already introduced 10 per cent tax relief on research and development expenditure and a further tax breaks for patented inventions and innovations. George Freeman, Minister for Life Sciences, said: ‘We want to make Britain the best place in the world to design and deliver innovative 21st-century medicines, and to accelerate and support the increasing ""stratification"" of medicines which cancer has spearheaded. ‘That's why we are investing £1 billion annually in the National Institute for Health Research NHS infrastructure, launched and committed to expand the early access to medicines scheme, ring-fenced £750 million for cancer research and development over four years and committed an extra £160 million to the cancer drugs fund.’","Paul Workman is chief executive of Institute of Cancer Research in London .

"One Boy Scout won't be earning his merit badge in Law. A Florida man  arrested for resisting an officer without violence made for an interesting mugshot in his costume. Eric Fagan, 24, was found 'slumped over' in a convertible that was parked facing the wrong way on the street around 3:30am the Saturday morning after Halloween, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Be prepared: Eric Fagan, 24, was arrested in his Boy Scout costume after being found in his convertible 'slumped over' When police asked him about his parking job, he denied he was even facing the wrong way. He continued to be uncooperative, not providing his driver's license to police. He later took out the license to show officers but did not hand it over. 'I explained that I could not read to from where I was standing and that I would not come any closer for officer safety reasons,' the arresting officer wrote in the police report. After eventually handing over the license, he refused to exit the car and had to be 'removed' before officers arrested him. Officers reported that Fagan smelled like alcohol and that his eyes appeared glassy and bloodshot. Police said that a DUI investigation was not conducted on Fagan during the stop due to his 'uncooperative nature.' Fagan was taken in and photographed in his scout's uniform before being held in Orange County Jail.","Eric Fagan, 24, was found in a convertible parked facing the wrong way .

"An epileptic child was forced to sleep in a giant dog cage after her mother's application for a special bed was turned down by local authorities. Sadie Fenton Hunt, 10, has such severe disabilities she needs to be boxed in to her bed every night to stop her crawling out and hurting herself. When her mother moved from Northumberland to Edinburgh to be near her parents earlier this year, she assumed the council would pay for the specialised piece of furniture. Sadie Fenton Hunt had to sleep surrounded by dog caging after her mother's bid for a special bed to keep her from crawling out at night and hurting herself was turned down . Ms Fenton was forced to think on her feet when the application was turned down. She used some furniture to steady the caging . But Ms Fenton was 'totally stunned' when she learned her daughter didn't meet NHS Lothian's criteria, and was forced to put dog caging around a mattress on the floor to keep Sadie safe at night. After sharing photographs of her daughter, who has a mental age of around 18 months, the mother-of-two has been contacted again by the council which has agreed to pay for a new bed. 'Sadie is severely disabled, she's in a special school and has limited ability and lots of learning needs. 'Mentally, she is the age of an 18-month-old so really she is just like a big toddler. 'We moved back to Edinburgh to be near my parents so they could help as I'm a single mother so it has been difficult. 'But I was totally stunned when I learned we couldn't get the same bed we'd had before. I was really upset'. The 41-year-old resorted to caging Sadie's mattress in to keep her from crawling out and hurting herself during the night. Sadie has a mental age of around 18 months and can seriously hurt herself if she crawls out of bed at night . A bed, similar to this one, has been paid for by Edinburgh City Council and will be delivered to Sadie immediately . 'Sadie hasn't ever been on holiday, she'd only ever slept in a bed like that. We need it, we all need to sleep - she does, I do and her brother does as well. 'I just had to think outside the box but to be honest experts do say when dealing with children with special needs, especially as they get older, sometimes dog equipment is best. 'If you think about stair gates, the children's ones are too small for Sadie but one for a tall dog isn't.' In response to the photograph of Sadie sleeping on the floor, Edinburgh City Council said it would pay for the child to get a new bed. 'We have urgently reviewed Sadie’s case and are taking immediate action. We are going to provide the family with a new bed which will meet her current and future needs. 'We would like to apologise to Sadie and her family for any upset caused.'","Sadie Fenton Hunt is 'severely disabled' and has mental age of 18 months .

Josh Johns (pictured) has leukaemia and has received hundreds of postcards from around the world, after his family had to cancel their holiday plans so that he could have chemotherapy . In a bid to cheer him up, his father Jason, 43, asked Josh’s uncle, Matthew, to send his son a postcard from his next business trip to America. Matthew left a post on Facebook asking all his friends to send a postcard to Josh too and this family set up a Facebook page encouraging strangers to send cards too. Their plea went viral and so far Josh has received almost 700 postcards in just over a week. He has been sent postcards from six different continents, in dozens of languages and the campaign has even been supported by actors, David Tennant and Robert Downey Jr. ‘We’ve been blown away by the response - Josh is getting more than 50 postcards a day delivered,’ Mr Johns said. ‘Luckily, we have a very understanding postman. Josh (pictured left with his postcards) was crushed when he found out his summer holiday abroad had been cancelled so he could undergo chemotherapy, but a post on Facebook asking for his uncle to send him a postcard went viral and now he's receiving 50 postcards daily. Josh is pictured with the postman (right) Jason said:'Josh's community nurse said she hasn't seen him so bouncy for a long time. It's definitely helping. Children as young as four have sent him cards, which is lovely. A doctor in America sent him some Dr Seuss books too, which he loved.' Josh is pictured with his father Jason and mother Nikki . Lymphoblastic leukaemia is a cancer of the lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cells that fight viral infections. Symptoms show themselves slowly and become more severe as the number of immature white blood cells in the blood increases. They include: pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness, having repeated infections over a short space of time and unusual and frequent bleeding. The disease means that a person’s bone marrow releases large number of immature white blood cells known as blast cells, which rapidly disrupt the normal balance of cells in the blood. This means that the body does not have enough red blood cells or platelet cells and its white cells are less effective at fighting bacteria and viruses. Around 650 people in the UK have lymphoblastic leukaemia. While it is uncommon overall, it's the most common type of cancer to affect children. Approximately 1 in every 2,000 children will develop it and 85% will be cured. ‘When the first few arrived, we made a little map, and Josh was going to put a sticker on the map where each card came from. ‘But two days later, there were far too many stickers - we’ve just had to put a sticker on each country. ‘Josh’s mother Nikki and I have been completely blown away by how thoughtful people have been. ‘We wanted to take Josh’s mind off his chemo, as it’s fairly nasty, and he has thrown himself into this.’ Josh was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukaemia in March and doctors warned he faced more than three years of treatment to rid his body of the cancer. ‘Since March, Josh has been treated with seven different types of chemotherapy and has spent time in hospital on four different occasions with suspected infections,' his father said. The programme of intense chemotherapy, which lasts for six months, has left Josh very weak and struggling to walk or write. Because of ‘particularly intensive block of treatment, we are unable to take him away on holiday,' Ms Johns wrote on the Josh's Facebook page. 'His latest blood test has shown that he is now neutropenic and has no immune system. This means we now have to keep him away from any possible infections...Chances are we will now spend the rest of the summer holidays at home' To pass the time, Josh reads the messages sent to him from as far away as New Zealand, Australia, America and Japan. 'Josh’s community nurse said she hasn’t seen him so bouncy for a long time. It’s definitely helping,' he continued. ‘Children . as young as four have sent him cards, which is lovely and a woman in . America sent him some Dr Seuss books too, which he loved. Josh has been sent postcards from six different continents, in dozens of languages and the campaign has even been supported by actors, David Tennant (pictured left) and Robert Downey Jr. (pictured right) 'Josh is now crossing off countries as he gets postcards from them - he wants to have one from someone in every country in the world,' his father said. Here he takes delivery of more postcards from the postman . Josh's father hoped that the postcards would take his son's mind of the 'nasty' course of chemotherapy and at first they marked where all the postcards were sent from on a map (pictured left) before more arrived (right) ‘Josh is now crossing off countries as he gets postcards from them - he wants to have one from someone in every country in the world. ‘The way it has taken off has really restored our faith in humanity. When Josh was first diagnosed, we were all devastated. It’s lovely that something like this can come out of something so horrible. ‘He’s had postcards from Leukaemia survivors across the world telling him to keep fighting - it’s been tremendously encouraging. ‘He and his sister Freya, six, are looking forward to taking the postcard collection into school to show their teachers in September - although they’ve had a couple of postcards from members of staff at the school already.’ For details of how to send a postcard to Josh, visit his Facebook page, Postcards for Josh.","Josh Johns, 7, needed chemotherapy which stopped him going on holiday .

"While there’s nothing that divides opinion as quickly as a caravan, they've been an iconic part of the British landscape for decades – as these previously unseen images show. Testament to their ever-changing designs and developments, the National Caravan Council has released a collection of pictures of some of the oldest and greatest caravans known to mankind. The predominantly black and white pictures, which mark the trade body's 75th year, date back to the 19th century and include the world’s oldest  camper which dates back to 1885 and was pulled by two horses. 'The Wanderer' was commissioned by Dr William Stables and designed purely for the pleasure of travel. The open road: An example of an original 1955 Teardrop caravan. The National Caravan Council has released many new images to celebrate it 75th year . Made from mahogany and maple wood, and painted black and gold, former naval officer Dr Stables wanted the life of a gypsy while traveling in style - spawning the nickname ‘Gentleman Gypsy’. The black and white photograph in the collection shows a family enjoying a picnic beside the groundbreaking design. At the time, it was such a novel product that a valet had to ride ahead on a bicycle and clear the way, moving along other road users. The Wanderer was restored over ten years leading up to The Caravan Club’s centenary in 2007 when it took centre stage at Buckingham Palace. Also in the collection, a couple escape the start of the Second World War in their 1939 Eccles caravan and there are examples of caravan parks spanning the last century at beautiful locations throughout the country - from Kent to Scotland. World's first  caravan: Dr William Stables commissioned the 1885  'Wanderer' - which was pulled by two horses and required a valet to ride ahead and clear the roads . Each of them paint the perfect picture of travelling holidays, which were once seen as the height of sophistication. The images include a flyer advertising the first ever International Caravan Exhibition and a colour copy of a 1975 billboard advertising the ideal caravanning holiday. The pictures come ahead of the Motorhome and Caravan show which opens for the 55th time on October 14 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, West Mids.

"Still wearing their boots and helmets, and carrying their weapons, the bodies of German soldiers who died in the Battle of the Seelow Heights have finally been unearthed. A team of archaeologists - the Association for the Recovery of the Fallen - have uncovered the skeletons of men who died defending Berlin from the soldiers of the Red Army in the final days of the Second World War. The dig, in Klessin, Brandenburg, brought to the light weapons, helmets, boots and the bones of those fighting to protect the murderous Third Reich. Scroll down for video . A member of the Association for the Recovery of the Fallen  uncovers the remains of German soldiers in a Soviet trench close to Klessin (Brandenburg), Germany . The work is painstaking: Human beings are buried below the soil. Gradually skulls are unearthed by the archaeologists . In many cases the German soldiers are still wearing their helmets and boots, made of more durable material than their battlesdresses which have worn away. In keeping with the spirit of respect the Association fosters, a simple wooden cross was set up at the site, topped with a distinctive 'coal scuttle' German helmet found in the earth. The battle was part of the Soviet assault on Berlin, lasting three days in April 1945. Almost a million soldiers of the Red Army under the command of Marshal Georgi Zhukov, attacked the position known as the Gates of Berlin. Defending the German position were110,000 soldiers of the 9th Army. Seelow Heights was where some of the most bitter fighting in the overall battle took place. Fighting began in the early hours of April 16 with a massive bombardment by thousands of artillery weapons. On the third day the final line of the Seelow Heights was breached leaving nothing but fractured German divisions between the Red Army and the chancellery in Berlin. A German soldier lies dead in the street as troops rush forward during the battle to gain control of Berlin . Vision of hell: A convoy of Soviet tanks as they drive through the war-torn streets of Berlin in April 1945 . The number of Russian soldiers thought to have died ranges from 5,000 to 33,000, while some 12,000 German troops perished. By April 23, the German capital was fully encircled and the Battle of Berlin entered its last stage. Within a fortnight, Adolf Hitler was dead and the war in Europe was effectively over. For many of the German soldiers who died in the battle where they fell is where they have remained ever since – buried deep in mud and soil - until now. The Association for the Recovery of the Fallen, which consists of volunteers from Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Holland and Switzerland, was founded in 1992, with some 200 members working as volunteers. In memoriam: A cross is planted in the ground above a trench and adorned with a German helmet. A German soldier has lain undisturbed for 70 years after falling in the Battle of the Seelow Heights, part of the Soviet assault on Berlin in 1945 .

A German tin helmet, a boot, a gun, a belt and what looks like a thigh bone are all that is left of a German soldier .

'We want to restore people to their name, which was taken from them over 60 years ago. 'We are not looking for soldiers of the Wehrmacht, not for U.S. GI's, Marines, soldiers of the red army or Polish Military - not for infantry, soldiers, sailors or airmen - not for Good or Bad.

"Earlier this week on ABC’s Q&A, comedian Josh Thomas introduced politician Bob Katter to the gay hook-up app, Grindr – and it seems the Greens party was listening. The Greens have begun advertising on Grindr, using geo-located ads to send targeted messages to members of the gay community in marginal seats. Greens candidate, Sam Hibbins will use the app to send political messages to members of Melbourne’s Prahran electorate, living in the suburbs of Prahran, Windsor, South Yarra and St Kilda East, as the candidate campaigns ahead of the Victoria's state election in November. Sam Hibbins, Greens candidate for Prahran, is using Grindr to send targeted messages to the homosexual community in his electorate ahead of the November 29 state election . ‘This election we're using Grindr to reach voters in Prahran,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page. 'We'll be using it to promote events, our support for equality and broader policies.' Mr Hibbins believes that although he is the first to use the strategy in Australia, the idea will take off as a popular campaign approach. ‘It might seem new and innovative now, but I suspect the other parties will also do it this election,' Hibbins explained in his Facbeook post. ‘Mind you, I don't think Denis Napthine or Daniel Andrews broached it when they addressed the Australian Christian Lobby,’ he added. The first of the Greens’ ten Grindr ads is an invitation to South Yarra gay bar Exchange on Saturday night, to join Hibbins and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young. ‘There might be a perception that the rainbow community supports us,' Mr Hibbins told SMH. 'We want to make sure of that, and being able to reach them effectively is very important for us.' The first of the Green’s ten Grindr ads is an invitation to South Yarra gay bar, The Exchange on Saturday night, to join Hibbins and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young. Hibbins says the smartphone app is a cheap and creative way to reach voters. ‘When the opportunity to advertise on Grindr came up we jumped on it. It was the way of being able to micro-target an audience that was really important,’ Mr Hibbins told SMH. The Prahran seat is known as the ‘pink seat’ amongst politicians, as it is a hub for the gay community, with the latest census data showing 6.6 per cent of Prahran couples are same-sex. ‘It’s fitting that the diverse, vibrant seat of Prahran is the only three way Green-Liberal-Labor marginal in Victoria,' Mr Hibbins wrote on his Facebook page. The seat is currently held by Liberal Clem Newton-Brown by 4.7 per cent. Mr Hibbins says the seat is ‘winnable’ and his approach to the upcoming state election is a ‘grassroots people-powered campaign’, which includes door-knocking and a ‘Grease the Musical sing-a-long fundraiser’ The Labor candidate Neil Pharaoh is also an advocate for gay rights, as he himself is a young gay man. Mr Pharaoh convened Rainbow Labor at a national level, an organisation which 'advocates internally for progressive LGBTI reform.' Mr Hibbins says the seat is ‘winnable’ and has described his approach to the upcoming state election as a ‘grassroots people-powered campaign’, including door-knocking more than 6000 homes and a ‘Grease the Musical sing-a-long fundraiser’ for the party. Whilst it’s believed to be an Australian-first, Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters. Dutch politician Jan-Bert Vroege used the app to campaign in March this year. He did not use pop up messages like Mr Hibbins however, rather transforming his own pre-existing Grindr account, changing his profile description to: ‘let’s have a date on March 19’ to promote a political event about gay issues. Whilst it’s believed to be an Australian-first, Dutch and Irish politicians were the first to use Grindr to connect with voters. The news comes after a heated exchange between north Queensland MP Bob Katter and homosexual comedian Josh Thomas about gay issues in politics, featured on Q & A on Monday. Mr Katter admitted he hadn't discussed the subject of gay rights ""in the last 7 years"". Mr Thomas held Mr Katter to account, pointing out the problems with Mr Katter's refusal to address gay issues. 'You say that it's (mental health issues amongst the gay community) not a priority but you talk about it quite a bit, and when you do talk about it you say awful things,' began Mr Thomas. 'And then when you go out and deny the existence of homosexuals in North Queensland,' Mr Thomas continued. 'They exist, there's an app called Grindr, I'll put it on your phone' he told Mr Katter, who mimed taking notes with a pen. Mr Thomas' impassioned argument was met with loud applause from the audience and an excited response from the Twitter community. 'All you need to do (is) say you say you know what, I've said some things in the past, it was a mistake,' said Mr Thomas, telling Mr Katter how to move forward in a more positive manner. '(You need to say) I understand now, it's (Mr Katter's comments) hurting people's mental health, it's part of the problem, not part of the solution. 'I'm sorry, hooray for homosexuals, here's some glitter.'","A Melbourne Greens candidate is sending targeted messages on Grindr .

"The temperature is a balmy 25c; pulling my sunglasses over my eyes, I warm my face in the bright sunshine before taking a sip of sangria. Aaaah, Barcelona - the perfect destination for a summer break. Except this is October and I'm not here to put my feet up. I'm on a mission to buy a new winter wardrobe and I've got another shop to visit. Going abroad for a little retail therapy isn't something I've ever done before. I have a couple of glamorous friends who occasionally jet off to New York to stock up on the latest designer labels, but my budget has never stretched further than my local High Street. Bagging a bargain: Clare travelled to Spain to see if she could save money on her winter wardrobe . Never mind the purchases you make when you get there, you have to factor in paying for flights and a hotel. Not to mention getting to and from the airport, travelling around the city, and eating. But I've discovered that several clothing brands are much cheaper in Spain than in the UK. Zara, Massimo Dutti and Mango cost up to 39 per cent less in Espana than here at home. Not surprisingly, they are all Spanish brands. Items are either manufactured in Spain or, if they're made further afield, channelled through Spanish distribution centres. If they don't have to travel on far then it's going to bring costs down. The exchange rate is also relatively advantageous and taxes tend to be lower. But how much cheaper does this make it? I decided to see if I could buy a whole winter wardrobe - and pay for a return flight and a night in a hotel in Barcelona - for no more than the cost of buying exactly the same clothes in the UK. I chose 13 key items - a work dress, party frock, trousers, skirt, winter coat, smart jacket, shirt, casual top, ankle boots, pair of smart heels, jumper, leather gloves and scarf. So can it be done? Booking my flight five days before my trip, I discover I can fly Ryanair from my local airport, Stansted, to Barcelona’s main airport for £93.98. Feeling quite pleased with myself, I turn my attention to a hotel. A frantic afternoon scrolling through myriad price comparison websites results in a booking at the Hotel Catalonia Park Putxet for £47. It's a four-star hotel, so I’m pleased with my bargain. With the basics in place, off I set on an 8.20 am flight. Travelling with hand luggage only, I pack the bare essentials, so my bag is left virtually empty for my new purchases. Luckily, while gloomy Britain is being drenched with rain, Barcelona is having an autumnal heatwave, so there’s no need to pack a coat. Worth the trip: It's far cheaper to shop at Zara and Mango in Spain . The exchange rate on the day I travel means one euro equals roughly 79p - or £1 = €1.26. A bus from the airport to the city centre costs €5.90 (£4.67) and once I'm there, a two-day travelcard to get me round the Metro costs € 14.40 (£11.40). So far I've spent £158 - and that's without buying anything to eat. Can I cover it all in savings at the shops? After dumping my bag in my hotel room, I head to the main shopping street off the Placa de Catalunya, Barcelona’s main square. My first destination is Zara - owned, like Massimo Dutti, by Spanish retail giant Inditex. One of the UK's favourite stores, it's favoured by stylish women including the Duchess of Cambridge, who chose a floaty blue Zara dress the day after her wedding in 2011. Here, I spot the perfect work dress - a dog-tooth-pattern shift with forgiving elbow-length sleeves. Figure-hugging but smart, it costs €39.95 (£31.63). In the UK, this dress would have set me back £49.99, so that’s a saving of £18.36 to start with. Then I spy a navy blazer with a single brass button that will go with everything and is so classically chic, it’s surely one the Duchess of Cambridge would have her eye on if she wasn't expecting. This is €69.95 (£55.38), but in the UK is priced at £79.99, saving me £24.61. Royal fan: The Duchess of Cambridge has worn Zara clothes on numerous occasions, including the day after she married Prince William when she wore this blue dress at Buckingham Palace . Now I'm on a roll. I spot a soft camel coat for €79.95 (£63.30) that would be £89.99 at home, saving me more than £25, a pair of comfy leather ankle boots for €69.95 (£55.38) that are £69.99 in the UK and a stripy top for €12.95 (£10.25). Unfortunately, a pair of silver kitten heels I'd coveted at home were sold out and the store is generally lacking in glam shoes, but a pink-and-black party dress with jewel embellishments is there for €49.95 (£39.52), a saving of about £20 on buying it in Britain, where it would cost £59.99. While gloves are the last thing I need in sunny Barcelona, I try to remember I am putting together a 'winter' wardrobe. I imagine doing the school run on an icy December morning and pick up a pair of black leather gloves for €29.95 (£23.70). These are £29.99 in the UK. My next stop is Mango. I've always thought of Mango as a store for the under-30s. However, I'm surprised to find a red jumper with pretty detailing. It's viscose and polyester, but at €19.99 (£15.82) is such a bargain it won’t matter if it doesn’t last. It’s less of a bargain back at home, though, where it costs £24.99. While many of the skirts in Mango are too thigh-skimming for my liking, I find a knee-length black and navy pencil skirt for €29.99 (£23.75), which looks great with the sweater. On the British High Street, it would cost £34.99. Sadly, there are no party shoes here either, but I find a cosy tartan scarf for €19.99 (£15.82). UK price? £24.99. As I'm about to pay for my items, I spot a display of sunglasses. They're not on my winter shopping list, but as one of the arms fell off my own pair on the flight over - and the sun is very bright - I treat myself to a pair of tortoiseshell specs. At €19.99 (£15.82), they're nearly a tenner less than in the UK, where they’re £24.99. By this point I’m too exhausted to shop any more and treat myself to a bowl of gazpacho soup, a roll and a small jug of sangria in a beautiful square off Las Ramblas - Barcelona’s tree-lined promenade. The cost is an eye-watering €17 (£13.45), but then I am in prime tourist territory. Pays to shop in Spain: Items in Zara can be 39 per cent less than they are in the UK . After returning to my hotel to recharge my batteries, I spend the evening exploring in the vibrant squares of the Gracia area 15 minutes’ walk from my hotel. Dinner is tapas - what else? - and a beer for €25 (£19.79) before heading to bed for an early night. As I've still got three items on my list to find, I’m in the hotel having cafe con leche and a croissant by 8.30 am, despite that breakfast is €8 (£6.33) extra. Then it’s back on the Metro and once more to the shops. Massimo Dutti, which has 11 stores around the UK, is Zara’s older, more upmarket sister. But there are big savings to be made here, too. A classic white stretch shirt with black piping detail will look great with the pencil skirt. In Barcelona it costs me €49.95 (£39.53), but in the UK is £54.95. Meanwhile, a pair of dark red trousers are also €49.95 (£39.53) but would cost £54.95 at home. And I find a pair of shoes that will be perfect for work and Christmas parties. The crocodile-skin-effect slingbacks are €89.95 (£71.17) - my most expensive purchase - but would have cost £89.99 at home. Finally, I have everything - all 13 items, plus some bonus sunglasses. It's time to head back to the airport for my 2.35pm flight. Of course, to avoid paying for check-in baggage I have to wear as much as possible. Piling on my blazer and coat when the temperature is 25c leaves me hot and red-faced. At least, because I've been shopping in the EU I don't have to pay import duty. So did I manage to save enough on my shopping to cover the cost of my mini-break? When I tot everything up I discover - hurrah! - I am £3.89 in credit! Sun, sea and savings? It pays to shop in Spain.

"A mentally ill North Carolina inmate held in solitary confinement for 35 days died of dehydration, an autopsy report revealed Thursday. Michael Anthony Kerr, 54, was found unresponsive in the back of a van on March 12 while being transported to a mental hospital. Officials say that prior to being driven to the mental hospital, Kerr was being held in solitary confinement -- or 'The Hole' -- at the Alexander Correctional Institution in Taylorsville. During his confinement, Kerr was reportedly cited twice for flooding his cell. 35 Days: Kerr was reportedly held in solitary confinement for more than a month prior to his death . Investigation: Department of Public Safety secretary Frank L. Perry pledged in March to conduct a thorough investigation into Kerr's death, no details of the investigation have been made public . Alexander Correctional Institution policy allows prison staff to turn off the water to an inmate's toilet or sink for 'misuse of plumbing.' Authorities noted abrasions on Kerr's arms that were consistent with being restrained. Kerr suffered from schizoaffective disorder -- a mental illness featuring symptoms of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder -- and officials say he was not receiving treatment at the time leading up to his death. ABC News reports that Frank L. Perry, public safety secretary, pledged to conduct a 'thorough' and 'aggressive' investigation into the death of Kerr, who had been serving a 31-year sentence as a 'habitual felon.' Kerr's sister: Brenda Liles, Kerr's sister, said she tried repeatedly to contact prison officials to help her brother . The agency has yet to make public any results of the investigation. ABC reports that Pathologist Dr. Lauren Scott said in a medical examiner's report that she could not determine whether Kerr's death was natural, accidental, or a homicide. Venuti said that missing key details led to lack of information led to unanswered questions about the circumstances leading to Kerr's death, including when he was last provided with food and water. 'It was not possible to make any firm conclusions regarding the inmate's nutrition and fluid intake,' Venuti said, 'and whether or not his mental health and/or external factors played a role in the dehydration.' Earlier this year, Kerr's sister, Brenda Liles, told the Associated Press that she and her brother had struggled with mental illness since the death of his two sons In recent years. Liles also told the AP that she tried to contact prison officials days before her brother's death in an effort to get him help after hearing from another inmate that Kerr was in danger. Since Kerr's death, an ACI nurse and staff psychologist resigned and a captain and four nurses have been fired by the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. The agency failed to respond to a request filed Thursday for information regarding Kerr's punishment. The agency reportedly said in a statement that the autopsy's findings are being reviewed and an investigation into Kerr's death is ongoing.","Autopsy: Michael Anthony Kerr, 54, died of dehydration .

"It's the dilemma that haunts every British homeowner: how safe are my children from a zombie apocalypse? A Leeds merchant has finally answered public concerns by making a undead-proof shed - which will set you back a mere £69,995, plus £20,780 for installation, CCTV, riot gear and solar panels. The so-called Zombie Fortification Cabin also has an escape hatch, an interior garden, weapons storage and a 360-degree vantage point, all with a ten-year anti-zombie guarantee. A flamethrower or water cannon, however, will cost you extra. Scroll down for video . An Englishman's home is his Zombie Fortification Cabin: For the man who has everything, why not buy a zombie-proof shed for more than £90,000 including installation, weapons storage, an escape hatch, a ten-year anti-zombie guarantee and eco-friendly solar panels? Safehouse: The cabin contains bedrooms and an enclosed vegetable garden in case there is a long siege by bloodthirsty brain-eaters . Designed just in time for Halloween, the shed - ZFC1 for short - has not yet had any buyers, but that hasn't stopped it attracting a wide range of reviews on its manufacturer's website. One, Shaun of the Dead, called it the 'Winchester of Log Cabins' adding: 'In my time I’ve had little respect as an electronics shop employee, with no real direction in life. But when I bought this Zombie proof log cabin I became the envy of all my neighbours! 'It’s big enough for me as well as my girlfriend and rather vulgar unemployed best friend (who could quite easily be mistaken for a zombie!). With this, any potential zombie apocalypse which could overwhelm the town, I'll have a nice cup of tea and wait for it all to blow over.' Not everyone was happy, however. A disgruntled Roger Rotter the Zombie wrote: 'I officially HATE this zombie proof log cabin!! 'Having roamed our way through the land mines, in just about one piece, a cluster of us avoided the flamethrowers and made it to the walls. No matter what we tried (eating through the walls, climbing to the roof etc) we just couldn't break in. 'Unfortunately, as time wore on it became obvious this was a lost cause and some 28 days later we gave up.' Protection: The expansive shed includes a place to store shotguns and bombs, beside a set of instructions on how to kill the undead . Ominous: All the photos in this article are artists' impressions since, sadly, no one has yet bought one of the sheds for genuine use . The bizarre idea was dreamed up by Leeds firm Tiger Log Cabins, and although there haven't yet been any sales, there have been some allegedly serious enquiries from across the Atlantic. Managing director Ross Moran, 29, told MailOnline: 'We've had a few people from America interested who are taking it a bit literally. They're thinking about having it on their ranch.' He added: 'Obviously it's a bit of a joke but the cabin is buildable. So if we get someone who's genuinely interested and has the money we would keep to our word and go and build it for them.' The idea for the cabin came after a conversation in the office about what would happen in a zombie apocalypse. Marketing director Jack Sutcliffe said: 'The conversation went from there and one of the team jokingly suggested that we would all be OK because we could just build ourselves a special log cabin and all hide in there. From there the idea was born and we thought ""well, why not"".' There is one hitch, however: planning permission. Mr Moran conceded: 'We'd have to say what we tell all our customers - check with your local authority because they all have different rules, even when it comes to preventing a deadly swarm of the undead'. Diagram: The company has even produced 3D blueprints for the cabin's design, which could be a dangerous help to brainier zombies .

"Riding the waves has been given a boost, literally, thanks to the latest electric-powered wakeboard. The Radinn board is made of lightweight carbon fibre and travels at up to 25 knots (29mph or 46 km/h) - meaning users don't need a boat to get up to speed. The Swedish designers unveiled the board at the Cannes Yachting Festival earlier this month and it is set to retail for €15,000 (£11,800 or $20,000) when it goes on sale next year. Scroll down for video . The Radinn board (pictured) is made of carbon fibre. It features a salt-water jet propulsion system and is powered by lithium batteries. Speed is controlled by a wireless remote and the current prototype can travel at speeds up to 25 knots (29mph or 46 km/h), but the firm said the final version is being designed to go faster . Founder and Swedish wakeboarder Philip Werner devised the electric-powered board in 2012, while studying at Lund University. A prototype was developed, alongside partner Alexander Lind, and engineers Oskar Odén and Filip Böttcher, and the first electric powered wakeboard was revealed in May 2014. The Radinn board features a saltwater-resistant jet-propulsion system, and is powered by lithium batteries contained in a waterproof pocket.

"Dozens of pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a New Zealand beach - but rescuers did manage to save another 22 of the animals. The whales came ashore at Ohiwa Harbour in the Bay of Plenty, prompting a major rescue effort involving volunteers and the local Maori community. The Department of Conservation said 25 of the whales died and 11 had to be euthanized. But the rescuers successfully released a group of 22, which swam out of the harbor to deeper water. The whales came ashore at Ohiwa Harbour in the Bay of Plenty, prompting a major rescue effort involving volunteers and the local Maori community . Wildlife conservationists from non-profit organization Project Jonah co-ordinated efforts to shepherd the whales through the channel and out to the ocean. The group wrote on its Facebook page: 'We did it! All 22 whales were shepherded through the mouth of the harbour to the ocean and were last seen heading towards deeper water. 'A tremendous effort from all those involved and a reminder of how important community can be. A huge thank you to our medics who answered the call.' Mass pilot whale strandings are common in New Zealand, but scientists unclear about why the marine mammals swim ashore in large groups. The short-finned pilot whale is known for its close-knit social groups. One theory is that if one whale gets stuck or stays behind, the others are likely to stay or even beach themselves as well. Wildlife conservationists from non-profit organization Project Jonah co-ordinated efforts to shepherd the whales through the channel and out to the ocean . The Department of Conservation said 25 of the whales died and 11 had to be euthanized. But the rescuers successfully released a group of 22, which swam out of the harbor to deeper water . The species get their name from the fact that it is thought that each pod follows a 'pilot' in the group. Daren Grover, general manager of Project Jonah told the BBC that the rates of whales stranded in New Zealand are higher than anywhere in the world. 'It's something we have lived with and we are quite geared up to respond to,' he said. 'Today was a great effort - all those that were alive were refloated.' Pilots are among the smaller of the whale species, with adult males reaching up to 18 feet in length and females 12 feet. The species is also the one most frequently involved in mass strandings.

"Sam Allardyce admits the heat is already on at West Ham after starting the new campaign with a home defeat. It wasn’t simply the pain of losing to neighbours Spurs but also the experience that a flying start can set the tone for the months ahead, while an early setback is only likely to increase anxiety levels. Asked when he expected to start feeling the pressure, he guffawed and replied: 'Tomorrow'. VIDEO Scroll down for Sam Allardyce gets defensive on talk of him being sacked .

Back of the net: Eric Dier (right) celebrates with team-mate Harry Kane after scoring Tottenham's winner . Allardyce studies trends and statistics. 'The start is everything,' he admitted. 'It is a trigger to the whole season and whereabouts you are going to finish. 'The perfect example is our first two seasons back in the Premier League where we acquired 14 points in the first eight games in the first [season] and only eight in the first eight last season. 'We saw that last season was a struggle. In the end we finished six points behind the season before. 'We had a huge amount of problems and lot of criticism for results and that comes by allowing yourself to slip into the bottom or relegation zone. That is where the pressure really mounts on you.

Allardyce must ensure West Ham respond in another London derby, against Crystal Palace on Saturday. He has not given up hope of adding to the squad and hopes more players are closer to full fitness by then, including new signing Enner Valencia, who came off the bench against Spurs. 'When everyone is fit, our squad runs at the same level as most teams around our level,' he added, and he was heartened by much of what he saw in Saturday’s 1-0 defeat and felt his team would have won had Mark Noble not missed the penalty awarded as Tottenham went down to 10 men. Debutant: New signing Enner Valencia came off the bench for the Hammers . 'I don’t think there is much doubt about that,'said Allardyce. 'But I would want the players to forgive Mark for missing a penalty for the first time and not put it on him as a heavy burden as he does not deserve it. His penalty taking in the three years that I have been here has been absolutely superb. 'We have to forgive him for missing the odd one and the rest of the lads should have made up for that.

A crowd of several hundred exasperated fans is expected to join representatives from the Football Supporters’ Federation as they seek to lower prices. Kevin Miles, chief executive of the FSF, claimed: ‘Nine out of 10 fans think football’s too expensive.’ Citing the Premier League’s current £5.5billion broadcast bounty, up £2.1bn on the previous agreement, Miles added: ‘Football is swimming in money, with clubs pocketing record amounts from broadcasting deals while squeezing supporters with high prices.

'It's not something that affected me or played on my mind at all. It wasn't hurtful. Much of it is tongue-in-cheek, of course. 'What does play on my mind is when I’ve made a mistake, particularly an influential one that has affected the outcome of a game. I’d be dishonest if I said it didn’t bother me. 'One newspaper listed the five games I’d want to forget over the course of my career. Well, there’s more than five. But against the backdrop of more than 500 professional games – I can think of many top professional footballers who have made plenty of mistakes but are still top professional footballers.'

He officiated in two World Cups and was handed the finals of the 2010 World Cup and Champions League. But that did not stop English fans questioning his integrity throughout his career.

Chelsea had intended to give him more games with their first team but Karanka will be able to offer even more consistent game time. Dropping down: Chelsea youngster Patrick Bamford is set to join Championship side Middlesbrough on loan . Everton and West Ham lead chase for Amalfitano . Everton, West Ham, Hull, Sunderland and Crystal Palace have expressed an interest in Marseille midfielder Morgan Amalfitano was in the stands at Loftus Road on Saturday to watch Hull City take on QPR. Amalfitano is available on a free transfer after an ugly fall out with coach Marcelo Bielsa that has culminated in the player being told to stay away from the Marseille training ground. The 29-year-old had a productive loan spell at West Bromwich Albion last season and is in London ahead of talks with Premier League clubs. In demand: Everton, West Ham and Hull are among the clubs interested in Marseille's Morgan Amalfitano (right) West Ham have already spoken with his representatives and are considered favourites to reach an agreement. Everton are considering a number of options following the injury to midfielder Ross Barkley. Fulham in talks with Hildebrand . Fulham have opened talks with former Germany goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand. The 35-year-old is a free agent after leaving Schalke and is well known to coach Felix Magath. Hildebrand's last visit to London did not leave a favourable impression as his blunder allowed Samuel Eto'o to score the opening goal for Chelsea in their 3-0 Champions League defeat of Schalke in November. However, Magath wants an experienced keeper to help his young players. He gave a debut to 21-year-old Finland man Jesse Joronen in goal on the opening day of the season after selling David Stockdale to Brighton and allowing Maarten Stekelenburg to join Monaco on loan.","Brendan Rodgers faces competition from Juventus and Real Madrid for Falcao as he looks to strengthen his attacking options .

"Stuart Pearce has claimed that Manchester City were close to going bankrupt during his managerial spell at the Etihad Stadium. The current Nottingham Forest manager was in charge at City between March 2005 and May 2007 and states that the sale of Shaun Wright Phillips for £21million to Chelsea shortly after his arrival proved crucial in keeping the club afloat. 'The club had sold the club shop, sold the ground to council, we were paying on the never-never for the Anelkas of this world,' Pearce told the The Mirror. VIDEO Scroll down to watch how times have changed with Manchester City's squad of stars . Reflect: Current Nottingham Forest boss Stuart Pearce has claimed Manchester City were close to going bust under his management between 2005 and 2007 - forcing him to sell Shaun Wright Phillips . 'It really was a case that the owners said, 'Unless Wright-Phillips goes, we go.' On the Monday morning they pressed the button and Chelsea put £21million in the bank which bails the club out, which puts pressure on me because you are selling your goal-scorer. 'The club has gone from strength to strength and now they are a world power and spending £150m on a training complex. Times change.' City would struggle against relegation during Pearce's two full seasons at the Etihad Stadium. It was a period in which City were struggling financially before Sheikh Mansour's billions dramatically altered the club's fortunes for the better in 2008 when he took control of the club. On the back foot: Pearce's two years at City saw the club struggle financially as well as in the league table . Key man out: Pearce claims City were forced to sell Shaun Wright-Phillips to Chelsea for £21million . By then, Pearce was long gone after he was dismissed to make way for Sven Goran Eriksson under previous owner Thaksin Shinawatra a year earlier. Pearce looks back at his Manchester City experience with fondness though and admits as a manger it made him appreciate the youth academy. 'We had the likes of Micah Richards, Stephen Ireland, Nedum Onuoha and Kasper Schmeichel all coming through the academy system.' Pearce added. Young guns: Micah Richards and Stephen Ireland emerged as young talent under Stuart Pearce's tenure . Focus on youngsters: Nedum Onuoha and Kasper Schmeichel also came through City's academy . 'Ideally you don’t want to go and buy a footballer, you want to pluck him from the academy and move him from one pitch to the next.

"At the heart of Arsenal’s defence, Calum Chambers played as if he owned the place. This was a performance of breathtaking maturity. To watch an Englishman as composed as Chambers on the ball, dropping off those extra 10 yards to be in possession or striding forward through midfield is something special. Long may it continue. Even with Fraizer Campbell breathing down his neck, he was always a step ahead of the game. VIDEO Scroll down for Wenger: Calum Chambers was educated as a central midfielder . Composed: Calum Chambers impressed for Arsenal as he made his debut for the club in the Premier League in the 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday . Winning start: Chambers (left) runs away to celebrate after Laurent Koscielny brought Arsenal level at 1-1 . Late winner: Aaron Ramsey pounced in stoppage time to earn all three points for Arsenal . Arsenal came from behind to win on the opening day for the third time — no other side has done so more often in Premier League history. The way he reads situations is remarkable for his age, showing far more composure in Arsenal’s defence than his experienced team-mate Laurent Koscielny. Think of the great ball-playing English centre backs, from Bobby Moore to Rio Ferdinand. This 19-year-old has similar traits. This is a future England defender. Last season he played right back but he was identified as a centre back as he came through Southampton’s academy. Wenger, to his credit, will always be remembered as the manager who had the conviction to make the change. It is a good decision. Chambers has already grown into the Arsenal shirt — enjoying life at the club and progressing at a remarkable pace. ‘Calum has come in and surprised everyone already,’ said left back Kieran Gibbs. ‘During the season we don’t get to watch other players much, so I didn’t know too much about him.’ Faith: Arsene Wenger was more than willing to throw Chambers into the team straight away . Trophy cabinet: Chambers helped Arsenal to victory in the FA Community Shield last weekend . He excelled in the Community Shield the previous weekend, part of an Arsenal team who beat the champions 3-0 on the grandest stage of all. Soon enough, when Chambers is called into the England squad, Wembley will be his home on the international stage. On Tuesday, he will be in Europe, playing in a Champions League qualifier against Besiktas at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. On Monday morning, when Arsenal train before they travel to Turkey, Wenger must decide whether to take World Cup-winning defender Per Mertesacker. Although Mertesacker has only just returned to training after a break following Germany’s triumph, Wenger is tempted to turn to experience against Slaven Bilic’s side. Experience: Wenger may prefer German World Cup-winner Per Mertesacker to Chambers for Tuesday night's Champions League play-off with Besiktas in Istanbul . Rest: Mertesacker was given time off to recover after Germany won the World Cup out in Brazil . This is a demanding week for Arsenal, who face a four-hour flight to Turkey and will return in the small hours of Wednesday morning in order to prepare for Saturday’s trip to Everton. Arsenal were ordinary on Saturday, but they were faced with unusual circumstances after Palace manager Tony Pulis left the club 48 hours before the start of the season. It will take time for Alexis Sanchez to gel with his team-mates and he should be granted it. He was welcomed to the league with some fierce challenges from Palace captain Mile Jedinak and his midfield partner Joe Ledley. Arsenal are still bedding in, scrambling a result after they fell behind to a clever corner routine that ended when Brede Hangeland flicked a header beyond Wojciech Szczesny. Towering: Brede Hangeland rises above the Arsenal defence to give Palace the lead on 35 minutes . Level terms: Laurent Koscielny got in behind the Palace defence to equalise for Arsenal on half-time . Arsenal recovered when Koscielny equalised just before half-time and Aaron Ramsey struck Arsenal’s winner. It was tough on Palace, but the priority is to find a manager before Saturday’s clash with West Ham at Selhurst Park. Although chairman Steve Parish is considering Tim Sherwood and Malky Mackay for the role, he has been advised to hire a manager with some serious Premier League experience. He held a mini board meeting with fellow directors before the game and they will explore a number of options this week. The timing of Pulis’s exit came as a shock to the players after a tough pre-season schedule in Austria, the USA and Germany. Keeper Julian Speroni said: ‘As professionals we need to deal with it and move on. Tony was very good for us and we learned a lot with him. We’re sad to see him go this way, but the players have learned a lot from last season. ‘The education he gave us will make us stronger.’ Manager search: Palace co-chairman Steve Parish needs to find a replacement for Tony Pulis .

"A female judge has said a man who took hundreds of photos up ladies' skirts at the Lincoln Memorial because she believes he did not violate their privacy. Christopher Hunt Cleveland from Springfield, Virginia, was arrested in July 2013 after police officers caught him taking 'upskirt' shots of women sitting above him on the steps of the monument in Washington D.C. He was then charged with voyeurism after officers reportedly found inappropriate images taken over more than a year on the camera's memory card, which he had tried to removed as he walked away. However D.C. Superior Judge Juliet McKenna drop the case at the end of last month, suggesting women should have no expectation of privacy in a public place. Case dropped: A judge ruled that Christopher Cleveland, who took hundreds of 'upskirt' photos of women at the Lincoln Memorial, did not violate their privacy and was not guilty of voyeurism (file picture) In her judgement, she wrote: 'This Court finds that no individual clothed and positioned in such a manner in a public area in broad daylight in the presence of countless other individuals could have a reasonable expectation of privacy.' In her statement, she added: 'The images captured were not 'incidental glimpses' and in fact were images that were exposed to the public without requiring any extraordinary lengths whatsoever, to view. 'The photographs recovered from Mr Cleveland's camera memory card depict a variety of images ranging from long shots of the Washington Monument and Reflecting Pool and groups of people sitting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, to close up photos of individual women seated or standing in the area. 'As Defendant's Response acknowledges some of these women are seated in such a way that their private areas, including the upper inches of their buttocks, are clearly visible. 'However, all of these images were similarly available to other passer-by in the area.' The court documents added that there was no evidence Mr. Cleveland positioned his camera in any waym or employed any photographic techniques , so as to capture images that were not already on public display. Exposure: D.C. Superior Judge Juliet McKenna said women should have no expectation of privacy in a public place and that any person could have taken the photos he did . But she did question his behavior, saying: 'The fact that the Defendant was intentionally photographing publicly exposed areas of women's clothed and unclothed bodies…is repellent and disturbing.' After Cleveland was arrested, police also reportedly searched his car and found and found a laptop containing at least 150 PowerPoint slide presentations, each containing 30 or more upskirt images or images leading up to the shots. Park Police said the Lincoln Memorial steps are 'commonly used by individuals engaged in voyeuristic activity', but Cleveland avoided prosecution. Some areas are however taking to steps to make sure it is against the law. In March, after a Massachusetts court ruled that upskirt photos were legal in the state, the legislature quickly pushed through a bill criminalizing it. In appropriate shots in the Bay State are now punishable by as many as five years in jail or fines up to $5,000. Texas also recently passed a law against photographs taken 'with the intent to arouse or gratify' sexual desire, though that wason First Amendment grounds.","Christoher Hunt Cleveland took hundreds of inappropriate photos at site .

"A little girl born looking like a ‘broken doll’ is having her face and entire body painstakingly re-built. Kira Yates suffers a rare condition which meant she was born with malformations of the skull, face, hands and feet. But she has been gradually put back together during a series of 14 major operations - including surgery to have her skull smashed and reshaped. Kira Yates, with her mother Michelle, has a rare condition dubbed 'broken doll syndrome'. Her body is being put back together during a series of major operations - including surgery to smash and re-shape her skull . Kira, nine, suffers from Apert syndrome, has also had metal bars fitted in her neck to hold the rest of her body in place. The condition is caused by a chromosomal defect. It results in premature fusion of certain skull bones which prevents the skull from growing normally and affecting the shape of the head and face. Children with Apert's have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides, according to the Children's Craniofacial Association. They may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems, suffer from a  cleft palate, and/or have webbed fingers and toes. Kira's mother Michelle, 47, said: 'Kira's bones aren’t like everyone else’s - she’s just a broken doll. 'She’s . had to be put back together like a jigsaw. It was a big shock when she . was born. As soon as she arrived she was taken away from me and wrapped . up. Kira (pictured here at a year old) has Apert syndrome - a condition caused by a chromosomal defect . Children with Apert syndrome can also suffer from webbed fingers and toes. Kira had to have each of her fingers and toes separated to give her ten digits and was also born with no knuckles . 'Her head was really big at the front, her hands and feet were fused like a glove and she just had stumps for big toes. 'She had a cleft palate and there was even a big bump sticking out at the bottom of her back. “The doctors didn’t even know what was wrong with her - they had to get a specialist in to diagnose her. 'It’s a miracle to think how much she has achieved considering how poorly she was as a baby.' 'She copes very well, and much better than doctors ever thought she would. 'But . it’s hard for her - she can’t look left and right, and she has no . knuckles so it can be difficult for her as a nine-year-old to do the . things she wants to do. Kira before and after her facial reconstruction. During the operation, her skull was smashed and re-shaped. She also had metal plates inserted into her face, which will help build it up and re-shape it . In the first year of her life, she underwent major facial surgery and once attended 27 appointments in a month . 'She gets the mickey taken out of her a lot . because of her looks, but that’s just life, and she has learned to deal . with it. She really is a child that doesn’t let anything stop her. 'Many parents give children with Apert up for adoption but we knew we had to find a way to get through it.' Kira, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, has a severe form of the condition, which affects one in every 100,000 babies. Within the first year of her life, she underwent major facial surgery and once attended 27 appointments in a month. Apert syndrome is a condition involving abnormal growth of the skull and the face due to early fusion of certain sutures of the skull. Children with Apert's have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides. They usually have problems with teeth alignment due to the underdevelopment of the upper jaw. Some have cleft palate. Among other anomalies, children with Apert syndrome have webbed fingers and toes. It affects one in every 100,000 babies. She has since had more than a dozen further procedures, including the most recent - a 14-hour operation at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital to lift her sunken face. The surgery involved inserting metal plates into Kira’s face before fitting her head with a metal frame. This helped to bring the bones in her head forward to transform her appearance. Her mother said: 'She’s gone through a lot, including being rushed into surgery to have two metal bars fitted in her neck to secure her head in place so she wouldn’t become paralysed from the neck down. 'She was in hospital six days in total . and had to be put into a coma for two days after the operation - waking . up to a face full of metal is a lot for a nine-year-old to take in.' 'During this latest operation Kira had metal plates inserted into her face, which will help build it up. 'Wires are attached to the plates and the frame, which we have to manipulate to ensure her face is developing correctly.' Also unable to use her hands or feet, Kira had to have each of her fingers and toes separated to give her ten digits. Professor Simon Kay, who had to travel to America to learn how to perform some of the procedures at Leeds General Infirmary, said: 'Kira’s condition is very rare and expertise is necessarily concentrated in our highly specialist units. Kira will wear the metal frame for the next three months and hopes to return to school in September . 'Our unit in Leeds is the only one in the UK to offer microsurgical reconstruction in these cases, which we believe greatly enhances recovery, especially when combined with excellent community support and the kind of attentive loving parents Kira has.' Mrs Yates and husband Mark, 42, as well as their older children Ryan, 18, and Victoria, 16, have had to adapt their lives to look after Kira, who has needed a lot of care since birth. Kira will wear the metal frame for the next three months and hopes to return to school in September. Mrs Yates, who cares for Kira full-time, added: 'We are seeing the changes already so there should be a big difference in the next few months. 'It could take her classmates a while to get used to it as her appearance will change quite drastically, but the main thing Kira wants is for people to stop staring at her. 'She asks why she is how she is, but I just tell her him upstairs wanted to make her special. 'My broken doll is nearly fixed and I’m so proud of her.'","Kira Yates suffers from Apert Syndrome, caused by chromosomal disorder .

"Pauline Chai told the High Court her vast shoe collection was proof the UK was her home . The billionaire chairman of retail giant Laura Ashley has insisted that his wife could not possibly own 1,000 pairs of shoes during their bitter £400million divorce battle. Khoo Kay Peng, 75, said that he was 'shocked' by his wife Pauline Chai's claim - which she offered in court earlier this month as proof that she considers the UK her permanent home. The Malaysian couple are currently fighting at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London over whether a final separation trial should be held in England or Malaysia. She wants the matter settled in the UK, where she is likely to receive a more generous divorce settlement. And to convince a judge to make the jurisdiction ruling in her favour - she claimed that keeping more than 1,000 pairs of shoes in her sprawling Hertfordshire estate meant the country mansion was her permanent home. But Dr Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, suggested to Mr Justice Bodey via video link that his wife owned no more than 40 pairs of shoes. He said the last person he remembered owning 1,000 pairs was Imelda Marcos - the widow of former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos. He said: 'When I read the newspaper I was very, very surprised and shocked. How are you going to wear 1,000 pair of shoes? 'I really don't know how many pairs of shoes she has got. A wild guess, I would tell you about 20, 30, 40. 'I could be wrong, because I don't know what she buys, because she loves shopping. She shops all over the place. 'The last time I read of 1,000 pair of shoes, I don't know if you remember Imelda Marcos? He went on: 'Collection? I thought you only collected things that would appreciate in value, not things that go down in value.' And he told the judge: 'I don't have a lot of shoes. I buy what I need.' The businessman married former beauty queen Pauline Chai in 1970 and the couple have five children. He told Mr Justice Bodey that he had been 'surprised and shocked' when Ms Chai - who was crowned Miss Malaysia in 1969 - filed for divorce. Dr Khoo says their marital home was in Malaysia and he wants a judge in Malaysia to make decisions about the division of money. Dr Khoo, speaking in court today via from Malaysia via video link, insisted his wife could not possibly own 1,000 pairs of shoes, his former wife sported navy courts with a silver heel speaking at court this month . He claims Ms Chai wants to fight in England because an English court will give her a more generous award. Ms Chai says they moved to their home to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, before separating last year, and she wants decisions made in an English court. And she says Dr Khoo is making a 'desperate attempt' to avoid fighting over money in an English court. She estimates that Dr Khoo is worth at least £441 million and says his income is at least £5.4 million a year. Ms Chai, pictured feeding pet alpacas on her Hertfordshire estate, also said her husband had been 'abusive' She also says he has failed to give a 'proper account' of his assets - but But Dr Khoo today insisted the £440m figure was 'far, far too high'. A recent survey from money saving website VoucherCodesPro.co.uk polled 2,352 women aged 18 and over from across the UK. They found: . His wife has previously claimed that she would be at a 'huge disadvantage' if she had to fight in Malaysia. Richard Todd QC, for Ms Chai, said she lived on a 'beautiful English estate', had a taste for English TV shows and valued what was 'quintessentially' English. He told Mr Justice Bodey that she was fulfilling a 'legitimate desire to be here'. Mr Justice Bodey is expected to make rulings on jurisdiction after hearing legal argument and evidence from both sides. The divorce battle began after their marriage hit the rocks last year, four years after buying their lavish Hertfordshire property. Ms Chai has told Mr Justice Bodey that she needed to get out of the 'abusive' marriage. She said: 'I just wanted to get away from an abusive, oppressive relationship which I could not take because of my age. 'When I was younger I could recover. Now it was too difficult to overcome it because of the violence and the fear he was putting on me. 'The reason I wanted freedom from him was because he was getting violent and I was very fearful.' The 67-year-old, pictured inside her plush home, claimed her vast shoe collection had to kept in several rooms . Beauty queen: Ms Chai was named Miss Malaysia in 1969 and has since lived in Australia, Canada and the UK . In the High Court today, Dr Khoo said that the only person he knew to own more than 1,000 pairs of shoes was Imelda Marcos. The 85-year-old widow of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos is famous for her astonishing collection of shoes. The collection, once said to be in the region of 3,000 pairs, including top U.S. and European brands, astounded the world and became a symbol of excess in the Southeast Asian nation, where many still walked barefoot out of abject poverty. Imelda Marcos claimed many of the shoes were gifts from Filipino shoemakers in suburban Marikina city, the country's shoemaking capital, for endorsing their products.

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has urged England’s youngsters to widen their football horizons by playing overseas. The Belgium central defender, who yesterday confirmed he has signed a new five-year contract with City, also believes England will play in a World Cup final by 2030. Belgium are emerging as one of European football’s leading nations, boasting talent such as Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Jan Vertonghen. Their emergence as a world force is in stark contrast to England’s recent decline. Hard-earned: Kompany says he owes a lot of his success to moving abroad at a young age . Down with the kids: Kompany joined Phil Jagielka, John O'Shea and Wes Morgan to launch the new season . While Belgians have moved around the world to further their careers, British professionals seem content to stay at home. Now 28-year-old Kompany, who left Hamburg for City when he was 22, believes England’s most talented youngsters can only benefit from spending time out of their comfort zone. Kompany believes the problem is down to the English mindset, and says: ‘If you ask a kid at 17, go play in League One or go and play in the first division in Holland, 90 per cent will go for League One. ‘Open the borders in your head. It is not just an opportunity, it is also education.’ Kompany adds: ‘What has made my development is not the fact that I started in the (Belgian) premier league at 17 or 18. It is the fact that I started at Anderlecht at 17 and played Champions League at 17 and moved on when I was 20. Early start: Kompany was playing Champions League football from a young age when at Anderlecht . Champion: Kompany has won two Premier League titles since joining Manchester City in 2008 . ‘That made a difference for players like me, Eden Hazard, Vertonghen, (Mousa) Dembele — all the players in my national team. We started at smaller clubs. 'English players should accept at a younger age to take experience abroad or in leagues where it is easier to play. They need to be more prepared to go for that experience and then come back.’ England’s poor showing in the World Cup has merely underlined their fading status on the world stage but Kompany insists he can see signs of a resurgence. ‘People talk about the great facilities in England but they’ve only been here for two to three years,’ he says. ‘You have to wait. England will play a World Cup final in the next four competitions for the simple reason that no other country has the resources to put that much into facilities. Committed: David Silva and Yaya Toure have both joined Kompany in committing their future to City . ‘It’s simple. You (England) rest on your laurels a little because you have had success for so long, then you get a slap like the last World Cup and it makes you progress 10 years. ‘It was a very important slap, one that will make English players reach another level.’ On his new deal, Kompany adds: ‘The main thing is not so much that I’ve signed but that I see David Silva signing, Samir Nasri, (Aleksandar) Kolarov, Yaya Toure... It’s a huge sign of commitment. 'All those could have played for the top three clubs in the world but they believe in the City project. In control: Kompany says England will make one of the next four World Cup finals because of their resources . ‘I don’t see any club who can honestly say every season they are going to compete for as many trophies as we are. 'In the Champions League, three clubs — Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona — are a step ahead of everyone. That was the case in the Premier League. It was Liverpool, United, Arsenal, Chelsea. ‘That has been changed — and now I would like nothing more than to upset the order in Europe.’","Kompany predicts England will make a World Cup final by 2030 .

"A run-down property that was only worth $5 in rent has sold  for $896,000 under the hammer on Friday. Located in Waverley in Sydney's eastern suburbs,  the rotting single-storey terrace is surrounded by properties that reel in rent close to the $1000 mark. Selling for $96,000 over the set reserve, the 'renovator's delight' comes with holes in the floorboards, rotting carpet and peeling paint. A run-down property that was only worth $5 in rent has sold for $896,000 under the hammer on Friday . Selling for $96,000 over the set reserve, the 'renovator's delight' comes with holes in the floorboards, rotting carpet and peeling paint . Anthony Romano from LJ Hooker Randwick said the property's rental arrangement place landlords in an interesting situation, leaving it off the market for more than a century. 'The protected tenancy arrangement stated that the laws were inherited so this place has been rented by several generations in the one family for the same price', Mr Romano told The Daily Telegraph. 'Rent was set over 50 years ago at 2.15 pounds a week which translates to $4.95,' he said. As rental prices in Waverley have increased over the years, the privately owned home was subsequently trapped in a rental freeze since World War II. The rental arrangement was set in place to provide security and rent control for tenants, as part of the 1948 Landlord and Tenant Act which has not applied since 1986. Mr Romano, the selling agent for the property, said that the 'rare situation' left the owner unable to renovate the run-down home. 'The owner wasn’t going to do anything to update the home given what rent he was receiving and neither was the tenant,' Mr Romano said.

As rental prices in Waverley have increased over the years, the privately owned home was subsequently trapped in a rental freeze since World War II . A few weeks ago, Waverley Council registered the property as 'unliveable', breaking the aged tenancy agreement and allowing the owners to place it on the market. On Friday a crowd of around 30 people lined up to inspect the crumbling 117-square-metre property, . 'I can only let a few people through at a time because of the state of it,' Mr Romano said. The property received 33 bids from parties interested on the day, but went to a young couple from Randwick in Sydney's east. 'I guess it really is a dump, but I think everyone likes to refer to it as a “blank canvas, don’t they,' said buyer David Shannon. The couple had previously missed out on four run-down properties that were at auction in recent weeks and were fixed on the idea of purchasing an inner city 'fixer upper'. 'We went to auctions in Waterloo, Redfern and Chippendale but kept missing out. But we’re so excited to have this one because you don’t often find a place like this so close to the beaches,' Mr Shannon's partner, Lucy Carse said. The couple plan on renovating the property and renting it out. 'But we will definitely charge the tenants more than $5 a week!' Ms Carse said.

"Wojciech Szczesny is excited about the competition for Arsenal's No 1 jersey this season after the club signed David Ospina from Nice. Ospina moved to the Emirates in July after shining for Colombia as they reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil. Szczesny says that after Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea when his contract expired it was inevitable that Arsene Wenger would strengthen in that position during the current transfer window.

Battle to be number one: Szczesny has said the arrival of David Ospina has not faze him in the slightest . 'I love a challenge,' the Polish shot-stopper told Arsenal.com. 'I was expecting someone to come because Lukasz has left for Swansea and I wish him all the best. I knew someone would come in. I'm just going to do the same thing over again, I'm going to try my best in every game and every week in training. Hopefully that will be enough.' Szczesny, who played in Sunday's Emirates Cup defeat to Monaco, thinks the first-team squad are reaching the right level of fitness ahead of the new Premier League campaign. 'It would have been nice to win a cup that we play at home, but that's not what we talk about in pre-season,' he said. 'We want to prepare and make sure we are at our very best at the weekend [in the Community Shield] and then against Crystal Palace in [the Premier League].

"Lonely cancer patients are more likely to struggle with their treatment plans, putting their lives at risk, a charity claims. Patients without a supportive network of friends and family around them are three times more likely to fall behind with their treatment than those who aren’t lonely, according to a new study. Many patients are missing appointments, not taking their medication properly, are unable to pick up prescriptions or even refusing treatment, Macmillan Cancer Support said. Patients without a supportive network of friends and family around them are three times more likely to fall behind with their treatment than those who aren't lonely, according to a new study . Among cancer patients who are lonely in the UK: . Its poll of more than 1,000 people from across the UK who had ever been diagnosed with cancer, found that one in five have been lonely since their diagnosis. Almost a third of those who said they had been lonely said they faced at least one issue with their treatment plan compared with 11 per cent who had not felt alone. Jacqui Graves, head of health and social care at Macmillan Cancer Support said: ‘Lonely cancer patients may not have the practical support they need to get out of the house and attend their appointments, or pick up prescriptions, especially if they can’t drive or live in a remote area. ‘Or they may feel emotionally overwhelmed and too anxious to attend appointments or have treatment. We know patients who have only attended appointments because friends or family persuaded them.’ Some 20,000 lonely cancer patients in the UK are having difficulty with their treatment, the charity said. Many lonely cancer patients (illustrated with a stock image) are missing appointments, not taking their medication properly, can't pick up prescriptions or even refusing treatment, Macmillan Cancer Support said . Mabel Macartney, 61, from Cheshire, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 said: . 'None of my family or friends live near me, so although I could stay with a friend after surgery, when I was told I’d need six months of chemotherapy the only thing going through my mind was: ""How am I going to cope?"" 'I couldn’t ask anyone to stay with me for such a long time or afford to be off work with no one else to help pay the mortgage. So I turned the chemotherapy treatment down. 'It was a horrible situation to be in, alone with life-changing decisions to make and I know I risked the chance of the cancer returning.' One in 30 people are estimated to have skipped treatment appointments and one in 17 didn’t take medicine as they should. One in eight patients couldn’t pick up prescriptions, while one in 11 refused some type of treatment. A total of five per cent of cancer patients refused treatment all together. Ciaran Devane, Chief Executive of the charity, said: ‘We already know that loneliness may be as harmful as smoking but this research shows for the first time that it is particularly toxic to cancer patients. ‘It is simply unacceptable that so many cancer patients feel emotionally alone or lack practical support to such an extent that they are missing appointments, unable to take their medicine or even refusing treatment, and that it’s putting their recovery at risk. ‘With Britain currently the loneliness capital of Europe and the cancer population set to double to four million by 2030, the problem’s only going to get worse. We need to urgently tackle it now. ‘That’s why we’re calling on health professionals to identify lonely cancer patients and make them aware of the support available so that they don’t have to go through their cancer alone.’","Patients without support are 3 times as likely to have treatment problems .

"Kalashnikov-wielding robbers ambushed the motorcade of a Saudi prince in Paris last night reportedly  making off with 250,000 euros (£200,000) in cash and a bundle of 'sensitive' diplomatic documents.

"Deputy head: Martin Goldberg, 46, was found dead a day after police questioned him over allegations that he had purchased child pornography from abroad . A paedophile deputy headmaster who secretly filmed his pupils may have been assessed as a ‘low risk’ by detectives, it was claimed today. Essex Police began probing allegations that Martin Goldberg, of Thorpe Hall School in Great Wakering, had bought material online which may have included images of naked teenage boys. Mr Goldberg, who taught at the £10,000-a-year private school, was found dead the day after they spoke to him at his £360,000 four-bedroom home in Shoeburyness, where he lived alone. After the 46-year-old's computer was seized, officers found hundreds of indecent images. It has since emerged that Essex Police had been alerted to the concerns about Goldberg - along with 34 other suspected paedophiles - nine months earlier, as part of Canadian police’s Operation Spade, but did not act. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, the county’s police and crime commissioner Nick Alston said: ‘I understand that Mr Goldberg was assessed as low-risk.’ He added that it was clear something had ‘gone wrong’ - but said Goldberg may not have been the force’s highest priority, as it dealt with huge amounts of information. Mr Alston also said the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) had received the details in 2012, but had taken a year to pass it on. He stated that the force had charged two people in connection with the Operation Spade intelligence, adding: ‘It’s not as if they were sitting doing nothing, it’s a question of priorities’. Mr Alston added: ‘My job is to make sure Essex Police are operating as effectively as they can with the resources they have got. But this is a case where things have gone wrong. Workplace: Mr Goldberg was employed at £10,600-a-year Thorpe Hall School in Great Wakering in Essex . ‘It was nine months too long and it should have been sooner. We need to find out why, but it’s not just resources. We need, and I think we have got, good procedures for acting on the threat of harm to individuals.’ Mr Alston previously said Ceop procedures may have to be reviewed, along with Essex Police’s action. The case is being reviewed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Officers have refused to comment further while this process is carried out. Goldberg was found dead on September 10. His death is not being treated as suspicious. It is thought that he had taken images of children at the school and other locations using a hidden camera. These pictures are believed to date back to 2000 and feature boys aged from nine to 12. Essex Police were originally told of concerns about Goldberg after Toronto police contacted them in November 2013 with information suggesting he had bought videos of naked boys several years ago. A police spokesman said: ‘It is important to stress that we have found no evidence of any other offences by Mr Goldberg involving these children. House: Goldberg tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork - and then hanged himself in the garage of his £360,000 four-bedroom home (pictured) ‘At this time there is nothing to suggest that he made inappropriate physical contact with any child. ‘The school has co-operated with our investigation and we have also found no evidence to suggest that anyone else was involved in Mr Goldberg’s criminal activity. There is also no information that he shared any of these images or that anyone else was aware of his offending.’ Late investigation: Essex Police did nothing about 46-year-old Goldberg (pictured) until three weeks ago . Essex Police did nothing about Goldberg until three weeks ago - almost a year after being informed. Nor did officers warn the school where the IT expert regularly took children away on official trips. The blunders were compounded when officers failed in a bid to get a search warrant from a magistrate. So they simply visited the paedophile’s home, just over a mile from the school, and politely asked if they could examine his computer. He refused and the officers left without arresting him. But within hours he tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork – and then hanged himself in the garage of his home. Detectives were still able to recover 75 images taken on a camera that was hidden in a bag in the school’s male changing rooms. There were 465 images from a local swimming pool and 38 from two other unknown locations. Four boys aged between nine and 12 have been identified as featuring in the images, and their parents informed. But in many other cases, faces are not shown, or are out of focus, making it impossible to know the full tally of his victims. The case has sparked fresh fears about potentially thousands more paedophiles being left unchecked, despite evidence against them, because UK police are taking so long to act on masses of information from child sex investigations overseas. Another name on the list of 2,345 suspects given to British authorities by Toronto Police was cancer specialist Myles Bradbury, 41. Astonishing: Shocked parents at the school where Goldberg taught were struggling to cope with the revelation . Last month Bradbury pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, with many of the offences taking place at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. Informed by police: Thorpe Hall’s headmaster, Andrew Hampton (pictured), said everyone at the school in Essex felt 'surprised, angry and betrayed' He was known to the authorities in 2012 – 16 months before he was arrested for abusing ill children – but investigations were ‘shelved’ until November 2013. He is expected to be jailed when he returns to court for sentencing. Last night shocked parents at the school where Goldberg taught were struggling to cope with the revelation. A source close to the school told the Daily Mail it was feared that as many as 25 pupils had been covertly caught on film. He had also masterminded his school’s computer system, issuing iPads to all pupils. His digital mastery has led to fears of what else he could have done, and concealed. Yesterday Essex Coroners’ Office confirmed an adjourned inquest had been told that Goldberg died by hanging. There were calls for a thorough investigation into the delays in the investigation. Local MP James Duddridge said: ‘Questions do need to be asked of Essex Police around how quickly this was dealt with.’ Police informed Thorpe Hall’s headmaster, Andrew Hampton, that his deputy had killed himself after he had been questioned about buying films of young boys. Initially Mr Hampton planned a remembrance ceremony and paid a glowing tribute, telling a local newspaper: ‘It’s a cutting edge school and he was a cutting edge guy. He was an ideal deputy and I couldn’t have asked for better.’ Yesterday, however, Mr Hampton said in a statement: ‘Everyone at Thorpe Hall School feels surprised, angry and betrayed.’ Yesterday an Essex police spokesman said there was no evidence of physical abuse by Goldberg of any children. There had been insufficient evidence to arrest Goldberg, he added. Yesterday, a resident in the cul-de-sac where Goldberg lived said: ‘I’ve heard he hanged himself in the garage and was burning papers in his office before then.’ Goldberg’s parents Harvey, 77, and Sheila, 72, live nearby. They were not available for comment. Essex Police only yesterday reported itself to the IPCC for its long delay in investigating Goldberg – weeks after his death. Last night an NSPCC spokesman said: ‘It is very concerning there appear to have been considerable delays in these cases before the police have taken action.’","Martin Goldberg taught at Thorpe Hall School in Great Wakering, Essex .

"Shrien Dewani could be cleared of the honeymoon murder of his new bride and be on his way back to Britain within days, according to one of South Africa's top legal experts. The state's case against the wealthy businessman is 'riddled with inconsistencies' and could collapse before Dewani, 34, even has to face tough questions in the witness box. Leading defence attorney William Booth said the two 'star' state witnesses against the accused had been particularly 'poor' and his legal team had a 'more than reasonable' chance of having all charges against him dropped. Scroll down for video . A South African legal expert says the state's case against Shrien Dewani (left) is 'riddled with inconsistencies' and could collapse. Dewani is accused of arranging the murder of his wife Dewani (right) four years ago . Dewani denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride, Anni, almost four years ago during their honeymoon to South Africa. The state alleges he plotted her murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £850 (R15,000). The driver, Zola Tongo – who spent his sixth day on the stand  – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates Bristol-based Dewani in his Swedish wife's death in November 2010. But during gruelling cross-examination, Dewani's defence team managed to blast a number of holes in Tongo's story, highlighting discrepancies between his evidence from the witness box and his statement to police a week after Mrs Dewani suffered a fatal gun shot wound to the neck. Francois van Zyl, who heads the defence team, also highlighted that the taxi driver received a substantially lower jail term for his role in the killing in exchange for implicating Dewani in the murder. Mr van Zyl also poked holes in the evidence of hitman Mziwamadoda Qwabe, hired by Tongo via a middle-man, who was the state's second witness and also received reduced prison time in exchange for giving evidence against Dewani. The state alleges Dewani plotted his new wife's murder by recruiting a taxi driver to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £850 (R15,000) Mr Booth said: 'The two key witnesses - Tongo and Qwabe - have brought really the only testimony that counts in this trial and the quality of their evidence has been poor and riddled with inconsistencies. 'The overall quality of the prosecution case we have heard so far has not been high. There is nothing for the defence team to lose by bringing the application to have the case against their client discharged and I think they would have a strong reasons for doing so. 'If Dewani were my client, I would certainly go down that route.' Even though the state is not duty bound to prove Dewani had a motive for killing his wife, evidence of the businessman's secret gay life was a cornerstone of the prosecution's case to demonstrate he had a compelling reason to want out of his new marriage. However, much of that evidence went unheard when Judge Jeanette Traverso ruled in favour of Dewani to exclude much of the testimony of three key witnesses - including the gay escort paid by Dewani and known as the German Master and the first cousin in whom Anni Dewani had confided intimate details about their unhappy relationship. Mr Booth said he rated the defence team's chance of any discharge application as 'more than reasonable', which would see Dewani going home to Bristol and cleared of all charges without ever having to give his version of what happened on the night his wife was murdered. 'Discharging a case is not something that judges do lightly, but Judge Jeanette Traverso is a bold judge and she does not tend to be cautious. 'The high-profile nature of the case would not influence her decision. I think if they brought a discharge application, the chance of success is more than reasonable, ' Mr Booth added. If no discharge application is brought - or the judge rules that Dewani does have a case to answer - the defence team will have to decide whether or not to call the businessman to the witness box to talk about the mysterious events surrounding his wife's killing, and to be cross-examined by the state. This poses a further dilemma to Dewani's lawyers. 'Bringing an application to discharge the case is a much easier decision to make than the one about whether or not to call your client to give evidence,' Mr Booth added. 'Although it is not down to him to prove his innocence, a judge can choose to draw conclusions from the fact that an accused chooses not to give evidence in his own defence.' The driver, Zola Tongo – who spent his sixth day on the stand – is the only state witness whose evidence directly implicates Bristol-based Dewani in his Swedish wife's death in November 2010 . Mr van Zyl said he had 'not yet decided' if he would make a discharge application, under section 174 of South Africa's Criminal Procedure Act. The prosecution is expected to call just two or three more witnesses, two of them police officers. Middleman Monde Mbolombo, who was approached by Tongo to recruit killers to carry out the contract hit, is expected to be called next by the state. Mbolombo was given immunity from prosecution in return for giving evidence against Tongo and hit men Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, who died two weeks ago while serving 18 years for his part in the killing. However, last week it emerged in court that Mbolombo had recently made a fresh statement to police about the events of 13 November 2010 – it is not known if this new version helps or hinders Dewani's defence. Anni was found shot dead in an abandoned minibus . But since Mbolombo never met and spoke to Dewani directly, it is likely his team will try to have his testimony entirely excluded as heresay or severely restricted. Certainly, the body language of Dewani and his family, who have been in court every day, has lightened since the trial began a month ago. On the first day, Dewani's lawyer read out an 'explanation of plea' to the court in which Dewani claimed to be bi-sexual and admitted using the services of gay prostitutes, including festish specialist Leopold Leisser, surfing gay porn sites and frequenting gay clubs. The admission, which followed previous Dewani denials of being gay and threats to sue Mr Leisser for giving an interview about their sex sessions, undermined the prosecution's case that his parallel life and fear of being found out prompted him to take extreme measures to be free of his wife. It also enabled the defence team to argue that Dewani's sexuality - no longer in dispute - should have no bearing on the case against him. As a consequence, Mr Leisser was flown from Britain to give just a few minutes' uncontested testimony, and a bundle of 53 sexually-charged emails sent to Dewani from an unidentified older male lover were also excluded as evidence. A source close to the case observed, 'Dewani was unable to be extradited from Britain for three years due to his high levels of trauma and depression, but within four months of arriving in South Africa, he was cleared by the doctors as fit to stand trial. 'Does this mean that doctors in South Africa can work miracles, or is it because he was sufficiently reassured by his legal team that the case against him was weak and they advised him just to get the trial over and done with?' Meanwhile, with the fourth anniversary of the Swedish engineer's brutal murder a little over a week ago, the question about why Anni Dewani was killed appears no closer to being answered - a terrible blow to her parents Nilam and Vinod, and brother, Anish, who have sat through every minute of the case so far. The trial continues.","Leading defence attorney says state's case is 'riddled with inconsistencies'

"Adventure travelers hoping to head into space don't have to take out extra life insurance ahead of their trips. Private pilots and skydivers have to take out extra life insurance to cover the added risk of their pursuits... but space tourists don't need special policies for their high flying rides. However, that loophole is likely to disappear, slowly, after the fatal crash last week of a test flight for a space ship designed to take tourists into space. The main wreckage from the crash on Friday that killed one pilot and injured another is spread over a five-mile area in the Mojave Desert in California . These images show the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rocket separating from the carrier aircraft, left, and then disintegrating, right, during a test flight on Friday . Michael Alsbury (left) was killed in the crash on Friday, while co-pilot Peter Siebold (right) survived . The loophole exists because US life insurance policies don't ask about space tourism or exclude it from coverage, meaning insurers most likely would have to pay if the holder died on a space trip, insurance industry veterans said. Insurance companies, which say they are considering what to do about space tourists after the Virgin crash, are likely to start adding questions about space travel and may even explicitly exclude space coverage, the industry observers said. The companies themselves are taking a cautious approach. 'If we had an applicant with such plans, we would postpone any underwriting decision until they returned,' Prudential spokeswoman Sheila Bridgeforth said. Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo broke up after its release from a launch plane high over the Mojave desert on October 31, killing one of two pilots. The craft is designed to carry six passengers on two-hour suborbital flights, including a few minutes of weightlessness. Virgin's space program, backed by founder Richard Branson and Aabar Investments, a United Arab Emirates investment fund, is the most developed of several projects to develop space tourism, with about 800 deposits for a ride into space at up to $250,000 (£157,000) a seat. Singer Lady Gaga and actor Ashton Kutcher have signed up. Other companies developing space ships include privately owned XCOR Aerospace and Blue Origin, a startup owned by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos. While current life policies probably would pay in the event of death, applicants for new policies should disclose space plans or risk a dispute with an insurer, said Steven Weisbart, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a non-profit trade association. Insurers typically have up to two years after a policy is written to contest the application, allowing them to investigate whether the insured person has misrepresented facts. So it's possible an insurer could avoid paying if someone bought a policy and died in a rocket crash during the two years period. 'You know that insurers are going to look for some way to invalidate the claim if you had a ticket,' said Glenn Daily, a fee-only insurance adviser based in New York. Northwestern Mutual said that it is paying close attention to the issue after the crash, but that there is too little safety data to assess the risk of space tourism. US life insurer MetLife said it doesn't have imminent plans to offer space tourism insurance. Still, the industry is starting to gear up for space tourists, just as they cover satellite launches. Pembroke Managing Agency offers a policy that pays up to $5 million (£3.1 million) per space passenger or up to $20 million (£12.5 million) per trip, according to parent Ironshore International, which announced the policy in June. 'I suspect in insurance company offices all over the country right now - as a result of what's happened to the Virgin Galactic plane - it's being discussed,' said Burke Christensen, former insurance lawyer and chief executive who has authored or edited three textbooks on insurance law. It would take time, perhaps years, for those changes to be approved by all U.S. state insurance commissioners, he noted. In deciding what to charge, insurers are likely to look at satellite policies, which range between 2.5 per cent and 10 per cent of insured value, Neil Stevens, a space insurance expert and member of the UK's Satellite Finance Network advisory board. At that rate, a policy paying a million dollars would cost $25,000 (£15,600) to $100,000 (£62,550). 'Getting on a space flight is a material change in risk,' he said, akin to strapping rocket boosters onto a car and asking for a new policy. 'Put yourself in the place of the insurer. Would you charge the same premium?' But the data on human space travel is much more favorable, if limited. There have been no fatal suborbital manned flights and three fatal orbital space shots, including the US space shuttles Challenger and Columbia with 14 deaths, and a Soyuz flight that killed one, according to the Seradata SpaceTrak database. The fatal Virgin Galactic disaster means life insurance companies could explicity exclude space tourism . That puts the risk of fatal accident on a manned orbital or suborbital spaceflight at three in 306 or just under one per cent, the company said. Given those numbers, and the few people who are likely to fly on rockets, 'you come up with a very, very, tiny, tiny probability' of death, Christensen said, and the company might conclude it is not worth charging extra.","Current US life insurance policies don't ask about space travel .
This means they would have to pay out if holder died on space trip .
Virgin Galactic crash means companies could explicitly exclude space travel ."
"If Harry Redknapp needed a reminder of how cruel the Premier League can be, this was it. Queens Park Rangers could have been 2-0 up at half time against Hull, but seven minutes into the second half they were on their way to defeat thanks to James Chester’s winner. Chester - escaping the attentions of debutant Rio Ferdinand in the process - headed home the only goal of the afternoon as Steve Bruce's side got their season up and running. And to compound QPR's misery, Charlie Austin missed a late penalty for Harry Redknapp's side as their latest top-flight journey began with defeat.

Man of the Match: Robertson . ‘Some days it doesn’t go with you, if we score the penalty we could have won the game — that’s how close it was,’ said Redknapp. ‘I felt we played better today than the majority of the Championship season last year, we will only get better.’ Ferdinand made his QPR debut, playing as the sweeper in Redknapp's new-look 3-5-2 formation. Alongside him was Richard Dunne, who was making his return to the top-flight, and Caulker, who was making his first competitive start for Rangers following his move from Cardiff. Jordon Mutch, also an arrival from Cardiff, made his debut but Redknapp didn't include loan signing Mauricio Isla who is still receive international clearance. Striker Loic Remy, who spent lost season on loan at Newcastle, also started for Rangers after his protracted moves to Liverpool and Arsenal fell through. There were also three debutantes for Hull, Andrew Robertson, Robert Snodgrass and Tom Ince all making their bows for Bruce's side. Both club's started with the 'on-trend' 3-5-2 system; Ferdinand assuming the role as sweeper in the heart of QPR's defence. But it was Hull that looked comfortable as they dominated the opening exchanges. Nikica Jelavic glanced a header wide from Robertson's deep cross before the home side struggled to deal with Snodgrass' inswinging corner. Slowly but surely, though, Redknapp's men eased their way back into Premier League life. Austin just failed to find Mutch during a rapid QPR break, before Ale Faurlin fired narrowly wide in the 17th minute after a period of sustained pressure from the top-flight new-boys. Austin did find Mutch five minutes later after Hull keeper Allan McGregor went walkabout - but QPR's summer signing completely missed his kick from 14 yards out. Curtis Davies was booked in the 27th minute for a crude foul on Remy, who turned the defender on the edge of the box, only for Joey Barton - captaining the side in Clint Hill's absence - to fire wide. New addition: Referee Craig Pawson uses the vanishing spray recently introduced to the Premier League to mark out a line for Hull's wall . In the book: Referee Craig Pawson brandishes a yellow card to Curtis Davies of Hull City as Robert Snodgrass protests . MINS PLD    KM       MILES .

Nikica Jelavic     90              11.8       7.3 . Tom Huddlestone   90         11.6       7.2 . Mutch then missed a glorious chance to score QPR's first goal of the season, but he could only head wide from eight yards after Remy's excellent cross. And the home side could easily have been punished for their wastefulness seconds later when Armand Traore clumsily bundled Jelavic over in the box, but referee Craig Pawson waved away Hull's appeals. Rangers were fortunate, and Ferdinand knew it, as he gave Traore an earful immediately after the incident. Snodgrass' début came to an abrupt end in the 40th minute, a knee injury ending his afternoon. And it nearly got worse for last season's FA Cup finalists after Caulker's bullet header from Barton's inswinging corner was cleared off the line by Robertson before McGregor tipped the loose ball over the bar. On balance, a goal wouldn't have flattered Rangers, who after a slow start got to grips with the Premier League pretty quickly. But, as is life in the big-time, QPR paid the consequences for the wastefulness as Hull took a 52nd minute lead. Stephen Quinn's inswinging corner was headed past Rob Green by Chester after the Hull defender escaped the attentions of Ferdinand at the back post. If Redknapp needed a reminder of how cruel the Premier League is, then that was it. And Hull should have doubled their lead in the 62nd minute after a flowing break, but Ince could only fire straight at Green with just the keeper to beat after brilliant work from Quinn. Redknapp introduced Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips to stem the visitors' impetus - but the chances kept coming for Hull.

Redknapp introduced Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips to stem the visitors' impetus - but the chances kept coming for Hull. First, Ince forced Green into another save in the 70th minute, the QPR keeper palming his fierce free kick behind before the Hull forward was thwarted again, this time by Dunne's timely block. Jelavic saw his volley from Quinn's corner deflected over in the 74th minute as Hull squandered another opportunity. And with every passing chance, Bruce was getting twitchier. So, it would have come as no surprise to the Hull boss when referee Pawson pointed to the spot in the 83rd minute after Chester handled substitute Junior Hoilett's attempted cross.

Under pressure: Jordan Mutch of QPR attempts to try and get away from Hull's Tom Huddlestone during the first-half of the match . But QPR's first half deficiencies were laid bare again when Austin's 84th minute penalty was superbly saved by McGregor. That just about summed up QPR's afternoon. Redknapp's side tried to muster a late onslaught, Remy and substitute Bobby Zamora wasting good chances as Hull held on for victory. Bruce was satisfied with the result as he set out Hull's target for Premier League survival. ‘That’s one win down, we just need to get another nine,’ said Bruce.

"They say that your teenage years are supposed to be the best of your life, but Britain's over-fifties would definitely take issue with that. The UK's middle-aged population aren't slowing down any time soon - in fact, new research shows that they are fast becoming the reckless generation. After years of saving towards pensions, looking after their offspring and taking care of their houses, the fifty-pluses are living life for the now, with sexual health and savings the first to take the hit. In a new survey called the 50+ project, 76 per cent of those asked confessed to not using contraception when they have sex, despite rising rates of STD's across the country. The UK's middle-aged population aren't slowing down any time soon - new research shows that they are fast becoming the reckless generation. 76 per cent of 50-plus generation don't use contraception when having sex and 67 per cent of parents believe in spending their wealth over saving it for their children (pictured posed by model) And despite not using protection, the age group aren't slowing down when it comes to activity inside the bedroom. 66 per cent of over-fifties believe that a good sex life is important and 38 per cent admit to having sex more than twice a week, on average. It's no surprise that they are staying busy between the sheets though, given that 43 per cent of that age group believe they are a better lover now than ever before. The reckless behaviour isn't just restricted to the bedroom though, our middle aged population are also becoming increasingly carefree with their savings and property portfolios, with less concern for any inheritance to be passed on to their children. Although 42 per cent revealed they had more disposable income than ever, very few were considering sharing much of that with their sons and daughters. 67 per cent of parents said they believe in spending their wealth over saving it for their children and · 24 per cent of parents are planning to leave little or none of their wealth to their children. The fifty-plus generation are spending their wealth on holidays and socialising. Half of the over-fifties admit they now go on holiday more now than ever before and 51 per cent also admit to drinking three or more times a week . The figure is even higher for Brits aged between 60-65, with 71 per cent of them planning on spending their wealth instead of earmarking it for inheritance. While the younger generation aren't doing so well out of their parent's swollen bank accounts, the tourism and alcohol and hospitality industries are quids in. Half of the over-fifties admit they now go on holiday more now than ever before, with 53 per cent taking a vacation more than three times a year. Meanwhile, half of this demographic admit to drinking three or more times a week and 40 per cent also go out socially more than once a week. TV presenter Mariella Frostrup, who recently joined the 50-plus ranks and will celebrate her 52nd birthday next month, commissioned the research in her role as editor-at-large of High50 magazine. The mother-of-two says the findings reflect her own attitudes towards life at this age, including how much of her wealth she is planning on sharing with her children. TV star Mariella Frostrup, 51, says UK has unhealthy attitude to maturity . Se said: 'The survey naturally reflects some of my concerns and aspirations, as a recent entry to the High50 generation. 'It's a topic I've been talking about for a long time as way before I reached my landmark birthday I felt our attitude to maturity in the UK is not a healthy one and these days is leagues behind the reality of who we all are at fifty. 'It shouldn't come as surprise that people over fifty aspire to a healthy sex life, we're still human after all and despite the myths around menopause and the rest we still have a beating pulse. 'Much to my daughters' horror I still even like to dance, given the right venue, and the right companions! 'As for leaving money to our children I've seen enough trust fund simpletons to know that educating your kids to their best ability, teaching them how lucky they are to live in a country like ours where a safety net exists and showing them societies where it doesn't is far more important to their future than doing their saving for them. 'I'd love to be able to give my kids a helping hand with a deposit for a flat or similar, it caused me the most anxiety when I was young.

He came close to becoming Pepe Mel's successor at West Brom earlier this summer, but a move to The Hawthorns collapsed over personal terms. And the former Blackburn midfielder could now be set for a return to football with Palace. Mackay has been out of work since his acrimonious exit from Cardiff in December and he now wants a return to the game. He has close links with Palace sporting director Iain Moody, having worked with him at Cardiff. Chris Hughton, who was sacked by Norwich towards the end of last season, is understood to be an outsider for the role. Parish knows he must appoint a new manager sooner rather later with the transfer deadline just two weeks away. The club still intend to strengthen their squad before September 1, but know they need a manager in situ before pressing ahead with deals.

"A disrespectful remark caused the fist fight that led to the fatal shooting of famed LA tattoo artist Trigz in Los Angeles, claims the manager of the store where the lethal brawl broke out. According to the manager, Trigz, whose real name is Michael Christopher Pebley, was minding his own business in the Black Derby Smoke Shop on Thursday afternoon when an apparent stranger upset him with a pointed remark leaving the store. Pebley, who was sitting talking to the store owner, was angered and approached the man, 'getting in his face', which sparked a 30 second fight inside, which eventually spilled onto the sidewalk and ended with Pebley being fatally shot outside the neighboring Tattoo & Body Piercing parlor. Scroll down for video . Gone too soon: Tattoo artist to the stars Trigz was shot dead in broad daylight in North Hollywood on Thursday, according to TMZ . 'The suspect was already shopping inside when Pebley walked in and sat down to talk to the owner,' said manager, James Mayen, who has also watched the security footage of the fight from Thursday. 'The suspect is making his way out of the store when he turns to Pebley and says something, which makes Pebley leave his chair and walk straight over to him. 'He gets in his face and the two begin arguing, which quickly descends into a huge fight inside, which then spills outside.' The witness, who was not at the store during the fight, said that according to those who were, shots rang out and the suspect fled in a four-door white Honda Accord. Asked what could have sparked such a violent and ultimately fatal fight, the witness said that he had been told the suspect turned to Pebley and asked him 'Where do I know you from?' 'That might may sound like nothing, but round here the way you say that could be the difference to starting a fight or not,' said Mayen. Police have said they do not know what the argument was about and are asking for anyone with information on the shooting to call the authorities. Tragic: Michael Christopher Pebley - or Trigz - leaves behind five children, including a young daughter Vida (pictured) and a fiancée . Witness Brandon Wilmot, 22, a security officer for Valley Plaza was working opposite the shop when the shooting took place. ‘He got shot but nobody heard any of the gunshots or anything. The cops and ambulance came up and they were trying to revive him for about five minutes, then they ended up just pulling the white sheet over him,' said Wilmot. 'When I walked down the street I could see the sheet over him and see his feet sticking out. 'He was a known local person and a good guy. When the cops came the people out of the tattoo shop came out and they were hysterical. A lot of his apprentices work at that tattoo parlour.' Pebley's friend, actor, Carlos Ayala, 35, said that it was 'probably fear that got Trigz killed.' They got into a fight and nowadays someone can’t just take an ass whupping - they have to pull out a gun. ‘They should just take their ass whupping and y’know, “see ya another day,” why pull out a gun? ‘Violence is going to be everywhere it doesn’t have to be gang violence or whatever. People pull out guns because they’re intimidated. ‘I worked with him on many videos. I’ve known him since 2002, we did SWAT together and the video for Rick Ross’ Don’t Play No Games with Future. ‘Just because he looks how he looks people shouldn’t judge. He was a real nice guy.' Loss: Trigz with his young daughter at his tattoo parlor in North Hollywood, California . The shooting occurred around 5:50 p.m. outside 5150 Tattoo & Body Piercing, near Laurel Canyon . The famed tattoo artist worked with Chris Brown, Kylie Jenner's reported boyfriend Tyga as well as Amber Rose's soon-to-be-ex Wiz Khalifa and musician Travis Barker. 'He was a really good guy,' said friend Desirae Howell to NBC Los Angeles.. 'He was a family guy. He was very intelligent.' Just after news broke of the murder, which is believed to have taken place at 5:50 pm, Brown tweeted, 'RIP homie. S*** it crazy!' Only hours after the fatal shooting, friends, family and mourners put together a makeshift memorial for Pebley outside the shop. The artist and an unidentified man were believed to have had a verbal altercation before the gun was fired. Trigz was a famed tattoo and graffiti artist, actor and model. He also became part of an exclusive worldwide group of artists called The Seventh Letter, fellow member and friend Willie T told Eyewitness News. Mourners visited a North Hollywood tattoo business after they heard the new of Trigz death on Thursday evening . Venice photographer and skater Pep Williams announced Trigz's death on his Facebook page last night, saying, ""Lost another brother just a couple of hours ago. Many good memories from shooting, grubbing and hanging at the traphouse. Love you brother."" Police told TMZ the shooting took place in front of the Black Derby Smoke Shop, which sells glass blown pipes. The suspect was described as a Hispanic male in his thirties. He left the scene of the crime in a white, early nineties Honda Accord, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. A witness told ABC Los Angeles that approximately four gunshots were heard before Trigz's body was found. The LAPD confirmed Trigz died at the scene. A witness says he heard four gunshots overall. Trigz left behind five children, three daughters and a son. He was often used as a model in music videos and in magazine shoots and was a member of the renowned Seventh Letter graffiti artist crew. Trigz, a.k.a. Mr. Trigger, worked out of Sincity Tattoo in Pacoima, where he specialized in body piercing. He had a big following: Trigz and friends with Chris Brown in an Instagram photo . Trigz’s son has started a GoFundMe account to help pay for his funeral expenses. Pebley's two sons, Michael and Anthony both expressed their pain at the death of their father by posting a picture of them both sitting on his knee dating from 1997. In a Facebook message, Anthony said that he was 'gonna miss' his father and 'we had a lot of s**t I wish we could have worked out before this. I love you.' Michael, who has set up a GoFundMe page was equally distraught, asking friends, family and members of the public to help donate money for his father's funeral.

Grief: Michael Christopher Pebley with Honey Miranda - his fiancée - in a series of pictures she uploaded to Facebook on Friday . Despite the glowing tributes paid by friends, the veteran tattoo artist was known for his checkered history with the law. As recently as 2009, Pebley, or Trigz, was incarcerated in Ironwood State Prison in Blythe serving a six year sentence for graffiti. He was arrested on 12 counts of vandalism and while he only served around 18 months, the prison sentence was seen as harsh nonetheless. Speaking to local media about his time in jail, Pebley said that prison was as good as could be expected. 'I've got some cool homies who have stayed tough for me on the streets which helps a villain keep my head high and my eyes open in this shark tank,' said Pebley. He also touched on his body art being a source of prejudice and claimed that he was dealt with differently by the courts because of them.

"With dozens of properties on sale for upwards of £1million, there is plenty to be shocked at when you walk past an estate agents in Notting Hill. But unfortunately for Faron Sutaria, the eyebrows of passers-by were also raised when they saw a naked woman writhing around on the TV in its office on a main road in west London. Robert Bartlett, chief executive of estate agents Chesterton Global, posted a photograph of the TV in the shop-front on Notting Hill Gate showing pornographic channel Babestation earlier this month. Scroll down for video . When I said arrange a viewing: Passers-by could view pornography on a TV inside the Faron Sutaria offices in Notting Hill, west London, after a 'mischief-maker' apparently changed the channel . In a Twitter post, the 49-year-old said: ‘Interesting to see what some estate agencies sell at night!’ The photograph was originally taken on October 2 by Twitter user 'TheLondonLuke'. Staff at Faron Sutaria said there is normally a news station broadcast on the TV in their window, but a prankster appeared to have changed the channel from outside with a universal remote. A spokesman told Metro: ‘We screen a 24-hour news channel on the television in our window. This was showing correctly when the premises were locked and left on the evening of October 2. ‘We believe a mischief-maker changed the channel on the television from the outside using a universal remote. We have now altered the system so this cannot happen again.’ Adult TV: Babestation has been on air since 2002 and allows viewers to communicate live with naked women . Eton-educated Mr Bartlett, who posted the image on Twitter on October 8, was appointed Chesterton chief in 2006 and has rowed internationally - representing Great Britain in the 1992 Olympic Games. Faron Sutaria was founded in 1975 and now has nine offices across London. Its most expensive property currently on sale from the Notting Hill branch is a four-bedroom home for £5.6million. Babestation is a TV sex line which has been on air since 2002, allowing viewers to communicate live with naked women via a premium-rate telephone number or by text messaging. It was in the news in 2012 when MailOnline reported how a trainee Mormon priest who flashed at two women said he was 'confused' after watching too much of the channel. Royston Thompson, 25, of Darlington, County Durham, said his behaviour was merely 'flirting' like the women on Babestation who writhe provocatively while urging callers to ring in. Separate incident: Two months ago Foxtons, another upmarket London estate agents, came under fire when a young girl was pictured cleaning its offices in Hampstead, north-west London, late at night . And in 2010, glamour model Lori Bucky, of Battersea, south London, was fined £1,000 for claiming benefits while working as a Babestation host -  which earned her up to £4,000 a month. The incident at Faron Sutaria comes  after Foxtons, another upmarket estate agents, came under fire when a young girl was pictured cleaning its offices in Hampstead, north-west London, late at night. The girl, who was believed to be aged 10 or 11, was spotted alone inside the branch in August by passers-by at 10.30pm - and could be seen wiping down tables and emptying bins at the agency. A spokesman for Foxtons said at the time that the girl had been taken to the offices by her mother, who was employed by a cleaning contractor, after her childcare arrangements fell through.","Passers-by could see Babestation on TV in Faron Sutaria in Notting Hill .

Van Gaal has been hit by defensive injuries before the opening game with Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick and Antonio Valencia all missing.

"Germany's all-time leading goalscorer, Miroslav Klose, has announced his retirement from international football. Less than a month after helping his country win the World Cup the 36-year-old has opted to call it a day. He took his tally of World Cup goals to a record 16 during the tournament in Brazil and bows out with 71 international strikes to his name.

'With the win in Brazil, a childhood dream came true, I am proud and happy that I was able to help this great success,' Klose told the German Football Association's official website. 'I had a unique and wonderful time and many memorable moments with the national team.' Klose - who was actually born in Poland - made his Germany debut in 2001 and has since played in four World Cups, scoring at all of them. His goal in the incredible 7-1 semi-final win over Brazil took him past Ronaldo's 15 in the competition to make him the most prolific striker in World Cup history. The Lazio striker, though, prefers to put the team ahead of his own achievements. 'The team's success was and is always the top priority for me,' he added. 'I've achieved our goal with the national team but I have achieved goals I set personally too. Anyone who knows me knows I am very ambitious.

He is one of the greatest strikers there have been,' he said. 'His footballing qualities; his aerial ability, his goal threat, his understanding and his tireless commitment are second to none, and yet I have barely seen a player who is so much about modesty and team spirit. 'For Miro it was always an honour to play for the national team and he has given everything to Germany. He will be missed as a footballer and a person and I am happy and grateful I was able to work with him.'

"Phil Neville has paid glowing tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson and revealed how the legendary former Manchester United manager encouraged him to play cricket during the off-season. Neville spoke about his love of the summer game while a guest on the BBC's Test Match Special programme at lunch on the second day of the fourth Investec Test between England and India at Old Trafford. A talented batsman, Neville was a contemporary of Andrew Flintoff at Lancashire and captained England at Under 15 level before deciding to concentrate full-time on football. VIDEO Scroll down for Class of 92 trailer ft. Scholes, Giggs, Beckham and the Nevilles . First love: Phil Neville was the lunchtime guest on the BBC's Test Match Special programme during the second day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford and spoke about his love of cricket . Lancashire connection: Neville poses for a picture with Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports commentator David 'Bumble' Lloyd at Old Trafford . Best seat in the house: Neville himself tweeted this view of the action from the Old Trafford press box . And a big factor in the decision was Ferguson, who put him on the path to a glittering Old Trafford career that saw him win six Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the Champions League alongside brother Gary. 'He was the best manager in terms of making you feel special,' Neville told TMS. 'Gary sometimes needed that kick up the backside, sometimes needed bringing back down to earth. 'With me, it was more of a wink or a tap on the shoulder. I never got the hairdryer - well, maybe once. 'He would only give you the hairdryer if there was a problem with your attitude. If you played badly, he would put his arm around you. 'He had an unbelievable quality of knowing, at just the right time, when to talk to you. 'He was the type of manager that when you went in for a new contract and asked for £150 more in wages, you would come out having signed the same contract and thanking him for it.' Brothers: Phil Neville leads his sibling Gary in the warm-ups as a Class of '92 team took on Salford City, the non-league club they recently purchased, in a fundraising match at the AJ Bell Stadium on Thursday night . Golden generation: The Class of '92 (from right) Paul Scholes, Phil Neville, Gary Neville, David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs pictured with manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2011 . Hero: Phil Neville made 386 appearances in all for Manchester United in 11 years at the club . Neville left Old Trafford back in 2005, joining Everton in a deal worth £3.5m, and would go on to captain the team and make 303 appearances. But even then, Ferguson continued to have an influence on his career. Neville, who will be part of the Match of the Day punditry team this season, said: 'When I left United, he told me which club to join and what to do and said 'one day you'll be back at Old Trafford.' 'It was not just Fergie the manager, he had a strong bond with his players and a very human side. 'He was brilliant at decision making, knowing the right players to sell at the right time. He slowly built a new team without us.' Neville worked as first-team coach to David Moyes at United last season but will not be part of Louis van Gaal's backroom staff. He has recently bought non-league club Salford City alongside brother Gary and fellow Class of '92 members Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt. Captain marvel: After leaving United, Neville moved to Everton, where he played for eight seasons . Right-hand man: Neville was part of the coaching staff under the David Moyes and Ryan Giggs tenures at Manchester United last season but has not been retained by Louis van Gaal . Next step: Neville will be a pundit for the BBC's Match of the Day programme this season . They played with invited guests in a charity match against Salford on Thursday night, losing 5-1 at the AJ Bell Stadium. Among those on the Class of '92 team were former cricketers Michael Vaughan and Steve Harmison. Neville said both 'did ok' in the fundraising match though Vaughan 'fluffed a good chance' and Harmison played 'like Tony Adams in the nineties'. He added: 'I have never seen a centre-back play so far forward.' Neville compared facing a ball of 90mph in cricket to playing football at an intimidating venue like Anfield or Galatasaray's old Ali Sami Yen ground. And it seems Ferguson was more than happy to see a young Neville toughened up by facing the quick bowlers in the summer months. 'Ferguson encouraged me to play cricket,' he said.

"Despite boasting world-class players James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao, Monaco’s average gate last season was 8,906 – fewer than MK Dons in League One. Rodriguez, the leading scorer at this summer’s World Cup, has since escaped the empty spaces of the Principality with a £65million move to Real Madrid. And If Falcao has his way, he’ll be next. Despite the trappings of Monaco – hot sunshine, low tax, you get the picture – he finds it soul-destroying to perform in front of meagre crowds, even when finishing runners-up in the French League to Paris St Germain. Fed up: Radamel Falcao is seeking a move away from Monaco as he grows tired of life in France . In action: Falcao returned from injury recently to face Arsenal in a pre-season game at the Emirates . Embrace: The forward hugs fellow South American Alexis Sanchez ahead of the game . Liverpool are reported to be keen and with super-agent Jorge Mendes directing operations and Brendan Rodgers still needing to fill the space vacated by Luis Suarez with a genuine A-lister, it could add up. Certainly, Falcao has the quality and goals to be a hit at Anfield. Importantly, he also possesses the physical strength to succeed in the Premer League. For him, hearing a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone from thousands of Koppites will be a marked contrast to the wide gaps he encounters at the Stade Louis II. Until a year ago, AS Monaco was best known for being the launchpad of Arsene Wenger’s career. The Frenchman even persuaded Glenn Hoddle to join him. Last year, a new high-roller tried to recapture the magic. Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, owner of Monaco, went on a huge spending spree and landed Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho from Porto for £60million. Then he gazumped Manchester City and Chelsea to capture Falcao for £50million after the Colombian striker scored 32 goals in La Liga for Atletico Madrid. But now the dream has turned sour for the 28-year-old striker who is getting to the age now where trophies are more important than an already-healthy bank balance. Moved on: His former Monaco team-mate James Rodriguez signed for Real Madrid this summer . Rubbing shoulders: And he is now training with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo on a day-to-day basis . VIDEO Falcao quiet over possible Madrid move . The Colombian was devastated to miss the World Cup with a knee injury and is in no mood to tread water in the French Riviera for another 12 months. Now back in action, he is aware of the interest from Liverpool, who were possibly less upset about missing out on Loic Remy because they knew Falcao was an option. Manchester City have also been mentioned as a possible destination because of injury to Alvaro Negredo though the club have done nothing to encourage the link. Former Rangers, AC Milan and England striker Mark Hateley, who won a French championship under Wenger, says working and living in Monaco is a surreal experience for a footballer. ‘In Milan, it was very intense, I couldn’t go shopping or to a restaurant without getting mobbed. Monaco was a different way of life, you could go for a stroll without anything,’ he said. ‘Boris Becker lived next door. Ayrton Senna was in the same apartment block. We got friendly with the royal family, and all the sportsmen would go out to lunch. The motor racing drivers wanted to be footballers and vice-versa!’ Frustrated: Falcao was desperately upset to miss the World Cup with Colombia through injury . Finisher: But he showed he still has an eye for goal with his finish against Arsenal on Sunday . It all sounds idyllic in one sense but it hasn’t given Falcao enough professional pride. With debate about the Monaco tax laws and the importance of financial fair play, even the compensation of the sky-high salaries may soon be a thing of the past. Falcao is a late developer which may help Liverpool who usually buy young. He was 23 when he left South America for Europe and started in Portugal. He was in his mid-twenties before he played in one of the top leagues, for Atletico. Waiting for his chance didn’t harm Falcao. He scored 52 goals in three seasons for Atletico and helped them win the Europa League and Copa del Rey in successive seasons. Last summer, every big club owner in Europe wanted him, including Roman Abramovich and Sheikh Mansour. On that occasion, he chose the trappings of Monaco. This time round, with his pal Rodriguez gone and strike partner Dimitar Berbatovn not known for doing his share of the workload, he’s tempted by the passion of the Premier League.

"Liverpool have had a £16million bid accepted by AC Milan for Italy striker Mario Balotelli. Balotelli has been offered £90,000-a-week to move to Anfield and the transfer is nearly complete after a 'positive' first meeting on Thursday evening. The player's representatives will meet with Reds executives on Friday morning to thrash out a deal.

Stats: Balotelli's Premier League record (via Opta) Balotelli earlier told Sky Italia: 'This will be my last day at Milanello.' Later, he left Milanello training complex in a red Ferrari. He had lunch after training and stopped to tell reporters: 'Nothing is decided yet nothing is black and white.' Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen posted on Sportslobster: 'Going to be great fun having Balotelli back in the Premier League. There is no doubt about his talent and I'm sure Brendan Rodgers will make sure he behaves having witnessed the problems (Luis) Suarez inflicted on the club. If that's the case, £16m looks good value.' Samuel Eto'o is still an option for Liverpool should the Balotelli deal fall through, for any reason. Balotelli has to be registered by noon on Friday if he is to figure for Liverpool against former club Manchester City on Monday. It would be a sensational return to the Premier League for the 24-year-old, who left City in 2013. Balotelli has been involved in a series of scrapes during his career to date, especially during his time in the Premier League. Striker: Balotelli scored 30 goals in 80 games for City before moving back to Italy . Flashpoint: Balotelli had a number of run-ins during his explosive relationship with Roberto Mancini . On the field, he was sent off for Manchester City against Arsenal in 2012 in a defeat that almost derailed their title charge. And off the pitch, there was the notorious incident when Balotelli set off fireworks in his house, leading to him revealing the famous 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt when he scored in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford in 2011. He also had a set-to with City manager Roberto Mancini on the training ground, and a scrap with Jerome Boateng. The striker's agent Mino Raiola flew to England on Wednesday to try to thrash out a deal. Since returning to Italy, he has scored 30 goals in 54 games, the same amount he scored for City in 80 games. And it is easy to forget that he has already won four titles in two countries, a Champions League and the FA Cup and Coppa Italia by the age of 24.

' Former club captain Monk steered Swansea to safety at the end of last season but it was often a struggle for the 35-year-old and Premier League status was only secured in the closing weeks of the campaign. Since then Swansea have sold goalkeeper Michel Vorm and Ben Davies to Tottenham and the Spanish trio of Michu, Chico Flores and Pablo Hernandez have all departed. Lukasz Fabianski, Bafetimbi Gomis, Jefferson Montero and Marvin Emnes have been recruited, but Monk admits he could do with 'two or three players' before the transfer window closes on September 1. Monk takes no notice, though, of the pundits who claim Swansea will struggle this term. 'We've been written off pretty much every year since I've been at the club,' he said. 'It's no difference to us - it's water off a duck's back. 'No-one will put me under more pressure than myself. I know what I want to do and where I want things to go. 'If things go as planned, then great. If it doesn't, then the obvious is the obvious. But in terms of what's been said, they don't see what we do every day.' Incoming! Lukasz Fabianski has arrived in South Wales from Arsenal but Monk wants more players . Whatever happens at Old Trafford, Monk is hoping to spend some time with the Dutchman after the game, with both men at the opposite ends of the management scale when it comes to experience. 'It would be nice to speak with him after the game,' Monk said. 'I have done that a lot with some of the managers we have come up against. 'I have had some good chats and, if the opportunity is there, I will take it. 'But my focus is on the game and it doesn't matter what team they play - if we are not quite at it then we are going to be in trouble.'","The Swans have lost Michu, Pablo Hernandez and Chico Flores this summer .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes his old club could be spiralling towards obscurity after more than two decades of Premier League domination. United began the season with a 2-1 home defeat by Swansea on Saturday, continuing their disastrous form of the 2013-14 campaign under new manager Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman has since strengthened his defence with the signing of Sporting Lisbon's Marcos Rojo but Scholes fears his old club's chances of breaking back into the top four are slim unless Van Gaal adds another five 'proper' players to his squad before the close of the transfer window.

After winning the title in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge, United could only muster a seventh-place finish under the stewardship of David Moyes - and caretaker boss Ryan Giggs - last season. Hopes of a revival were high following the  appointment of the experienced Van Gaal earlier this summer, particularly after the 63-year-old led Holland to the World Cup semi-finals in impressive fashion.

"Patrick Vieira 'can't believe' that Carlo Tavecchio was elected as the new president of the Italian Football Federation amid a furious racism row and says he'd be banished from working in England. The 71-year-old beat former AC Milan midfielder Demetrio Albertini after three rounds of voting in Rome on Monday but there is widespread outrage that Tavecchio - who allegedly called African players 'banana eaters' last month - has landed the post.

'I'm finding it really hard to believe that Carlo Tavecchio has been elected as president of the Italian FA after the comments that he made,' he tweeted. 'For me, that shows how far away the Italian football authorities are from dealing with discrimination. 63.63% of those that voted are admitting that they aren't fighting against racism, or that they don't want to fight these problems. I played in Italy for years so I know the issues, I saw the issues. 'If he was an Englishman making this kind of comment, politically, he would be completely out.

"If you're planning on flying somewhere for Thanksgiving, expect planes and airports to be even busier than usual this year. Airports could be much more crowded this year as more people fly to their destination to spend time with their family. U.S. airlines expect to carry 24.6 million passengers over the 12 days surrounding Thanksgiving, up 1.5 percent from last year. Busy: Travelers move through the security line on Thanksgiving at the Denver International Airport, there are predictions that there could be widespread disruption this year too . Holiday: Travelers make their way through the Salt Lake City international Airport - U.S. airlines expect to carry 24.6 million passengers over the 12 days surrounding Thanksgiving . And the worst day to travel could be on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, which falls on November 30, with 2.6 million people flying on U.S. airlines. The forecast comes from Airlines for America, a trade group representing the biggest U.S. carriers. It looked at data for Friday, November 21 to Tuesday, December 2 and found that there could be more problems this year compared with prior Thanksgiving. John Heimlich, the group's chief economist, said that rising personal incomes and job growth are helping boost demand for travel. However, last year, the airlines' Thanksgiving travel forecast turned out to be too high by about 3 percent. Heimlich blamed bad weather for causing widespread flight cancelations. Last year, a winter storm caused Thanksgiving travel chaos  in Texas. Road block: Air travel is expected to be bad, but it may not be any better for those who drive . More than 300 flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport - one of the busiest hubs in the nation - were canceled as a dangerous mix of freezing rain and sleet threatened north Texas. However, even if airlines meet this year's forecast, Thanksgiving travel would still be about 6 per cent lower than it was before the recession that began in 2008. The airlines are doing well financially by limiting the supply of new seats and raising fares. In the first nine months of this year, the nine biggest U.S. airlines reported earnings of $6.8 billion, up from $4.5 billion a year earlier.

"One of Australia's top criminal prosecutors is trying to stop a corruption watchdog inquiry, investigating accusations that she advised her son's girlfriend to pretend to have chest pains after a car accident to avoid a blood alcohol test. NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC, best known for prosecuting pack rapists and paedophiles, is understood to have launched legal action in the NSW Supreme Court on Tuesday against a planned Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry into the allegations. The action, which is expected to be heard in the coming days, will argue the inquiry falls outside the ICAC's jurisdiction. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is investigating whether Ms Cunneen and her son Stephen Wyllie, 26, advised Mr Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid being breath tested after a car crash on May 31. NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen is considering quitting over a corruption investigation into a car crash involving her son's girlfriend . Sophia Tilley was involved in a car accident at Willoughby on May 31. Her boyfriend Stephen Wyllie is the son of Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC. Ms Cunneen and Mr Wylie are accused of counselling Ms Tilley to face chest pain at the crash site. The highly-respected has stood aside from her duties until the investigation is resolved. She revealed to Daily Mail Australia that she is considering quitting her job in response to what she says is a baseless corruption investigation targeting her and her son. 'The attack on me through my children is the last intolerable straw,' Ms Cunneen told Daily Mail Australia. 'After 38 years in the service of our state.' The court challenge comes after former Supreme Court judge David Levine QC, who is now the Inspector of the ICAC, reportedly asked the commission to justify its inquiry into Ms Cunneen. Mr Levine's audit requires ICAC to hand over material related to the investigation. It's claimed she and her son Stephen Wyllie in May advised Mr Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains to avoid a blood alcohol test at scene of a car crash. Ms Tilley allegedly took the advice. Ms Cunneen denies what she's described as the 'malicious' allegations made to the watchdog. Former Queensland Parliamentary Crime and Misconduct Commissioner Alan MacSporran QC will preside over the three-day public inquiry starting on November 10, should Ms Cunneen's legal challenge be unsuccessful. Ms Cunneen, best known for prosecuting pack rapists and paedophiles, told Daily Mail Australia that she is devastated by the effect of the investigation on her family. Margaret Cunneen has had a distinguished 38-year career in public service. She is considering quitting due to allegations she and her son attempted to pervert the course of justice in relation to a car accident involving her son's girlfriend. ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30. Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August. Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo when she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore, on May 31. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time. Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured. 'The attack on me through my children is the last intolerable straw.' Margaret Cunneen may quit her job as deputy senior Crown prosecutor . Deputy senior Crown prosecutor is accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice. She denies any wrongdoing and does not know who has been allegations against her . The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident. The Mondeo was a write-off. None of those at the crash scene knew of any investigation until ICAC officers executed simultaneous warrants on July 31 at the home of Ms Cunneen and that of Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley. Each of their mobile telephones was seized. Ms Cunneen has successfully prosecuted paedophiles Robert 'Dolly' Dunn, Colin Fisk and Phillip Bell as well as pack rapist Bilal Skaf and his gang of thugs. Despite, or because, of her accomplishments, she has been criticised by some defence lawyers for being too close to crime victims. In late 2012, Ms Cunneen was appointed to preside over a special commission of inquiry into allegations of police interference in child sex abuse cases in the Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle. The day before the accident she had delivered her report to the then Governor, Dame Marie Bashir. Ms Cunneen is unsure what happened in the two months between the accident and her phone being seized to initiate an investigation but believes the inquiry was sparked by a 'malicious complaint' from someone out to damage her reputation. She has stood aside from her job pending the outcome of the investigation. In August, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were called before ICAC for private hearings. Again, the matter seemed to be stalled until Mr Wyllie, Ms Tilley and Ms Cunneen were served with summonses to appear before a public hearing on Wednesday night. Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen says she may quit her job over ICAC's investigation into allegations she counselled her son Stephen Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to face chest pains after a car accident . The following day ICAC announced it would hold public hearings as part of what it is calling Operation Hale. The hearings would examine 'allegations that on 31 May 2014 Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen SC and Stephen Wyllie, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains, and that Sophia Tilley, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did pretend to have chest pains, to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence of Ms Tilley's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident'. The public hearing is set for three days, staring on November 10, when the commission is expected to hear from police and ambulance officers who attended the crash as well as members of the public who were present at the scene. Daily Mail Australia can reveal that since the announcement of the public hearing a new witness to accident has come forward stating she heard and saw 'nothing untoward' at the crash scene. Ms Cunneen has received widespread support from prominent Australians, particularly in the legal community. The architect of the ICAC, Gary Sturgess, has described the investigation as 'appalling'. 'That's a joke, really that's a joke,' Mr Sturgess told The Daily Telegraph. 'If that is the best they have got to do then frankly they should be handing some money back. It's appalling.' Former premier Nick Greiner, who set up the ICAC in 1989, has also criticised the corruption watchdog's investigation into Ms Cunneen for straying beyond its 'core task'. Mr Greiner told The Sydney Morning Herald he had a 'sneaking view' that if Ms Cunneen had a lower profile 'I doubt this would have happened'.","Margaret Cunneen, SC, launches legal action in the NSW Supreme Court .

"Celtic have been handed a sensational Champions League reprieve after UEFA ruled Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player against the Scottish champions. Henning Berg's side had advanced to the play-off round after winning the home and away legs on a convincing 6-1 aggregate. But a UEFA disciplinary meeting convened before the European draws in Nyon decided Celtic should be awarded a 3-0 second leg victory - and advance on away goals - after Legia fielded defender Bartosz Bereszynski for the final three minutes of Wednesday night's win in Edinburgh. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Ronny Delia following Celtic's defeat on Wednesday . Reprieve? UEFA have launched an investigation into Celtic's Champions League defeat to Legia Warsaw . Suspended: Defender Bartosz Bereszynski came of for the final few minutes of the game . Going through? Bereszynski celebrates with team-mates as Legia Warsaw beat Celtic . Bartosz Bereszynski is a Polish international who has won two caps for his country. He started his career at Lech Poznan in 2009 before joining Legia Warsaw in 2013. The 22-year-old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against Apallon in the Europa League. He could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against St Patrick's but Legia failed to register the defender for those matches allowing  Berg to choose from his full compliment of 25 players. News began to filter out for Uefa headquarters after the Legia chairman tweeted 'I failed' ahead of the official announcement. Red carded against Cypriots Appollon Limassol in a Europa League game last season Bereszynski was supposed to serve his suspension in UEFA competition this season. Unregistered for the second qualifying win over St Patrick's Athletic, however, the first opportunity to serve his ban came with during the Celtic tie. His late appearance as a substitute in the second leg was reported to the governing body by the UEFA match delegate leading to his eligibility being investigated. After being reinstated into the competition, Celtic were drawn against Maribor in the play-off round. Legia are likely to fight the decision after spokeswoman Elizabeth Kus said: 'This is the result of a misunderstanding. We have already seen comments appear which threaten us with expulsion, but this is absurd. UEFA have only asked us to explain.' Heat is on: Deila (left) sitting beside assistants John Collins and John Kennedy has suffered an horrendous start as Celtic boss following the Hoops failure to reach the group stage . Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda gave a scathing assessment of Celtic's performance after the first leg, he said: 'St Patrick's playerd a lot tougher against us than Celtic. They gave us a very tough game in Warsaw. 'With Celtic, we didn't know what to expect, but we were expected to easily beat the Irish side, which we did, but only after a big fright and a good performance away. Fortunately, we regained our composure and we are now on the right track.' In an incredible twist this is the second time in three years Celtic have gained a UEFA reprieve following an ineligibility row. In September 2011 Swiss club FC Sion were expelled from the Europa League for fielding ineligible players. Sion won the qualifying tie 3-1 on aggregate, but following an appeal from Celtic, UEFA awarded the Parkhead club a 3-0 victory for each of the home and away legs of the tie which sent them into the group stages. A UEFA statement said: 'Legia have been sanctioned for fielding an ineligible player (article 18 of the UEFA Champions League regulations and article 21 of the Disciplinary Regulations). The match has been declared as forfeit meaning Legia Warszawa have lost the match 3-0. 'As a consequence, Celtic have qualified for the UEFA Champions League play-offs on away goals (agg: 4-4) and Legia will compete in the UEFA Europa League play-offs. 'In addition the player Bartosz Bereszynski has been suspended for one additional UEFA competition match for which he would be otherwise eligible. This suspension shall be added to the remaining two match suspension which the player still has to serve in accordance with the Control and Disciplinary Body decision of 13 February 2014.' Hopeful: Celtic fans, pictured ahead of Wednesday's night clash at Murrayfield, will be hoping for a reprieve . Celtic will now be among the seeded teams for Friday's draw. Legia Warsaw have five days within which to lodge an appeal, and a statement on the Polish's club website indicated they had requested UEFA's reasoning for the ruling before making a decision. Celtic benefited from an ineligibility ruling during the 2011-12 season when they were reinstated into the Europa League group stages despite a qualifying defeat by Sion. The Swiss side were ruled to have fielded five ineligible players after breaching a FIFA transfer ban and failed to reverse the decision during a lengthy legal battle. Legia chairman Dariusz Mioduski vowed to challenge UEFA's decision. He wrote on Twitter: 'Today, the sport lost behind closed doors. We made a mistake, sorry, but the penalty is disproportionate. Stay with us. We fight on.'","Legia Warsaw fielded defender Bartosz Bereszynski was suspended after red card last season .

"Sharks have a fearsome reputation as ruthless and aggressive hunters. But some 'tigers of the sea' can also be solitary, and prefer to remain in the background, according to new research on shark personalities. UK scientists claim they have shown that the notorious predators have personality traits that determines how they behave in groups. A University of Exeter team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks in captivity under three different habitat types . A University of Exeter team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks in captivity under three different habitat types. The species of shark are found throughout the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean and usually form mixed-sexed social groups driven by individual familiarity. Ten groups of sharks were monitored in large tanks containing three habitats which differed in their level of structural complexity. 'We found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed, socially well-connected individuals remained well-connected under each new habitat,' said Dr David Jacoby, a behavioural ecologist now at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), London. Ten groups of sharks were monitored in large tanks containing three habitats which differed in their level of structural complexity. The team found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed, socially well-connected individuals remained well-connected under each new habitat . There are more than 150 known species of catsharks, with some more commonly known as 'dogfish.' Catsharks are found in temperate and tropical oceans worldwide, and can be found in very shallow waters to depths of 9.8ft (3m). Most species are small and grow no longer than 31 inches (80 cm). Some, however, can reach reach 5.2ft (1.6 metres) in length. The small-spotted catshark is found mainly sandy, gravelly, or muddy areas of waters largely in in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. 'In other words, their social network positions were repeated through time and across different habitats. 'These results were driven by different social preferences that appeared to reflect different strategies for staying safe. ' The study found that well-connected sharks formed groups, while less social individuals tended to camouflage alone, matching their skin colour with the colour of the gravel at the bottom of the tank. 'In the wild these small juveniles can make easy prey items for larger fish, so different anti-predator strategies are likely to have evolved,' said Professor Darren Croft, of the Centre for Research into Animal Behaviour at Exeter. The research follows a similar study last year by a biologist from the Bahamas who also discovered while that some lemon sharks (pictured) can be aggressive, others can be 'mellow' 'More research, however, is required to truly test the influence of predators on social personality traits in sharks. This study is the first step in that direction.' The research follows a similar study last year by a biologist from the Bahamas who also discovered while that some sharks can be aggressive, others can be 'mellow'. Biologist Jean Sebastien Finger added that it is impossible to generalise the behaviour of one individual to a species. In a study of young lemon sharks, he found that some of the fish were novelty-seekers while others were less sociable and played it safe when exploring a new enclosure. Scientists are interested in comparing research into animals' personalities across different species to see how the quality has evolved. A mixture of personalities in a group could potentially have a huge bearing on the survival of certain species.","University of Exeter recorded interactions of between young catsharks .

"Luis Suarez has left the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne following a five-hour hearing on the first day of his appeal case against his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. Suarez refused to answer questions as he left the CAS headquarters in the Swiss city but did stop to sign autographs for waiting fans. The Barcelona striker and his legal team are confident the ban from 'all football-related activity', handed down by world governing body FIFA, will be halved. This would open the way for Uruguay star Suarez, 27, to return after August 25, potentially making his debut for the La Liga club at Villarreal on August 31.

Confident: Suarez's legal team are optimistic his four-month ban will be halved, making his available to play for new club Barcelona at the end of August . His legal team will argue that the ban should be restricted to international football and that he should be allowed to train with Barcelona while he is suspended. Following the hearing, CAS issued a statement which read: 'The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has today heard the appeal of Luis Suarez, FC Barcelona and the Uruguayan FA against FIFA. The hearing took place at the CAS headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. 'The player was present and gave a statement to the Panel of CAS arbitrators: Mr Bernhard Welten, Switzerland (President), Professor Luigi Fumagalli, Italy, and Dr Marco Balmelli, Switzerland. 'At the end of the hearing, the panel informed the parties that it will issue its decision as soon as possible, probably before the end of next week. 'The full arbitral award, with the grounds, will follow at a later date and be published by the CAS.' FIFA imposed the four-month ban from all football, plus a nine-month international ban and a £66,000 fine, after the former Liverpool player bit Chiellini on the shoulder during Uruguay's 1-0 win on June 24. The governing body's appeal committee have already turned down an appeal against the suspension. Mobbed: Suarez is surrounded by photographers and cameramen as he arrives at CAS headquarters . Encouragement: A young Barcelona fan wishes Suarez well and hopes to see him playing for his side soon . Waiting game: The press wait for Suarez to re-emerge from CAS after a decision is made . What he did . Suarez bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder while waiting for a cross during Uruguay's World Cup match on June 24. Replays showed Suarez lunged at Chiellini and bit him before falling to the ground clutching his face. The Italian later pulled down his shirt to reveal bite marks. The punishment . On June 26, FIFA's Disciplinary Committee handed down a four-month ban from all football-related activity as well as a nine-match international suspension and a fine of £66,000. What are the implications of this? The four-month ban means Suarez is unable to play again until October 25. After the World Cup, Liverpool sold him to Barcelona for a fee of £75m. Intriguingly, if the ban is upheld, Suarez's first match after the ban will be the Clasico with Real Madrid on October 26. What if the appeal succeeds? His legal team believe there is a chance the ban could be halved to just two months, therefore expiring on August 25 instead. Barcelona's first match after that date is at Villarreal on August 31. Incident: Suarez bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder during Uruguay's 1-0 win at the World Cup . Marked: Chiellini shows the bite marks after Suarez sunk his teeth into his shoulder . But FIFPro, the world players' union, supports a reduction in Suarez's punishment at domestic and international level. A statement on the organisation's website read: 'That Luis Suarez has been trialled and vilified in public, ever since the incident, is a sanction in itself. 'On the other hand, it has been remarkable to see the response from his fellow professionals and the victim himself, Giorgio Chiellini. 'Many agree the sanctions are excessive. This is an important signal for the CAS panel to consider. 'The sanctions are a disproportionate response to the offence. 'Especially the four-month ban from all football-related activity, which is unfair for Suarez as it infringes his right to work at club level. 'In the international arena, where the offence was committed, a nine-match ban for Uruguay is also too strong as it effectively equates to a two-year sanction. Plea of innocence: Suarez then collapsed to the ground holding his front teeth . New signing: Liverpool sold Suarez to Barcelona for £75m after his ban was handed down . Bearing his teeth: Suarez later apologised to Chiellini and the 'entire football family' and promised that there would never again be another incident . VIDEO If appeal unsuccessful, Suarez will return for El Clasico . 'FIFPro states the educative nature of the sanction mentioned by FIFA in the ruling can be much better achieved by making it partially conditional, including the obligation for Luis Suarez to receive treatment. 'This can be applied on the number of matches but also on the period of the ban. The FIFA appeals committee missed an opportunity to take this into account. FIFPro expects that CAS will respect these assumptions.' Suarez's lawyer Alejandro Balbi, a member of the Uruguayan FA's executive, admitted there was little chance of overturning the nine-match international ban, but there was a likelihood of getting the four-month overall ban reduced. Balbi told Uruguyan newspaper El Observador: 'It would be more logical to reduce the sanction by a few months than to reduce the ban concerning international games, because legally it's easier to contend against the terms of the suspension that forbid him from training and from being at the club, because they violate fundamental rights. 'The other ban (the nine-match ban for Uruguay) is more a question of the level of the punishment.' Liverpool sold Suarez, who scored 31 goals last season, to Barcelona for £75m after his FIFA ban. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, is regarded as the 'Supreme Court' for the sporting world.

"Barcelona thanked Thomas Vermaelen for turning down Manchester United and reassured supporters his injury problems are behind him when the 28-year-old central defender was presented at the Camp Nou on Sunday. Referring to United, Barcelona’s Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta said: 'He had offers from one of the biggest clubs in world football and we appreciate the fact that he chose to come here instead.'

The player was asked numerous questions regarding his injury record but Zubizarreta defended the signing saying: 'We have no doubt about the fitness of Thomas. 'He can play at left-back as well as in the centre of defence so he gives us a versatility that we will need over the long season. We have followed him for a long time because he is the type of player that fits the way we play.' The player himself spoke of a ‘fresh start’ admitting that his last season at the Emirates had been difficult. 'I want to look forward not back and the desire is there to play a lot of games, I believe I can. Last year was disappointing with injuries but that happens sometimes in a long career. I hope that I will be stronger this season and play more games. I am ready and I feel I can offer the club a lot. I can’t wait to get started with training. This is a new beginning.' Vermaelen's former team-mates at Arsenal took to Twitter to wish him all the best.

The player added: 'I picked up an injury at the World Cup and have not trained with Arsenal so I will need a couple of weeks to get back to full fitness. The club confirmed the deal is worth 15m euros with 3.8m euros in add-ons if Barcelona win the Champions League across the five years of his contract. The length of the player’s deal has also raised eyebrows in Barcelona but Zubizarreta said: 'He is only 28 and we think he can give us stability. He could be here for five years; he could be here for even longer. 'He is a player for the here and now once he has got over his injury, and then he is here for the long term.'

Vermaelen is the first out-and-out centre back Barcelona have signed in five years but the club also made a point of mentioning his ability to play as a left-back. Vermaelen said: 'I prefer to play in the centre of defence but occasionally I have played as a full-back. 'The fact that I’ve played at Arsenal will help. I don’t think the style here is that different so that will be an advantage. I was at Ajax before and they also look to play the ball on the ground.' Barcleona have also signed the defender, who won only an FA Cup at Arsenal but a league and two cups at Ajax, for his ability in the air and he said: 'I feel that I am very good in the air and that is something else I can offer.' Asked about his new defensive team-mates and about his former Ajax team-mate Luis Suarez, he said: 'The defenders who are already here are very good but you know that will be case when you join a big club. 'Luis is a great player as every has seen first at Ajax and then in Liverpool. Everyone knows what quality he has. As a person I knew him at Ajax and my experience was that he is a nice guy.

"Coventry City will return to the Ricoh Arena after more than a year playing in Northampton. The Sky Blues, currently 14th in League One, have ended their dispute with the stadium's owners Arena Coventry Limited (ACL) and have reached an agreement to head back to the stadium they played in between 2005 and 2013. The two-year deal, with an option for an extra two years, should see the Sky Blues play at the Ricoh   in their next home fixture, which is against Gillingham on 6 September. Heading home: Coventry are to return to the Ricoh Arena after playing in Northampton for more than a year . A year's break: Coventry spent last season playing in front of small crowds at Northampton's   Sixfields Stadium . The deal was struck after Coventry owners Sisu paid ACL £471,192 via the Football League last week, with the money going towards compensation and unpaid rent. ACL had previously said it would not discuss a return until it received money owed by the club after they went into administration last year. Sisu and ACL first came into conflict in April 2012 when  Coventry started to withhold what they felt was unreasonable rent from the stadium operators. The Sky Blues then agreed a three-year groundshare deal with Northampton - 35 miles away - with an option of a further two years, and the Cobblers will be due compensation after the early end of the deal. Back to where they belong: A fan protests at the Ricoh in 2013, prior to Coventry's move . Home from home: Coventry take on Barnsley earlier this month at their adopted home in Northampton . Steve Waggott, development director at Coventry City FC, welcomed the agreement and said: 'We are delighted to get this deal done and I am sure every supporter of Coventry City will be thrilled with this news. 'We are under no illusion what a difficult 12 months it has been for the supporters and that was uppermost in our thinking as we worked to get this deal done. 'Logistically, it's going to mean a huge amount of work between now and the first game back and we would ask supporters to bear with us as all of our efforts up to now have been in getting this deal over the line to get us back to Coventry as soon as possible.' Versatile: The Ricoh Arena has been used for other events, such as football matches during the 2012 Olympics . 'We are delighted to get this deal done and I am sure every supporter of Coventry City will be thrilled with this news. 'We are under no illusion what a difficult 12 months it has been for the supporters and that was uppermost in our thinking as we worked to get this deal done. 'There has had to be compromise on both sides and the commercial details of the deal will remain confidential. 'Now it is all about looking forward to a really exciting season back in the community and with a real chance of success. I am sure every supporter will want to give Steven Pressley, his staff and players their full backing for the season at the Ricoh. 'Logistically, it's going to mean a huge amount of work between now and the first game back and we would ask supporters to bear with us as all of our efforts up to now have been in getting this deal over the line to get us back to Coventry as soon as possible. 'We will announce details around tickets, Season Tickets and other information as soon as we can next week but we hope to be back at the Ricoh for the clash with Gillingham. We will keep supporters fully informed of progress to that aim. 'Can I also take this opportunity of thanking Chris Robinson, Chair of ACL, for the professional manner he has conducted our lengthy discussions to reach this agreement.'","Coventry City will return to the Ricoh Arena after more than a year away .

"Arsenal cruised to a 3-0 victory over Premier League champions Manchester City to lift their first silverware of the season - the Community Shield. It was largely one-way traffic at Wembley where Arsene Wenger's side made it two trophies from two games but Manuel Pellegrini's men never really turned up. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his opinion on the performances of both sets of players. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mathieu Flamini say Arsenal will challenge for the title . Champions: Arsenal make it two trophies from two Wembley visits after winning the FA Cup back in May . Rivals: Aaron Ramsey scored an excellent goal against former team-mate Gael Clichy's Manchester City . Opener: Santi Cazorla's neat turn wrong-footed Clichy before he fired past Willy Caballero . Arsenal: 4-2-3-1 . Wojciech Szczesny - Has serious competition after the arrival of David Ospina, but was safe as houses. 6.5 . Mathieu Debuchy - Bacary Sagna's replacement will be satisfied with his display, but needs to show more defensive responsibility. 6.5 . Calum Chambers - Looks sure to be an England regular of the future. Not the quickest, but reads the game well. 7.5 . Laurent Koscielny - Largely untroubled but the Frenchman was solid in heart of Arsenal's back-four. 6.5 . Third: Substitute Olivier Giroud scores an excellent long-range goal to give Arsene Wenger food for thought . Kieran Gibbs - Looks in excellent shape. Finally free of injury, he can make a run for the England squad. 7 . Mikel Arteta - Skippered the side and led by example. Kept things ticking over in midfield. 7 . Aaron Ramsey - Picked up where he left off last season, with another excellent Wembley goal. 8 . Jack Wilshere - After an injury free pre-season, the midfielder looked sharp before he was forced off with knock on his knee. 7 . New boys: Alexis Sanchez makes a pass while former Porto man Fernando watches on . Alexis Sanchez - Dangerous whenever the ball was at his feet. Big hand in Arsenal's second. 6.5 . Santi Cazorla - Been talk of him leaving this summer, but remains vital to Arsene Wenger's plans. Excellent goal, too. 7 . Yaya Sanogo - Looks far from being an Arsenal player at times, but had a hand in both goals. Work that one out. 6.5 . Subs: Rosicky (for Cazorla, 70) 6, Giroud (for Sanogo 46) 7, Oxlade-Chamberlain 6.5 (for Sanchez 46), Monreal 6.5 (Koscielny 46), Flamini (for Wilshere 68) 6, Campbell (for Ramsey) 5.5 . Not used: Martinez. Arsene Wenger - Winning is a habit. They've won at Wembley again. The Frenchman will be full of optimism going into the new season. 7.5 . Tussle: Yaya Toure and Jack Wilshere compete for the ball during the Community Shield final . Man City: 4-4-2 . Willy Caballero - An opportunity to put pressure on Joe Hart ahead of the new season. He didn't take it. 5 . Gael Clichy - Played out on the right-hand side and was kept busy by Cazorla's movement. 6 . Dedryck Boyata - Unlikely to feature regularly for the City this season and he looked uncomfortable for City. 5 . Matija Nastasic - Looks set to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer. It looked that way. 5 . Tactics: Manuel Pellegrini gives instructions to James Milner before the Englishman headed on as a substitute . Impressive: Former Southampton defender Calum Chamber looked assured for Arsenal playing in a central role . Aleksander Kolarov - Kept plugging away against the pace of Sanchez, but couldn't stop the Arsenal tide. 5.5 . Jesus Navas - A few elaborate touches that came off, but not the Spaniard's best afternoon. 5 . Yaya Toure - Strong physical presence in midfield, but struggled to contain the movement of Arsenal's midfield trio during the first half. 6 . Fernando - The game bypassed Manchester City's summer signing somewhat. He'll hope for easier afternoons. 6 . Marked: Jesus Navas battles with Kieran Gibbs as the two lined up against each other . Unpopular: Samir Nasri's every touch was greeted by boos in the first half, he was eventually substituted . Samir Nasri - An unhappy afternoon playing against his former club. Subbed at half-time - much to Arsenal supporters delight. 5 . Edin Dzeko - Starved of service from City's midfield before being replaced at half time. 5 . Stevan Jovetic - Has looked sharp during pre-season but it was a day to forget. 5.5 . Subs: Richards (for Kolarov 76) 5.5, Milner (for Dzeko) 6, Sinclair (for Navas 86) 5, Silva (for Nasri 46) 6, Zuculini 5.5 (for Toure 46) Not used: Hart, Rekik .

Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) - 6.5 . Reserves: Neither Yaya Sanogo or Matija Nastasic are likely to be first choice for their clubs this season .

"Neil Warnock is hoping to end his 16-month managerial exile after holding talks with Huddersfield Town over their vacant position. The former QPR boss was sacked by Leeds United in April last year and is keen to get back into the game. Although the Terriers are seen as a club in crisis after the abrupt exit of Mark Robins following the opening day mauling at the hands of Bournemouth, Warnock would have no qualms rejoining his old side. Back in the picture: Former Leeds boss Neil Warnock is hoping to end his managerial exile . The 65-year-old managed Huddersfield between 1993 and 1995 before eventually moving on to take charge in the Premier League later in his career. Warnock will link-up with Kevin Blackwell should he land the job at the besieged Championship club, who have made huge strides off the pitch in recent years in order to create an infrastructure capable of handling the rigours of English football’s second tier. Blackwell would become assistant manager at the John Smith’s Stadium 20 years after playing under Warnock in Yorkshire.

"Tiger Woods finally arrived at Valhalla Golf Club on Wednesday to begin his preparations for the 96th US PGA Championship. Woods' participation was in serious doubt after he withdrew from the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational during Sunday's final round, the former world number one looking in severe pain from his back after hitting his tee shot on the ninth hole. The 38-year-old, who underwent back surgery on March 31, was scheduled to play a practice round at 2pm local time. VIDEO Scroll down for World No.1 Rory McIlroy looks forward to US PGA Championship . Fighting fit: Tiger Woods arrives at Valhalla for his PGA Championship practice round . Smooth: The American golfer looked calm in his preparations, intent on recovering from injury . Empty space: There were doubts the former world number one would make it to Valhalla . Woods won the US PGA the last time it was staged here in 2000, but did not play in the Ryder Cup in 2008 and the course has since undergone extensive renovation led by designer Jack Nicklaus. Woods is scheduled to tee off at 8:35am local time on Thursday alongside Phil Mickelson and Padraig Harrington, but could still decide to withdraw and miss three of the year's four majors for the first time in his career. Knee surgery in 2008 to replace his anterior cruciate ligament - just after his last major victory in the US Open at Torrey Pines - forced him to miss the Open and US PGA Championship. In 2011 he failed to tee it up at the US Open and the Open because of an Achilles complaint. Injury: Woods injured his back playing this shot last week . Asked on Sunday if he had suffered the same injury which led to the operation in March, Woods told reporters: 'It's just the whole lower back. It happened on the second hole when I hit my second shot. I fell back into the bunker. Just jarred it. It's been spasming ever since.' Woods missed the cut in his first event back at the end of June and then suffered his worst ever 72-hole finish in a major championship as a professional, ending up 69th in the Open at Royal Liverpool despite an opening 69. He had previously spoken about being 'pain-free' for the first time in two years, but told his pre-tournament press conference in Akron that other people who had undergone the same surgery 'had no idea' how he was able to play again so quickly.","Woods due to begin practice round at 7pm BST .

"It’s one of the fastest growing demands from travellers but many airlines are still not offering on-board wifi for their passengers, according to a study that identifies some of the cheapest rates. Of those who are allowing fliers to stay connected, many are charging a hefty fee for each hour of use or for the duration of the entire trip. Analysis by Cheapflights.co.uk revealed that Middle Eastern carriers Emirates and Etihad are charging the lowest tariffs at around £1.70 and £3.10 per hour, respectively. Stay connected: Nearly half of 20 carriers included in a study are not offering on-board wifi . Of the 20 carriers included in the study, Turkish Airlines is the only one that does not charge a fee for wifi, while nine do not offer it at all. Monarch Airlines charges £3.99 per person per flight. On the pricier end of the scale, Aer Lingus, Air France and KLM charge approximately £8.65 for a single hour of in-flight wifi. A recent survey of 1,073 adults in the UK found that 70 per cent of passengers want to remain connected to simply pass the time, stay in touch with family and friends or complete business work. A recent survey of 1,073 adults in the UK found that 70 per cent of passengers want access to wifi . Planes have traditionally been a connectivity-free zone, but new rules from the European Aviation Safety Agency allow mobile devices to be left switched on during flights. Before the rules were relaxed in September mobile devices on all flights had to be turned off or switched to flight mode before take-off. The change clears the way for airlines to allow passengers to use their mobile phone plan to make calls and use data via satellite, but it appears carriers have been slow to implement it. Of the airlines included in the study, six are allowing travellers to use their phones (Aer Lingus, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic), and one (Lufthansa) is allowing text messages only. Travellers should be careful before they start calling their friends on the ground or using their data, however, because they risk being hit with a massive bill.

"Madonna could deliver a much-needed ratings boost to The X Factor . It is precisely the sort of headline-grabbing coup that The X Factor needs to boost its flagging ratings. Simon Cowell has persuaded Madonna to perform in the live final of the ITV talent show – but there are strings attached. One source said: ‘Madonna will have been provisionally booked because the final can be subject to change if an artist doesn’t approve of the finalists – especially if they have agreed to sing with them. ‘Someone like Madonna will want a lot of creative control over her appearance, but for Simon the ratings will be worth it.’ But the source added that there were also conditions Madonna must agree to. ‘She has been told that her label will be expected to pay for any stage props and backing dancers she brings with her,’ the insider said. The 56-year-old pop queen’s appearance on December 13 will hark back to the show’s heyday when it could attract superstars of the calibre of Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John and Beyoncé Knowles. And Madonna’s appearance could also boost sales of her as-yet untitled 13th studio album, due for release just after the live final. Another source close to the show told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It had been rumoured that Irish rockers U2 were being lined up to take part. But that has not happened and the confusion may have come because they share the same manager, Guy Oseary.’ An ITV source said last night: ‘We do always look for the best artists for the final. Madonna’s name will have been on a list at some point, yes. But nothing will be made certain until just before the live final.’ Viewing figures for this year’s series have struggled despite the return of Simon Cowell (left) and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini (second left) to the panel and Cowell thinks having Madonna in the final will give the show a boost . Meanwhile, Cowell is setting his sights on establishing an X Factor-style show in India. The music mogul wants to find a boy band that can dominate the sub-continent in the same way his acts such as One Direction do in Britain and America. India is a lucrative market: the country is home to more than 700 million people under the age of 30 and has seen an explosion in music sales. A source said that discussions with TV networks were at an advanced stage. Cowell already has a relationship with broadcaster Colors which screens India’s Got Talent to audiences of 100 million. A spokesman for his company, Syco, said: ‘India is an important market to us and there are a number of new projects in discussion.’ These include a stage show taking place in December in Mumbai. Cowell is also planning an international talent contest across all countries where his Got Talent franchise is screened.","Madonna 'will want a lot of creative control over her appearance' on show .

"Paul Scholes was lazing around at his home on Saddleworth Moor when his phone bleeped. It was a simple text message from his best mate Gary Neville. ‘Jack wants a word’ it read. ‘Jack who?’ replied Scholes. ‘Jack Wilshere you ****!!!’. The night before, Scholes had made a memorable debut in the television studio at Old Trafford alongside a grinning Neville. He didn't hold back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch WIlshere talk about him smoking and see him in training . New surroundings: Paul Scholes is a pundit for BT Sport this season after hanging up his boots . Critic: Scholes claimed Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere had not improved with age . ‘Wilshere, what a really top young player, but he has not really gone on,’ observed Scholes on that evening in March. ‘Injuries haven’t helped him, but he doesn’t look any better now than when he was 17.’ Scholes has continued to tell it how it is since that evening, which is part of the attraction to his new employer BT Sport after a playing career spent largely away from the media glare. As we chat about his new career as a TV analyst, he peppers the conversation with gems such as: ‘I wish I could have played for Mourinho.’ Nothing is off limits. He is passionate about the national team but scathing of Roy Hodgson’s claim that England play just like Germany. More on all that in a moment. Back to Jack and that night at Old Trafford. ‘I would never have answered the phone if I knew he was going to talk about it to everyone,’ admitted Scholes. ‘I don’t think he should have told anyone about our phone call, but it’s up to him. I had hoped it was private.’ Scholes sees something special in Wilshere. The former Manchester United midfielder first came across him in 2010, when Wilshere was on loan at Bolton. Back in the day: Scholes first came across Wilshere when he was on loan at Bolton . Paul Scholes hit out at Jack Wilshere after Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Swansea in March . The midfielder said he was hurt by the ex-Manchester United man's comments . ‘I wasn’t having a pop,’ he explained. ‘I was disappointed he wasn't being helped by his club, by his manager or his assistant manager. ‘As an English midfield player I just want him to do better. I know he has had a nightmare with those ankles, but I played against him when he was 17 and I just thought “Jesus”.’ Scholes, like everyone else, saw the pictures of Wilshere partying away in Las Vegas with Joe Hart and James Milner in the days after England’s shameful World Cup exit. He is a man who likes a pint down the local with his pals and believes players are entitled to a few drinks if it helps them relax at the end of a tough season. ‘What Jack gets up to in the summer is up to him,’ he added. ‘He had a smoke, but it’s not the end of the world. ‘At United the laundry room used to be full of smoke in the mornings because Laurent Blanc and Fabien Barthez wouldn't start training until they had a cigarette. ‘I've known foreign players have a glass of wine or a beer the night before a game. ‘I have never smoked, but when there was a chance to go out with my wife or my friends then I would take it. I was brought up going to the pub on Saturday and Sunday afternoon with my mum and dad. ‘When I became a first-team player I realised when I was 19 or 20 that I would have to be more professional.’ Caught: Wilshere was photographed with a cigarette in his mouth in Las Vegas this summer . Time out: Scholes claims Fabien Barthez (left) and Laurent Blanc both enjoyed a cigarette before training . Scholes was a dedicated player who won 11 Barclays Premier League titles and two Champions Leagues during his phenomenal career. He says he never considered leaving United — ‘imagine me as a Galactico? You must be joking’ — and he was genuinely surprised to learn of Xavi’s admiration for his ability. ‘It is embarrassing for someone of his ilk to talk about me like that,’ he admits. ‘What a player he has been for Spain and Barcelona. I only wish we could have played together.’ ‘No one ever came in for me,’ he claims, although he goes on to admit he would have taken the chance to play for Chelsea’s controversial manager. ‘Mourinho is the man I would have wanted to play for. The way he comes across, he is a confident man and someone to look up to. He’s probably a little bit funny to listen to for the players. ‘He is a great manager and has managed some great clubs.’ Scholes played in some magnificent United teams, a powerful force at home and abroad as they chased so many honours. Scholes talks as though he is still one of the boys in the dressing room, going on to say that he would love to see ‘Kroos or Schweinsteiger, or both, in a red shirt’. Main man: Scholes admits he would loved to have played under current Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . German giants: Scholes would like to see Toni Kroos (left) or Bastian Schweinsteiger play for United . He is a straight talker, something bookmaker Paddy Power capitalised on when the former United midfielder wrote a column criticising Wayne Rooney before the World Cup. Rooney retaliated — ‘I don’t have his phone number and he doesn't have mine’ — but Scholes maintains that the new United captain is one of the best players in the Premier League. ‘Where the friction came from I’m not too sure because I like the lad,’ he added. ‘From my point of view there is no friction and I loved playing with him. He is an unbelievable footballer. He has been captaincy material for quite a while because he is vocal when he needs to be. ‘He demands the best from his team-mates and he isn't a shy lad.’ Rooney is five short of 100 caps for his country but Scholes is not taken with the pomp and ceremony that comes with those glass-cabinet presentations. David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard have all been presented with golden caps on the pitch at Wembley. Happy times: Scholes and Wayne Rooney during their time together at Manchester United . Captain fantastic? Rooney scored for United against Swansea on Saturday but saw his slide slip to defeat . VIDEO Rooney not world class - Hamman . Scholes, who won 66 caps before retiring from international duty in 2004, said: ‘What does 100 caps mean? It means you've played 100 games for your country. It’s not achieving what you want to achieve. Did you win something? No.’ Scholes is passionate about the national team and admits he was surprised to hear Hodgson claim England were close to Germany’s level despite exiting the World Cup with a single point. ‘England would like to do what Germany are doing but are we close? I honestly can’t see it. ‘We went out of the World Cup after two games, but Roy obviously thinks we are on the right track. ‘Germany took young players to a World Cup four years ago and were beating everyone. We did the same and went out. If I’m honest, I’m not really sure what it is that we do.’ Game over: England were knocked out of the World Cup after the group stage in Brazil this summer . Despite Scholes’ undoubted ability on the pitch, along with his strident opinions off it, he has been lost to the national set-up. ‘What would I do?’ he wonders aloud.

"Arsene Wenger attacked Serbian referee Milorad Mazic after Aaron Ramsey was sent off in Arsenal’s stormy Champions League qualifier against Besiktas. Wenger, who narrowly missed being hit by a bottle thrown from the stands at the final whistle, was angry with the officiating inside the intimidating Ataturk Stadium after they escaped with a 0-0 draw. Ramsey picked up two yellow cards, Mikel Arteta came off with an ankle injury after Demba Ba fouled him and Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic was sent off in the final seconds. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ramsey red card unbelievable - Wenger . Dumbfounded: Aaron Ramsey was sent off for Arsenal against Besiktas on Tuesday night . Silly boy: Ramsey received (left) his second yellow card for bringing down Besiktas' Oguzhan Ozyakup (right) Fuming: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger describes the decision to send off Ramsey as 'wrong' Arsenal have reported the bottle thrown incident to UEFA and the governing body will open an investigation into the matter today. Wenger said: ‘Neither the first nor the second yellow card was deserved. When you see some of the fouls made tonight and we go home with Ramsey red carded, it's a bit unbelievable. ‘I think it was a very bad challenge on Arteta, but the referee was on the pitch and didn't make anything of it. In the second half the performance of the referee was very bad. Arteta turned his ankle on the tackle. ‘To send off Ramsey was wrong and it was a huge decision. I felt just a lot was wrong in the second half but, overall, it was a difficult game maybe to referee as well. ‘Everybody did fight for every ball. Maybe it was not easy for the referee as well. ‘The referee had a few conversations with Bilic in the second half and, in the end, sent him off. He can explain that much better. I don't know really why he sent him off.’ Wenger also confirmed that he has made a complaint to UEFA after a missile was launched at him after the final whistle.

"Chelsea's preparations for the Premier League season were dealt a blow as Didier Drogba limped off less than 30 minutes into his first start since returning to the club, as Jose Mourinho's side rounded off their pre-season tour of Europe with a hard-fought win against Ferencvaros. The former Ivory Coast international went down clutching his ankle midway through the first half and had to be replaced by Oscar after 28 minutes. Chelsea were already behind at the point, due to the left boot of former Fulham playmaker Zoltan Gera. Ramires equalised for the visitors with an impressive dipping strike early in the second half, before substitute Cesc Fabregas netted his second goal for the Blues with a stunning individual effort nine minutes from time. Check back on Sportsmail's live minute-by-minute coverage here. Ferencvaros: Dibusz, Bonig, Bode, Gyomber, Gera, Busai, Nagy, Nalepa, Cukic, Pavlovic, Mateos. Chelsea: Cech, Azpilicueta, Christensen, Zouma, Luis, Mikel, Ramires, Schurrle, Willian, Torres, Drogba. Host commentator . Thanks for following our live coverage of Chelsea's 2-1 win in Budapest against Ferencvaros. We saw a couple of great goals on a decent night for Jose Mourinho's side. Next up they face Real Sociedad on Tuesday at Stamford Bridge before opening their Premier League campaign against Burnley. That's that. Chelsea win their final game of their pre season tour - coming from behind at the break. Ramires and Cesc Fabregas grabbed the goals in an excellent second half for the Blues. The only downside was Didier Drogba's injury and we await further news on that. Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa link up - the playmaker finds Costa and puts him in on goal but the dinked finish goes narrowly wide with the 'keeper floored. We enter stoppage time at the end of the game. Victor Moses plays with his marker down the right and crosses it left footed. Oscar and Fabregas were both flying in for the header and the latter couldn't divert it past the 'keeper with the pair completely unmarked. Another brilliant strike! Fabregas brings the ball in from the right wing and some brilliant dribbling takes him on a run past three defenders before he slots it past the 'keeper. It's his second goal of pre season and he looks more than ready for his Premier League return. Great ball control, tidy finish. Nine minutes left and Chelsea lead. Ake instantly goes close with a header. Marco van Ginkel on for Mo Salah - who himself had come on as a replacement at half time. Nathan Ake on for Kurt Zouma . Eden Hazard is back - a trademark drop of the shoulder takes him round the outside of the full back and he slides the ball across the box. Sadly Oscar can't quite reach it and the chance is wasted. Any touch = goal. 20 minutes left at the Groupama Arena. Chelsea are well on top and the hosts are struggling to cope with the rise in tempo. Looks like the Blues substitutes have had the required effect. The Nigerian winger replaces Azpilicueta on the field. He'll need to impress here to get into Jose Mourinho's thoughts - or those of another manager considering a move. How did that not go in?!? Fabregas delivered the ball into the box and Cahill flicks it onto the post and then Ivanovic couldn't quite knock in the rebound with the 'keeper sprawling. Then the hosts run straight up the other end and they have a two-on-one but they waste the opportunity. Nemanja Matic comes on for John Obi Mikel while Eden Hazard replaces Ramires. Hazard moves in to the No 10 role. Oscar should have put Chelsea ahead there. He latches on to an excellent Ramires through ball but he can't do it justice and his hesitation ruins the chance. Looks like Eden Hazard is the next replacement coming on. Two subs combine: Gary Cahill is unmarked in the box and directs Cesc Fabregas' corner at goal with a stooping header but it's well saved by the substitute 'keeper. Fantastic finish from the Brazilian! A deflected Mo Salah cross comes to Chelsea's No 7 on the edge of the box and he blasts a dipping finish into the 'keeper's top corner! He took the ball down with an exquisite touch before swinging his left boot at it to level the scores at the Groupama Arena after 51 minutes. LOADS of changes at the break for Chelsea. Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Mo Salah, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Mark Schwarzer replace Fernando Torres, Andre Schurrle, Filipe Luis, Willian, Andreas Christensen and Petr Cech. Didier Drogba looked the brightest he has so far for Chelsea but Jose Mourinho will be worried about his injury that could reduce him to just two fit strikers. The Ivorian hurt his right ankle coming down from an aerial challenge but tried to continue before leaving the field of play. Andre Schurrle has looked good, showing pace on the right flank to stretch the defence but he has so far been unable to provide the ammunition to Fernando Torres since he moved central. That's it for the first half. Chelsea not overly impressive and they trail courtesy of Zoltan Gera's 17th minute goal. They started brightly but have since faded. More concerning though was Didier Drogba limping off injured with just eight days til the Blues kick off their Premier League campaign. Andre Schurrle has been the best player in Blue and he's only supposed to be half-fit - expect a few changes from Mourinho at the break. It's a bit of a Raheem Sterling moment here. Willian goes down and Schurrle bends in a brilliant free kick from 25 yards out. It looks like it goes nestles in the back of the net but on the replays it actually hit the stanchion and ended up behind the goal. False alarm. Daniel Nagy goes down under a challenge from Filipe Luis in the Chelsea area and claims for a penalty. The referee waves away his protest though and replays show it was a good tackle by the Chelsea new boy. Meanwhile, Gary Cahill, Cesc Fabregas and Branislav Ivanovic are warming up on the touchline. Cesar Azpilicueta drives a shot wide for Chelsea - bit of a rarity there. And it has Eden Hazard doubled up in laughter on the bench as it zips wide of the goal. Didier Drogba hobbles off towards the bench now - boot off and he can't continue. Brazilian midfielder Oscar replaces the veteran striker. Looks like Torres will go into the No 9 role now. Drogba's back on but he doesn't look comfortable. You'd imagine Jose Mourinho wouldn't risk him carrying on in a friendly if it's serious though. Didier Drogba is down injured inside the Ferencvaros box. Let's hope it's just one of his playacting routines. There didn't look to be much contact with the 'keeper but he turned his ankle as he landed from an aerial challenge. Not great - by all standards. It must be difficult for the former Liverpool man out of position on the left wing - but here's another comical vine as he knocks a ball out for a throw in. Jose Mourinho doesn't look best impressed... Former Fulham and West Brom man Zoltan Gera gives the hosts the lead at the Groupama Arena. A simple finish well executed as he tucks home a cross with Kurt Zouma caught ball-watching. Drogba's at the heart of everything here for Chelsea - he finally looks fit after some mixed appearances as a sub previously in pre season. This time he gets away from his marker but he doesn't hit the shot cleanly from the edge of the box and it's easily gathered by the 'keeper. Close! Drogba hits a cross after drifting out to the right wing but it's mishit and flies towards goal. Luckily Dibusz was there to tip it away. The game is opening up a bit now - Didier Drogba (deflected) and Andre Schurrle both have efforts beaten away by Denes Dibusz in the Feren goal. Pretty low key start from both sides so far. But Ferencvaros look to have had the best chance with Daniel Nagy blazing over a decent opportunity eight yards out. To partially save his embarrassment the linesman has his flag up. The home side get the game underway at the Groupama Arena. We're not far from the 7.45pm kick off now. Victor Moses is among the Chelsea substitutes - he's sporting the No 18 shirt. How many appearances is he likely to get this season? Jose Mourinho will be taking this seriously - but probably not as seriously as the Hungarians. Their president is here for the opening of the new stadium, and they've just had their air force flying overhead. With the young Belgian pretender still out with a minor injury niggle, Petr Cech has another chance to show what he can do in goal. Here he is taking a cross from Mark Schwarzer during the warm up. The big news from Budapest is that Didier Drogba makes his first start since returning to Chelsea - and the big man will lead the line alongside Fernando Torres. Other summer signings Filipe Luis and Kurt Zouma both also start while 18-year-old Andreas Christensen is in Jose Mourinho's line up too. It's already looking busy at the brand new Groupama Arena.","Blues are opening the new stadium in Budapest on last stop of their tour .

"At least two of the three babies whose skeletal remains were found in a filthy Massachusetts home may have been alive 'for some period of time', a court heard today. Both bodies were found wearing diapers and one-piece infant outfits in closets in the vermin-infested Blackstone home, assistant district attorney John Bradley said at a pretrial hearing for Erika Murray in Uxbridge District Court. Murray, 31, has been held without bail since her arraignment last month on charges of fetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child. Scroll down for video . At least two of the three babies whose skeletal remains were found in a filthy Massachusetts home of Erika Murray may have been alive 'for some period of time', prosecutors said in court. Pictured: Murray enters the courtroom for her arraignment at Uxbridge District Court earlier this month . Ramon Rivera III, boyfriend of Erika Murray, in Uxbridge District Court today. Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains, but faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the home's basement . She did not appear in front of the judge, who set her bail at $1 million. Murray’s attorney Keith Halpern said she is spending about 23 hours a day in isolation for her safety. In August the state Department of Children and Families removed four children ranging in age from six months to 13 years from Murray's home in about 50 miles southwest of Boston along the Rhode Island border. They were discovered after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's house and asked for help in quieting a crying baby. The state Department of Children and Families removed four children ranging in age from 6 months to 13 years from Murray's home in August after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's house and asked for help in quieting a crying baby . After interviewing the older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house, where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroom . The neighbor found the youngest child, a six-month-old covered in feces and a three-year-old child. Neither child has birth records and both are severely malnourished  - the infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds. Today Bradley told the court both of them are developmentally delayed, reports CBSBoston. 'The pediatrician determined that the two had been profoundly neglected. 'The muscle tone of the three-year old was such that it appeared she had spent most of her young life on her back,' said Bradley. Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts . Emergency personal in protective clothing fold a tarp on the street in front of a house where the bodies  were found . Blackstone code enforcement officer Bill Walsh said when he walked inside the smell was overwhelming, reports the Boston Herald. The second floor looked like a landfill and was 'unbearable.' He said the hidden upstairs were like 'jellyfish,' covered in feces and maggots surrounded by hundreds of dirty diapers. Murray arrived at the house and agreed the children should not live in the home, but did not seem to be upset they would be removed from her care and appeared more concerned about her cat which had disappeared. After interviewing the older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house, where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroom. After discovering those remains, police obtained another search warrant. Murray in court last month. She did not appear in front of the judge, who set her bail at $1 million . Murray is led out of the district court in Uxbridge, Massachusetts following her arraignment last month . During the second search, they found the remains of two other babies in another bedroom, also inside a closet. The state medical examiner is trying to determine whether they were newborns or fetuses. Murray's attorney, Keith Halpern, has said he believes Murray is suffering from a mental illness. Today the Boston Herald reported that Murray gave birth to her first child in 2001 after meeting her partner, Raymond Rivera who was seven years older, when they both worked at McDonald's. The young family lived with her parents, but when she became pregnant again aged 21 they moved to Rivera's sister's three-bedroom house in Blackstone and she moved out. Friends and family told the news outlet this is when Murray's mental health began to deteriorate. Wearing baggier clothes and not inviting people into her home, she became pregnant twice more, giving birth at the house - it was the bodies of those babies which investigators found. She then gave birth to two more children - the three-year-old and the six-month-old baby. Halpern says that he believes Murray secretly gave birth to those children because her boyfriend didn't want any more kids than the two they already had together, the 10-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl. Murray's boyfriend and the father of the children, Ramon Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains, but faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the home's basement . The basement of 23 St. Paul Street in Blackstone when investigators visited the home in late August . Initially Murray kept them hidden upstairs when Rivera, 37, was home. She told police that it was only in the summer she told Rivera and her two eldest children of their existence but insisted that she was babysitting them. He is thought to be the father of all seven children, but did apparently did not know he had two younger children, according to investigators. Today in court Halpern insisted it did not make sense that he did not know about the conditions in the house. 'There are parts of this story that make absolutely no sense,' said Halpern, reports CBSBoston. 'It makes no sense particularly given how small this house was, that he could've lived in this house and shared this bedroom and not realized that there were these two that shared the house with him.' Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains, but faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the home's basement. Prosecutors also said that the charges against Murray could be upgraded once a grand jury investigation concludes. The Blackstone Board of Health condemned the house where Murray, Rivera and the children lived and are planning to demolish it later this month. Investigators working in the small house had to wear hazardous material suits. 'The house is filled with vermin,' the prosecutor said in August. 'We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.' Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years. 'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.' She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch. Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad. The two older children are staying with a paternal grandparent, while the two younger ones are receiving medical attention under foster care.

"Elected: Sage Lovell, 16, of Marietta, was elected to her high school's homecoming court in an election believed to be the first of its kind in the state . An openly transgender Georgia teen was elected to her high school's homecoming court in an election believed to be the first of its kind in the state. Sage Lovell, 16, of Marietta, was elected to Walton High School's homecoming court among four other women chosen out of 50 nominees at the school. 'I couldn't stop smiling,' said Lovell told CBS 46, who said she heard word of her victory while in her homeroom class. 'My entire homeroom erupted in very loud cheering. Apparently it was able to be heard from across the school.' On Friday night, the Walton High School football stadium erupted with applause as Lovell and the three other women entered the field during the half-time homecoming ceremony. Lovell was escorted by her father, Joseph Lovell, who the MDJ reports has supported her journey of transformation. Lovell told the Marietta Daily Journal that she received support from her classmates following her nomination. 'I’m so flattered to be representing my school,' Lovell told the MDJ, 'to be, like, able to, like, just represent my entire junior class.' Lovell, who was born a boy, told CBS 46 that she realized she felt differently about her identity in her early teenage years. Lovell said that her transformation began with her believing she was homosexual and then progressed to her realizing that she was a female and not a male. This began when Lovell found herself attracted to men in the middle school and, in ninth grade, she came out as gay, Lovell told the MDJ. Scroll down for video .

'At this point, I can’t really tell,' Lovell said of the possibility of having a sex-change operation.

Farah, the double Olympic and world champion over 5,000m and 10,000m withdrew after missing a block of training with abdominal pains, but Radcliffe said he would be ‘kicking himself’ after Caleb Mwangangi Ndiku and Moses Kipsiro won gold in his absence.

The BBC pundit, who ranks winning Commonwealth 5,000m gold in Manchester in 2002 as one of her career highlights, said: ‘It’s been a tough season for Mo because he hasn’t been injured, he’s been ill, and that’s when the doubts start to creep in, but hopefully he will be fine for the Europeans. ‘He wasn’t sure he was in shape to come and run in Glasgow, but I was surprised he took the decision to pull straight out of the 10,000m. I thought he might give himself a bit more time. ‘The Commonwealths are important - they were massive for me. In Glasgow I looked at the likes of David Rudisha as someone who’s not quite where he wanted to be in terms of fitness but still risked it and he acquitted himself well. ‘Rudisha, though, didn’t have the back-up of the European Championships next month, which will be much easier races for Mo. They were tougher races in Glasgow with Kipsiro (who won the 10,000m) and Ndiku, the 5,000m winner. But I’d have loved to have seen Mo run and he would have been watching that 10km kicking himself a little bit because Cameron Levins was in contention. Mo trains with him and beats him in training.’ Radcliffe mentors young athletes such as Laura Weightman, 23, who won Commonwealth 1,500m silver, and Jessica Judd, 19, the 800m runner who finished fourth in her first senior championship final. She believes the next generation can use the experience as a springboard for success in Zurich. Joy: Radcliffe ranks winning Commonwealth gold in Manchester in 2002 among her proudest achievements . Champion: Farah won the 5,000m and 10,000m at the London 2012 Olympics and 2013 World Championships . ‘They can use it as a platform, definitely,’ said Radcliffe, 40. ‘That’s what I said to Jess: “You’ve had a huge performance and it’s something to build on”.’ British Athletics performance director Neil Black has not set a medal target for the Europeans, which start on Tuesday, August 12, but the competition will be deemed a failure if Britain do not improve on the seven medals - four gold - they won in Helsinki in 2012 with a weakened team before the start of the London Olympics. Adam Gemili, who won silver in the 100m in Glasgow, will also run the 200m, while the British team will be boosted by the inclusion of James Dasaolu and Dwain Chambers in the 100m. Dasaolu is the second-quickest British man of all time but was not selected by England for the Commonwealths after opening his season late. Katarina Johnson-Thompson, 21, is expected to be fit for the long jump. Double world junior champion Morgan Lake, 17, will also contest the high jump, while Matthew Hudson-Smith, 19, who anchored England to Commonwealth gold in the 4x400m relay, is the fastest ranked man in the individual 400m field for his first senior championships.

"Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps has temporarily retired from the sport to attend rehab after his second DUI charge. His eyes were 'red, bloodshot and his speech was mush mouth' when officers pulled the record-breaking multiple gold-medalist over in his white Land Rover at 1.40am on Tuesday. According to a police statement of the incident, Phelps showed signs of intoxication, smelled of alcohol, and couldn't walk in a straight line. Scroll down for video . Rehab: The record-breaking Olympic gold medalist will take time away from the pool to attend a program, he told his 1.6m Twitter followers after receiving his second DUI following an eight-hour casino session . Revealed: He tweeted followers this morning to explain why he is stepping aside after the arrest and charge . Today, the 29-year-old took to Twitter to apologize to his 1.6 million followers, and reveal that he is 'going to take some time away to attend a program'. In a series of tweets, he wrote: 'The past few days have been extremely difficult. 'I recognize that this is not my first lapse in judgment, and I am extremely disappointed with myself. 'I’m going to take some time away to attend a program that will provide the help I need to better understand myself. 'Swimming is a major part of my life, but right now I need to focus my attention on me as an individual, and do the necessary work to learn from this experience and make better decisions in the future.' It is the second time he has been arrested and charged with DUI. The first incident was in 2004. Reports claim Phelps had arrived at the Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore, Maryland, at 5pm on Monday afternoon. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, he was pulled over. He told Maryland police he had 'three or four drinks' and had just left the 'Horseshoe'., referring to the casino a few miles away. When officers asked the 29-year-old to walk heel to toe in a straight line, he had 'difficulty with his balance.' Then when he was asked to stand on one leg, Phelps told police 'that's not happening'. A later breathalyzer revealed Phelps had a blood alcohol level of .14, which is well over the state's  limit of .08. The website TMZ reported that the swimmer had been gambling at the Horseshoe Casino, arriving at around 5pm on Monday afternoon. He sat in a VIP gambling room for several hours before leaving at about 1am, a casino source told the website. 'Earlier this morning, I was arrested and charged with DUI, excessive speeding and crossing double lane lines,' Phelps tweeted on Tuesday afternoon. Phelps said that he understood the severity of his actions and took full responsibility for them . After winning 18 gold medals, two silver and two bronze medals at Olympics in Athens, Beijing and London, Phelps announced his retirement following the 2012 Olympics - but he then came out of retirement in 2014 . 'I understand the severity of my actions and take full responsibility. I know these words may not mean much right now but I am deeply sorry to everyone I have let down.' He was also was charged with excessive speed and crossing double lane lines within the Fort McHenry Tunnel in his hometown of Baltimore. Police say he was driving 84 mph in a 45 mph zone. It was the athlete's second DUI arrest. In 2004, at the age of 19, he was arrested for DUI and received 18 months probation. The then 19-year-old Phelps was arrested near Salisbury University  and charged with DUI, DWI, violation of a license restriction and failure to obey a stop sign. He was also made to pay a $250 fine and ordered to pay court costs of $55. 'I recognize the seriousness of this mistake,' Phelps told a judge in 2004 as 100 spectators looked on. 'I've learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my life.' After winning 18 gold medals, two silver and two bronze medals at Olympics in Athens, Beijing and London, Phelps announced his retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps apologized Tuesday afternoon - his second such apology. In 2004, at age 19, the swimmer was sentenced to 18 months probation after pleading guilty to driving drunk in Maryland's Eastern Shore . Phelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time and has an astounding 22 medals from three Summer Games, including 18 gold. When he was last arrested for DUI, he announced 'I've learned from this mistake' But in April 2014, at age 28 Phelps announced his plans to come out of retirement and return to professional competition at age 28, setting himself up to compete at next summer's world championships and at Rio in 2016. Phelps said one of the reasons he returned to swimming was because it gave him a structured schedule, and he was bored in retirement. 'It's good to have some structure back in my life,' Phelps said in July. 'That's how I've always been. That's something I need. 'I was happy to get that year and a half where I did whatever I wanted, went wherever I wanted. I got that out of the way, and I'm happy to have this back.' A later breathalyzer revealed Phelps had a blood alcohol level of .14, which is well over the state's limit of .08 . Michael Phelps parties poolside with friends in the Bahamas in 2008. The swimmer and 18-time gold medalist has been known to let his hair down when away from the pool . A spokesman from USA Swimming said: 'The news regarding Michael Phelps and his actions are disappointing and unquestionably serious. We expect our athletes to conduct themselves responsibly in and out of the pool.' In 2009, a British tabloid published a photo of Phelps using a marijuana pipe in South Carolina a few months earlier. A sheriff said there was not enough evidence to charge Phelps with a crime, but he agreed to the suspension by USA Swimming. In the wake of the photo's release, Phelps said he 'used bad judgment and it's a mistake I won't make again.' In April 2014, at age 28 Phelps announced his plans to come out of retirement and return to professional competition at age 28, setting himself up to compete at next summer's world championships and at Rio in 2016 .","Swimmer tweeted fans to apologize: 'this is not my first lapse in judgment'

"Police have today renewed warnings about the dangers of trespassing on railway property after a man died of horrific burns after he grabbed onto power lines while trying to graffiti trains in Brisbane last night. The 26-year-old suffered a massive electric shock and 90 per cent burns to his body when he grabbed onto the lines carrying 450,000 volts. Queensland Police are investigating the shocking incident which took place at a  railway yard on Lofter Street in Tennyson, south Brisbane. The 26-year-old man touched one of these train cables at the railway shunting yard  in Tennyson, south Brisbane on Saturday night . The incident happened in Tennyson and the trespasser was from the Greenbank suburb of Brisbane . The Greenbank man entered the rail shunting yard about 8.30pm last night with a 19-year-old friend and the pair were trying to graffiti train carriages. The 26-year-old climbed onto one of the carriages, he raised his hands and touched electrical wires and he then suffered an electric shock. A Queensland Police spokesman said: 'While scaling a container car he brushed against the wires, suffering deep thickness burns to 90 per cent of his body.' Police said the man was taken to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital for life-threatening burns but later died of his injuries. Queensland Rail (QR) is helping police with their investigation and they told ABC that the site is leased the site to rail freight company Pacific National, which was responsible for security in the area. Daily Mail Australia tried to contact Pacific National without success and QR said they would not be making any comments on the incident due to the police investigation. Police have renewed warnings for people not to trespass on railway property after the latest tragedy . Regional duty officer Inspector Daniel Bragg renewed warnings about the dangers of trespassing on the railways during a press conference this morning. This incident comes two months after the death of another man linked to graffiti on Brisbane trains. Inspector Bragg told the media that emergency crews were already at the scene when police arrived and staff at the shunting station saw a flash or flame, they found the man sitting on top of the carriage. The man's friend who he entered the shunting yard with called emergency services. Police say railway shunting yards are 'dangerous places' and warned people to stay away from them . Inspector Bragg said: 'It's just a terrible, terrible thing and police hate going to jobs like this and the sad thing about it is this could be so easily avoided. 'Railway lines and railway shunting yards are very dangerous places - police are often called to jobs where people have been injured or killed on properties like this. 'You don't have to actually touch the lines to be electrocuted. You just have to be in close proximity. 'The message here is quite simple: don't go near train lines,' reports ABC. The man's friend is currently assisting police with their enquiries as they continue to investigate the incident.","A 26-year-old man was killed when he grabbed onto power lines at a railway yard in Brisbane, Queensland .

"Manchester United face the threat of a return to the days of ‘Green and Gold’ protests as impatient supporters grow increasingly angry at what they see as a lack of investment in the squad by owners the Glazer family. With just over 10 days left in the transfer window, Louis van Gaal’s squad remains dreadfully short of the quality it needs if the Dutch manager is to steer the club back towards the top of the Barclays Premier League. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward still hopes to conclude a deal for Sporting Lisbon central defender Marcos Rojo, while United hope that Angel di Maria can be tempted from Real Madrid despite the fact they cannot offer him European football. They are also talking to Ajax about Holland utility man Daley Blind. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United target Di Maria in a spat with Ronaldo . Bad result: Manchester United lost their opening game of the weekend against Swansea City on Saturday . Unhappy fans: Sections of the Old Trafford faithful could protest against the Glazer family against QPR . Protest: Manchester United fans remain far from happy with the club's owners the Glazer family . Displeased: Louis van Gaal knows he needs to add to his squad before the transfer window slams shut . The club’s fans, though, are furious that the most important season in recent times has begun with United thrashing around for new players when they were led to believe all key business would be concluded shortly after the World Cup finished at the start of July. Now a growing group of supporters will see what happens over the next week or so before planning a possible protest at Old Trafford when United face QPR on September 14. That would be the first game after the transfer window closes, with some fans talking about a return to the ‘Green and Gold’ campaign that was a feature of anti-Glazer feeling back in 2010. Dissent has grown rapidly in the wake of Saturday’s dismal home defeat by Swansea and social media has been awash with #GlazerOut messages over the weekend. Sean Bones, of the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust, said: ‘United supporters worldwide have hit out in huge numbers against the Glazer family’s ownership of Manchester United via Twitter and Facebook. ‘It’s obviously something that will be a huge concern to the current sponsors who have invested a lot of money in Manchester United as a brand. ‘There will be a lot of attention to see how the New York Stock Exchange views the negative reaction by supporters in terms of the Glazers’ handling of United.’ While some United supporters blame Woodward for United’s failure to land players this summer, others blame Van Gaal’s predecessor David Moyes, who led the team to seventh last season after inheriting a team of title winners from Sir Alex Ferguson. Transfer target: Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo is closing in on a move to Manchester United . Blame game: Manchester United's executive vice-chairman has failed to land top targets this summer . Beneath all that, however, lies ongoing resentment towards the Glazer family; vast numbers of United fans firmly believe the current problems are the result of years of under-investment by the Americans. It was sobering for followers of the club with the largest turnover in British football to see a Premier League opening weekend featuring a host of big-name, expensive players who have signed for other clubs over the summer. United have signed two expensive players — midfielder Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw — for more than £50m but Woodward is now facing the tricky obstacle of a lack of Champions League football as he tries to lure the really big stars to Manchester. Woodward has said he is confident that the history, size and tradition of United will prove enough when it comes to attracting new players. However, the case of Di Maria throws that into doubt. The Argentina winger knows Real need to raise money through sales and also that he may not command a first-team place at the Bernabeu this season. You can Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page, here. Summer signings: Manchester United have brought in Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw so far this summer . Wanted man: Manchester United are keen on bringing Real Madrid's Angel di Maria to Old Trafford . Di Maria has told friends that United’s weekly wage offer is the highest he has received from any club, yet he is unsure about whether to join a club that has no place in the only European competition that really matters to the truly stellar names these days. Inside the corridors of power at Old Trafford, there is no panic yet as the club still has more than 10 days to bring in players. Van Gaal has tried to remain phlegmatic in public, saying that it ‘only takes 24 hours’ to sign a player. However, it is understood the United boss is already irritable and anxious about the matter and fears he may end up signing players beneath the required quality simply because he needs numbers in his squad. Saturday’s game saw him start without nine players who are injured and he has subsequently lost young midfielder Jesse Lingard to a lower leg injury that saw him leave hospital on crutches.

"A Melbourne couple could be charged for giving their three-year-old son medicinal cannabis who was suffering from hundreds of life-threatening seizures a day. Under doctor's supervision, Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace use cannabis oil to treat Cooper's severe epileptic seizures as he did not respond to any other medication. However Victorian police raided the family's Mernda home, north-east of Melbourne, and seized all the supply - leaving his parents fearful that they will lose their son. Meanwhile, there are more than 100,000 patients who legally access prescription cannabis in the US with 285 of them being under the age of 18. And there's also a burgeoning market which provides 'weed for kids'. Scroll down for video . Cooper would suffer from hundreds of life-threatening seizures a day if it wasn't for his medicinal marijuana . The three-year-old contracted  meningitis a month after he was born which left him with severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy . His parents Rhett Wallace and Cassie Batten had their Melbourne home raided by police. Cooper's supply of cannabis tincture was seized . Upon receiving treatment through medicinal cannabis, Cooper's seizures have significantly reduced from hundreds a day to just two or three. Although Cooper was born a healthy child, one month later he contracted meningitis which left him with severe epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Cooper's marijuana oil, which is put into his milk before he is fed, has removed the ingredient which drug users get their high from. His parents are certain that  if it wasn't for the cannabis tincture their son wouldn't be here today. 'Without the cannabis oil we wouldn't have our son today,' Mr Wallace told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program. 'We would be visiting him in a cemetery. 'We know that without the cannabis tincture – that's a death sentence to Cooper.' Cannabis oil is put into Cooper's milk and fed to him throughout the day . Cooper's parents believe that without medicinal marijuana, their son wouldn't be here today . But according to the Australian law, Mr Wallace and Ms Batten's only chance to save their son is seen as illegal. 'I understand that we're breaking the law but we're doing it to save out son,' Ms Batten said. 'We're not doing it out of pleasure, we're doing it because we have to.' The pair, who have no criminal history, say they shouldn't be treated like criminals. 'We're not criminals, we're simply trying to save our child,' Ms Batten said. The distraught mother also revealed on Sunday Night that she may have her son taken away by authorities after receiving increasing phone calls from the Department of Health Services. 'That's our biggest fear' Ms Batten said. 'Are they trying to say that we're not caring for him, we're not meeting his needs when doctors said that they've seen the opposite. That they've seen improvement with this treatment.' And while Australia continues the ongoing debate for legalisation of medicinal marijuana, Colorado - one of the 23 states in the US which permits cannabis use for patients - is meeting the high demands of weed for kids. There are more than 100,000 patients who legally access prescription cannabis in the US with 285 of them being under the age of 18 . There is a burgeoning marijuana business in Colorado, US . Colorado - one of the 23 states in the US which permits cannabis use for patients - is meeting the high demands of weed for kids . Cannabis cultivator Joel Stanley and his growing what's called Charlotte's Web which is specifically for intractable epilepsy . Cannabis cultivator Joel Stanley and his brothers are growing what's called Charlotte's Web, reported 60 Minutes. The strain - which is named after Charlotte Figi who's severe condition changed the laws in Colorado - is specially grown for 100s patients with intractable epilepsy. 'Most of those cases are paediatric cases,' Mr Stanley said. 'It's quite controversial - weed for kids. That's what we grow it for.' Mr Stanley explained that Charlotte's Web has a low dose of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and more cannabidiol (CBD). 'It is low in THC which makes it hemp strength,' Mr Stanley said. Although there are no studies which prove that medicinal cannabis for children is safe in the long term, there are 8000 others on the waiting list to get their hands on Charlotte's Web. They include Australian mother Sally White, who is considering moving to the US for her daughter. Australian mother Sally White is among the 8000 people on the waiting list for Joel Stanley's medicinal marijuana . Ms White is considering moving to the US so she can legally obtain cannabis to treat her daughter's seizures . 'It's ridiculous. There are other children who are taking medical marijuana through illegal means,' she said. 'We don't want to do that...our only option is to go to America.' Her 16-month-old daughter Zahlia was diagnosed with Aicardi Syndrome - a rare genetic disorder - at 12 weeks of age. She, like Cooper, suffers from daily seizures. 'What do you do? Do you watch her seizure until she dies?' Ms White asked. Ms White, like Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace, believes medicinal marijuana can save her child's life and she want the Australian government to act now before it's too late. 'Being a politician, they would do something if it was their kid,' she said. 'But they obviously don't have sick kids.'","Melbourne couple Cassie Batten and Rhett Wallace fear they may lose their son Cooper .

"For the first time since 50,000 Geordies hissed their deafening disapproval and forced him to retreat to his dugout, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew returned to St James’ Park. After five minutes he made his first tentative steps into the technical area which had been the scene of his public persecution three months ago. Given the sedate setting of a pre-season friendly, however, he escaped a repeat of such vitriol. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Newcastle have greater attacking threat - Pardew . Embrace: Managers Alan Pardew and Jagoba Arrasate greet each other before the game . Delight: Moussa Sissoko celebrates scoring the only goal of the game for Newcastle on Saturday . Tussle: Massaido Haidara and former Real Madrid midfielder Esteban Granero fight for the ball . It had been during the 3-0 victory over Cardiff in May – Pardew’s first game back on the home touchline following his ban for butting Hull’s David Meyler — that supporters had turned on him. Has the passage of the summer and the arrival of nine signings won Pardew a reprieve? Does he feel relations have been repaired? We do not know, for the club are refusing to allow their boss to speak to the press, and therefore the fans. He did offer — via his programme notes — that he was happy with the ‘healthy’ nature of his squad. But that team barely raised a pulse during a subdued and sodden 90 minutes which left fans pining for the start of competitive action. That comes on Sunday when champions Manchester City visit St James’, and only then will we get a measure of fans’ forgiveness. For the feeling on Tyneside is that they remain ready to turn, regardless of new investment. Pardew, though, is happy with the £35million backing from owner Mike Ashley this close-season, as he wrote: ‘We came up short at times last season, but everyone has worked hard to ensure we have a team that will represent this great club in a fitting manner over the coming months, and I’m relishing the prospect of what lies ahead. Slide: Yoan Gouffran slides in for a tackle during the first half against Real Sociedad . Pain: Yoan Gouffran goes down after a heavy challenge during Newcastle's final pre-season friendly . Escape:  Haidara skips away from Carlos Martinez during the match at St James' Park . Tackle: Granero puts in a tackle on Haidara, not something the creative midfielder is renowned for . Transfer: New signing Remy Cabella goes in for a challenge rather tentatively . ‘The squad we have assembled is healthy in terms of numbers, experience and quality and that is all any manager can ask for when he is looking ahead to a long and arduous marathon.’ Long and arduous was one way to describe yesterday’s friendly. For even by pre-season standards it was a tedious affair. Moussa Sissoko was the match-winner following a dreadful performance which was about as far removed as imaginable from his impressive showing at the World Cup with France. With two minutes remaining Gabriel Obertan attacked the by-line and drew back to Sissoko’s unmarked feet on the edge of the area. Given how he had performed until that point, those in the Gallowgate End would have been forgiven had they ducked for cover. But Sissoko kept his composure and produced the game’s one moment of quality, tucking into the bottom corner with authority. Next Sunday against City should feature five full debutants from their summer splurge but Pardew can afford no bedding-in period with those new faces. The pressure will be on from the off and, unable to communicate with the fans except via sanitised, official outlets, his existence could again be a lonely one should results not go his way. Skipper Fabricio Coloccini certainly feels the arrival of new faces has reinvigorated a squad which, in light of Yohan Cabaye’s £20m sale in January and no subsequent investment, had grown disillusioned with the direction of the club. VIDEO Newcastle have greater attacking threat - Pardew . Manager: Pardew will be hoping for a better season than last, which trailed off in the second half . Forward: Emmanuel Riviere signed this summer from French side Monaco . Battle: Former Manchester United midfielder Gabriel Obertan tussles with Yuri Berchiche . Celebration: Sissoko after scoring his side's 88th minute winner, Gabriel Obertan assisted the goal .

The 23-year-old brings guile and energy to a side sadly lacking in both departments last season and he could well be the next player to use the Magpies as a launchpad to greater things. In the meantime Pardew will be looking to Cabella — and the likes of former Ajax captain Siem de Jong and Holland defender Daryl Janmaat — to win him a few friends among the Toon Army. For while he is unhappy with the silence imposed upon him by the club’s hierarchy, should the home fans remain equally muted when he returns to his technical zone against City, Pardew will be a relieved man.","Pardew was back in the home dugout for the first time since he was booed by fans in May .

"Arsene Wenger is quick to interject. The question is about Arsenal’s increased spending power, having signed Mesut Ozil for £42million last season, Alexis Sanchez for £35m this summer, as well as Mathieu Debuchy, David Ospina and Calum Chambers. ‘Let’s not go overboard,’ said Wenger, interrupting. ‘We are more comfortable but we are not Manchester City.’ Sunday's opponents in the Community Shield are the eternal reference point for the clubs who once ruled the Premier League before the era of Russian oligarchs and energy-rich states upset the established order. VIDEO Scroll down to find out more about Arsenal and Manchester City's new signings . Hey big spender! Alexis Sanchez has jetted into Arsenal this summer as their transfer fees top £50m . Splash the cash: Arsene Wenger has eventually loosened the sizeable purse string at the Emirates . It is City who are the Premier League champions and the new force in English football. They are also a constant irritant to Arsenal. It is not just the procession of players who have gone there for better money and trophy-winning prospects: Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy, Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Adebayor (ingloriously) and now Bacary Sagna. There is even an Arsenal influence over the management at City in Brian Marwood and Patrick Vieira. The old jibes about being a feeder club are still raw and relevant. ‘Well, Sagna just left for City, so you can’t say those days are over,’ says Kieran Gibbs when asked if the days of City dominating Arsenal might be past. ‘But you would think from the signings we have made...’ He doesn’t finish the answer but it is put to him that players should believe they can achieve their ambitions at Arsenal. ‘You would hope so,’ says Gibbs. Big spenders: Calum Chambers (left) moved to Arsenal from Southampton for £12million . It is seemingly always a definitive season of late because performances were lacklustre for so long. Wenger has his rehearsed and very reasonable defence for that. ‘The real pressure was first of all to keep the club financially capable to pay back the debt [for the stadium] and for that we needed to be in the Champions League,’ he said. ‘If I write my book I’ll explain why that was the real pressure.’ Arsenal scrambled across the line to win the FA Cup. Hull almost did for them in the final. You could say they demonstrated the mental strength that has been lacking over the years, or that the FA Cup papered over the cracks more easily seen in dreadful hammerings by Liverpool and Chelsea. Jack Wilshere is under pressure to deliver and there will still be departures, as Thomas Vermaelen’s £15m transfer to Barcelona proved. But Gibbs tries to sum up what a trophy can do. ‘The ceiling is higher. You just feel more responsible and more mature because you’ve actually gone through quite a lot to get your hands on it, so you realise what it takes. I think the whole squad realises.’ In or out: Wilshere is not immune to being sold by the club, and there could still be departures this summer . The aim: Manchester City won the Premier League last season, their second title in three years . A holding midfielder — maybe Sven or Lars Bender or William Carvalho — and another striker would make them more credible title contenders. But key men are already in place. Debuchy replaces Sagna; Chambers, at centre-back today, is an exciting and youthful addition; Ospina is a keeper to challenge Wojciech Szczesny while Sanchez could be the star striker craved since Robin van Persie’s exit. ‘Alexis is like an animal in training,’ said Gibbs. ‘He doesn’t stop running. That is what we need. We can’t just sign a superstar and say, “Ok we’re going to win everything”.’ Training against him, says Gibbs, is ‘not the best day you’re going to have; he’s a top player who will bring something extra’.","Wenger says the club are not like Manchester City despite spending big .

"Mastermind: Virgin Atlantic pilot Mark Entwistle was jailed for 14 years for orchestrating a £30m scam . A Virgin Atlantic pilot who blew 'prodigious sums' in Las Vegas casinos while masterminding a £30million mortgage fraud has been jailed for 14 years. Innocent families had to leave their homes in and around Windsor, Berkshire, after they were unwittingly caught up in the scam by 47-year-old Mark Entwistle. He and three accomplices tricked top lenders including RBS into issuing mortgages on other people's houses. In one case they managed to take out five mortgages on a single property. But instead of investing in homes, Entwistle  funded a high-rolling lifestyle which included a platinum membership at Vegas casinos Bellagio’s and Caesar’s Palace . Entwistle, an established property developer living in Windsor, also frittered away the cash on a luxury boat and paid off other debts - 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' - as the housing crisis tightened in 2009. He even blew vast sums on the gambling website Betfair, Southwark Crown Court heard. Entwistle recruited Jonathan Gilbert, 45, to act as his solicitor and mortgage brokers Nicholas Pomroy, 58, and Matthew Robinson, 40, to process the sophisticated frauds. The four men were jailed for 34 years between them after a six-month trial as Judge Martin Beddoe branded Entwistle ‘arrogant and greedy, brazen to the last with no expression of remorse'. The judge told him: ‘This trial has been nothing but another gamble for you but the odds have proved to be too long this time. ‘Between 2005 and 2009 a substantial and sophisticated fraud was committed against banks and other lenders, some 14 of them or so. ‘The fraud was for the benefit of you, Mark Entwistle, orchestrated by you and Jonathan Gilbert and assisted in some ways by Mr Robinson and Mr Pomroy. ‘Only a small amount was ever used for the purposes of the loan, and it was often a case of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. Partners in crime: Entwistle, 47 (left) recruited Jonathan Gilbert, 45 (right) to act as his solicitor in the complex four-year fraud, which left innocent families in the Home Counties having to move out of their homes . ‘A great deal of money was blown on your excesses Mr Entwistle, to keep up the vague pretence to your friends and others of what a rich and successful man you were.' He added: 'This was very well orchestrated, professional offending over a long period of time, using and abusing the identities of others. 'This is a story of arrogance and greed. ‘You may be a good pilot and had a great vision for the development of properties in and around Windsor but none of that exceeds your arrogance or greed. ‘You thought you were better than anyone else and you were unable to get over the need to show off your entrapments of wealth. ‘When it was all falling apart you could so easily joke with Mr Gilbert - you were cynical to the last. ‘You were dishonest and had no compunction but to lie and defraud. Ever since the enquiry in mid-2009 by lenders and the enquiry of Thames Valley Police in 2010, you have continued in the same vein and lied’. Spree: Entwistle had a platinum membership at the Las Vegas casino Caesar's Palace, the court heard . The court heard Entwistle and Gilbert fleeced RBS and Northern Rock out of more than £6million, using variations on the name Rigby Group to secure illegal mortgages between 2005 and 2009. At first the money was genuinely used to redevelop property and sell it on at a profit, said prosecutor Michael Shorrock QC. ‘As time went by, however, he began to raise finance by fraud,' said Mr Shorrock. ‘The loan applications would state that loan funds were to be used to refinance or purchase or develop a particular property.' When mortgages were approved, Gilbert did not tell the Land Registry about other mortgages on the property, tricking lenders into thinking they had more legal rights and collateral than they did. One house in Ascot, Berkshire, was remortgaged five times for more than £3million pounds and has since been demolished. In other cases the gang took out mortgages on properties already owned by unconnected people, who had no idea of the loan until the lender told them payments had been missed. One family had to move out of their £1.5million home for three years after building society bosses arrived to repossess it. Caught: Matthew Robinson, 40 (pictured) helped process the fraudulent mortgage applications. He was jailed for five years after he was found guilty following a six-month trial. The judge branded him 'inherently dishonest' The alarm was finally raised in July 2009 when Wilmett Solicitors in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where Gilbert was a partner,  was wound up due to the debts with the loss of 70 jobs. Gilbert was banned from practising as a solicitor in the same year, but his fellow partners faced financial ruin when they were saddled with the liability. During the police investigation, it emerged paperwork held by Gilbert at the solicitors’ firm had been destroyed. But investigators established Entwistle had netted just over £30million over four years, with the loss to today’s money lenders calculated at £17,798,939. He had paid Gilbert by giving him an American Express card which he used to buy holidays to New York, Sardinia and New Zealand. Entwistle also paid the rent on Gilbert’s home in Windsor, Berkshire, allowing him to live there for free. Con: Broker Nicholas Pomroy, 58, who 'deliberately told lies and made up figures', was jailed for three years . The ringleader was sentenced in July, but the fraud can only be reported now after a court order was amended. He was jailed for 14 years after being convicted of 21 counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of conspiracy to launder criminal property. He was acquitted on one count of conspiracy to commit corruption. Entwistle's right-hand man Gilbert, of Penarth, South Glamorgan, pleaded guilty to 18 counts of conspiracy to defraud and was jailed for 12 years. The judge said his crimes were 'as bad a breach of trust as it could get'. 'Inherently dishonest' Robinson, of Richmond, Surrey, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of four counts of conspiracy to defraud and one of conspiracy to launder criminal property. And Pomroy, of Baughurst, Hampshire - who 'deliberately told lies and made up figures that were untrue' - was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for three years. Two other defendants - Philip Barker, 47, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, and Shon Williams, 48, of  East Grinstead, West Sussex - were cleared of all counts after the trial. Both were acquitted by the jury of involvement in any conspiracy to defraud or commit corruption. Detective Chief Inspector Mick Saunders, of Thames Valley Police, said today: 'Fraud is not a victimless crime. 'Testimony was heard in court about the stress suffered by some whose homes seem to have been sold from underneath them, those who lost life savings and investments and those who lost jobs due to the callous and predatory actions of Entwistle and those who worked with him. 'This organised gang defrauded millions of pounds and I am pleased with the prison terms handed down to them. 'I hope their time behind bars will give them the opportunity to reflect on the pain and misery their actions have caused. 'We continue to investigate their financial affairs to bring Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against them to ensure they do not benefit from their crime.' Treat: Gilbert was handed an American Express card which he used to travel to New York as payment . One couple first learned of the fraud when bailiffs arrived on their doorstep in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, telling them their £1.5million home would be repossessed. The husband and wife had to take their 12-year-old son out of school and move in with their in-laws for three years when the house became caught up in legal wrangling. The knock on the door came in mid-2007 from a Birmingham Midshires Building Society representative. 'He said he was here about a repossession,' said the wife, who asked to remain anonymous. 'They came because the mortgage had not been paid by Rigsby... He said the owners were Rigsby. I said ""What are you talking about? We are the owners"". 'I didn’t know what was going on. I thought we were going to be evicted from our house.' Once the problem was reported, fraud teams quickly began investigating the case, but that did not prevent the family’s problems mounting. They were unable to sell their home as they had already planned, because it was caught up in the case. Instead they had to rent it out to try to save money. That meant moving nearly 80 miles away to stay with in-laws in Littlehampton, West Sussex. 'It has caused us five years of turmoil,' she added. 'It was a big relief at the end because it was a lot of stress.' Her husband, a semi-retired IT manager, said of Entwistle: 'I don’t think he actually thinks he’s done anything wrong. It really impacted on our lives.'","Mark Entwistle and accomplices drew mortgages on other peoples' homes .

"The Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips has compared having her baby to having a horse - because they both need feeding schedules. The royal has confessed not being very maternal before having her first child Mia in January and admitted her return to work was harder than she expected. The 33-year-old, who married ex-England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011, was speaking to CNN Equestrian about becoming a mother and her career since becoming a parent. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips with baby Mia (left) and on her horse High Kingdom (right). The royal has compared her daughter to a 'high performance horse' She said: 'I've really enjoyed it. In a funny kind of way it's like having another high performance horse on your hands. 'You've got to get them in a schedule and feed. I wasn't maternal at all before I had Mia but I'm lucky she's very good.' 'I sat on a horse about five weeks afterwards for about ten minutes. I was teaching my muscle groups again what they were doing - you know I've never not ridden for that long.' And just eight and a half months after the birth of her daughter, who is 16th in line to the throne, she took part in the showjumping at the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games in Normandy, coming 11th. It wasn't the first time she was spotted juggling being a new mother with her eventing. In June she and her husband Mike Tindall took baby daughter Mia - pronounced My-ya- to the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Former England rugby centre Mike Tindall, pictured her pushing his daughter's buggy, while Zara competes . Zara lifts the hat out of her daughter's eyes as she's held by her sister-in-law Autumn Phillips while at the driving range as Mike Tindall hosted golf event in May . Tindall took over watching their daughter - who they named for no other reason than 'they both liked the name' so that Zara, daughter of Princess Anne, could compete at the event. She told CNN that their daughter had been on the road with her and 'it fits in really well'. And little Mia Grace got the chance to watch her father in action - although this time on the driving range rather than the rugby pitch - back in May when she was four-months-old. Tindall was hosting the event in support of Rugby for Heroes and the On Course Foundation at the Celtic Manor Resort, Newport, Wales. He is a patron for the charity and hosted the tournament to raise money for the cause. Zara, who lives at her mother's Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire, was the first senior member of the Royal Family to sell photographs of her new baby to a celebrity magazine – for a reported fee of £150,000. At the time of going to print in March, senior officials at Buckingham Palace were not made aware of the lucrative deal with Hello Magazine in advance. Less than two months after her birth on January 17, Zara arrives with Mia (pronounced My-ya) at Kingsholm Stadium to watch Mike Tindall playing rugby . The couple, pictured at the Hambledon Horse Trials in Oxfordshire in April, say that Mia Grace is 'very good' The royal has confessed that she was not very maternal before having her first child  and admitted her return to work was harder than she expected . The equestrian revealed to the American cable network that she felt 'a little bit glum' after walking away with a silver medal at the London Olympics in 2012, and she she is intent on getting a gold in 2016. The former world eventing champion was the first member of the Royal Family to win an Olympic medal as part of Team GB. Her mother presented Zara with her winning medal at the celebrated event in London. She also said her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who is still riding horses at the age of 88 had been a massive influence on her career. She added that her love and passion for horses has filtered down through the family. The couple have previously revealed that they would like their daughter to follow in their mother's footsteps and already have a Shetland pony lined up for her to learn to ride on. Zara has no Royal title or taxpayer funding and earns a living as a professional equestrian, funding her stables through sponsorship deals with firms including Land Rover and Rolex.

"Dejan Lovren pauses as he carefully considers the question. He has been talking about his journey to Liverpool, from Zagreb to Southampton via Lyon, but has now been asked to revisit the life-shaping events of his childhood. Lovren, Liverpool’s new commanding £20million defender, was born in Zenica, a small town in the former Yugoslavia. When the Bosnian war erupted, his father, Sasa, and mother, Silva, made the decision one night in 1992 to flee to Germany with him and his brother, Davor. A year later, on April 19, 1993, as the conflict spiralled out of control, a market place in his home town came under fire from heavy shelling: 15 people were killed and another 50 seriously injured in what became known as the Zenica Massacre. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dejan Lovren sign and train for new club Liverpool . New beginnings: Dejan Lovren joined Liverpool from Southampton in a £20million deal this summer . ‘I don’t know what would have happened if we had stayed,’ says Lovren. ‘I think somebody would have been killed – I don’t know. It was horrible in that time. I think in 1992 my parents took the decision and said “we don’t have a choice anymore.” ‘My father and mother’s parents were already in Germany so we were the last to go. They literally took their bags, one little car and went to Germany. It was difficult for my parents to leave the country after they had been there for 27, 28 years. ‘They said “come on we need to go to Germany”. You don’t even speak German, you know nothing about the country so you are going like a blind man. And with a three-year-old child like me to take too, it was really difficult for them at that time. ‘After seven years in Germany the situation calmed down. We went back in 1999 (they were sent back as they did not have the right paperwork). But, you know, I think this is what gave something to me; made something stronger inside me. It showed me that this life is never easy.’ Difficult childhood: Lovren and his family were forced to flee to Germany during troubles in his homeland . Humanitarian mission: The UN in Bosnia in 1993 after conflicts in the former Yugoslavia spiralled out of control . If his life in Germany ended in sour manner, that was the country were his dreams took flight. Lovren supported Bayern Munich and would regularly take the subway to stand outside Sabener Strasse, Munich’s fabled headquarters, hunting for pictures and autographs. ‘I had my photos taken with Giovane Elber, (Mario) Basler, (Bixente) Lizarazu… I had all these pictures in my room,’ he recalls. ‘I would go to the training ground to see them. It was the best. ‘I was a normal child, playing with the kids. It was only when Dinamo Zagreb wanted to sign me that I felt I had a chance. I now sign autographs every time. I know what it means for a parents to see their child smiling after the autograph. Nobody should mind giving up 10 minutes.’ Dejan Lovren is not the only Balkan player to have thrived in the Premier League. Below are 11 players that grew up in war-torn Balkan countries and have gone on to shine in England's top tier. Asmir Begovic (Bosnia) - Portsmouth, Stoke . Vedran Corluka (Croatia) - Man City, Tottenham . Nemanja Vidic (Serbia) - Man United . Dejan Lovren (Croatia) - Southampton, Liverpol . Branislav Ivanovic (Serbia) - Chelsea . Luka Modric (Croatia) - Tottenham . Lorik Cana (Albania)-  Sunderland . Aleksandar Kolarov (Serbia) - Man City . Nikica Jelavic (Croatia) - Everton, Hull . Edin Dzeko (Bosnia) - Man City . Mladen Petric (Croatia) - Fulham, West Ham . Hero: As a youngster, Lovren would go and have his picture taken with Bayern Munich stars like Giovane Elber . Happy to stop: Having queued to meet the likes of Bixente Lizarazu and Mario Basler, Lovren enjoys taking time out to sign autographs and pose for photos with fans . ‘You will earn everything with work,’ he adds. ‘I said to myself “I don’t want to live my life like this”. My parents gave me everything they could but it was not amazing. Maybe it was better to happen like this than to have a (privileged) childhood when you don’t know the real life.’ Do not discount the effort it has taken to get where he is. From the 100-mile round trips he would take from Karlovac to Zagreb as a teen, to fighting off critics in France after his €10m move to Lyon – “they always questioned me” – Lovren is not going to be fazed by the task that awaits on Merseyside. He is only 25 but the maturity and clarity with which Lovren speaks shows why Brendan Rodgers wanted to make him the most expensive defender in Liverpool’s history; the leader who could fill the chasm in Liverpool’s defence since Jamie Carragher retired. After scoring in the 4-0 win over Borussia Dortmund, Rodgers called him 'perfect' and one aspect which so impressed was how vocal he was; that may seem a small point but it is significant as Carragher departure saw an end to orders being bellowed from the back at Anfield. Best possible start: Lovren is congratulated after scoring in Liverpool's friendly win over Borussia Dortmund . ‘Brendan said to me because he has seen me as a leader,’ Lovren explains. ‘I said to him “I’m still young.” But I will try my best. I will lead the team. I don’t have so many experiences like Jamie Carragher but I think it will come with time. ‘I said also it’s a great honour to be compared with a legend like him. I have a lot of time in front of me so I will just keep working and it will come one day. The first step, inevitably, sees him face Southampton. He had a successful year on the South Coast and, out of respect, he is reluctant to comment on what has unfolded with so much change but does he have regrets? ‘Yes maybe, a little bit,’ the Croatia international replies. ‘But I said also to them that I want to leave because Liverpool is a massive club and maybe I will have this chance just one time in my life. I didn’t want to see the chance going. ‘Maybe it was a difficult relationship but, at the end, everybody agreed and that’s most important. I shook their hands, said goodbye so now it is finished. It was destiny (to play them). I will just have to concentrate on my game and I won’t think about Southampton. This is a new beginning.’ Once in a lifetime opportunity: Lovren poses next to the European Cup at Liverpool's Melwood training ground .","Dejan Lovren was forced to flee to Germany as a child after the Bosnian war erupted during the early 90s .

"Rain in Manchester appeared to come as a shock at Old Trafford on Friday when a stretch of outfield that could not cope with an hour’s downpour forced the abandonment of the second day with England starting to pull away from India. Lancashire faced anger from spectators who had seen the drainage system which enabled the bulk of the playing surface to recover from a heavy shower fail in one ugly, relaid area of the outfield that remained stubbornly unfit for play. It is an embarrassment for Lancashire, who prepared the best pitch of this series only to see the elements expose the inadequacies of the Old Trafford facilities and hold up England’s attempt to move into a winning position. VIDEO Scroll down for Stuart Broad's six-wicket blitz puts England in command . On top: Joe Root is unbeaten on 48 for England as they lead India by 85 runs with four wickets in hand . Opening out: Jos Buttler is also in the middle, on 22, as England looked to build a lead before rain interveneed . Holding the bat up high: Ian Bell acknowledges the crowd after reaching his 42nd Test fifty for England . Delay: Joe Root (right) and Jos Buttler (left) leave the field after rain stopped play not long after lunch on Friday . Rain which stopped play 35 minutes after lunch had cleared seemingly in time for two more hours of play but umpires Marais Erasmus and Rod Tucker were unhappy with a saturated area at the Statham End. It emerged that construction work earlier this year had caused turf to be relaid in front of the media centre in April and it had not bedded down in time for this Test. Cue a scarred area of sandy turf, a frustrated crowd, a black mark for Lancashire in highly competitive times for Test match grounds and red faces to match the Red Rose. It was left to Mike Watkinson, the lugubrious Lancashire director of cricket, to offer the case for the defence of an Old Trafford ground that suffered a similar controversy during a Twenty20 game against Australia five years ago. ‘We’ve had a massive downpour and this is an area used for construction purposes,’ he said. ‘It’s got high-performing drains but what it hasn’t got is turf knitted together over the years like the rest of the outfield. If we’ve got anything wrong it was to go with the waterhog instead of letting it drain naturally. It looks a bit of a mess, we accept that. ‘You hope people look at the cricket that’s been played and the quality of the pitch rather than five metres of a sandy puddle that affected an hour’s cricket.’ Waterlogged: The downpour in Manchester left the Old Trafford outfield looking like a reservoir . Dark skies: The clouds stopped above Old Trafford and unleashed a rain storm down on to the outfield . That may be so, but with terrible weather forecast for Sunday, the drainage and outfield will be tested to the full and the time already lost could prove significant in what has become an absorbing fourth Test. There seemed no way back for India from eight for four after just half an hour on Thursday but on Friday they ensured that England face a fight if they are going to emerge from Old Trafford with at least a share of this series guaranteed. Only when Joe Root and Jos Buttler began to take advantage of some curious tactics by MS Dhoni after lunch did England look likely to build the decisive first-innings lead that had looked assured when their bowlers ran riot on day one. Clearly the fall of Gary Ballance in the last over of the first day had lifted India and they stayed in contention on Friday, albeit without gaining the swing enjoyed by Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, until that heavy rain arrived. Chris Jordan, who took just one wicket in the Indian innings, had been handed the perfect chance to prove his batting worth as nightwatchman and signalled his intent by hooking Pankaj Singh aggressively for four. Celebration: India players congratulate Varun Aaron (second left) after he dismisses Moeen Ali (second right) Out the ground: Moeen Ali was clean-bowled by Varun Aaron as India took three early wickets in Manchester . Jordan managed two more boundaries, even though one of them was inside-edged narrowly past his stumps, until he middled another pull from Bhuvneshwar Kumar and was athletically caught by a diving Varun Aaron at mid-wicket. Ian Bell then moved to his 42nd Test half-century before he was undone by the skill of Kumar. First Bell’s outside edge was defeated and Kumar then took the same edge with the next ball with Bell expecting an inswinger. Moeen Ali (right) looked to take on the short ball, pulling Kumar for successive fours that gave England the lead, but the ball after he had uncertainly steered Aaron for two he was stuck on the back foot and bowled by a prodigious inswinger. Enter Buttler in vastly different circumstances from those which marked his debut, but he again showed his vast potential by knuckling down with Root in an unbeaten partnership of 67 that was beginning to flourish before the rain. The pair were helped by some odd tactics by Dhoni which included bowling Ravindra Jadeja both just before and after lunch when conditions were crying out for a burst from his seamers. It enabled England to move into a lead of 85 that could prove decisive — if the drainage system allows play to resume on Saturday. GOLD TRAFFORD . Ian Bell’s belligerent 58 continued his love affair with Old Trafford, where he has made 608 Test runs at an average of 76. Among batsmen who have played a minimum of six Test innings here, only Allan Border (416 runs at 83) and Denis Compton (818 at 81) average more. SINGH'S LONG WAIT . India seamer Pankaj Singh has now conceded 258 runs without taking a Test wicket, sending down 384 balls in the process. But he has some way to go before he breaks the record of India’s Amritsar Kripal Singh, who waited 651 deliveries for his first Test wicket.","Ian Bell reached 42nd Test half-century for England during morning session .

Wilshere, who has started both of Arsenal’s opening two games, said: ‘They’re Germans and they’ve got fantastic mentality anyway. Last year we saw that. They’re great characters to have in the dressing room and great players as well. We’re looking forward to getting them back and it’s going to make our squad even stronger. ‘We have worked all year. We were in and around the top and in the end we fell away but we worked really hard to be in the top four. ‘We always want to be in the Champions League to attract players who want to play in the Champions League. We have players at the club who have to play in the Champions League. So we know it’s a big game and we’ll treat it as a cup final in the second leg.’ Big difference: Jack Wilshere is confident Arsenal's returning German's willmake the squad stronger . Wenger described Ramsey's red card in Istanbul as 'unbelievable'. The Welsh midfielder, who apologised to fans via Twitter after the game, will serve a one-game European ban and misses Wednesday’s match. Wilshere defended Arsenal’s conduct against Besiktas, saying: ‘I don’t think the tackles crossed the line. That’s always going to be the type of challenge you’d expect in a match of this type. We put in some as well. It was a fair game and the ref did a good job. ‘It was harsh to send off Aaron but in the rule book that’s how it is. Two minutes after he did it, someone did it to me and didn’t get booked. That’s the only problem sometimes — with consistency. But I suppose in the rule book it is a booking.’ VIDEO Ramsey red card unbelievable - Wenger .","Mikel Arteta ruled out for two games after spraining ankle .

"A woman who has been charged with bestiality after police found footage on her mobile phone of her allegedly having sex with a dog has returned to her Queensland home. Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug, the Courier Mail reports. The 25-year-old arrived home and exited the black sedan, clutching a red bull can and dressed in a black singlet, pink shorts and black thongs. Jenna Louise Driscoll has been charged with three counts of bestiality, along with charges of trafficking and possession of a dangerous drug . The 25-year-old returned home with an unidentified man and a dog . Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos which allegedly show her having sex with a dog . Driscoll appeared at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday . Driscoll was accompanied by an unidentified man, who exited the car along with a dog, and was dressed in a red shirt and black shorts and had a backpack. The dog,  believed to be a pitbull terrier, climbed the stairs to Driscoll's cream coloured residence, where neighbours say she has lived for some time. Driscoll entered her house and remained for a very short amount of time, before leaving with the man in the sedan. Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos, and appeared at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday. ‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland. ‘Under the Animal Care Protection Act bestiality isn’t included. To take action and remove the dog we would have to prove actions there were cruel or that it was tormented.’ ‘The RSPCA would ideally like to get a dog out of the situation if bestiality was happening, but to operate under the act we would have to prove those two things.’ ‘We’d try to do everything we can to help the dog if that is the case.’ Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. She was granted bail but will have to report to police once a week and live at an apartment at Enoggera, south-west of Brisbane. Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends. Text messages showed that Driscoll had arranged for 113 grams of the drug to be sold for $1,150 and on another occasion 85 grams for $900, according to Sgt Pearson. It was when police were investigating the text messages they located the videos of Driscoll allegedly having sex with the dog. She will reappear in court in December.

"Meet the Sydney artist having a crack at our politicians. Jenna Bloom has been busy painting the faces of Australia's  leaders for her new satirical exhibition Pollie Cracker. The stencil artist has drawn inspiration from comments and  opinions  by politicians that have made waves on social media for being controversial. 'Everyone has strong opinions and I started to notice that quite a bit on social media,' Ms Bloom told Daily Mail Australia. Sydney artist Jenna Bloom has been busy painting the faces of Australia's leaders for her new satirical exhibition Pollie Cracker . 'I'm quite a sarcastic person and I thought the exhibition would be a good way to the information people are putting out there into imagery.' And no politician is safe from Ms Bloom's can of spray paint. Among those who have made the satirical cut including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Treaurer Joe Hockey, Clive Palmer, Education Minister Christopher Pyne, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. This cardboard painting of Prime Minister Tony Abbott as a homeless man is one of Ms Bloom's favourites due to its social context . Former NSW Premier is painted on a goon bag after he publicly resigned after lying about a $3,000 bottle of wine he received . 'I mainly focused on them because they're the ones in the media spotlight at the moment. Some of their statements, for whatever reason, have been quite controversial,' Ms Bloom said. Scott Morrison's face has been painted onto a welcome mat because of his role as the Immigration Minister in stopping asylum seekers from coming to Australia via boat. Education Minister Christopher Pyne is featured sitting on a chair in the 'naughty corner' and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was painted with her head in the sand due to her stance on climate change. Ms Bloom drew inspiration from comments by politicians that have made waves on social media for being controversial, like billionaire Clive Palmer pictured here as a walrus . Scott Morrison's face has been painted onto a welcome mat because of his role as the Immigration Minister in stopping asylum seekers from coming to Australia via boat . Former Prime Ministers Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, who infamously toppled each other from Labor's leadership have been painted on tombstones . 'But the Tony Abbott piece with him as a homeless person is my favourite. I live in Kings Cross and regularly see people begging for money to survive. I always feel an immense amount of empathy for them and I was trying to depict if there was any empathy in politics?' Ms Bloom said she wasn't trying to push an agenda with her artwork, just prompt discussion. 'I just want people to get a laugh out of it and then make up their own minds,' she said. Ms Bloom painted Christopher Pyne sitting on a chair in the 'naughty corner' for his role as the Federal Education Minister . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been painted with 'her head in the sand' for her position on climate change . This artwork by Ms Bloom earned her a finalist spot in the Stencil Art Prize 2014 . US President Barack Obama will make a brief appearance in Ms Bloom's exhibition as the only international politician. Mr Abbott reportedly gifted him a surfboard . 'I really do think people will see the humorous side. You make a joke, but not everyone is going to laugh.'

"Martyn Rooney anchored Great Britain's 4x400 metres relay team to gold as the favourites fulfilled their potential in breaking the three-minute barrier on the final day of the European Championships. Having seen their female compatriots win bronze and Chris O'Hare finish third in the 1500m earlier in the afternoon, the British quartet ensured they would top the podium at the Stadion Letzigrund. Conrad Williams, Matthew Hudson-Smith, Michael Bingham and Rooney were charged with bringing the baton home and did not disappoint in the Zurich sunshine.

Bringing it home: Martyn Rooney (front) guided Great Britain to gold, running the final leg . Williams - one of the three in action to have featured in the triumphant England team at the Commonwealth Games - produced a sturdy first leg, handing the baton over to Hudson-Smith at the front of the pack. The teenager, fresh from winning individual silver on Friday, followed it with a strong leg which was matched by Bingham, who handed over to anchorman Rooney in second place. Taking the confidence brought by Friday's gold medal - his first at a major championship - the 27-year-old powered past the Russians, crossing in a Europe-leading two minutes 58.79 seconds. 'I can't believe what's happened,' Hudson-Smith told the BBC. 'I just can't. It's been a hell of a journey. I'm enjoying it and it's fun.' Changing hands: Hudson-Smith (third right) passes the baton to Bingham (centre) at Zurich . Relay team-mate Bingham added: 'When Matthew first came into the team we were trying to make sure the environment was good for him. 'But what he did was chilled the whole environment out and that allowed us to keep the same camaraderie between the team - and win gold.' Those comments echoed the thoughts of the women's 4x400m team, who had considered a protest against Ukraine until viewing the video with the track referee. 'It's really great to be part of this team and to come back after the 400m hurdles final and give a good performance,' Eilidh Child said after adding relay bronze to her 400m hurdles title.

"Watching Barcelona train on Luis Suarez's first day back at work at the weekend several things were apparent. One, that Suarez had lost none of his sharpness. Two, that Barcelona's intensive passing drills remain a sight to behold. And three, that Alex Song looks anything but out of place pinging the ball one touch between the flying tackles, to team-mates Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi. Song has become a figure of fun since his switch to the Nou Camp last summer - last week he even managed to injure new goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen in training. VIDEO Scroll for Alex Song on Arsene Wenger's 1,000th game . Fooling around: Alex Song (centre) play fights with Barcelona team-mate Dani Alves (right) in training . On the move? Barca are looking to offload Song on either a loan or permanent deal this summer . Preparation: Song has been busy training for the new season but did not play a minute of Barca's final friendly . It was the first thing of note he had done all pre-season but despite the strange two-year sabbatical in Spain it would be a mistake for Arsene Wenger or any other Premier League suitor to believe he no longer has what it takes for the Premier League. The first joke came in his presentation when he was introduced as someone who could operate just as well in the centre of defence as in midfield. The punchline was that even he didn't believe that. The fact that he could not play in the centre of defence meant he would only make it into the first team ahead of Sergio Busquets and the Spain midfielder's name is practically chiseled in stone in the Barca first XI. That remains the case despite a poor season and World Cup. On the few occasions Song has played he has done nothing wrong. But that is not enough at Barcelona. Doing nothing wrong will not keep you in the team, only doing something spectacularly right will, and he has not managed that. Favourite: Song has found it almost impossible to take Sergio Busquets' place in Barca's starting XI . Exit: Song is not needed  after the summer signings of Ivan Rakitic, Thomas Vermaelen and Jeremy Mathieu . Tito Vilanova tried to, without success, use him at the back, Tata Martino liked his strength and energy and even considered playing him and Busquets in the team but a change of system was too radical an idea. Now new coach Luis Enrique has taken a look at his squad and decided he has no use for Song. The hint was dropped in spectacular fashion on Monday night when Barcelona used 22 players and Song was the only one who never got so much as a minute on the pitch in the final friendly of pre-season. Busquets will play again this year and now that Barcelona have signed some central defenders Javier Mascherano can also operate in midfield. Song is even further down the queue. Experienced: Song provided a physical presence in Arsenal's midfield before his move to the Nou Camp in 2012 . New boy: Barca signed Song for £15million but he has failed to command a regular starting spot since . His signing was a mistake. Barcelona didn't need him and he has wasted two years of his career but in every training session in that two year period his first touch, vision and speed of pass will have been improved. He cannot fail to have taken something from 24 months alongside Xavi and Andres Iniesta. He remains a fine athlete, a strong runner, a driving force from deep and he has polished his passing on the training pitches of Barcelona's Joan Gamper Sports City, if not at the Nou Camp. Premier League tested he would not be a gamble. He would be expensive, which is why Barcelona are struggling to sell him, but for any team lacking in the centre of midfield, he might just be worth it.

"Having got shot of one undeniably talented but possibly unhinged centre forward, Liverpool are now close to recruiting another who offers even greater chance of fireworks. Quite literally. Mario Balotelli’s return to the Premier League is on the cards, with Brendan Rodgers seemingly changing his mind over the former Manchester City striker who brought drama by the rocket load during his previous spell in England. But is the only player in world football with more baggage than Luis Suarez really what Liverpool need? VIDEO Scroll down for Mario Balotelli scores and still manages to row with team-mate . Get ready for this: Mario Balotelli mocked up in a Liverpool kit ahead of his expected £16m move . Goal machine: Suarez had a stellar season and here celebrates scoring against Norwich . Giving the attack some bite: Suarez chows down on Branislav Ivanovic in 2013 . Suarez ultimately left Anfield without too much hand-wringing because of his tendency for chowing down on opponents and ambivalence towards racial slurs (as well as a £75million fee from Barcelona). While at City, Balotelli set off fireworks in his bathroom to accidentally start a fire that caused £200,000 worth of damage, threw darts at a youth team player for fun, and staged a mock sword-fight with a friend using a rolling pin during a late-night meal at a curry house that broke team curfew. His time in Manchester came to an acrimonious end as he threatened to take the club to a Premier League tribunal over their £340,000 fine issued for his extensive periods banned following red cards. In his last full season at City he missed 11 of 54 matches in all competitions through suspensions, including three Champions League games for a kung-fu kick on Dynamo Kiev’s Goran Popv. Do Liverpool really need another player with a proclivity for enforced absences as a result of on-field indiscretions? Super Mario: Balotelli left the Premier League in 2013, but could be on his way back with Liverpool . Enigma: Balotelli has played for both Inter Milan and AC Milan and is an extremely controversial character . Proven: Balotelli does have a very good goalscoring record and has shown his worth in the Champions League . Big stage: Balotelli netted twice against England at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil to hand Italy a 2-1 victory . Stats: Balotelli's Premier League record (via Opta) Their bid to take Balotelli initially on loan did include the potential for a ‘good behaviour’ clause, allowing a termination of the deal if the 24-year-old decided to strap a Catherine Wheel to a Yorkshire terrier – or some other such jolly. But that was slapped down by AC Milan and a permanent transfer worth some £16million has instead been accepted. The appeal for Rodgers is based on Balotelli’s ability with the ball and experience of the English top-flight and Europe’s elite competition. He is a beguiling presence, as his goal against England at the World Cup illustrated, and remarkably cool from 12 yards, missing not a single spot-kick at City. Steven Gerrard step aside. He scored 20 Premier League goals in 33 starts for City (21 appearances came from the bench) and has 26 Serie A goals in 43 games for AC. But, simply, the Italian does not occupy the same plane as his Uruguayan counterpart, which you imagine would need to be the case given his magnetism to mayhem. Flashpoint: Balotelli had a number of run-ins during his explosive relationship with Roberto Mancini . Discipline: Balotelli was sent off four times during his times at Manchester City, often at important times .

Premier League Discipline: 23 Yellow, 0 Red . Mario Balotelli . Premier League Apps: 54 . Premier League Goals: 20 . Premier League Discipline: 12 Yellow 3 Red . Suarez scored 31 goals in 33 Premier League games and linked up beautifully with Daniel Sturridge, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling. Before he bit Giorgio Chiellini those factors balanced out the bother. Bother is guaranteed with Balotelli, but is the rest? Ostensibly, he is a good guy with a wayward mind who will perform outrageous acts on the spur of the moment. But Rodgers will have to work hard to ensure the potential for unrest among the squad is worthwhile. Pictures would regularly surface of Balotelli going tete-a-tete with Roberto Mancini at training. Not an unfamiliar occurrence in general at clubs but the frequency clearly tired his manager, who had to intervene after one particularly ugly tackle by Balotelli on Scott Sinclair. Rodgers does not seem wholly convinced. He privately expressed reservations about the Italy striker's mentality and character during the club’s United States tour this month, saying: ‘I was asked the question about Balotelli last week and spoke about what a talent he is and excellent player he is. But I can categorically tell you that he will not be coming to Liverpool.’ Radamel Falcao, Samuel Eto’o, Loic Remy and Wilfried Bony have all been looked at but failed to materialize for various reasons so it seems Balotelli is a late – if not last – resort. With a player like him doubt can create cracks, and cracks produce ructions. Ructions are good for newspapers, but not exactly productive for a team embarking on their most important season in years. Couple: The Italian striker and his partner Fanny Neguesha in Miami over the summer . CAR CRASH (August 2010) Just days after signing for City, Balotelli hits the headlines after crashing his Audi R8 en route to the club's training ground. Balotelli was found carrying £5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police asked why, he reportedly replied: 'Because I am rich.' FIRST RED CARD (November 2010) Balotelli scored his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 win at West Brom but the achievement was marred when he was sent off following a clash with Youssouf Mulumbu. WILSHERE SNUB (December 2010) City boss Roberto Mancini said Balotelli must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of Jack Wilshere after beating the Arsenal midfielder to FIFA's Young Player of the Year award. DART-THROWING INCIDENT (March 2011) Balotelli again hit trouble after it emerged he threw a dart at a City youth team player. No one was hurt in the incident and he escaped punishment. SECOND RED CARD (March 2011) Balotelli apologised to his team-mates after being sent off during a Europa League tie with Dynamo Kiev for a reckless challenge on Goran Popov. BACK-HEEL BLUNDER (July 2011) Balotelli was immediately substituted by an enraged Mancini after performing a pirouette and back-heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against LA Galaxy. FIREWORK INCIDENT (October 2011) The Italian had another run-in with the emergency services after a firework was set off in the bathroom of his home, triggering a fire. The next day, he scored in the Manchester derby and celebrated by revealing a T-shirt which read 'Why always me?' THIRD RED CARD (November 2011) The third red card of Balotelli's City career arrived in a league match against Liverpool, the 21-year-old dismissed for two yellow cards. BREAKING CURFEW (December 2011) Balotelli broke a club 48-hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against Chelsea. RICHARDS CLASH (December 2011) Just days after Balotelli's curfew lapse, he again attracted negative headlines after pictures emerged of a training-ground bust-up with team-mate Micah Richards. PARKER CLASH (January 2012) Balotelli was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association, and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League match. INTER PRESS CONFERENCE (March 2012) Balotelli gatecrashed the press conference to announce the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as Inter Milan's new coach. FOURTH RED CARD (April 2012) Balotelli was sent off for two bookable challenges on Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. He was also guilty of a shocking knee-high challenge on Gunners midfielder Alex Song. CLASH WITH MANCINI (January 2013) Balotelli clashed with Mancini during training with the pair pulled apart by coaches.

"Poor old Bebe, supporters can be cruel. He’s one of those players for whom cheers are perhaps worse than boos, knowing as he must the irony that they carry. He was given what must have seemed to the uninitiated a nice reception when his place in Benfica’s starting line-up was announced. No-one else in his side came close to drawing such a reaction, and neither did any player in the Valencia squad. His £7million move to Manchester United in 2010, sight unseen, remains one of English football’s great curiosities. But here he is, recruited by a side who completed a domestic treble last season and who came within a penalty shootout of winning the Europa League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch United flop Bebe score two wonder-goals last season . Potential: Bebe never made a Premier league appearance for Manchester United, but played well on loan . Opener: Vanderley Dias Marinho, otherwise known as Derley, opens the scoring for Benfica against Valencia . For the 24-year-old it’s a fresh chance, an opportunity for this young man of tough origins to return to his homeland and get his career on to a positive trajectory. But he knows that with the riches of a stay at Manchester United he has also earned a certain amount of ridicule in this country. Of course, it’s faintly ludicrous and quite obviously unfair. He didn’t set the amount, he didn’t choose to be less than spectacular in four years at Old Trafford. His judgements were never the ones in question. But he will always be a figure of fun because he was a central aspect of a strange transfer that did not come off. And so it transpired at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday afternoon. His touches were cheered, none more so than at the end of the first half when he took possession on the right and left Carles Gil on his backside. His cross to Jara bobbled a touch but it was just about fine. Manager: Valencia head coach Nuno Espirito contemplates his side's performance as they go1-0 down . Transfer: Former Manchester United forward Bebe moved to Benfica for less than half what United paid for him . Escape: Goal-scorer Derley escapes the attentions of Valencia's Dani Parejo during their Emirates Cup match . Valencia (4-2-3-1): Rodriguez; Barragán, Vezo, Otamendi, Gayà; Guardado, Parejo; Feghoul, Gil, Piatti; Alcácer . Benfica (4-3-3): Artur; Cancelo, Lindelöf, Sidnei, Benito; Almeida Teixeira, Bebé; Jara, Derley, Candeias. That was the highlight; the rest acceptable. He swapped flanks a few times, occasionally taking the ball and getting up on his toes, jinking a little here, dropping a shoulder there. Then, as it looked like he might try something, he’d give a simple pass, usually backwards. No frills, no great effect. In all, he was neither good nor bad. But then no-one was, except perhaps Jara. He made Benfica’s opener by robbing a defender and squaring for Derley to finish. Pablo Piatti, also a fine player, hit the post at the other end, before Jara rattled the underside of the bar for Benfica. Bebe was part of the move, but only in a very minor way. He was cheered for his role, though. Handbags at dawn: Benfica's Sidnei goes head-to-head with Valencia's Antonio Barragan . Cushion: Andres Guardado celebrates scoring Valencia's third, giving his side a two-goal cushion . Jose Luis Gaya equalised in the second half for Valencia and Piatti then put them in front. Andreas Guardado, like Piatti, profited from Moraes Artur’s questionable goalkeeping and made it 3-1. And Bebe? He kept at it and had a shot blocked in the second half. His runs got a bit more purposeful and he actually linked up play quite well. But by the then the cheers had stopped, starting up again only when he was substituted in the 70th minute. Maybe he’ll come good in Portugal and shock everyone. Maybe.","Benfica lost 5-1 to Arsenal yesterday .

"Louis van Gaal celebrated his 63rd birthday on Friday. Next weekend, the next chapter in his life begins in earnest when Manchester United play Swansea City in the first Premier League game under his charge. Relatively elderly managers haven’t always fared well when working in England for the first time. Fabio Capello didn’t have the patience or inclination to learn English properly after a career in Italy and Spain. Sven Goran Eriksson used a chauffeur to ferry him about because he felt he was too old to learn how to drive on the left. VIDEO: Scroll down to see footage of United signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw . Getting his message across: Louis van Gaal is confident of success at United after taking over this summer . Jubilant: The 63-year-old says he will be active as United boss, and will drive himself to work, despite his age . VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . Van Gaal insists he won’t be a fossil. ‘I’ll drive myself to the training ground,’ he promises. ‘I have already driven in England, in 1996 in a brand new Mercedes 600 SL. ‘I was invited by the Umbro president and I drove myself. It’s an easy job! It is only a problem when it is late and there are no other cars there, otherwise you can just follow the car in front of you. ‘I think I’ll be able to adapt though I’ll only know for certain when the Premier League begins. Football is football everywhere and, I’m sorry, but I have survived.’ For all the warnings about Van Gaal being authoritarian and demanding, he cuts an affable and relaxed figure as he sits down with the Mail on Sunday ahead of the big kick off. He likes to intersperse his pantomime glares with plenty of smiles and laughter. Back to winning ways: United claimed the International Champions Cup on their pre-season tour of the US . Undoubtedly, he’s had an intense start to life at Old Trafford. Delayed by Holland’s run to the World Cup semi-finals, he’s been in his new job just three weeks and travelled nearly 15,000 miles in that time. A positive omen is the club have already won two trophies under his leadership; the International Champions Cup by beating Roma, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Liverpool in America, and the Manchester Senior Cup, in which 18-year-old striker James Wilson scored four goals in the final against Manchester City. Only two new players have arrived so far, Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera but Van Gaal doesn’t gloss over the fact that the team, who finished seventh last year under David Moyes, are short in certain areas. Luke who's talking: Luke Shaw admits it will be a dream come to true to make his Old Trafford debut . New signing: Ander Herrera (centre) was overwhelmed by Manchester United's support in the States . Interestingly, he does little to dampen speculation that he’d be interested in securing Real Madrid’s £55million winger Angel Di Maria and £15million Ajax wing-back Daley Blind, particularly after Barcelona secured the signing of Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen. Roma’s Kevin Strootman is a January target. ‘You cannot compare players how the players will do under the guidance of Moyes with those same players under the guidance of Louis van Gaal. Every trainer and coach and manager wants a different style of play and different tactics,’ he outlines. ‘Now we have five number 9s and four number 10s and we don’t have wingers to play attacking width, not at the highest level, of Ronaldo or Di Maria or something like that. So I have to play also in another way and you have seen that.’ ‘It’s a strategy of Manchester United to buy players who are on the way up and getting better, but I only buy when I think we need to.’ Heavenly: Van Gaal says United do not possess wingers as good as Real Madrid's Angel Di Maria . Physical challenge: Blind admitted that he would prefer La Liga to England, despite Van Gaal's interest in him . He acknowledges that could include one or two from the group of players he worked with as Holland manager. ‘If they are at the level I want them to be, then I will sign Dutch players,’ he states. ‘Dutch players are usually cheaper than players of other nationalities and they have usually been very well educated in the Netherlands, I believe. ‘But they have to be of a level than can play well in the English Premier League. You have to ask yourself if that is the case with every player.’ Much has been made of Van Gaal’s success in the past with young players, something in line with the United philosophy dating back to the Busby Babes and continued by Sir Alex Ferguson. Van Gaal won the Champions League with Ajax when Patrick Kluivert, Kanu, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf and Edwin van der Sar were emerging. At Barcelona, he gave Andres Iniesta and Xavi their big break. Lean on me: The United boss says he will look to his assistant manager Ryan Giggs for support this season . He’d like to do the same at United and will lean on assistant-manager Ryan Giggs on who deserves a chance. But he is also keen to stress the players have to be good enough as well as young enough. ‘Ryan Giggs is my assistant manager because I always want someone on my staff who knows and understands the culture of the club,’ adds Van Gaal, whose methods have won trophies in their bucketload at Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ Alkmaar. ‘Ryan has mentioned some players to me and I have seen some of them play in the matches. ‘I have one rule for young players; to get in my team they have to be better than the player they are replacing. ‘It isn't tough for me to put young players into my team. When they are better, they play. It's that easy. For me, age is not important and experience is not important. It is the ability of the player that is the important thing.’ The likes of Wilfried Zaha, Jesse Lingard, Nick Powell, Will and Michael Keane, and James Wilson will wait with baited breath to see if their chance comes this season or if a loan period elsewhere is required first. Impressed: Dutchman praises Rooney but insists physical training will carry on until first league game . The partnership of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie is one that neither Sir Alex Ferguson nor David Moyes got to grips with properly. Van Gaal knows Van Persie personally and with the Dutchman absent so far after a post-World Cup break, has got to see Rooney close hand. Before, Rooney has been a threat to Van Gaal’s teams, particularly in 2010 when Bayern played United in the Champions League semi-final. ‘I liked him when I was the manager of his opponent,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He is always working very hard, has a high level and can make goals. He did that in America, four goal in his first three matches is not so bad I think! ‘But we have to wait and see, we are now in the beginning of the preparation. The physical training will go on before our first league match.’ The hidden warning to Rooney could have come out of Ferguson’s mouth. The legendary United boss was occasionally irritated by the player’s fluctuating physical condition. Good luck: Van Gaal says former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has wished him all the best ahead of season . Fergie won’t be a overbearing presence to Van Gaal as he was to Moyes. The Dutchman says he will pick the Scotsman’s brains over coffee or dinner at some stage, but their initial communication has been brief and to the point. ‘He just wished me luck and that was it. It isn’t disappointing, it is normal. I did the same when I was in the same position as him. Ferguson was the consummate man-manager, getting good players to feel right about themselves and perform on the pitch. Moyes liked the coaching side of the game. Van Gaal’s strength is he can do both. A natural people person who nonetheless thinks a manager can orchestrate success through tactics. ‘The World Cup didn’t teach us anything new. Every system has been tried before in football. It’s how you prepare your team to do against the system of the opponents, that is the thing that always makes the difference.’","Van Gaal said he is impressed by Wayne Rooney but issued a veiled warning about player's physical condition ahead of the start of the Premier League .

"The man from the pools would come to the front door for your coupon every Thursday and then James Alexander Gordon would enter your home on the airwaves at tea time on Saturday. For 40 years, the wonderful, mesmeric Gordon would deliver what was potentially jackpot news to millions listening with pens poised, with that distinctive use of inflection that meant you knew the result before he had finished. On the BBC’s Sports Report, firstly on Radio Two and latterly on 5 Live, the way he delivered the score for the home team always offered a hint of what was to follow. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Gordon Alexander on reading classified results . Institution: James Alexander Gordon, who read the football results for 40 years, has died aged 78 . BBC radio football pundit and former England international Jimmy Armfield: ‘He really was something special. People used to mark the pools coupons with the football results. James knew that. He always gave them time to find out whether it was 1, 2 or an X for the football pools. ‘There was no satellite broadcasting, everything came down the line on the radio. He was the first point of contact for who had won. ‘James knew it all, he was the consummate professional, he seemed to pitch it just right.’ BBC match analyst Mark Lawrenson: ‘When James started out there weren’t 10 reporters at every game. You had to wait for him for the definitive result.’ BBC 5 live senior football reporter Ian Dennis: ‘For a generation of football lovers James’s voice was Saturday afternoon for the complete picture.’ He was the voice of football before Sky had 24 cameras at every game; before Twitter and talkSPORT, Jeff Stelling and the digital revolution that has given every fan a platform. Upon his retirement in 2013 because of the cancer that finally claimed his life on Monday, fellow broadcaster Mark Pougatch perhaps best summed up a very British footballing institution. ‘Even people who don’t even really like football knew who James was, even if they didn’t realise it,’ said Pougatch. ‘Such was James’s unique style of reading the classifieds, his wonderful inflections and stresses, that even non-believers of the sport knew the result after the home team’s score. ‘Nobody else will be able to say “Wolverhampton Wanderers” with quite such mellifluous tones. But enough of this ‘‘James’’. To those of us lucky enough to work at BBC radio sport, he is ‘‘JAG’’. And JAG is an institution, a legend and a gentleman all rolled into one.’ Gordon’s unique broadcasting style was actually inspired by his father. ‘Dad used to get really irritated by football announcers when he was filling in his pools coupon, because the intonation in their voices misled him,’ he once revealed in an interview. ‘So I decided to gather all the results on a Saturday before he’d checked his coupon and I would go into a cupboard with a torch and some kid-on radio equipment and read them out in a way I thought was more realistic. Unique: Gordon's inflection meant listeners knew the result after he had announced the home team's score . ‘When I did my first broadcast, dad cried and said: “The wee bugger’s finally done it”.’ The ‘wee bugger’ kept doing it for 40 years. He had what could only be described as a difficult childhood, even if Gordon would later insist it was a happy one. Born in Edinburgh in 1936, his mother died in childbirth and his adoptive parents had to contend with him contracting polio that left him paralysed and in and out of hospital until the age of 15. He limped for the remainder of his life. Amazingly, he also developed a speech impediment as a child but his father’s purchase of a radio led to Gordon’s fascination with speech. He would read Dickens and listen to the BBC’s Home Service, eventually becoming such a masterful orator that students in Sweden would be made to listen to him to perfect their English. He did not actually follow a specific football team. Opportunities to attend matches were rare, his father only taking him when he could convince a worried mother that he was well enough to go. Long-serving: Gordon joined the BBC in 1972 and continued until 2013 when Charlotte Green took over . Instead, he focused more on his passion for music and began his working life with record label Polydor. A career in broadcasting would follow. At one stage he worked as an announcer on Eric Morecambe’s radio show and in later years, Morecambe — one of his biggest fans — would often tease him with that famous tongue-twister scoreline: ‘East Fife 4, Forfar 5’. Gordon joined the BBC in 1972, taking over the reading of the results two years later. He was only on air for five minutes each week but what a special five minutes they were, particularly in those days before there were other means of discovering the football results. ‘In those days (before he read the results) it was funereal,’ Gordon once said. ‘So I thought I would make it more musical. I wanted to reflect the mood of results. ‘For instance, if Arsenal have lost I’m sorry for them, and if Manchester United won I’m happy for them.’ He never once missed a day because of sickness, even after retiring from the BBC 10 years ago and working every Saturday as a freelancer. He was eventually replaced by Charlotte Green in September 2013. James Alexander Gordon died at the Duchess of Kent Hospice in Reading aged 78. He is survived by his wife Julia, son David and two granddaughters.","James Alexander Gordon has died, aged 78 .

"Martin Kaymer would love to compete against Tiger Woods in this week's US PGA Championship, but hinted that the 14-time major winner would be better off taking a lengthy break from the game. Woods withdrew from the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational during Sunday's final round, the former world number one looking in severe pain from his back after hitting his tee shot on the ninth hole. The 38-year-old was playing only his third tournament since undergoing back surgery on March 31 and has yet to announce if he will able to play at Valhalla, the venue where he won the US PGA in 2000 in a play-off with Bob May.

'Obviously everybody wants him to be back at golf tournaments,' said Kaymer, whose eight-shot win at Pinehurst in June came without Woods in the field. 'If you win a big tournament without Tiger in the field you still feel very happy about it, but you want to play against him and it's nice if he's part of every tournament. 'He brings a lot of people into it. It has a different flair. When Tiger's playing in a golf tournament there's more entertainment and more people.

"Arsenal came from two goals down at Goodison Park to secure a 2-2 draw with late goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith had struck for Everton. Here, Sportsmail's Adam Crafton gives his opinion on his performance of the players. Everton - 4-2-3-1 . T Howard - 6 . Assured presence, fast off his line and smart save to deny Giroud. S Coleman - 7 . Few defensive lapses but relentless going forward and a belting header to open the scoring. Opener: Seamus Coleman popped up on the right-hand side to score Everton's first . P Jagielka - 6 . Saw off Sanchez with ease but Giroud offered greater problems. S Distin - 6 . Another dominant showing but should have seen the game out better. L Baines - 6.5 . Usual attacking flair as he rampaged forward and impressive defensively. J McCarthy - 7.5 . Athletic, dogged and influential in the midfield, setting a breathless tempo for his team. Slotted: And Steven Naismith popped up to net the second just before half time . G Barry - 6.5 . Glorious cross for Coleman's goal and a reliable shield in the front of the back-four. K Mirallas - 5.5 . Costly miss in the first-half when should have scored when clean through on goal. S Naismith - 6.5 . Infectious in his work-rate and a smart finish to put Everton 2-0 up. S Pienaar - 6 . Replaced by Leon Osman after just 10 minutes, who was his typical tireless self on the left-side. Strength: Arsenal's defence struggled to deal with the power of Romelu Lukaku throughout the first half . R Lukaku - 6.5 . Unstoppable run for the second goal but wasteful on the counter in second-half. Substitutes . Osman (for Pienaar, 10), McGeady (for Lukaku, 75), Joel, Besic, Atsu, Stones, Alcaraz. R Martinez - 6 . For 75 minutes, this was a powerful statement of Everton's intentions for this season. Martinez will be irritated that his side lacked the wit to close out out the game. Two draws to begin the season, both from winning positions. One back: Aaron Ramsey grabs the ball after scoring the goal that got Arsenal back into the game . Arsenal - 4-2-3-1 . W Szczesny - 5.5 . Exposed for both goals but little to do as Everton sat back in the second half. M Debuchy - 6 . Stirring battle with Mirallas but could have offered more when Arsenal attacked. C Chambers - 5.5 . Bright start at Arsenal but sold himself too easily as Lukaku charged through for Everton's second. P Mertesacker - 5.5 . Another victim of Lukaku's power and the German struggled on his Premier League return. Lacking sharpness: Mesut Ozil had a tough afternoon in his first game back for the Gunners . N Monreal - 5 . Fast asleep as Coleman stole in to score but great cross for Giroud's equaliser. A Ramsey - 6 . Tidy in possession and led the comeback as he nipped in to pull one back. M Flamini - 5 . Overran in the middle and must be more influential in these big matches . A Oxlade-Chamberlain - 6 . Missed Arsenal's best chance of the first-half showed an attacking spark. Off the pace: Alexis Sanchez struggled before being withdrawn at the interval . Wilshere - 4.5 . Another below par-showing and booked for a rash challenge on Barry after the restart. M Ozil - 5 . Anonymous on the left-side and couldn't keep up with Coleman's attacking forays. A Sanchez - 4 . Hooked after 45 minutes and can have no complaints. Looked light-weight and miles off-the pace. Bullet header: Olivier Giroud rescues the Gunners with a last-minute equaliser . Substitutes . Giroud (for Sanchez, 45), Cazorla (for Wilshere, 74), Campbell (for Oxlade-Chamberlain, 74), Martinez, Koscielny, Rosicky, Bellerin. Arsene Wenger - 6.5 . His major summer signing Alexis Sanchez was a huge disappointment and Giroud simply had to come on at the interval. Wenger had the gall to make the change and it paid off. A good point but more bite is needed in midfield.","Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey score two late goals for Arsenal .

"Rarely have you seen a sadder sporting sight. As the buggy pulled into the car park here yesterday it revealed the greatest golfer of his generation and the greatest golfing athlete of all time with a face creased with pain. When Tiger Woods tried to stand up, the sense of shock among the few eyewitnesses was palpable. It was like watching an 80-year-old man crippled by arthritis. For one awful moment, it looked like he wouldn’t be able to make it. Eventually he did so but the effort was such he had to put both hands on the roof of his courtesy vehicle, a grey Cadillac Escalade, for a minute or so to recover. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Tiger Woods suffers his latest setback . Out of touch: Tiger Woods hits out of a bunker on the second hole during his final round at Bridgestone . Struggling: Tiger Woods was four-over through eight before he pulled out through injury . Discomfort: Tiger Woods was in clear pain after hitting his second shot on the second hole . Struggling: Tiger Woods grimaces as he hits out of a bunker on the second hole . Blow: Tiger Woods has been hampered by several injuries in the last few years . Feeling the pace: Tiger Woods was not at his best before he pulled out through injury . VIDEO WGC-Bridgestone Invitational - Day 4 highlights . Watching him take off his golf shoes and put on his sneakers was so excruciating the instinct was to look away. It was as much as he could do to raise his right leg the inches it took to enable him to kick off his shoe, and he clutched his lower back. The man who did more than any other to make the game an athletic pursuit had come to this. My mind wandered back to an interview earlier in the year with Canadian Graeme DeLaet, who had an operation for a herniated disc similar to the one that Woods had in March. He thought he was fine too, only for his back to go as he tried to play a shot from thick rough. It was a year before he felt right — and he was 28 at the time, not 38. Seeing Woods in such distress, the idea that he could be part of the field for the USPGA Championship this week was untenable, while American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson can forget about him. You can’t take a man whose back might go at any minute. What a week Watson has had. He’s probably only just come to terms with the Dustin Johnson saga and now he’s got this on his plate. Pain game: Tiger Woods clutches his knee after his tee-shot on the ninth hole . Down and out: Tiger Woods hangs his head after pulling out through injury . Discomfort: Tiger Woods was immediately escorted off the course in a buggy . Blow: Tiger Woods's season may be over after his latest injury . Still, all his thoughts will be with the stricken Woods, as he contemplates what will surely prove another lengthy time away from the game. Where it all went wrong was on the second hole. Ironically, Woods had begun with a birdie but yet another stray drive left him in an awkward spot with his ball perched on top of a bunker. Even at the time, it seemed a reckless play to try to propel the ball a good distance forward, for by necessity it meant he would tumble back into the bunker. But he took it on, and duly retreated into the sand at a jarring angle. During his prime athletic years, of course, there would have been no repercussions. But Woods felt a sickening pain that began just above his right buttock that wouldn’t go away. ‘I don’t know what happened, I just jarred it and it has been in spasm ever since,’ he said. At the par-three fifth he hit a tee shot so badly it finished 68 yards short of the flag. At the sixth, he was so wayward his ball finished in a hot dog stand. At the par-four ninth, he had one more swing with his driver and then he was done. He collapsed onto his haunches and the world knew what would happen next. Will we see him again this year? It seems highly unlikely. Golf will go on very nicely without him, for a new generation led by Rory McIlroy is leaving its mark. But it’s hard not to have enormous sympathy for the man who made us all dream at one point that he could achieve the unthinkable and chase down Jack Nicklaus’s total of 18 majors. The golfing world will gather at Valhalla this week, the place where Woods won a playoff for the USPGA in 2000. It was his third major win in a row on his way to 14, and he looked omnipotent. At 38 and no age for a golfer, the story should all have been about his return to past glories and his hopes of pulling off another  triumph. Instead he’s where he was before back surgery in March, a scary world of uncertainty where the professionals are of the medical variety rather than his peers. You wish him the best but fear the worst. Dec 2002: Has surgery on his left knee to remove fluid inside and outside the anterior cruciate ligament and remove benign cysts.

"Arsene Wenger is brimming with confidence ahead of the new season, following Sunday's emphatic 3-0 win against Manchester City in the Community Shield. The Arsenal boss watched his side pick apart Manuel Pellegrini's side at Wembley with an attacking verve that is sure to get Gunners fans excited for the next campaign.

Welcome addition: World Cup winner Mesut Ozil (centre) began pre-season training with Arsenal on Monday . World Cup winners Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil started their pre-season training on Monday, while the Wenger can call upon Olivier Giroud, Aaron Ramsey, Santi Cazorla, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott when he returns from injury. In light of Wenger's comments, Sportsmail reviews the Frenchman's attacking power during his 18 years at Arsenal. 1997/98 . Main men: Nicolas Anelka, Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars Ray Parlour, Ian Wright . Wenger's second season at the club was a successful one winning the Premier League and FA Cup to complete the second league and cup double in the club's history. With a stalwart defence, Wenger could utilise the talents of Ian Wright, Ray Parlour and Dennis Bergkamp alongside new signing Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka. Bergkamp performed the role of the team's catalyst with 22 goals in all competitions for the Gunners, with Wright and Overmars also reaching double figures. For many Gunners fans, Overmars winning strike at Manchester United in their 1-0 victory to help them turn around a 12-point deficit on the way to the title will never be forgotten. Talented: Anelka emerged on to the scene at Arsenal before earning a move to Real Madrid . Club legend: Ian Wright (left) will go down as one of Arsenal's all-time greats after a superb spell at the club . 2001/02 . Main men: Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Nwankwo Kanu, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, Sylvain Wiltord . After watching perennial domestic rivals United win the Premier League title three-years running, it was Arsenal's time to be crowned England's best in another glorious season for the north London outfit. Still utilising the skills of Bergkamp, Wenger had made further additions since the 1997-98 season with Henry, Kanu, Ljungberg, Pires and Wiltord all joining the club since then. The result? Another Premier League and FA Cup success as Arsenal won their second league and cup double in five years - with the title sweetly sealed at Old Trafford. Henry scored 24 goals in the league, while Ljungberg doubled Arsenal's lead against London rivals Chelsea in their 2-0 FA Cup triumph.

Euphoria: Sylvain Wiltord scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal clinch the title at Old Trafford . 2003/04 . Main men: Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires . Arguably the greatest team ever to grace the Premier League era, the 2003/04 Arsenal team will forever be written in the history books. Dubbed 'The Invincibles' the Gunners went unbeaten during the entire Premier League campaign as they ended the season as champions. Winning 26 games and drawing 12, Arsenal's top goalscorer for the third year running was Thierry Henry - who scored 39 goals in 51 games. The Frenchman was given the accolade of PFA Players' Player of the Year by his fellow peers and the FWA Footballer of the Year by the football writers. To date nobody before or since has been able to match the Gunners feat in the Premier League. Top class: Dennis Bergkamp brought sheer brilliance to Arsenal's attack during his spell at the club .

Main men: Emmanuel Adebayor, Nicklas Bendtner, Eduardo, Cesc Fabregas, Alexander Hleb, Tomas Rosicky, Robin van Persie, Theo Walcott . A season of hope and promise that all changed during one lunchtime kick off at Birmingham City. The Gunners never fully recovered from their 2-2 draw at St Andrews in February in a league campaign that saw them challenge all the way for the Premier League title. Club icon Henry had left for Barcelona before the season began, but Wenger looked to have remedied the blow with the arrival of Eduardo and with Cesc Fabregas becoming ever more influential in midfield. Eduardo scored 12 goals in 31 games before breaking his leg in a horrible challenge with Birmingham defender Martin Taylor. In the Croatia international's absence Emmanuel Adebayor continued to deliver the goods for the Emirates faithful in a breakthrough season for the Togo forward. Adebayor ended as the club's highest scorer in all competitions with 30 goals as Wenger's side finished third in the league. Top gun: Emmanuel Adebayor was Arsenal's top scorer in the 2007/08 season with 30 goals in all competitions . Skillful: Rosicky impressed for the Gunners in his second full campaign with the club .

Summer signing Samir Nasri proved a hit in his debut season at the club, while Euro 2008 star man Andrei Arshavin showcased all his talents against Liverpool. The Russian playmaker who joined from Zenit St. Petersburg in February 2009 scored all four of Arsenal's goals in a 4-4 draw at Anfield in a man-of-the-match performance.

"QPR manager Harry Redknapp wants to sign two midfielders and a striker before the transfer window closes. Rangers have so far added four new recruits to the squad but Redknapp has been left short after players were released and last year's loanees returned to their parent clubs. Redknapp has already signed Steven Caulker and Jordon Mutch from Cardiff, Rio Ferdinand from Manchester United and Mauricio Isla on loan from Juventus. VIDEO Scroll down for QPR chairman Tony Fernandes talks Remy, Hoddle and transfers . New arrival: Jordon Mutch, centre, joined QPR from Cardiff City following an impressive season . 'We need to get a couple more in, we're short in some areas,' Redknapp said. 'I've got three central midfield players - Joey Barton, Alejandro Faurlin and Karl Henry - when you need six midfield players really at this level. 'So we're looking to get one or two midfielders in and maybe a front man as well because we need a bit of cover there. You need four strikers in an ideal world.' Redknapp added: 'If you look at the whole squad with everyone fit we've got 18 or 19 outfield players and that includes one or two lads who couldn't get in the squad last year.' Helping hand: West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison made a significant contribution to QPR's promotion . Rangers used the loan system to their advantage last season in the Championship as the likes of Tom Carroll, Niko Kranjcar and Ravel Morrison all made significant contributions. 'We'll probably use the loan system again. Maybe we'll buy one and loan a couple,' Redknapp said after QPR were beaten 1-0 by Hull at Loftus Road on Saturday. 'I think the chairman is close to doing a couple of deals today, I'm hoping he is. 'I spoke to him before the game and he's confident he'll get another couple that I'm after.' Uncertain: French striker Loic Remy could still leave the club before the transfer window closes . The future of Loic Remy, who came close to joining Liverpool earlier in the transfer window, is still uncertain. The French forward is keen to leave Loftus Road but is waiting to be approached by a club who can challenge for a Champions League spot. 'He's got a buy-out clause which is a problem, because if someone comes in and offers the money you lose him,' Redknapp said. 'If he goes you're looking for two strikers, which isn't easy to find, but if he's going to leave QPR, it's got to be to a big club - a top-seven club I would think. 'He didn't want to go back to Newcastle which is a massive club, so unless it's a club in the top seven I don't think he'll go.' On the move: Benfica are hoping to agree a deal to take Julio Cesar to the Stadium of Light . One player who does look set to leave is goalkeeper Julio Cesar. The 34-year-old, who joined Rangers in August 2012, was due to hold talks with Benfica over the weekend with a view to completing a transfer. Redknapp's side will be looking to bounce back from their opening day defeat when they travel to Tottenham on Sunday. The fixture means a return to White Hart Lane for Redknapp, who was sacked by Spurs in June 2012. 'It's a tough game but I'm looking forward to going back there,' Redknapp said. 'They'll be strong this year. With the money they spent last year they've got to be pushing for the top four.'","The former Spurs manager says he plans to strengthen Loftus Road squad .

"Little green army men were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame on Thursday, along with two other retro classics, the Rubik’s Cube and blow-your-own bubbles. The low-tech trio of toys joins an esteemed list of childhood favorites, including Barbie, G.I. Joe, Scrabble and the hula hoop, at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, having beat out nine other finalists including Fisher-Price Little People, American Girl dolls and My Little Pony. The tiny green heroes have been a favorite with children around the world since their creation in 1938 - and were even featured in the popular Toy Story movies. Life in plastic: New additions to the National Toy Hall of Fame include little green army men (right), the Rubik's Cube (left) and bubbles (center) At ease: Actors portraying the little green army men pose at the National Museum of Play in Rochester, NY . While their popularity waned during the 20 years of the Vietnam War, their appearance in the 1995 film cemented their place as one of the world's most-loved toys and prompted several manufacturers to begin reproducing millions of them every year. 'Over the years, these toys have remained popular because they are lightweight, simple to transport in buckets or pails, fun to blow up, easy to replace,' said the Museum of Play's curator Patricia Hogan. 'But most of all because they inspire open-ended play.' The army men made it on to the list of Hall of Fame finalists on two other occasions before finally making the cut this time around, offering hope to this year's rejected toys, which also included Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Slip 'N Slide, Operation, paper airplanes and pots and pans. Toy story: Items previously inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, include Barbie (left) and G.I. Joe (right) The Rubik's Cube was invented by Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in the 1970s, but really began to take off in the United States in 1980 after being imported by Ideal Toy Corp. More than 100 million of the six-color cubes were sold between 1980 and 1982, diving an obsessively-twisting nation between those who could solve the complex puzzle - and who could not. The cubes, which have nine colored squares on each side, can be arranged 43 quintillion ways, according to the Toy Hall of Fame, and have inspired organized competitions in more than 50 countries, along with variety of contests that require entrants to solve it blindfolded, one-handed and under water. Word play: Scrabble (pictured) was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in 2004 . Mats Valk of the Netherlands holds the speed record for re-aligning the colors in 5.55 seconds. In a videotaped statement played at Thursday's ceremony, Mr Rubik said he was happy to see his cube added to a collection that includes chess and 'other wonderful inventions from around the world.' 'I am very satisfied that I was able to share my enjoyment and happiness in connection with discoveries ... of geometry with millions of kids all around the world,' Mr Rubik said. Children have played with soap bubbles since at least the 17th century, according to the toy hall, when paintings depicting the play appeared in what is now modern-day Belgium.  More than 200 million bottles of bubble liquid are sold annually. Didn't make the cut: My Little Pony (left) and American Girl dolls (right) were among the finalists that were not chosen . Bubbles got a nod because of their ability to inspire imagination, Hall of Fame spokesperson Shane Rhinewald revealed, listing the simple toy alongside similar inductees including the stick and blanket. Ms Hogan, who curates the toy hall inside the museum, noted the staying power of the decidedly low-tech toys in this year's class, saying the simpler the toy, the more ways children find to use them.

"Roberto Martinez is backing Phil Jagielka to prove he is still one of England’s best defenders and show he is an improved player for his experience at the World Cup. There are question marks over Jagielka’s long-term prospects in the England squad, given he was criticised for his role in the defeats against Italy and Uruguay that condemned Roy Hodgson’s squad to an early exit. Martinez, though, has no such worries about his captain heading into the new Barclays Premier League campaign and believes the 31-year-old has recovered sufficiently from a draining experience to show why he can still lead his club and country’s defence. Leader: Everton manager Roberto Martinez has backed captain Phil Jagielka ahead of the new season . Heads up: Martinez is keen for Jagielka to prove he his still one of the country's best central defenders . ‘When you have been in a tournament like the World Cup, the days after it can be very raw and you have emotions,’ said Martinez. ‘You need a proper break and, by that, I mean time to get a proper perspective on things, time with your family and four weeks away from football. ‘The mind-set changes then and the experience of playing in a World Cup then gives you a head start on players who have never been there. That is the way I have seen the players come back from the World Cup - Phil, Leighton Baines, Ross Barkley. ‘They all had different experiences and have come back feeling they are better players for the experience they had I think his experience will make him more determined and a better player, he will be able to anticipate things and reach another level.’ Beneficial: Martinez believes having played in the World Cup will stand his players in good stead for the season . Jagielka himself feels he has recovered but says it will only be after Everton have got through their opening three tussles – after Leicester they face Arsenal and Chelsea – will know how much, if any, scarring remains. ‘It was difficult watching the World Cup at home,’ said Jagielka. ‘We went away with Turkey with the family and there was not much TV on. You try to forget about it, get run ragged by the kids, get thrown in the pool. It is the best medicine to be perfectly honest. ‘I didn’t want to be in Turkey that early in the summer. Anti-climax would probably be an under-statement. It is frustrating not to have been able to stay out longer. I would have preferred for us to have played worse, got more points and snuck through. It wasn’t meant to be.’","Everton boss Roberto Martinez keen for captain Phil Jagielka to show he remains one of England's best defenders .

The 42-year-old anchor was welcomed back in the New York studio by colleagues Matt Lauer, Al Roker and Natalie Morales after having her first baby on August 13. She said: 'It's so great to be back to see all of our friends here behind the scenes' adding that if too many clips of her daughter were shown 'you may have some waterworks'. In a first-person essay about her experiences as a new mom returning to work after maternity leave, she wrote: 'I feel like my heart is outside my body because Vale is in this world and she's my heart.' Scroll down for video . Savannah Guthrie was welcomed back in the New York studio by colleagues Matt Lauer and Natalie Morales after having her first baby on August 13 . Guthrie tweeted on Monday: 'How to get through first morning post maternity leave? FaceTime during commercials' Savannah joined her colleagues bright and early in their New York studio on Monday morning . Guthrie went out into Rockefeller plaza with the Today show team on Monday where fans welcomed her back with posters . Guthrie, who looked trim in a matching vibrant pink skirt and peplum top, tweeted from her desk on Monday: 'How to get through first morning post maternity leave? FaceTime during commercials.'

She said that maternity leave felt like a luxury after hardly taking two weeks off during her entire working life. The best part was having days stretch out with nothing more to do than take care of her new baby, she wrote. However she admitted that having a new baby waking up every few hours is exhausting. She wrote: 'I find that sleep deprivation kind of accumulates and after a while you're just not quite yourself. So of course one of the things is I'm terrified to come back to a job where I have to speak for a living, because I honestly have a very hard time right now putting basic sentences together.' Along with 'mommy brain' getting back into her pre-birth pants had been a challenge, she admitted. Baby Vale enjoying bath time with mommy Savannah while the Today host was on maternity leave .

"Former British boxing champion Jamie Moore has been shot twice in the leg in Marbella. The 35-year-old was in the Spanish city training middleweight Matthew Macklin ahead of his fight in Dublin later this month. Moore is reported to have been shot at five times in the early hours of Sunday morning and remains under armed guard in hospital after successful surgery.

Manchester lad: Moore meeting Sir Alex Ferguson and Wayne Rooney in 2007 . A source told the Manchester Evening News: 'It would appear he was out and about, not at the gym, when he was shot.' Moore took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to say: 'Thanks for all the well wishes. Overwhelmed. Gutted and confused about what happened, but thank God I'm OK.' Moore won the British light middleweight title in 2003 and later defended it against Macklin in a thrilling battle in Manchester. He was also crowned European champion in 2009 but retired the following year on medical grounds. Moore missed out on a world title shot and his career ended with successive defeats to Ryan Rhodes and Sergey Khomitsky. As well as training Macklin and Hull lightweight Tommy Coyle, Salford's Moore works as a pundit for Sky Sports.

"Here Sportsmail gives you a guide on Besiktas, the team which stands in Arsenal's way of reaching the Champions League group stages. The play-off to is to progress to the main draw of Europe's premier club competition, but the Gunners will look to avoid complacency as they go toe-to-toe with the Turkish side in a bid to reach the group stages . But what can Arsene Wenger's side expect to face in the play-off? Here Sportsmail gives you a guide to Besiktas, the team which stands in Arsenal's way of reaching Europe's elite . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Demba Ba completes his move to Besiktas from Chelsea . Familiar face: Demba Ba is likely to feature for Besiktas when they face Arsenal in the Champions League . BESIKTAS . UEFA ranking: 66 . Record against Arsenal: Never played . How they qualified: Third in Turkish Super League . Besiktas finished just three points behind Galatasary last term but a mammoth 12 behind champions Fenerbahce. That's the same Fenerbahce who were beaten 5-0 on aggregate by the Gunners in a Champions League play-off last year. Easy street: Arsenal defeated Fenerbahce 5-0 on aggregate in a Champions League play-off last season . But with the Turkish champions banned from Europe, Besiktas inherited the second of the two Champions League places on offer to Turkey. They have only won the Turkish top flight three times in the last 20 years, with their last success coming in 2009. Besiktas are consistent finishers inside the top four, having only finished below the position just twice since 1980. Star man - Demba Ba . There's plenty for Arsenal to be concerned about in Besiktas - especially their attacking prowess. The Turkish side feature Demba Ba in attack, with the former Chelsea and Newcastle striker an £8million signing from the Blues earlier this summer. Hat-trick hero: Demba Ba (centre) scored a treble for Besiktas on his home debut against Feyenoord . Already he has found the score sheet, netting a hat-trick on his home debut in the third qualifying round 3-1 win over Feyenoord. Manager - Slaven Bilic . As Croatia boss, Bilic was once touted as one of the Europe's most promising managers. The former West Ham and Everton defender famously recorded two wins over England in the Euro 2008 qualifiers to help dump the Three Lions out of the tournament before Steve McClaren's side had even left Wembley for Austria and Switzerland. On the up: Slaven Bilic is rebuilding his reputation at Besiktas after a disastrous spell at Lokomotiv Moscow . After leaving Croatia, Bilic's reputation took a battering after just one season at Lokomotiv Moscow as he guided the Russian club to their worst league placing since 1992, with a ninth placed finish. The former defender has since re-emerged at Besiktas where in his first season at the club he guided them back into Champions League contention. Out the hat: UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino draws Besiktas in Nyon to face Arsenal in the play-offs . Group stage campaigns: Five (last appearance - 2009-10) In the Champions League era, Besiktas have only made the main tournament five times - never progressing beyond the group stage. Last season: Europa League play-offs . Having been out of Champions League action since 2009, the last three seasons have seen Besiktas compete in the Europa League. Defeat in England: Besiktas reached the Europa League last 16 in 2012 but were beaten by Stoke along the way . They reached the last 32 in 2011 before going one better in a year later to reach the last 16. But they were kicked out of the competition following their play-off victory over Tromso last term following previous match fixing allegations. Best European Cup performance: Quarter-finals (1986-87) Besiktas' finest European Cup campaign came in 1987...where they won just two games before reaching the quarter-finals. Two victories to defeat Dinamo Tirana, were followed by a walkover victory over APOEL who were prohibited by their Cypriot government from playing the tie. The joy for Besiktas was short lived however, as Dynamo Kiev thrashed them 7-0 on aggregate in the last eight. Playing the Blues: John Terry (front) looks stunned as Besiktas's biggest Champions League away victory came at Chelsea with a 2-0 win in 2003 . UEFA records: .

"West Ham United's first Premier League game of the season against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur could set fans back as much as £77 for an adult ticket, causing uproar among Hammers fans. Saturday's opener at Upton Park, kicking off at 3pm, has been classed as a Category A fixture, with the cheapest ticket for members £50 and non-members £55. In stark contrast, Hull City, who finished just three points below the Hammers in their first season back in the Premier League, are charging a flat price of £16 around the ground for their first home fixture against Bojan Krkic's new club Stoke City on Sunday August 24. VIDEO Scroll down to watch West Ham unveil their new 'Superman' Enner Valencia . Hottest ticket in town? West Ham are preparing for their penultimate season at Upton Park . Extortionate: The West Ham website shows the most expensive tickets for non-members as £75 . Hundreds of fans will march on Premier League and Football League headquarters on Thursday to demand cheaper tickets across the board, with the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) heading the protests. Supporters believe the increase in the multi-billion pound TV deals, including the Premier League media deal worth £5.5billion, should allow for a decrease in ticket prices. Kevin Miles, chief executive of the FSF, said: 'Nine out of 10 fans think football's simply too expensive. 'There's always the odd deal that clubs can quote to play it down, but the truth is supporters tell us they think tickets cost too much.' Table: Prices for first two weeks of fixtures (red indicates highest and lowest price) Bang for buck: West Ham are the most expensive for home and away fans, while Hull represent the cheapest . Paying for what? Many feel West Ham's style of play does not warrant such prices, despite being a London club . West Ham are charging juniors £41 in Band 1 areas of the ground, while Hull fans under 15 can go for as little as £5 for the Category C fixture. The most expensive ticket for the Tottenham game is £75, with a £2 booking fee for all purchases. Despite the expected difference in Category A and Category C prices, West Ham fans are already disgruntled at having to watch what some of the faithful regard as poor football. West Ham won just seven of their 19 games at home last season in the top flight, scoring 25 goals. But the club do offer incentives for fans throughout the term, particularly for juniors. Six 'Kids for a Quid' fixtures are named in a season, as well as earmarking one game where under 16s can attend for free. However, the prices have caused anger on social media, with football fans wondering how a side that struggled in the Premier League last season can charge supporters so much. Adrian Leahy (@adieleahy), who voiced his concerns to Hammers co-chairman David Gold on Twitter, said: '@davidgold if you really are serious about making football affordable how come you keep raising the prices ? More & more fans priced out !' Danny Smith (@DannyyySmith) added: 'How can west ham charge £70 to the game against spurs ? Wouldn't mind but we don't even play football! HOOOFBALL!! @davidgold.' Andrew (@{griffina71) said: 'I took my son to watch Dortmund last year return flight and ticket cost £6 less !!!!' Not content: West Ham endured a tough season last term, with Sam Allardyce under pressure from fans . Affordable: In contrast, Hull City are offering adult tickets for £16 for all Category C games at the KC Stadium . Venue: The KC Stadium saw Premier League football return last season, with Hull finishing 16th . With it costing £35 to become a member at Upton Park,  the ticket prices for non-members could discourage new fans from deciding to attend Hammers games at short notice. Tottenham is a Category A fixture, alongside the visits of Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United. Eleven other Premier League clubs are listed as Category B fixtures, costing as much as £55 for members and £60 for non-members, while the Leicester City match at Upton Park is graded as Category C, priced £20 to £30. Fans across the Premier League have a right to feel disgruntled about ticket prices for the highest category games. Hull themselves charge adults £50, seniors and young adults £30, and juniors £20 for Category A games at the KC Stadium, while West Ham are not the only club charging a premium, particularly in the capital. On show: Hull fans will be hoping for a good start at the KC against Stoke, who will have Bojan starring . Value for money: Hull won the same amount of games at home as West Ham last term (seven), and reached the FA Cup final, meaning they are now in this season's Europa League . To come: West Ham will hope to offer more affordable prices when they move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016 . At newly-promoted QPR, 'Platinum' seats for their Category A fixtures  - against Arsenal, Man City, Man United, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and West Ham - will set non-members back £70. Across the capital at Arsenal, the most expensive Category A ticket for non-members is £97, while seeing the big clashes at White Hart Lane will set you back £81, including their home match against West Ham. A ticket see Jose Mourinho's Chelsea at Stamford Bridge against top opposition costs £82. In their penultimate campaign at Upton Park before moving to the Olympic Stadium, West Ham announced in April they would be freezing prices on season tickets for this term. The most expensive adult season ticket is £910 for new applicants, while renewals saved £20. But the cheapest, at £620, is still more expensive than London rivals Chelsea's least expensive option for this season, as well as the cheapest ticket at Manchester United. Football for all: Hull City fans can enjoy affordable prices for the lesser Premier League games all year round .","Non-members adult ticket in Band 1 for game on Saturday will cost £75 .

"Lincoln City savoured the sweet taste of victory over Barnet on Saturday - after  boss Gary Simpson had to use jelly babies to show his team their formation before the match. The Imps' trip south was nearly scuppered when their team coach failed to show up, meaning players and staff had to make their own way to the ground. The tactics board didn't make the cut, which led to Simpson marking out a 4-2-4 formation using the sweets on top of a kit locker.

Those tactics certainly gave Barnet plenty to chew on as Lincoln emerged 2-1 winners. After the match Simpson told BBC Radio Lincolnshire: 'If we can keep winning I will do whatever is necessary.' The club are looking into the reason why the team coach did not turn up for the Conference clash. 'We turned up in drips and drabs a little bit, but we all got down,' said Simpson. 'It wasn't the best situation to be in, especially when you are going to the league leaders that haven't conceded a goal, and had got off to an absolutely unbelievable start.'","Lincoln boss Gary Simpson improvised as the club had no tactics board .

"The alleged exchanges between Malky Mackay and Iain Moody show a culture of racism, prejudice, homophobia and arrogance that I know to be the unfortunate true face of top-level professional football. So why should we care that two middle-aged white men have what seem to be entrenched views of others who are different from them? These texts show a way of talking, behaving and thinking that I don’t particularly like, but why should football care? We should care because this whole issue turns ugly when you realise how such views make people act. When you read the accusations of Ibrahim Farah (@ibby_farah) about a culture of racism at Cardiff City under Mackay, it starts to take a sinister turn. VIDEO Scroll down to watch managers support Malky Mackay at time of Cardiff sacking . Reported: Malky Mackay (right) and Iain Moody have been accused of being racist, sexist and homophobic in a series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff . People in positions of power affect careers and futures. People who exclude others who don’t fit into their little pockets of comfort and small-minded views of the world are dangerous. The truth is, nothing in the alleged exchanges surprised me. This is how football talks in private, and more importantly, how it behaves in public. This is the reality and the gravity of the situation anyone outside the, male, white, old boy network exists in. Is it any wonder we have 92 professional clubs but no BME (black and minority ethnic) managers? Many will leap to the defence of these two men. I am sure they gave regular playing time to one or two black players and probably had a few around for tea who may retain some loyalty to their ‘mates’. I am sure both are a riot in the pub on a Saturday night. Not surprised: Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts wasn't shocked by the alleged exchange . But make no mistake, the game will be straining at the leash to find a way back for both Moody and Mackay when the brief outcry simmers down. If they are struggling for work and play their cards right I’m sure there will be media work available to them. Without meaningful changes to the structure of our game, from boardrooms to grass roots, football will continue to be run in a manner akin to the dialogue alleged here. There are many more where Moody and Mackay came from. Unfortunately for them, they are just the ones who got caught. The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.

"The heavyweight grudge match between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora has been rescheduled for November 22 at London's ExCel arena. The two Britons had been due to meet in a rematch in Manchester last month until Chisora fractured his hand and the long-awaited bout had to be postponed. Promoter Frank Warren said: 'It's been a roller-coaster few weeks, but I'm delighted to say that the fight is definitely on with Chisora and Fury ready to clash on Saturday 22nd November at the ExCeL London. Head to head: Tyson Fury (left) will take on Dereck Chisora in a battle of British heavyweights on November 22 . Fighting fit: fury in training after Chisora pulled out of the original bout with a fractured hand . 'It was an extremely unfortunate set of circumstances that caused Chisora to pull out with a fractured hand. 'Despite the setbacks, they were both determined to fight each other and I believe that we could see a genuine old fashioned ring war between them.' Warren had been hoping to set the world title eliminator for October but was troubled by a lack of suitable dates and venues, while also mindful of giving Chisora's hand enough time to recover. European champion Chisora, who lost on points to Fury when they met in 2011, said: 'The important thing is we have a new date for the fight, it's on, and Fury and I will finally give the fans what they want to see, a fight. 'What happened with my hand has happened and the timing of the injury was terrible, it couldn't have happened at a worse time and of course Fury had personal issues going on with him. Squaring up: Sparks flew at the original press conference before Chisora pulled out . 'I just want to fight Fury, get revenge, beat him good and proper, and move on to fight Wladimir Klitschko for the world title.' Unbeaten Fury, who had been scheduled to fight Alexander Ustinov in Manchester last month following Chisora's withdrawal but pulled out due to his uncle Hughie being taken ill, said: 'Chisora is now going to get a beating twice as bad than the one that he was going to get for pulling out. 'All Chisora is to me is an obstacle and I've got to smash through him to get where I want to be and that's fighting for the world title. He's messed me around and now I'm going to make him pay. 'I'm happy for the fans who will get to see me crush Chisora for second and final time and send him into retirement.'","Heavyweight clash will take place on November 22 at London's ExCel .

"Sunderland striker Connor Wickham could follow Jack Colback to Newcastle United this summer. The 21-year-old has one year to run on his current deal and has not been offered a new contract – this despite manager Gus Poyet issuing the player with an ultimatum last week. The Uruguayan said: 'For me, Connor’s situation is clear. He needs to sign a new contract or we let him go – we sell him. There is nothing in between.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch who has come and gone from Newcastle this summer . Deal or no deal: Connor Wickham could head to Newcastle if Sunderland don't offer him a new deal . But Sportsmail can reveal that no new terms have been put to Wickham and this has alerted North-East rivals Newcastle, who are in the market for another forward. United boss Alan Pardew tried to sign him in 2011 and was manager of Reading when the youngster played in their academy. West Ham are also monitoring the situation and Wickham – who lives in Newcastle - could be available for around £6million, £2m less than the fee Sunderland paid Ipswich Town three years ago. Will he stay or will he go? Sunderland are keen to keep Wickham after he scored some important goals last season . The England Under-21 star scored the goals which kept the Black Cats in the Premier League last season and he is happy at the Stadium of Light. However, the club's failure to offer him a new deal has left him considering his options. Sunderland, though, can ill afford to lose another first-team player with Phil Bardsley, Craig Gardner, David Vaughan and Colback having already left since the end of last season. Swapping sides: Jack Colback joined Newcastle this summer after leaving Sunderland . Reunited: Alan Pardew was manager of Reading when Wickham was in the academy there . Colback joined the Magpies on a free transfer after his contract expired but Sunderland will not allow the same situation to unfold with Wickham - although being under 24 compensation would be due - and he will be sold if an agreement is not reached.","Connor Wickham has a year to run on his current Sunderland deal .

"A university student who admitted leaking restricted details of a scholarship awarded to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughter will have to wait another month to find out her fate. Freya Newman, 21, pleaded guilty on September 18 to accessing restricted data held in a computer after she obtained details about a $60,000 Whitehouse Institute of Design scholarship granted to Frances Abbott. Ms Newman, who studies communications at the University of Technology Sydney, then handed the information to journalists. She was due to be sentenced on Thursday, but Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan adjourned her sentencing until November 25 after submissions from the defence and prosecution. Scroll down for video . Freya Newman, 21, appeared at Sydney's Downing Centre Court on Thursday  for hacking a computer to leak details about Frances Abbott's $60,000 scholarship at the Whitehouse Institute of Design . Newman, who studies communications at the University of Technology Sydney, pleaded guilty in September to accessing restricted data. She then handed the information to journalists . Ms Newman's lawyer Tony Payne SC, who was representing her for free, asked the Magistrate not to record a conviction. 'Freya suffered and continues to suffer the consequences for the rest of her (life),' he told the Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. He said the 21-year-old suffered anxiety due to the media attention the case had attracted and added that future jobs and travel would potentially be affected if a conviction was recorded. 'A sense of injustice motivated Ms Newman, not greed or a desire for notoriety or to embarrass Ms Abbott,' Mr Payne said. 'She was not aware that her actions were against the law or that her identity would become known.' The prosecution agreed the offence wasn't done for personal gain or notoriety but out of a sense of social justice and public interest. Newman accessed the files about a $60,000 Whitehouse Design Institute scholarship given to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's daughter Frances in 2011 . The Hunters Hill woman was a casual library assistant at the fashion and design college where Ms Abbott studied and used her position to access information about her enrolment. Ms Newman used the log-in and password of another staff member on May 20 to access Ms Abbott's details through the student record system, according to court documents. The documents allege she then emailed two other employees at the private design school saying '... there's a bit about Frances meeting with Leanne J, the CEO of Whitehouse Institute on February 21, 2011 and then receiving a Managing Director's Scholarship three days later'. 'Got em. Might go meet Chris now to talk tactics.' The following day, a story headlined Leaked Documents Cast Doubt on Abbott's $60,000 Scholarship Claims was published on news website New Matilda written by Chris Graham.

Ms Newman used the log-in and password of another staff member on May 20 to access Ms Abbott's details through the student record system, according to court documents . A handful of supporters were outside the court holding signs reading #FreeFreya ahead of her sentencing . No sensitive data was accessed and no information about any other student was viewed during the 103 minutes Ms Newman was in the database, Mr Payne told the court. She also committed the offence in the full knowledge she was under CCTV surveillance, admitted what she had done to her employer and resigned the following day, he said. But the prosecution argued a conviction should be recorded to deter anyone else from committing the offence. Ms Newman's family and supporters were packed into the court room and rallied around the student as she left. She faces a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Groups voicing solidarity for Newman have sprung up on Facebook and a handful of supporters were outside the court holding signs reading #FreeFreya ahead of her sentencing. Outside, neither Ms Newman, her parents nor Mr Payne commented. Ms Newman's will return to the same court on November 25.

"A 14-year-old boy hospitalized in a gay-bashing attack has been charged with assault and suspended from school because he threw the first punch at the boys for taunting him. Eric Martin spent nine days in an intensive ward with a broken arm, severe concussion and heavy spinal bruising after four classmates allegedly called him 'gay' and a 'faggot' then slammed him into a table and repeatedly punched him. But police investigating the incident at Highland Springs High School in Henrico, Virginia, have decided to bring charges against Eric for instigating the fight. Eric Martin, 14, has been charged with assault after four gay-bashers beat him so hard he was hospitalized . The teenager has also been barred from returning to classes until he signs a confession admitting he threatened school. Enraged, his mother Mary Martin said Eric was defending himself against a group of bullies who have repeatedly taunted him with homophobic slurs. Despite reporting the jibes to Highland Springs, she says, nothing was done to stop them. 'I'm angry, and I'm hurt,' Mary Martin told NBC 12. 'He's got bruises all down the spine of his back where he was just slammed on that table.' 'So in other words the four or five boys can beat my boy to death,' she said, 'and he gets one slap in and gets charged, too? That's plain ridiculous.' Suspended: Eric has also been barred from Highland Springs High School, VA, for his 'threatening actions' 'Bullied': His mother says the bullying boys had been taunted him with homophobic slurs for weeks . Henrico County Schools spokesperson Andy Jenks released a statement on the issue when it happened, in early September: 'We take very seriously the safety and security of our students, and we are investigating this incident. 'As always, school divisions are very limited in what information can be made publicly available. 'Any of our students who are determined to be responsible will be dealt with according to our established disciplinary policies and procedures.'","Eric Martin was 'slammed into table and punched', hospitalized for 9 days .

"A New Hampshire judge has caused fury in a small New Hampshire town after announcing that he plans to reduce the sentence of child molester who was convicted of sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl to just five years. Carroll County Judge David Garfunkel initially ordered Joshua Baud, 31, sentenced to 10 to 20 years - with a minimum of seven and a half years behind bars. He announced on September 30 that he had a change of heart and wanted to cut the sentence to just five years. More than 50 furious residents of tiny Ossippee, New Hampshire, packed Judge Garfunkel's courtroom Tuesday morning to protest his decision, Ossippee police Sergeant Robert King told MailOnline. Change of heart: Carroll County Judge David Garfunkel has come in for intense criticism after announcing his plan to shorten the prison sentence for a convicted child molester . Baud was a close family friend of the girl's mother and allegedly abused the 7-year-old when her mother left him to babysit . The protesters, along with the victim's mother, from the town of 5,500 people wore t-shirts with the name of a sexual assault and domestic violence charity to show their support for the girl, who is now 15. A group called Bikers Against Child Abuse also came out in force. Even the Ossippee Police Department spoke out against the judge's decision, writing on the department's Facebook page: 'This is an astonishing and unheard of move by a Judge, especially without any motion or petition by the defendant or defense counsel.' 'We just felt that, in talking to the chief, that we were so outraged by this professionally and personally that we had to do something,' Sgt King said. 'We felt in our department that we have the responsibility to make it known this was this process was going on.' On Tuesday, the number of protesters seemed to sway to judge - at least a little. The hearing was originally scheduled for him to reduce Baud's sentence. Instead, he decided to postpone the decision and hear arguments from prosecutors and Baud's attorney over the sentencing. Supporters of the victim, all wearing t-shirts for a sexual abuse support charity, showed up in force to protest the judge's re-sentencing . Carroll County Attorney Robin Gordon argued that the judge did not have the power to shorten the sentence. She also argued that the hearing put even more stress on the victim, who has had to testify against her attacker twice already. Sgt King said Bauder was a lifelong friend of the victim's mother. He assaulted the girl seven years ago when she left him at home to babysit her children. The girl testified that he fondled her after her mother left. The girl kept the abuse a secret for more than five years before coming forward in 2012. The first case resulted in a mistrial and she had to testify again at a second trial. The girl's mother said she's having the relive the horror of her abuse all over again as the judge decides whether to shorten the sentence. 'This has had a big backlash on my daughter. She was hoping for it to be over,' she said. 'I think he's wrong. If he could just consider what my daughter's been through. I think this man deserves even more than he got.'","Judge David Garfunkel said he had a change of heart after sentencing Joshua Baud to seven and a half years in prison .

"Two brothers whose images went viral after allegedly attacking a man on a Sydney train have pleaded not guilty to the assault. Connor McKeown, 26, and Gareth McKeown, 28, appeared briefly at Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday, pleading not guilty to affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. Police allege the brothers attacked 48-year-old Paul Roberts as he travelled home from the NRL clash between the Panthers and Bulldogs at Sydney Olympic Park on September 27. Scroll down for video . Brothers Connor (26 yrs) and Gareth (28 yrs) McKeown leave Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Wednesday. The brother pleaded not guilty to the assault of a 48 year old man on a train . Paul came away from allegedly trying to keep the peace with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches to a gash on his head and lip . Police allege the brothers attacked 48-year-old Paul Roberts as he travelled home from the NRL clash between the Panthers and Bulldogs at Sydney Olympic Park on September 27 . The 48-year-old was covered in blood after a vicious attack from two men. The alleged culprits departed at Sydney's Central Station . Mr Roberts was allegedly punched in the face numerous times, suffering a broken nose, two black eyes and a cut to his forehead. He also underwent plastic surgery for a cut to his lip. The brothers voluntarily attended police earlier this month after CCTV images of the men posted by police went viral. Within two hours the post reached 180,000 people and garnered more than 1000 shares, 490 likes and 370 comments. The pair remain on bail, with the matter expected to return to court in December. Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics took Paul to St Vincent's Hospital . In September, Mr Roberts spoke about about the incident, explaining that he stepped stepping in to defend two women with the intention of preventing any violence from erupting. He as he has been identified, was on the train from Sydney Olympic Park to Central after the Penrith-Canterbury semi-final when he saw an argument between two women and two men. Deciding to go over and calm things down before the situation got out of control, he came away with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches to a gash on his head and lip. 'I thought I'd just ask the fellas to leave it alone and walk away, to just quieten everything down,' Paul told 9NEWS. 'There were innocent people on the train and these people were getting quite overheated. 'I didn't want it to escalate to the stage where there was any violence.' One of the men allegedly moved to sit down in a different part of the train, but his friend is claimed to have started throwing punches. 'Loads of punches were being thrown, one of the guys pinned my arms to my side while the other one threw punches,' Paul said. He managed to headbutt the alleged attacker - the 48-year-old's only option without the use of his arms. Police take a statement from Paul at Central Station before he was taken by an ambulance to hospital . The alleged culprits departed at Central railway station, where paramedics came to Paul's aid. Police confirm that at 11.50pm, the alleged victim was travelling on a city-bound train from Olympic Park with a man and two women after the Bulldogs-Panthers clash. It's alleged Connor and Gareth McKeown boarded the train at Strathfield Station and struck up a conversation with the group. 'By the time the train reached Redfern, the 48-year-old man was concerned the conversation had become offensive,' said a NSW Police spokesperson. 'He approached the other two men in an attempt to de-escalate matters.' Witnesses say Paul was assaulted between Redfern Station and Central Station, at which point all parties left the train.

"Barcelona have confirmed that former Everton loanee Gerard Deulofeu will be joining Sevilla on a season-long loan deal. The La Liga giants have explained their reasons behind the move commenting: 'It is an operation designed to maximise his participation and optimise his progression as a player.' Deulofeu is highly-rated by the Catalan side and is considered to be one of the most promising youngsters to recently emerge from Barcelona's 'La Masia' football academy. Potential: Deulofeu showed signs he can become a top player in the future on loan at Everton last season . Classy: Deulofeu celebrates scoring a last-gasp equaliser for the Toffees at the Emirates last December . Last season the 20-year-old was loaned out to Goodison Park where he impressed despite scoring just four times in 29 appearances. However, new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique didn't feel that particular loan spell aided Deulofeu's development and is far more confident of him progressing on loan this time around. It was initially believed that Deulofeu would form part of Barcelona's attack this season but Enrique has opted to send the youngster out on loan, believing his chances of playing first-team football were minimal after the £75million signing of Luis Suarez. Deulofeu is the second Barcelona player to be loaned out to Sevilla before the start of the new season, along with former Manchester City youngster Denis Suarez.","Barcelona have confirmed they are loaning out Deulofeu to Seville for a year .

"Apple and Samsung have spent years at loggerheads over various patent infringements, and despite calling a truce recently, the rivalry still runs deep it seems. Reports claim that Apple was recently in talks with PayPal to be the ‘preferred payment process’ for its new Apple Pay service. But, during talks, PayPal agreed to do a similar deal with Samsung, and this is said to have caused Apple to have called the whole thing off. Sources close to Apple and PayPal revealed that Apple had hoped to add PayPal to Apple Pay, but during talks, PayPal signed a deal with Samsung. Apple was said to be ‘absolutely furious’ and snubbed the service completely.

The move means PayPal can focus on growing its market share in an increasingly competitive environment.

"TV chef Lorraine Pascale with one of her dishes . It was about time someone addressed the problem of sodden greens, gloopy custard and crusty pasta dishes served in their hundreds of thousands every day on almost every flight path under the sun. That person is TV presenter, chef and cookery book author Lorraine Pascale who has spent the last six months working with Virgin Atlantic's in-flight catering departments to try to improve their meals. The upshot is a vastly superior menu for Virgin's upper class passengers and rejuvenated meals for children throughout the cabin - but  no change for those in standard class. Lorraine's upper class dishes – inspired by her love of healthy, light eating  – will include Thai beef salad with roasted pine nuts and chilli dressing or a warm salmon and lentils with chorizo dish with asparagus and balsamic dressing. The children's dishes, on rotation over the next 12 months, will include 'marvellous' mac'n'cheese with pancetta pieces, crispy tender chicken strips with potato wedges and crushed peas, sweet and sour pork balls with sunshine rice and a Mum's chilli con carne with calypso rice. Fine dining: Lorraine's Thai beef salad with  pine nuts and chilli dressing which will be for upper class flyers . Not a soggy green in sight: the TV chef has designed four kid's meals including  mac'n'cheese with pancetta . The new dishes will be showcased on Virgin's  B787-9 flight to Atlanta on October 23, then added to services departing the UK from October 28. Reuben Arnold, Brand and Customer Engagement Director at Virgin Atlantic, said: 'We are thrilled to be working with Lorraine. She is the biggest ever debut cooking writer in Britain and to be collaborating with her to create these dishes has been really inspiring. 'Dishes such as 'Mum's chilli con carne with calypso rice will hopefully get our younger passengers very excited to be eating meals with a home-cooked feel. 'All of Lorraine's dishes reflect her philosophy of food, which is to champion fresh, nutritious and simple meals – something that is so important to our customers.' Other chidlren's options will include sweet and sour pork balls with sunshine rice (above) and  chilli con carne . Lorraine Pascale says: 'I have really enjoyed working the team at Virgin on these dishes, which I very much hope customers will enjoy. The aim was to create healthy and sophisticated menus for the Upper Class customers and wholesome, delicious and fun meals for the children's offering. 'I think we've achieved it – bon appetit!' Lorraine was keen that passengers would be 'excited by what they see'. She added, 'For me, when I fly, I like to have something light, healthy and with lots and lots of flavour.' Not everyone has been enamoured by the news, however, and some have taken to Facebook to vent their ire. Princess Watson-Smith wrote underneath an announcement of the collaboration: 'So hang on, upper class get upper quality food as they can afford the upper prices? So lower paying people are second rate and only deserve lower quality food but children of both upper and lower are the same? 'I don't know who I'm annoyed at more!' All in a day's work: TV chef Pascale tucks in to the Thai beef salad option from her 'healthy' for Virgin Atlantic . Not for all: upper class travellers will enjoy salmon with lentils, chorizo, asparagus and a balsamic dressing . Another, Sharron Prince added: 'Upper class ... Shouldn't we all be treated equally ... Some family's save very hard to fly with virgin for their holidays so don't they deserve to treated as upper class?' Linda Paul rode to the TV chef's defence saying: 'Good on you Lorraine! Love all your recipes and well written cook books. Thank you' Whether you can afford it or not, hopefully it will inspire more airlines to up their game and is a taster of good things to come.","TV presenter and author works with airline to make light, healthy meals .

"Google's chief executive Larry Page has revealed the firm has outgrown its original mission statement and is in 'uncharted territory.' The search giant claimed to 'organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful' when it first launch in 1998 along with the famous mantra 'Don't be evil'. Now, Page admits he isn't sure what the firm's goals are. Scroll down for video . Google's chief executive Larry Page has revealed the firm has outgrown its original mission statement and is in 'uncharted territory'. Questioned by The Financial Times, Page said: 'We're in a bit of uncharted territory. We're trying to figure it out. 'How do we use all these resources … and have a much more positive impact on the world?' In recent years, the firm has expanded into everything from driverless cars to flying drones and smart contact lenses. However, it has also faced anti-monopoly probes by the European commission and most recently pressure from Europe over the 'right to be forgotten'. This ruling forced Google to remove search listings to information deemed to be outdated and not in the public interest which saw Britons request over 60,000 links be deleted by October. The firm last week revealed a plan to take on cancer with smart nanoparticles. Nanoparticles could be ingested in a pill to enter the bloodstream. They would be designed to bind to a particular type of cell – like a cancer tumor cell. This would be done by 'painting' them with a substance that could interact with the surface of cells. They'd then travel together as a unit through the bloodstream. The core of the nanoparticles would be magnetic, so a wearable device that creates a magnetic field could draw the particles – with their target cells in tow – toward it, where they could be detected and counted. Experts at Google are studying various non-invasive techniques, like light and radio waves, for detecting and counting the particles. He says the firm's secretive [x] lab has meant is can do work nobody else can. It has already developed a smart contact lens. It works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears, before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition. 'We do benefit from the fact that once we say we're going to do it, people believe we can do it, because we have the resources,' said Page. 'Google helps in that way: there aren't many funding mechanisms like that.' Page also criticised the current boom which say investors throwing money and startups with little chance of changing the world. A Google smart contact lens that can monitor the glucose levels in the eye is being developed in a partnership with Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It  works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears, before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition.

"Brendan Rodgers is prepared to push Liverpool’s search for a new striker to the last minute of the transfer window as he scours Europe for candidates of the highest calibre. When Liverpool wrap up the formalities of Alberto Moreno’s £12million move from Sevilla, Rodgers will have brought eight new faces in this summer but he still has one key area that he needs to fill. Having missed out on Loic Remy because of complications over his medical, Rodgers and his recruitment team have been discussing a number of names, including Samuel Eto’o, who is a free agent, and Monaco’s Radamel Falcao. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers say he is happy with his business so far . Waiting game: Brendan Rodgers will continue his search for striker right up until the final day . Denied! Liverpool came close to signing Loic Remy before the Newcastle striker failed a medical . Liverpool had initially accepted that signing Falcao would be difficult, given they had understood that Real Madrid were his chosen option, but they have not given up hope of possibly taking the Colombian before the window closes. There are other options being considered and Rodgers is hoping his search will be productive. Should he fail to find a suitable target, though, Liverpool’s manager is adamant that his squad has enough depth. ‘We just want to complete on Moreno so we have covered both full back positions and if we can get a striker on top of that, it will be it,’ said Rodgers. ‘It’s not easy, but we have to keep looking. ‘We certainly need something that is going to help us over the coming season. You never know sometimes you just never know happens with a few weeks to go in the window. Colombian connection? Liverpool have been linked with an audacious move for Radamel Falcao . ‘That last week, the window will always throw up something. We will just persevere, and the boys are working hard behind the scenes to see what information we can get on the availability of players and we will take it from there.’ Liverpool will have to adjust to not having brilliance of Luis Suarez this season but, as he prepares for Sunday’s opening fixture with Southampton, Rodgers feels his squad are better prepared for the campaign compared to how they were 12 months ago. ‘We haven’t just brought in a ton of players without thought,’ said Rodgers. ‘These are players who will be integrated into the squad, at 22, 20, and 19 that can play now and that can also be here for the future. The aim is to ensure this club is sustainable and that means on and off the field. Blues brother? A move for former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o would be a cheaper option . ‘For us this year we are better equipped because of the depth of the squad. I see it in the training, young players they give energy to senior players and give that enthusiasm and I look in the training and it has given some of the older players that nudge as well.

"The man convicted of gunning down three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in a rampage  was given life in prison, the country's harshest sentence in 50 years. The life sentence was handed down to Justin Bourque on Friday for the murder of three officers and wounding of two others in Moncton, New Brunswick, on June 4. Dressed in combat fatigues with a shotgun slung across his back, Bourque shot several Mounted Police officers with what he later testified was a semi-automatic rifle. Guilty: Justin Bourque, 24, was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 75 years, the country's harshest punishment since 1962 . Moncton, a city of nearly 70,000 was on lockdown for 30 hours as a manhunt followed before Bourque finally surrendered to law enforcement on a homeowner's lawn. His sentence will be the harshest in Canada since 1962, when two men were hanged for murder. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown found the long sentence for Bourque a fitting punishment. 'This probably was one of the worst crimes that we've ever seen in our country,' Brown said. 'We saw three of our own gunned down because of the job they do.' Due to the first degree murder charge, Bourque was already facing a mandatory life sentence after being convicted. He will be 99 when he's first eligible for parole. First degree murder convicts in Canada are normally given life with no parole for 25 years, after which they can apply for parole. Sketch: A court sketch artist draws Bourque during his first court appearance in Moncton shortly after he was caught . Funeral: An officer holds the hat of Constable Dave Joseph Ross as he walks with Ross's K9 partner Danny to the funeral for the fallen Mounted Police . Procession: Royal Mounted Police Officers escort the bodies of the three fallen officers that were killed during the rampage . Loss: Constable 'Dave' Ross, 32, seen here on his wedding day with his wife Rachael, was one of the three slain officers who were fatally shot on Wednesday night in Moncton . Cryptic: Bourque posted cryptic poetry to Facebook leading up to the shooting, including this post hours before . The prosecution asked the court for the maximum sentence of 75 years based on an amended section of Canada's Criminal Code, while the defense argued for parole at 50 years. It was the second-deadliest attack on RMCP in 120 years, after the 2005 killing of four RMCP officers in Alberta. During his sentencing hearing, a video tape of Bourque saying he wanted to start an insurrection against the 'soldiers' defending federal institutions and protecting the rich. 'I know this is going to sound pretty messed up, but I felt pretty accomplished,' he told police. 'I miss my husband every minute of every day. He cannot ever be replaced,' said Rachael Ross, widow of one of the officers, said outside court. Nadine Larche said the sentence means their children will unlikely be subject to parole hearings. According to witnesses of the shooting, the first gunshots came from a wooded area about 100 yards from the trailer park where Bourque lives in the northwest part of the city. After the first shooting, police sighted the killer three times prowling the city, including once at 8am near Moncton's Costco. During another call Thursday afternoon, patrol cars and armored trucks surrounded a building in the area, presumably thinking Bourque was inside, but they later dispersed. 'We received some information and did a search and it was unfounded,' a RCMP spokesperson said. At one point, Bourque was seen coming in and out of a wooded area, said Commander Marlene Snowman, who added that Bourque was not known to police, meaning that he had never been seen as a cause for concern by officials before his rampage. Schools and government offices were closed, and the city pulled its buses off the roads. Mail delivery was suspended. Commanding Officer Roger Brown said the two wounded officers underwent surgery for non-life-threatening injuries Thursday and he met with their families. One was later released from hospital. Bourque finally surrendered to police in the lawn of Michelle Thibodeau, 21, who watched his arrest. She said she heard the suspect say, 'I'm done,' before officers, some with their guns drawn, arrested him.","Justin Bourque, 24, was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 75 years .

"Pepe Reina only completed his £2million switch to Bayern Munich on Friday, but already the former Liverpool goalkeeper has lined up in full kit for his new side. But it wasn't for a competitive game, or even a pre-season friendly, it was for the club's official team photo where the German side proudly showed off three of the four trophies they won last term. There was no room for the UEFA Super Cup, but Reina sat proudly in the first row just in front of the FIFA World Club Cup and the German league title, with the German Cup also featuring in the picture.

In a letter headlined 'Once a Red Always a Red' the former Liverpool 'keeper addressed the fans and signed off with 'You'll Never Walk Alone, Pepe.' He says that he knew his time at the club was over before the last campaign and updated the fans from a letter last year on what he called 'an honour and a priviledge.' The move to Munich reunites Reina with his former captain at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola, and he says he wanted to enjoy his time with the German champions as much as his time at Liverpool. Finally, he tells fans that he now counts himself as a Liverpudlian and he looks forward to returning to Anfield as a fan.

"Bayern Munich have broken promises they made to Pep Guardiola when persuading him to join the club, a soon-to-be-released biography of the Spanish coach claims. Written by Spanish journalist Marti Perarnau, it has emerged that one of Guardiola's conditions for joining Bayern was that Toni Kroos would not be sold 'under any circumstances'. Kroos was sold to Real Madrid for £20million this summer. Perarnau's book Herr Guardiola has been written on the back of several months which the journalist spent shadowing Guardiola in Munich. It will be released in German at the end of this month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Toni Kroos embarass Ronaldo in Real Madrid training . Gloomy: Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola watches the German Super Cup defeat against Borussia Dortmund . In pre-release extracts, Perarnau describes details of the negotiations which brought Guardiola to Bayern. Having been approached, and offered huge sums, by both Chelsea and Manchester City, Guardiola is said to have been promised that all financial conditions would be met without problems by then Bayern president Uli Hoeness. With Bayern carrying no debt, and able to appeal to their various corporate shareholders for particular investments, Guardiola's salary, estimated to be around £12m a year, was not central to discussions. Rather, it was footballing issues which the Catalan was keen to clear before taking the job. Split: Guardiola and Kroos exchange words on the touchline at Old Trafford last season . Pass master: Kroos is now playing his trade in Real Madrid's midfield after a £20m summer transfer . Some have been well documented. Guardiola's desire to sign Mario Gotze from Borussia Dortmund was clear from the beginning, as was his ultimatum to the Bayern board with regard to Thiago Alcantara. 'Thiago or nothing', he is alleged to have said. Perarnau's book, though, alleges that Guardiola also specified that Kroos should not be sold under any circumstances. The former Barcelona boss saw pass-master Kroos as a key ingredient to the project he wished to build in Bavaria. In Guardiola's first season, Kroos was used only as part of a rotation policy with the likes of Thiago. This disgruntled the midfielder, and led to a famous touchline spat last winter. The player eventually demanded a far higher wage from Bayern, claiming he felt undervalued. Injury headache: Guardiola will be without midfielder Thiago Alcantara (centre) for a lengthy period . That led to a whole six months of endless speculation as to whether Kroos would leave for the Premier League or La Liga, or if Bayern would cave to his demands. During negotiations with the midfielder, the narrative became clear that both Guardiola and director of sport Matthias Sammer were desperate to keep the player, while the board were happy to let him go. 'Kroos is a great guy, he loves the game. I would really like to hold onto him,' Guardiola said in April. But with the board, led by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, refusing point blank to raise Kroos' wages, the player was lost to Real Madrid after the World Cup. After his move, Kroos insisted that he had 'no problem whatsoever with Guardiola'. Many had already seen the Kroos saga as a clear case of Guardiola being undermined by the board. With Perarnau's claim that Guardiola had demanded the player stay from the very beginning, that reading seems even more valid. It remains to be seen how much Bayern will miss Kroos, but with both Thiago and Bastian Schweinsteiger set to miss a huge chunk of the early season through injury, his departure may prove to be a crucial development in Guardiola's second season in Munich.

"That morning latte, the after dinner cheese board, ice-cream — for many of us the prospect of giving up dairy is too daunting a prospect to countenance. But dairy has become the latest dietary bogeyman, having been linked to myriad diseases and health complaints, from bloating and eczema to asthma and weight gain. Is giving it up another food fad or could going dairy-free really give you a svelte figure, fantastic skin and help prevent disease? Dairy has become the latest dietary bogeyman, having been linked to myriad diseases and health complaints, from bloating and eczema to asthma and weight gain . Celebrities such as actress Megan Fox have credited their super-slim figures to going dairy-free, while Victoria Beckham is said to have got rid of her bad skin this way. For those following the latest trendy vegan and Paleo diets — where you emulate the eating habits of prehistoric people, relying on a lot of meat and green veg — dairy is also banned. Even David Cameron has reportedly cut back on dairy products to stay slim. The Prime Minister recently requested a dairy-free meal on a flight and is said to be having almond milk — which has half the calories of semi-skimmed cow’s milk — on his cereal. And it’s not just the rich and famous. In June, a leading scientist, Professor Jane Plant, who has had breast cancer five times, told how she went into remission and has remained cancer-free for 18 years after going dairy-free. She gave it up after studying the low rates of breast cancer in China, where dairy is much less prevalent than in Western diets. Many other devotees swear by the transformative powers of ditching milk. Jill Barker, 48, from Glastonbury, Somerset, gave up dairy five years ago and says it has transformed her energy levels, figure and mood. ‘I felt sluggish, was piling on the pounds and couldn’t find a way to keep my weight under control,’ says Jill, who lives with her husband Jonathan and their 15-year-old son, and runs a holiday cottage rental company. Professor Jane Plant, who has had breast cancer five times, went into remission and has remained cancer-free for 18 years after going dairy-free . ‘I started doing the My Food diet plan, which delivers healthy meals to your home, and noticed they were dairy-free. ‘Cutting out dairy is a good way to cut calories — you lose the milky lattes and without cheese and butter you don’t eat bread. But I didn’t just lose weight: my energy levels went through the roof and I didn’t feel sluggish any more.’ Jill decided to stay dairy free — having soya or almond milk with her coffee and cereal, and avoiding cheese, butter and cream. ‘Over the past five years, I’ve gradually lost more than 2st, going from a size 18 to 14, and find it easy to stick to a healthy weight,’ she says. ‘I’m slimmer than I was 18 years ago when I got married. Friends say I look younger and the dark circles under my eyes have gone. I’m convinced it’s all down to cutting out dairy.’ While she allows herself the occasional sliver of cheese with no ill effects, she says that if she has a cup of tea with milk, ‘almost immediately I feel really tired’. Though she has not been diagnosed with an intolerance or allergy, Jill believes humans were not designed to consume dairy. ‘As long as you’re eating your greens, you can get enough calcium and protein that way.’ Jo Matyear, 39, a sales and marketing manager who lives in Hampshire with her husband, James, has been avoiding dairy for nine years. ‘In primeval times, we didn’t drink milk, apart from breast milk as babies,’ she says. ‘The incidence of illnesses such as cancer are increasing in Western countries and I’m convinced they are linked to diet and the fact we are having more dairy.’ Jo believes dairy was to blame for some health niggles. ‘I have studied nutrition and read about how dairy can affect your health. As soon as I removed dairy products from my diet, I found I had more energy,’ she says. ‘I no longer feel bloated and my stomach is flatter. Celebrities such as actress Megan Fox have credited their super-slim figures to going dairy-free . ‘I used to have a constant need to clear my throat and that has disappeared. ‘Another weird thing is that I used to get eczema on my chest and sometimes on my face — within a couple of weeks of giving up dairy that cleared up.’ So, how could dairy be responsible for so many ailments? The problem, say some, is lactose, the naturally occurring sugar in milk. Research suggests that 60 per cent of the world’s population have a degree of lactose intolerance. In such people, the gut struggles to break it down, triggering a host of digestive problems. Dietitian Laura Tilt says cheese and butter are high in fat and if you’re eating lots of it then cutting down will help. But there’s no evidence that cutting out dairy has any particular benefit for weight loss . ‘From an evolutionary perspective, eating dairy products is relatively recent,’ says Dr John Briffa, a leading expert in nutrition and author of Escape The Diet Trap. ‘If lactose is not broken down, it ferments in the gut, which can cause various digestive issues such as bloating. The protein in milk, casein, is allergenic — it seems to get into the gut and make the system more sensitive. ‘That’s why so many find that eczema and hay fever clear up when they come off dairy.’ Dietitian Laura Tilt says she has noticed an increase in people inquiring about dairy-free diets. ‘Lactose intolerance is common, particularly in people with irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease or colitis,’ she says. ‘The problem is that the symptoms vary from person to person. Though there are ways to diagnose lactose intolerance — using blood tests or breath tests — availability is poor. ‘Dairy-free foods have become much more available and are even fashionable, so I think some people are swapping to soya milk because it sounds as if it’s good for you, without any physiological reason.’ Laura Tilt says it’s a common misconception that giving up dairy will help with weight loss. 'Some people are swapping to soya milk because it sounds as if it’s good for you, without any physiological reason,’, says Laura Tilt . ‘Obviously cheese and butter are high in fat and if you’re eating lots of it then cutting down will help. But there’s no evidence that cutting out dairy has any particular benefit for weight loss. ‘In fact, when we compare people on two diets with the same amount of calories, the group who are having milk and dairy tend to lose more weight and more body fat. That may be because milk and yoghurt are good sources of protein — they help keep you full and support lean muscle. ‘If you want to lose weight, you should cut out empty calories — sugar, alcohol, refined carbohydrates — and reduce the amount of high-fat dairy products.’ Dairy is an important source of calcium — for healthy bones — and anyone cutting it out must ensure they get a good intake of the nutrient from other sources, such as green, leafy vegetables and grains. But worryingly this doesn’t seem to be happening and fad diets appear to be taking their toll on Britons’ calcium intake. Recent figures from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey show 18 per cent of teenagers and 8 per cent of adults are not getting enough of this vital mineral. Experts worry this is putting women at increased risk of osteoporosis, or brittle bones. This is something Katherine Thay, 31, is all too aware of. Like many young women, she felt conscious of her weight at university. And in 2001, inspired by celebrities showing off their svelte figures after rapid weight loss, she cut out carbohydrates and dairy products. ‘I justified it to myself by claiming I was lactose intolerant — even though, if I was honest, I didn’t have any symptoms,’ says Katherine, who works in advertising and lives in Brighton. The new regime saw her lose a stone, dropping to 8st. But then in 2004, while training for a marathon she tripped and fractured her ankle. Victoria Beckham is said to have got rid of her bad skin by ditching dairy products from her diet . Then 18 months later she fractured her wrist after another fall while out running. ‘I went to see my GP, who agreed that another fracture after such a minor fall was unusual. I was sent for a scan to measure my bone density. The results showed I had developed osteopenia, the precursor condition to osteoporosis. ‘I was shocked that just three years of dieting could have done so much damage to my bone health.’ Katherine began eating dairy again in 2005 and started taking calcium tablets. She has not had a fracture since. ‘My weight has gone back up to 9st,’ she says. ‘I’m just hoping that it’s not too late for my bones.’","Dairy has become the latest dietary bogeyman .

'He was left out for football reasons' Ancelotti said when asked why the Argentine had not even made the bench at the Vincente Calderon Stadium.

Real Madrid supporters have left the club in no doubt that they want Di Maria to stay but president Florentino Perez wants him sold to help the club balance the books after their staggering spending spree this summer with the acquisitions of Toni Kroos and James Rodrgiguez. Madrid were embarrassed by the reaction of the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday when Di Maria came on as a second half substitute and was given a huge ovation by supporters. Ancelotti confirmed on Friday that the player had turned down the offer of a new deal and asked for a move.

Supporters who saw him play a huge role in Real’s Champions League success last season believe he is worth it but the club have made no second offer and he will be a United player if they find the money to meet both the asking price and the player’s wage demands. Barcelona paper Sport are suggesting that Barcelona had made a 60m euro bid for the player but the midfielder Xavi dismissed the idea Di Maria could do a ‘reverse Figo’ in moving from between Spain’s big two. ‘He’s a great player but it is very rare that that happens,’ Xavi said. A fan poll on Sport’s website revealed 80 per cent of Barca fans wanting the unlikely swoop to take place. And Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said on Tuesday that he is ‘Real Madrid’s best player’. It seems everyone bar the Real board want the Argentine. What remains to be seen is if United want him enough and can persuade him to give up Champions League football for a season. You can Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page here.

"Offered an improbable second chance in the Champions League, Celtic are on the verge of taking it. A composed, tactically astute performance against the champions of Slovenia in the Ljudski Vrt Stadium leaves Ronny Deila's team 90 minutes from the group stages for a third successive year. Short of signing David Blaine it's hard to recall a greater act of naked escapology than this. The Scottish champions are not through yet. Neither should they expect a good luck postcard from Warsaw in the coming days. Yet, on a night when they dominated a very ordinary Maribor team for long spells they could – should – have emerged with a first leg victory. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronny Deila say he is  happy with his side's performance and is confident of progressing to the group stage . Back of the net: Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor (centre) reacts quickest to put the visitors ahead in the sixth minute against Maribor . Early delight: McGregor runs away to celebrate  his strike in Slovenia as goalkeeper Jasmin Handanovic is left to pick the ball out of the net . All smiles: Celtic players (from left to right) Beram Kyal, Stefan Johansen and Jo Inge Berget celebrate with goalscorer McGregor (far right) Maribor: Handanovic, Stojanovic, Rajcevic, Suler, Viler, Vrsic (Mendy 74), Filipovic, Dervisevic (Mertelj 81), Bohar (Sallalich 79), Tavares, Ibraimi. Subs: Cotman, Mejac, Zahovic, Arghus. Celtic: Gordon, Lustig, Denayer, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Johansen, Mulgrew, McGregor, Kayal, Berget, Stokes (Griffiths 81). Subs: Zaluska, Ambrose, Biton, Commons, Pukki, Griffiths, Henderson. Referee: Pavel Kralovec (Czech Republic) Such was the contrast with the 4-1 defeat to Legia which left Deila's team staring down the barrel of fiscal gun, however, there were few of a mind to quibble on Wednesday night. There were some similarities with the Legia game. Once again Celtic made a terrific start. Once again, they conceded a quick equaliser. But this time there was no collapse. Celtic have good reason to believe they will finish the job at Parkhead before a large crowd now. For the third successive away game in Europe Callum McGregor, the 20-year-old who spent last season on loan at Notts County, scored an invaluable goal. Like Stefan Johansen, Craig Gordon and a raft of others in Celtic colours he had a fine game and is making a habit of it, showing excellent composure and decision making in key areas. It took him eight minutes to score the goal which ultimately proved crucial to Celtic in Warsaw. Here it took just five. Johansen, who had an industrious night in Celtic's midfield, sprung the Maribor back line with a lofted pass to an onside and in space Jo Inge Berget. The Norwegian had work to do yet. He rode the first challenge then steered an angled shot towards goal. Home keeper Jasmin Handanovic blocked with his legs, but McGregor is showing a pleasing habit of being the right man in the right place. The youngster slotted the ball into the net for 1-0. The gnashing of teeth on the streets of Warsaw was almost audible above the silence of the home supporters. There was no sign of panic from Celtic. The possession stats were overwhelming in their favour. Maribor generously stood off the team in green and white and allowed them to play. All square: Maribor's Damian Bohar (second from right) tucks the ball beyond Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon to get his side back on level terms . Get in! Maribor midfielder Bohar gestures to the home fans after scoring in the 14th minute at the Ljudski vrt Stadium . Yet cold hard experience has already shown this season that nothing is simple for Scotland's champions. After shipping a leveller in three minutes in Poland they lasted a whole eight here. Yet the goal they lost – once again – was pitiful. Ronny Deila started 19-year-old on loan Manchester City defender Jason Denayer beside Virgil van Dijk and threw Beram Kayal in beside Charlie Mulgrew as a second holding midfielder. Last season's top scorer Kris Commons was sacrificed to make Celtic stiffer and sterner in defence and that decision was justified by a return to form from Kayal. The Israeli was solid here. Yet in 14 minutes the home team simply passed the ball through a porous backline. Denayer's inexperience showed as he was caught wrong side of his man, while Mikael Lustig might also have done better. Whoever cops the blame eventually, left winger Damjan Bohar slotted the through ball calmly past Craig Gordon for 1-1. It was Maribor's first chance. Virtually their first attack. It was natural, then, to fear for Celtic. There was a déjà vu to much of this. Mercifully, it was misplaced. In contrast with warsaw Deila's team didn't panic. They made it to half-time at 1-1 quite comfortably and were desperately unlucky not to be 2-1 – maybe even 3-1 ahead. Oddly willing to stand off and allow their visitors to play, Maribor conceded a raft of first half corners. One of them, in 20 minutes, almost ended in a goal when Stefan Johansen's deep, probing effort to the back post was headed back across goal by captain Charlie Mulgrew. Zeljko Filopovic headed off the line. There was an astonishing let-off for Maribor just after the half hour mark. Another Celtic corner, this time from Anthony Stokes on the other side picked out Virgil van Dijk in front of goal and his header could hardly have been any better. It was bulleting into the net until, freakishly, it struck Celtic teammate Johansen on the goalline and stayed out. Under pressure: Celtic defender Jason Denaver (back) tussles with Maribor striker Marcos Tavares (front) as he prepares to receive a pass . So close: Celtic almost take the lead but Virgil can Dijk's (right) header hits his team-mate Stefan Johansen and bounces back into play . Battle: Goalscorers Bohar (left) and McGregor (right) both attempt to get control of the ball during the opening period . Still there was no reason for Celtic to despair. They passed the ball sharply, UEFA statistics showing the Scots had 64% possession in the first half. With a striker able to hold the ball up and bring others into the play . And yet the worry here was clear. Celtic had shown they could score. Could they defend? Maribor stung the palms of Craig Gordon twice with long-range efforts. A Petar Stojanovic piledriver was pushed wide by Gordon as van Dijk stood off. The former Scotland keeper, making his first European start for Celtic, was called into action again after Maribor's creative danger man, Agim Ibrahimi made space to thump a 25 yard left foot drive at goal. Gordon pushed it out and Dare Vrsic failed to bring the ball down to guide the rebound on target. For all the criticism of Celtic's transfer dealings – or lack of – over the summer, Gordon may yet prove to be a superb piece of business. In a rare lapse of defensive concentration in 59 minutes Emilio Izaguirre gave the ball away in his own half. Working the ball wide to the left flank Maribor full-back Mitja Viler whipped in a cross for Ibrahimi to direct a downward header towards the bottom right hand corner. Gordon dived full length to push the ball away in a manner which suggested, if he stays fit, that Fraser Forster's departure may prove less than catastrophic. It was a fleeting moment of concern for Celtic's number one. Of the two goalkeepers Handanovic, at the other end, was by far the busier keeper. How Celtic left here without a second goal, indeed, remains an enduring mystery. Looking on: Celic manager Ronny Deila plots his next move while watching his players in action before the break . Sliding in: Celtic midfielder Jo Inge Berget (right) evades a strong tackle from Maribor's Dare Vrsic (left) Challenge: Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre (right) has the ball stolen off him by Vrsic near the touchline . They controlled the play and crafted a series of chances. The first in 61 minutes saw Stokes claim a handball from Aleksander Rajcevic as he headed a fine cross from McGregor towards goal. Stokes had a mixed night here, in truth. His best moment came when he controlled the ball with his back to goal, spinning and dragging a low effort from 20 yards wide of goal. That came during an excellent spell for the Scottish champions. They should have scored a second in 72 minutes when Johansen embarked on an endless solo run which almost carried him through for a brilliant individual goal. Stokes was screaming for the ball in the centre and would have had a tap in had the Norwegian squared. Instead he stumbled at the crucial moment, allowing Handanovic to deal with the danger. The Maribor keeper was at it again seconds later, another charging solo run from Virgil van Dijk this time - anding in the Dutchman thudding a 30 yard shot towards the top corner, Handanovic tipping the ball over the bar at the last second. A second goal was desirable for Celtic. But not essential. The key was keeping composure in defence until the end. The arrival of Efe Ambrose at right back offered no guarantee of that, but when Gordon produced another excellent save by leaping to push a 30 yard drive from substitute Ales Mertelj over the bar they were edging closer to a very decent first leg outcome.","McGregor gave Celtic the lead with a close-range finish after six minutes .

"An Oklahoma couple were arrested after police searched their home and found a video showing a dog performing oral sex on the wife. Brenda Mettler, 42, and her husband, 44-year-old Robert Mettler, were arrested last Thursday on charges of crimes against nature/sodomy, cruelty to animals and distributing obscene material. When the Rogers County Sheriff's Office executed a search warrant at the Mettlers' home in Claremore, deputies reportedly came upon a cache of videos showing various breeds of dogs performing sexual acts on women, including intercourse. Dog people: Robert Mettler (left) and Brenda Mettler (right), from Oklahoma, have been charged with crimes against nature/sodomy, cruelty to animals and distributing obscene material for making a video showing their pet dog performing oral sex on the wife . Deputies described what they saw as 'detestable and abominable crimes against nature.' When interviewed by police, Brenda Mettler admitted that she and her spouse made a video a long time ago showing their white boxer performing oral sex on her, according to a police report cited by Tulsa World. Deceased: Mettler said her white boxer (likely similar to the one pictured) have since died) But the 42-year-old insisted that it was a 'one-time deal,' and that the pet in question has since passed away. The woman also claimed that she had no idea her husband had shared the video online. Under questioning, Mr Mettler said it was a fantasy of his to watch dogs have sex with women. The 44-year-old suspect initially said he did not know the video of his wife cavorting with their pet boxer was uploaded online and claimed that his account must have been hacked. But according to the probable cause affidavit, investigators were able to match the clip found on a bestiality forum with footage on Robert Mettler's cellphone. The couple were released from jail Friday after posting $60,000 bail. They are due back in court November 7.","Brenda and Robert Mettler, from Oklahoma, charged with crimes against nature/sodomy, cruelty to animals and distributing obscene material .

"Sergeant Jim Suter encourages his officers to catch up on their paperwork using laptops in coffee shops around the community . Years of hard work are finally paying off for dedicated police officer Jim Suter - who is celebrating the first crime free day in 25 years on the same beat. Sergeant Suter has tirelessly worked to reduce crime in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, since 1988. His days are normally spent dealing with burglaries, muggings, robberies, car theft, vandalism and drunken fighting. But a string of initiatives have seen crime fall - and earlier this week not a single incident was reported in a 24-hour period for the first time on record. Sgt Suter said from 6.30am on Monday to 6.30am on Tuesday this week, nobody in a town of more than 30,000 people reported a crime. Not even a single domestic incident was recorded - which is normally a daily occurrence. Sgt Suter said nobody even had a bike stole and there was not a single complaint of shoplifting. The town will typically see about 10 crimes a day. He said: 'I was really surprised. I certainly have never known that to happen before and I first started here 26 years ago. 'Twenty years ago, Trowbridge was horrendous. You couldn't walk from the station to the town centre on a Saturday night without immediately getting involved in some kind of incident. 'There are things we are doing that are having an impact, though, and our emphasis on being out and about in the town and visible as much as we can has certainly had a positive impact. 'We are also better at targeting repeat offenders as it is true to say that there's only a small number of individuals responsible for the large majority of crime in Trowbridge.' This week was the first time in 25 years Trowbridge Police went 24 hours without any crimes reported . Officers based at Trowbridge Police Station (pictured) do their admin work in public using wifi enabled laptops . But the crime-free days for Trowbridge did not last longer than around 30 hours. By lunchtime on Tuesday, a domestic violence offence, a theft and a burglary had been reported. Sgt Suter pointed to Trowbridge Neighbourhood Police Team's increased use of bikes to increase their visibility on patch, which has helped reduce crime. Officers are also now doing admin work in public thanks to 3G and wifi enabled laptops, giving them more time on the beat. Jim said: 'To not have any reported crime at all is incredibly unusual and it is obviously a bit of an anomaly. 'I've not completely wiped out all crime from Trowbridge forever. 'If it was just one thing that I could put my finger on then I would replicate it, but it's not as easy as that.' A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'The comments made by Sergeant Jim Suter related to a period when no live crimes were reported in the Trowbridge and Bradford-On-Avon areas. 'Clearly, officers would have still been investigating crime reported before this period and going about their daily patrols during this time. The Wiltshire town, with a population of 30,000, normally has about 10 crimes reported each day . Officers are also using bicycles to increase their presence within Trowbridge town (pictured) 'The Trowbridge Neighbourhood Policing Team has increased its visibility over the past few months which has resulted in a drop in reported crime. 'We would always urge anyone wishing to report a crime to do so by calling Wiltshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 where information can be left anonymously.' Trowbridge police are making a strong push to ensure police officers are constantly seen by possible offenders by ensuring they are using bikes and doing paperwork on the go. Sgt Suter said: 'We're also out and about a lot more. We're leading the way with things like getting police back on bicycles - we can do 2,000 miles in a month on the bikes - and more and more foot patrols. 'I'm also very keen that when my officers have paperwork to do, it's done on laptops now so they can go and do it in a coffee shop in town, or at a community centre. 'They are working doing admin, but they are visible.'","Sergeant Jim Suter started working the Trowbridge, Wiltshire beat in 1988 .

"Drivers could be banned from getting behind the wheel after just a single pint under tough new rules proposed by MPs. The All Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse called for a tightening on drink drive rules as part of a raft of measures to combat problem drinking. Members also called for cigarette-style health warnings on wine bottles, a minimum price per unit of alcohol and a strengthening of the rules around advertising alchoholic products. Scroll down for video . Crackdown: New rules proposed by MPs would ban motorists from driving after a single pint of strong lager . 'The facts and figures of the scale of alcohol misuse in the UK speak for themselves,' said Tracey Crouch, Tory MP and chairman of the group. '1.2 million people a year are admitted to hospital due to alcohol; liver disease in those under 30 has more than doubled over the past 20 years; and the cost of alcohol to the economy totals £21 billion.' The group has called on political parties to commit to 10 recommendations which they say will help to minimise alcohol-related harm in the UK. Chief among them is a reduction in the drink-drive limit from 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood to 50mg per 100ml, the Sunday Express reported. So defined, the law would criminalise driving after a single pint of strong lager or a large glass of wine. Younger drivers under the age of 21 would be targeted first. 'The scale of alcohol misuse in the UK speak for itself': Tracey Crouch, Tory MP and chairman of the All Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse . Ms Crouch told Sunday Express health editor Lucy Johnston: 'We have one of the highest alcohol driving limits in the world. 'We have seen drink-driving accidents increase over the past two years and we want to start by targeting younger drivers who are more likely to be involved in a fatal collision than older drivers.' The group also wants to see health warnings and more detailed nutritional labelling on alcohol products. The recommendation document states: 'Health warnings are a familiar and prominent feature on all tobacco products. Likewise, detailed nutritional labelling is ubiquitous on food products and soft drinks. 'Yet consumer information on alcohol products usually extends no further than the volume strength and unit content. 'In order to inform consumers about balanced risk, every alcohol label should include an evidence-based health warning as well as describing the product's nutritional calorific and alcohol content.' Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, vice-chairman of the group, said: 'After smoking, alcohol is the second biggest preventable killer. 'Not only does it cost lives but burdens the NHS and the criminal and justice systems and others with ever increasing costs. 'All the political parties know that but they run for cover when they are confronted by the drinks industry and its immensely powerful lobby. 'These proposals give them another chance to consider whether they really have the guts to take a different line for the country's wellbeing in the future.' Jackie Ballard, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, added: 'We need urgent action to tackle this and the significant harmful effects alcohol misuse causes to individuals. 'I hope all parties will read the manifesto and show a commitment to the vital measures which it highlights.' Under current law, the UK has one of the highest drink-drive limits in Europe. Most countries set the limit at either 0.5mg per ml of blood, the level proposed for under-21s by the latest report. But in a significant chunk of the continent, the limit is just 0.2mg - equivalent to a very small tipple indeed.","MPs call drink-drive limit to be slashed first for younger drivers under 21 .

"Gary Neville believes English football is shooting itself in the foot by allowing foreign players to dominate the Premier League at the expense of home-grown talent.

"Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic will be banned from the touchline when the Turks face Arsenal in London in the second leg of their Champions League play-off next week. Bilic was dismissed from the touchline in the final seconds of the first leg, a stormy goalless draw in Istanbul's Ataturk Olympic Stadium. He hoped it would not incur a ban, since it was at the very end of the match, he apologised immediately and his disciplinary record has been good, but UEFA have confirmed that the automatic one-ban suspension will stand. Trouble: Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic (right) has been handed a minimum one-game suspension by UEFA . You're off! Bilic was sent to the stands as his side drew 0-0 with Arsenal in their Champions League play-off . Their Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will decide on the full extent of the final sanction when they meet next week. It comes as a considerable blow for Besiktas as Bilic is such an influential figure during games, constantly on the touchline, directing his players and motivating. The former West Ham and Everton defender became agitated during the second half as tackles started to fly in from both teams and Aaron Ramsey was sent off for two yellow cards.

Still friends: Bilic (right) admits he apologised to Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (left) after being sent off . He was warned by the Serbian referee Milorad Mazic but continued to berate the fourth official and exploded furiously when the game was halted with Besiktas on the attack so that Mathieu Flamini could receive treatment after being hit by the ball. After the game, Bilic said: 'I have apologised. It was a big game for us, right. I just wasn't happy with some of the decisions. After the game I apologised to the referee and to Mr Wenger. No hard feelings or whatever. I made a mistake. 'Maybe I over-reacted in that situation when he stopped the game when the ball hit Flamini in the stomach and we were in a good position, two against one... But nothing serious happened in that moment or after the game.' Down the tunnel: Gunners midfielder Aaron Ramsey will miss the second leg after being sent off in Turkey .

'I had 60 or 70 games with Croatia, but this is only the second time I've been asked to leave the dug-out. I don't know the rules... but I see no reason for me not to be in the dug-out in London, really. If that was a reason, many coaches would be missing from the dug-out.' The UEFA ban will stand firm. He will be allowed into the Emirates Stadium to watch the second-leg but he will be denied access to his squad, which will keep him out of the dressing room before the game and at half-time. Ramsey will also serve an automatic one-match ban for his red card.

"For Arsene Wenger all that counts is the result. Somehow, this Arsenal team got there in the end. The playing conditions, along with that feeling you get at the start of a new season and facing a team without a manager should have suited them down to a tee. It didn’t.

Palace, without a manager after Tony Pulis walked away on Thursday evening, felt aggrieved. Yes, they probably deserved a point. That was until Aaron Ramsey, a tad subdued in the centre of Arsenal’s midfield alongside Jack Wilshere, came to their rescue in the final minute. Again. For once the Arsenal fans stayed with their team, waiting patiently for the moment when they could win this game with Ramsey’s stabbed effort. ‘I am grateful to the fans because we have to face up to the frustration,’ admitted Wenger. ‘When we were one nil down they stayed behind the team, and at 1-1 they gave us some energy.’ At 2-1, they had done their job, sticking it out and sending their supporters scurrying home happy. Ramsey’s goal was in the last knockings, when Palace were down to ten men after Jason Puncheon was foolishly sent off for a second booking. It was reckless and ill-disciplined, the kind of mistake that would have had Pulis having kittens in the technical area. Arsenal, though, are up and running, recovering from the setback of Brede Hangeland’s debut goal in the 35th minute to go on and secure their first three points of the season. They were far from impressive. Perhaps, in time, we will look back on this result and salute them for sticking this out to the bitter end and biting Palace where it really hurts. It is a measure of any decent team that they are prepared to be patient at times, waiting for the moment to pounce. Palace will know that, particularly after some slack marking allowed Laurent Koscielny to run unmarked into their penalty area and guide Alexis Sanchez’s free kick beyond Julian Speroni. Alexis has the touches, whipping the Arsenal crowd into a frenzy with a series of step-overs at bewildering speed in the first half. What a player he can be. ‘He needs to improve his understanding with his team-mates,’ was Wenger’s assessment of the £33m Chile winger. In time it will come.

So, too, will the performances from this entire Arsenal team as they settle into the rhythm of the regular season. They have already lost Kieran Gibbs to a hamstring injury and they cannot allow another congested medical room to affect their season. There are other issues, such as the scandalous failure to spot Hangeland’s run for his debut goal. Not one Arsenal player tracked him. It was a training ground move, straight out of Pulis’s book and brilliantly executed by Hangeland when his diagonal run met Puncheon’s left-footed inswinging corner. That rattled Arsenal. In midfield the nice touches from Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta, Santi Cazorla, Alexis and Ramsey were going nowhere. They lacked direction and purpose. Koscielny’s set-piece equaliser changed the game, giving Arsenal the impetus to start the second half in a different gear. They did that. The highlights must include Calum Chambers’ performance at the back. He was exceptional, breezing through this game and adapting to his new role in the team. His positioning and anticipation is first class, a refreshing way to look at a young, English central defender. He is a top signing. Wenger knows it and there is a chance that the former Southampton right-back will face Besiktas in Tuesday’s Champions League qualifier in Istanbul on Tuesday. Domestic matters will dominate at Palace this week as attentions turn to the appointment of a new manager. Palace’s directors held a board meeting before Saturday’s game, but they have yet to make a decision on the identity of their next manager.

Grilling: Arsene Wenger is questioned by a reporter from Sky Sports ahead of the match . New hero: An Arsenal fan with a shirt with the name and number of Alexis Sanchez and a Chilean flag outside the Emirates before the match . Arsenal’s chronic set piece problems look likely to continue. New full-back Mathieu Debuchy was guilty of completely losing scorer Brede Hangeland for the opening goal, with the Palace defender ending up five yards off his marker. It remains an area of concern for Arsene Wenger particularly when Per Mertesacker is unavailable. There is an outside chance that they will give it to Keith Millen, the impressive and unassuming caretaker coach who took the team yesterday. He said: ‘I will speak to the chairman. The players respect me and my decisions. ‘It is the start of the season and only one game into it, but we know we can compete at this level. ‘We have identified the areas we need to strengthen and the three players we brought in did well.’ They did, but they switched off at the crucial moment when Koscielny’s header was knocked back across goal by Giroud, before Debuchy’s shot was parried by Speroni only for Ramsey to prod it home. Without Ramsey, Arsenal would be facing up to some familiar problems.","Aaron Ramsey turned ball in from close range in stoppage time to earn Arsenal all three points after Julian Speroni couldn't hold point-blank shot from Mathieu Debuchy .

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today became the most senior Tory politician yet to complain about a newspaper sting targeting MPs online. It follows allegations of 'entrapment' against a newspaper that forced Brooks Newmark to resign as a minister for sending an explicit photograph of himself to an undercover reporter posing as a Tory activist. As another MP said the story could be a test case for the new press regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, Mrs Morgan said the Sunday Mirror 'will have to think about their conduct'. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan today suggested the Sunday Mirror had questions to answer about its sting involving Charities Minister Brooks Newmark, who resigned after sending an explicit photograph of himself to an undercover journalist posing as a Tory activist . Charities Minister Mr Newmark was forced to quit after allegedly sending a picture of himself wearing Paisley pyjamas to a journalist, masquerading as 'Sophie Wittams', via the instant messaging app Whatsapp. Mr Newmark admitted: 'I have been a complete fool.' However, lawyers and media commentators questioned whether there was a public interest in using subterfuge to get the Tory MP to exchange explicit images with an undercover reporter, who was working for the Sunday Mirror. Some even suggested that the paper may have committed a criminal offence by 'tricking' Mr Newmark into sexual activity. A male journalist working for the Sunday Mirror set up a fake Twitter account in the name of Sophie Wittams, supposedly a pretty blonde in her 20s working in PR. 'Sophie' described herself as a 'twenty-something Tory PR girl' in London, and her flirty and flattering tweets attracted the attention of several Tory MPs – including married minister Mr Newmark. Mrs Morgan, who is also the women's minister, said today: 'It is not right that photos are taken without consent from anybody. 'There is also the broader issue of this story and the fact there was a paper that seemed to be out to target a particular group of men. 'They will have to answer, I'm afraid, and I think there are regulations affecting that,' she said at a Tory party conference fringe event reported by The Guardian. 'In relation to my own colleague Brooks Newmark, he was right to resign and he did that quickly … I think people realise this is one person who has made a big mistake and has paid for it massively … People appreciate that we are all flawed human beings. The paper will have to think about their conduct.' Enticing: The Twitter profile picture of 'Sophie Wittams', who is really a Swedish model uninvolved in the sting. Malin Sahlen, 22, last night said it was 'offensive' to use her image without permission . Alluring: This picture of 'Miss Wittam's' legs - actually Miss Tyler's - was used as the journalist encouraged Mr Newmark to send explicit images. Miss Tyler said the MP had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign . Another Tory MP, Mark Pritchard, plans to make a formal complaint over allegations of 'entrapment' against a newspaper that forced Brooks Newmark to resign as a minister for sending an explicit photograph of himself. He said on Twitter he would be referring the story to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which recently replaced the Press Complaints Commission. He told his 3,200 Twitter followers: 'Test case for IPSO Will be making formal complaint over attempted entrapment by Mirror.' Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'It is in the public interest that their actions are fully investigated. This is the first real test as to whether the new body, Ipso, has any teeth.' Conservative MP John Whittingdale (Maldon), who chairs the parliamentary committee that examines press regulation, said the case raised serious questions about whether or not the journalist's method was a legitimate use of subterfuge. He said on first glance he was not convinced it was justified and welcomed the investigation by Ipso. Anger: A photo by 'Sophie Wittams' was in fact of unsuspecting Charlene Tyler, from Lincolnshire . He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme: 'There are strict rules about this ... and on the first sight I'm not convinced that actually this was justified. 'I'm glad it has been referred to Ipso. That will provide the chance for the newspaper to provide justification for the use of these tactics but they will need to have to demonstrate it wasn't a fishing exercise which it looks very much as if it was. 'They will need to demonstrate there was public interest involved. I'm not convinced that was the case either. 'We shall be watching very carefully as this is a test of Ipso.' Former culture secretary Maria Miller, who has been campaigning around the issue of revenge pornography, said the situation 'graphically demonstrates' why people have to be very cautious about the sorts of images they take of themselves and the way they communicate those around the internet. She added: 'I think it is very sad. I think Brooks has contributed enormously to the role of women within my party ... I think he is a great politician.' The Sunday Mirror said the story was in the public interest. Alison Phillips, Mirror weekend editor, told the Guardian: 'This investigation was brought to the Sunday Mirror by a freelance reporter. 'The investigation, which had a clear public interest, was carried out following information from a reliable source.' IPSO's code of practice states editors must justify intrusions into people's private lives, including when using digital communications. It adds: 'Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.' Charlotte Harris, media lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said: 'I think many members of the public reading the Sunday Mirror story will consider that it does amount to entrapment – particularly if you look at when the story has been used.' And criminal barrister Matthew Scott wrote on his blog yesterday: 'What conceivable public interest was served by tricking Mr Newmark in this way?' Lloyd Embley, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror, defended the story after former BBC journalist Sue Llewellyn claimed it was 'unethical'. He tweeted: '1) it wasn't a Mirror sting 2) there's a nailed-on public interest.' The pictures of 'Sophie' on the account appear to have simply been taken from the internet. They show at least two different women – one an unsuspecting young woman from Lincolnshire and the other a blonde model from Sweden, who yesterday made furious claims she had been 'exploited'. Although the name Sophie Wittams was selected for the account, it bears no connection to any real person with that name. However, the bogus profile was still enough to persuade the married Tory minister he was chatting to a young woman – a conversation which culminated in him sending an X-rated photo. The journalist also tried to charm a series of Conservative politicians as 'Miss Wittams' – and a number replied. 'She' described newly-elected Newark MP Robert Jenrick, 32, as a 'fitty', and called housing minister Brandon Lewis, 43, a 'legend'. The reporter also tried to flirt with Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, 43, after he posted a picture of himself with two dogs at a pet shop in his Dover constituency – although the MP simply acknowledged it with a polite reply. Other Tory politicians lauded by 'Miss Wittams' included Dan Byles, 40, Mark Pritchard, 47, and Nick de Bois, 55. The journalist also used the account to tweet about boozy work nights out, sunbathing and sport as well as Conservative policies. There is no suggestion that any MP apart from Mr Newmark behaved inappropriately or sent any explicit material. The fake Twitter profile was set up in May and has now been deleted. Its profile photograph was yesterday revealed to be Swedish model Malin Sahlen, 22, who last night said it was 'offensive' to use her image without permission. ''I have had a lot of emails, texts and phonecalls from different countries about it. It feels unreal,' she tells Aftonbladet. Disgraced: Brooks Newmark with his wife Lucy, just after he was elected MP for Braintree in 2005 . 'I do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible, both for me and others involved in this.' On her blog she writes: 'I feel very confused right now and still can't comprehend that what has happened has happened. I can blog more about this another day, but right now I can't bare to talk about it.' 'This thing feels really unpleasant.' The undercover reporter also used another enticing picture from a young British woman's Twitter page as part of the deception. During the summer heatwave, 'Miss Wittams' tweeted 'Cheeky early finish on a Friday #lappingupthesun'. It was illustrated with a selfie of a woman's tanned legs, which was taken from a tweet sent the previous day by Charlene Tyler, 26, from Boston, Lincolnshire. Miss Tyler told the Daily Telegraph she was upset that the Mirror had hijacked her photo for use in its sting. She said Mr Newmark had nothing to be ashamed of and should have felt no need to resign. 'I think grown adults can do whatever they like as long as both of them are over the age of consent,' she said, adding that she hoped Mr Newmark was okay and revealing she felt 'awful' about her unwitting role in his downfall. 'The fact that a newspaper was stealing my photograph is quite wrong. The newspaper's taken it too far,' she said of the Mirror reporter's use of her photograph. The main focus of the journalist's investigation appears to have been Mr Newmark, 56. 'Miss Wittams' retweeted several of his postings, which covered everything from a concert by The Eagles to a briefing by charities about their work in Rwanda. She wrote 'haha!' when the MP complained about people phoning him during the Wimbledon men's final in July. When Mr Newmark posted a picture of himself with a dog called 'Mrs Thatcher' at a fete in his Braintree constituency, she commented: 'Aww!' Only one of Mr Newmark's replies to 'Miss Wittams' survives. On June 15 he simply wrote: 'delighted!'","Education Secretary and women's minister raises doubts about 'conduct'

"Tim Sherwood is emerging as a strong candidate to replace Tony Pulis as Crystal Palace manager. Eagles chairman Steve Parish has identified Sherwood - who was sacked as Tottenham manager at the end of last season - as a potential contender to take the vacant reins at Selhurst Park. Parish will hold talks with the 45-year-old in the coming days as he looks to appoint Pulis' successor. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tim Sherwood's reign as Tottenham manager . Favourite: Tim Sherwood has emerged as the leading contender to take the Crystal Palace job . Plenty to shout about:  Pulis was unhappy with the transfer policy at Crystal Palace . Sherwood is looking for a route back into the game after leaving White Hart Lane. He came close to becoming Pepe Mel's successor at West Brom earlier this summer, but a move to the Hawthorns collapsed over personal terms. And the former Blackburn midfielder could now be set for a return to football with Palace. Other early candidates for the role include former Cardiff chief Malky Mackay and ex-Norwich manager Chris Hughton. Mackay has been out of work since his acrimonious exit from Cardiff in December and he now wants a return to the game. He has close links with Palace sporting director Iain Moody having worked with him at Cardiff. Hughton, who was sacked by Norwich towards the end of last season, is understood to be an outsider for the role. Parish knows he must appoint a new manager sooner rather later with the transfer deadline now just 16 days away. The club still intend to strengthen their squad before the September 1 deadline, but know they need a manager in situ before pressing ahead with deals. Missed out: Steven Caulker (left) was wanted by Palace but joined London rivals QPR . Pulis walked away from Palace on Thursday night following emergency talks with Parish about their differences over the club's transfer strategy. First team coach Keith Millen will take the team for Saturday's visit to Arsenal. And he said: 'What Tony brought in was the experience and knowledge of what it takes to stay in this league. 'That was the biggest thing that the staff took on straight away. We have lost a great leader of the football club and a leader of men if you like. 'He likes to control what goes on in the football club, but he also controls the players. He is close to the players and he works them hard. 'He’s very structured and organised and single-minded. He knows what he wants and you either do it or you don’t and the players understood that. 'The players have been asking why (has this happened). This has happened three times now, so they was asking why. 'It’s been important to reassure them they’d done nothing wrong. Tony loved working with them. So there were no problems there. 'Now, all of a sudden, they’re wondering who’s going to come in, what direction we’re going to go in.' Award winner: Tony Pulis was named Barclays Premier League manager of the season .

"Harry Redknapp has ended Glenn Hoddle’s eight-year hiatus from club football by recruiting him to radically shake up QPR’s tactical options. The ex-England manager has not worked for a club since he left Wolves in 2006, but has been identified by Redknapp as the perfect coach to help him implement a new 3-5-2 system as Rangers bid to stay in the Premier League. It marks a stunning return for Hoddle, who held talks with Tottenham after Andre Villas-Boas was sacked last season. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Sherwood: The game has moved on since Hoddle managed' Dream team: Glenn Hoddle (right) will work with Harry Redknapp at QPR . Keeping his hand in: Hoddle worked for ITV at the World Cup in Brazil over this summer . The 56-year-old will now form part of Redknapp’s backroom staff alongside Joe Jordan and Kevin Bond as the club look set to ditch the 4-4-2 formation that dominated their promotion campaign. Redknapp said: ‘Glenn will be great. He has a brilliant knowledge of the game and will be fantastic out on the training ground with the players. ‘He is a hugely respected coach. I decided if I was going to bring somebody in, I was going to go for somebody who was top class — and that’s what Glenn is.’ Hoddle said earlier this year that he had received ‘many, many offers’ to return to management since he left Wolves, but opted to run a football academy and work as a pundit. He favoured a 3-5-2 formation when he started at Swindon and Chelsea, before using it sporadically in his ill-fated England tenure. Redknapp is understood to be considering using Rio Ferdinand as a sweeper in a system that will replicate Louis van Gaal’s at Manchester United. Tactical guru: Hoddle used the 3-5-2 formation during his time as England manager . New man: QPR signed Jordon Mutch for £6million last week but lost to PAOK at the weekend . Hoddle said: ‘After winning promotion last season, the first aim at QPR is to stay in the Premier League and I am looking forward to helping play my part as we try to achieve that. ‘I have always loved coaching, and I can’t wait to meet the players, get on the training pitch and get to work.’ Former QPR midfielder Trevor Sinclair believes Hoddle, who faces the test of adapting to a role under another manager, will be a success at Loftus Road. ‘He is one of the most forward-thinking coaches. I think putting him with Harry could be a dream combination,’ he said. The 3-5-2 formation is set to make a comeback with Glenn Hoddle at QPR to implement the system he helped popularise in the 1990s. Hoddle used the formation for England’s 1998 World Cup campaign, having tested it out while manager of Chelsea. At Loftus Road, Rio Ferdinand will play the sweeper role that Hoddle had in mind when signing Ruud Gullit at Stamford Bridge in 1995. Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United revolution will also showcase the system, as he used it to guide Holland to third place at this summer’s World Cup finals in Brazil. Top-level football is saturated with teams playing 4-2-3-1, so playing three at the back allows a side to outnumber the opposition forwards and go man-for-man in midfield while possessing the added attacking threat of two men up front. Width is provided from two wing backs who must be able to contribute in both halves, with United’s signing of Luke Shaw seeing the teenager pencilled into the left-sided role at Old Trafford.

"Spherical fossils in China dating back 600 million years could be the remains of the planet's earliest animals. The fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion. Virginia scientists claim the fossils are too complex to be bacteria, and may instead be the embryos of an ancient unidentified creatures. Spherical fossils in China dating back 600 million years could be the remains of the planet's earliest animals.The fossils are 60 million years older than the date skeletal animals appeared during a huge growth spurt of new life on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion . Called Megasphaera, the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern China called the Doushantuo Formation and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils. Each fossil measures around 0.03 inches (0.7mm) across and originated from what could have been a marine environment at the time. 'This opens up a new door for us to shine some light on the timing and evolutionary steps that were taken by multicellular organisms that would eventually go on to dominate the Earth in a very visible way,' said Shuhai Xiao, a professor of geobiology in the Virginia Tech College of Science. Called Megasphaera, the ancient fossils come from a rock layer in southern China called the Doushantuo Formation and contradict several longstanding interpretations of multicellular fossils . The Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid appearance, around 540 million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as demonstrated in the fossil record. About 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies. Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today. It ended with the Cambrian-Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488 million years ago. 'Fossils similar to these have been interpreted as bacteria, single-cell eukaryotes, algae, and transitional forms related to modern animals such as sponges, sea anemones, or bilaterally symmetrical animals. This paper lets us put aside some of those interpretations.' By cutting the rocks into extremely thin slicers, the scientists were able to shine a light through the fossils to see the formation inside, according to a report in LiveScience. Professor Xiao found patterns in the fossils that suggests cell-to-cell adhesion and programmed cell death - qualities found in the cell of animals and plants. The fossils could represent the shift between single-celled life and multicellular animals, Professor Xiao said. Professor Xiao is now hoping to find more Megasphaera, including fossils of the adult creatures that may have created the embryos. 'We will have to be open-minded in terms of what can be expected,' Professor Xiao told Stephanie Pappas at LiveScience. 'There are extinct animals or even offshoots of the lineages leading to animals that could be rather different from what we know as animals living today.'","Called Megasphaera, the fossils were found in rock in southern China .
