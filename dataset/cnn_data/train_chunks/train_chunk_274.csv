"(CNN) -- Benfica's hopes of snapping a 52-year title drought in Europe were revived by a stunning late winner from substitute Rodrigo Lima in a 2-1 victory over Serie A giants Juventus in Lisbon Thursday. His sublime 84th minute strike left Gianluigi Buffon clutching at fresh air to leave Juventus with work to do in the second leg of the Europa League semifinal in Turin next week. The Italian champions had looked to be in control when Carlos Tevez scored his first goal in European competition for five years to level the match at 1-1 late in the second half. But Benfica's top scorer Lima, on target twice as his side wrapped up their 33rd Portuguese League title at the weekend, had other ideas as he converted from Enzo Perez's pass. In a frantic finale, Claudio Marchisio was twice denied by home goalkeeper Artur Moraes and Benfica might have also added to their tally. Ezequiel Garay headed home from a cross by Miralem Sulejmani to put Benfica ahead after only two minutes, but Juventus came more into the match after the early setback and highly-rated Paul Pogba might have leveled before Tevez struck. The Argentina star, who has plied his trade at both Manchester United and City, was played through by Kwadwo Asamoah and slid the ball under Moraes for a vital away goal. Benfica have not won a major trophy since winning the old European Cup in 1962, despite playing in seven finals in various competitions since, beaten by Chelsea in the title match of the Europa League last year. By legend, the reason for their failure is a 'curse' placed on the side by former coach Bela Guttmann, who guided them to that last success then left over an unpaid bonus, vowing that they would never taste the same success for 100 years. Fine wins over English Premier League Tottenham Hotspur and Dutch side AZ Alkmaar had left Benfica with the opportunity to reach another final, but Juve have the incentive of a possible title match in their home Turin Stadium on May 14. The Italian giants have also waited a long time for a trophy on the European stage, having not triumphed since winning the Champions League in 1996. The other semifinal is an all-Spanish affair and in-form Sevilla beat Valencia 2-0 thanks to two goals in just three minutes in the first half. Stephane Mbia and Carlos Bacca scored for the home side, who have won 13 of their last 16 games, including a victory over Real Madrid.","Benfica beat Juventus 2-1 in Europa League semifinal first leg .

"(CNN) -- I've never really needed an extra ear. But theoretically, I suppose I could grow one with a 3-D science printer and scare children in the park. ""Robots are taking all your future jobs! You won't be better off than your parents! Earth is becoming unlivable! Mwahaha!"" Mind you, the ear would be back at home. These missions are unrelated. But, yes, though it might seem crazy, we now know that this is possible, because a German artist named Diemut Strebe has successfully ""regrown"" Vincent van Gogh's legendary severed ear. It's a piece she calls ""Sugababe,"" and is on display at the ZKM Karlsruhe Museum, where you can actually speak into van Gogh's ear with a special microphone, magically confessing all your secrets to the deceased artist. ""Vincent ... I'm not wearing pants."" ""Sir, we know. Please come with us."" It's been 126 years since the famous Dutch painter supposedly hacked off part of his ear, but new technology and a little creative thinking managed to bring it back to life. Sort of. Here's how it worked: . When Strebe came up with her idea, she originally wanted to procure some DNA from an envelope that it was believed van Gogh had once licked. ""Publishers Clearing House. Vincent van Gogh, you may already be a winner. HOT DAMN! I gotta get this in the mail!"" However, it turned out that the DNA wasn't a match, so she found an actual modern day descendant of Vincent, the great-great-grandson of his brother Theo. Which I'm sure resulted in a rather awkward phone call. ""Right. Sooooo, I need some of your DNA for this ... ear I'm building."" This modern descendent would be Lieuwe van Gogh, who, it turns out, shares a Y-chromosome and one-sixteenth of Vincent's genome. In case you were wondering, Iggy Pop was not a match. Nobody checked. But I'm telling you he wasn't a match. So, now they had some living cells from Lieuwe (pronounced: ""Dave""), and that led Strebe to the next step in the process, which was making a mold of van Gogh's ear with a 3-D printer. The shape was modeled and designed by closely computing photos of van Gogh. And it had to be photos. Despite Vincent's talent, for an accurate reading, his self portraits were just a little too post-impressionisty. Next, Strebe needed to get her hands on some cartilage cells. Which, I assume, is not something you can do by, say, hitting up your local corner dope pusher or stopping into Trader Joe's. ""Three bells!"" Nevertheless, obtained cartilage cells were injected with Lieuwe's DNA and added to the 3-D mold that had been created with a dissolvable sugar-polymer scaffolding. And there it sat, inside a bioreactor, for several weeks, where, as the scaffolding dissolved, the cells grew, strengthened, and filled in empty spaces. And then (poof!) you had van Gogh's ear. So long as we have a very loose definition of what we are willing to consider van Gogh's ear. But we definitely had something. And while the ear now sits suspended in a nutrient solution in Germany, the plan is to move the display to New York in 2015. By then, though, I'm hoping we can add a few more famous missing parts to the exhibit, starting with Jerry Garcia's right-hand middle finger. Which just so happens to be the exact same missing digit as Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel's. (Fun fact. Bet you didn't know that.) Look, I'm no artist. Hell, I think Dogs Playing Poker is one of the greatest cultural achievements in human history. But, that said, I'm pretty sure a regenerated middle-finger-face-off between Jerry Garcia and Rahm Emanuel would be worthy of its own room at the MOMA next to van Gogh's ear. But good luck getting the genetics. ""Right. Sooooo, Rahm, I need some of your DNA for this ... middle finger I'm building."" Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Add another name to the list of political observers who think a Clinton-Obama ticket would be unbeatable: Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Cuban President Fidel Castro, shown in a file photo, says a Clinton-Obama ticket in 2008 would be ""invincible."" In an editorial in Cuba's communist party newspaper, Granma, the ailing dictator called the pairing of the two White House hopefuls ""invincible,"" according to an English translation on the paper's Web site. Castro, who has overseen communist rule of Cuba since 1959, did, however, make it clear that he is no fan of the two Democrats' support of democratic reform in Cuba. ""Both of them feel the sacred duty of demanding 'a democratic government in Cuba,'"" Castro wrote. ""They are not making politics: they are playing a game of cards on a Sunday afternoon.""

"(CNN) -- Shortly after Salwa Bugaighis posted the names of three security force members killed in Benghazi on Wednesday on her Facebook page, she became the fourth person to die in the Libyan city that day. Bugaighis, one of the most prominent faces of Libya's 2011 revolution, was shot in the head in her own home. Local media reported she had also been stabbed several times. Bugaighis' husband, Issam, was thought to have been with her in the house and is reported missing. Friends and family believe he was abducted by the attackers. Bugaighis was a lawyer, a human rights and women's rights activist, and one of the first Libyans to take to the streets of Benghazi in February 2011 to protest against the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. Her assassination came hours after she cast her ballot in the country's second parliamentary election since the revolution. Photos of her voting were circulated on social media within moments of the news of her death. ""The shocking, ruthless killing of Salwa Bugaighis robs Libyan civil society of one of its most courageous and esteemed figures. But sadly she is by no means the first activist struck down during the political violence that has plagued the country since the uprising and in its aftermath,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""The Libyan authorities must do everything possible to ensure that Salwa Bugaighis' death is fully, independently and impartially investigated and that anyone responsible is held to account -- something they have patently failed to do in previous political killings."" 'True Libyan patriot' Messages of support and mourning came from around the world. ""Outraged by senseless murder of Salwa Bugaighis. She was a courageous and inspiring leader. We join the Libyan people in mourning her loss,"" White House national security adviser Susan Rice said in a tweet. Deborah K. Jones, the current U.S. Ambassador to Libya, wrote on her Twitter account: ""A cowardly, despicable, shameful act against a courageous woman and true Libyan patriot. Heartbreaking."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague also tweeted: ""Shocked and saddened by the killing of Salwa Bugaighis who was a passionate campaigner for the ideals of the revolution in Libya."" In a moving tribute, Human Rights Watch's Peter Bouckaert said: ""On Wednesday, following countless threats against her and her family, Salwa was assassinated, shortly after she voted in Libya's parliamentary election. With Salwa's death, the original idealism of the 2011 uprising that overthrew Gadhafi's tyranny has received another crushing blow, and many Libyan women have lost a role model."" Campaign of violence . Over the past two years, the security situation in Benghazi -- the cradle of Libya's revolution -- has seriously deteriorated. Bombings, kidnappings and killings have become near daily in a campaign of violence that has mainly targeted members of the security forces. Judges, activists and journalists have also been attacked. No group has claimed these attacks, but officials and Benghazi residents blame the violence on Islamist extremist groups that have grown in size and influence since the fall of the regime. Last month, Libyans mourned another known figure, an outspoken critic of extremist groups, newspaper editor Muftah Buzeid was shot dead in broad daylight while driving in Benghazi. Three years after being one of the first voices of the uprising and a founding member of the country's first governing body -- the National Transitional Council -- Bugaighis had continued to work to establish a better country and achieve the goals of the revolution. More recently, she had been a member of the preparatory committee for national dialogue, working to bring together Libyans divided along regional, tribal and ideological lines. Despite the increasing threat from radical groups, Bugaighis continued her activism and remained unveiled in a city where only a few dared to. ""We believe that Salwa Bugaighis may have been targeted for both her political activism and her role in promoting women's rights,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. Libyans across the country took to social media, sharing their shock, grief, and anger. An online petition was started calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. ""Salwa was always present, at those early demonstrations where she would march at the front and whisper to me, we're not going to let them put us (women) at the back or in separate lines "" said Huda Abuzeid, a friend of Bugaighis. ""She was always present, working tirelessly to support national dialogue and rule of law and still marching. An original leader of the revolution, a proud mother, an inspiring woman and supportive generous friend, she was charismatic, outspoken and fearless and she was always here."" Election day . In a tragic postscript, Bugaighis plotted her final hours on her Facebook page. She began the day urging her fellow Libyans to go out that day and vote. ""The blood of our martyrs will not prevent us from exercising our constitutional duty for the nation,"" she wrote. She then posted three photographs of herself voting at a polling station in Benghazi. The country's new parliament is to be based in Benghazi despite the recent uptick in violence after a retired military general and his loyalist forces reclaimed the city from Islamist militants. Benghazi was also the city where U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed by suspected Islamists in the U.S. Consulate in September, 2012. Election day in Benghazi bought more violence, with Bugaighis posting photographs from her roof showing smoke rising in the distance from what she thought was a nearby international school after being hit by gunfire. She later rang in to Libya TV and described the sound of fighting near her home as militants fought with the military. Gunfire could be heard in the background. 'More than just words' Family members and friends said Bugaighis and her family moved overseas early this year. She and her husband only returned recently to the city. ""What now? Does she become just another poster to carry? Another name lost? Another death that we owe a debt to? That's all I will hold onto now ... we have a responsibility that those who murdered her, in her own home will not be the winners,"" Abuzeid said in a Facebook post. ""Because we will not, cannot, let those murdering cowardly scum write the end of this story ... That's what we owe Salwa, Salwa who went back to Benghazi and amidst the fighting went out and took part and voted, who spoke out, who worried about those being killed, who did more than just talk,"" Abuzeid wrote. ""She did her part and however much it pains us, anything other than carrying on and doing our part is a betrayal to her and all those who have died ... her family, Libya and she deserve more from us than just words ..."" Libyan communities overseas are planning several memorial events this weekend.","Lawyer and activist Salwa Bugaighis was shot, stabbed in her Benghazi home June 25 .

"(CNN) -- Four journalists and an executive from a Myanmar magazine have been sentenced to 10 years of hard labor on charges of violating state secrets by claiming the military was making chemical weapons. The sentencing has drawn an outcry from international media and rights watchdogs, who say it is evidence of a drastic rollback of press freedoms this year in a country that had been praised for its reforms since 2011. Those sentenced -- reporters Yazar Soe, Sithu Soe, Lu Maw Naing, and Paing Thet Kyaw and chief executive Tint San -- all worked for the Yangon-based current affairs magazine Unity Weekly, said Tint's lawyer, Than Saw Aung. They had been convicted under the country's 1923 State Secrets Act, Than said, adding that his client would appeal the sentence. The periodical, which has since been shuttered, had published stories in January alleging that Myanmar's military had seized hundreds of hectares of land to build a factory to manufacture chemical weapons, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Myanmar's government has previously denied accusations it has used chemical weapons against ethnic rebels. ""CPJ is alarmed that journalists were tried under a 100-year-old spying statute and slammed with an outrageously harsh sentence,"" said CPJ's Asia program coordinator Bob Dietz, Asia program coordinator in a statement calling for donor countries to Myanmar to exert pressure over the case. ""This conviction should shatter any illusions that President Thein Sein's government grasps the role of a free press in a democracy."" Myanmar's presidential spokesman Ye Htut could not be reached for comment. 'Back to square one' Scores of journalists, some of them wearing T-shirts that read ""Stop killing press,"" gathered at Yangon's Shwedagon Pagoda Friday offering prayers for the sentenced journalists Friday, while some publications printed blacked-out front pages in protest. Aung Zaw, editor of news magazine The Irrawaddy, told CNN the case showed it was ""back to square one"" in terms of press freedom in Myanmar, also known as Burma. ""The sad fact is Burma overnight restored its former title as enemy of the press,"" he said. The government could have asked for a retraction or correction if the report was untrue, he said, or prosecuted the Unity staff using newly passed media laws. Instead, it had chosen to bludgeon them using the colonial-era State Secrets Act to send ""a serious warning to other journalists."" He said the harsh sentences handed down had shocked journalists, but also made them more resolute not to back down from their work. Tide turned . While Myanmar has been praised for reforms in recent years, rights groups say the tide appears to have turned when it comes to media freedom. Benjamin Ismail, the head of Reporters Without Borders' Asia-Pacific desk, described the court's decision in a statement as ""a grave setback for press freedom."" He said it marked ""a return to a dark time when journalists and bloggers who did their job were jailed on national security charges or for allegedly trying to overthrow the government."" Rupert Abbott, Amnesty International's deputy Asia-Pacific director, said in a statement that the sentences reflected ""a wider crackdown on free media since the beginning of the year, despite government assurances that such practices would end."" Myanmar President Thein Sein warned in a speech earlier this week that the increased press freedom the country had enjoyed should be used without threatening the stability of the state, the state-run New Light of Myanmar reported. Reporters Without Borders says that while no journalists were imprisoned in Myanmar in 2012, they have been the target of a growing number of prosecutions this year. Reporters from local media outlets have been jailed this year, and a foreign journalist deported after covering a press freedom rally. Zaw said the resumption of official antagonism towards the fourth estate was reflected in a visit to The Irrawaddy's newsroom by special branch officers in recent weeks. He claimed the officers, who would not reveal who had sent them, had harassed staff about the magazine's editorial positions and finances. ""It was a sign of intimidation,"" he said. Burma is ranked 145th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index. Ei Mon Kyaw and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Five magazine staffers in Myanmar have been sentenced to a decade of hard labor .

"(CNN) -- It's been described as one of the greatest Victorian gothic horror stories of all time. Two ships with 129 men on board and fitted with the latest technology, vanish with barely a trace left behind. One hundred and sixty years of searching -- one attempt as recent as last month -- have failed to find ""HMS Erebus"" and her sister ship, the somewhat appropriately named ""HMS Terror"" -- the two vessels lost in the Arctic. In 1845 British Royal Navy captain Sir John Franklin set out with some of the finest sailors of the time on a mission to map the Northwest Passage. Franklin's expedition wasn't the first to the region, but it is the most infamous. ""Why did this fail when all the others didn't,"" asks author William Battersby. ""There was something jinxed about the expedition."" Battersby is one of many to be transfixed by the mystery of Franklin's last voyage. ""We love adventure stories, of derring-do, win against all odds, but in this story they don't and we still don't know why."" The environment of the Northwest Passage is unforgiving. The landscape is vast and deserted, comparable only to Jupiter's moons. The winters are unrelenting and bleak. Franklin's men were faced with particularly brutally harsh temperatures and blizzards when they reached the region. Despite the ships being reinforced with steel and holding three years worth or provisions, it appears the environment got the better of the crew. ""Man proposes, God disposes,"" says Bob Headland from the Scott Polar Research Institute, who regularly visits the region. '""And the ice gods are a fickle lot."" The disappearance of the Erebus and the Terror has prompted the longest search mission in history: Although there have been numerous attempts to find the ships, there has been no sign of them. Ryan Harris from Parks Canada led the most recent mission to try to locate the shipwrecks. Last month, his crews spent hours scouring the ocean floor, searching waters up to 50 meters deep. ""It's an incredible story. It's got shipwrecks, the remoteness of the Arctic, putting the might of English industrialism against Mother Nature,"" says Harris. Since 1997 Parks Canada has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to locate the ""Erebus"" and ""Terror."" The tale of the Franklin expedition has enthralled Canadians -- the wreckage has the dubious honor of being the only national historic site in Canada that hasn't been found yet. ""Once Franklin received his orders that sealed his fate,"" Harris explains. ""In directing them south-west into ultimately the Victoria Strait it took them to the ice choke point. Once they fell into the clutch of that area, their fate was sealed. There's not much wildlife there and it is isolated."" The last known account of the ""Erebus"" and ""Terror"" came in 1848. A rock cairn with a message on it indicated that the harsh conditions had already claimed their first lives, with only 105 men left alive. Franklin was one of the first casualties of his own expedition. That same year the men abandoned their ships, archaeologists believing they began making their way south in a desperate bid to find food. However the harsh environment supported little, and with few animals to hunt and over 100 men to feed, the chance of survival was low. It's been suggested that the men may have resorted to cannibalism in their last-ditch efforts to survive. ""There were far too many men to live off the environment. What man plans and what nature allows are two different things,"" says Headland. Archaeologists have relied heavily upon oral Inuit history to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Based on their accounts it is thought some of the men lived for another three or four years after abandoning ship. But questions remain over exactly what happened to them. In 160 years only two skeletons and three perfectly preserved bodies have been uncovered. It is likely diseases such as scurvy claimed many lives but Battersby believes it may have been the ships themselves that killed the sailors. His theory is that the men succumbed to lead poisoning derived from the internal pipe system used to melt ice into drinking water. It's hoped the discovery of the ships will provide answers. '""There's a charm to the story,"" acknowledges Harris. ""By solving a mystery it takes the allure away."" But having said that, Harris is determined the search will go on until the ""Erebus"" and the ""Terror"" are found. Parks Canada insists that their searches have not been futile and they'll continue to gather information to help with future efforts. ""I hope we're the last,"" says Harris. But after 160 years it's possible that this tale may be frozen in time forever. ""These are the last of the ghost ships,"" says Battersby. ""It is the world's biggest ghost story.""","In 1845 Sir John Franklin and 129 men set out on a mission to map the Northwest Passage .

"(CNN) -- A state commission issued a finding of probable cause that racism was involved in the decision by a suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, swim club to revoke privileges of a largely minority day care center. Some kids from the Creative Steps Day Care center say club members made racist remarks. The Valley Swim Club canceled a contract for swimming privileges for the approximately 65 children from the Creative Steps day care center after a visit June 29. Some black and Hispanic children said white club members made racist comments to them during that visit, asking why black children were there and raising concerns that ""they might steal from us."" The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, in its 33-page finding, details the incident. It notes that the swim club maintains that it canceled its relationship with the day care center because members were requesting that their membership fees be refunded and because of safety concerns ""attendant with overcrowding of the shallow end of the pool by a large number of non-swimmers."" But the commission, in its finding, stated that the club ""routinely has members at the facility in numbers that are equal in size or exceed the number of Creative Steps campers."" The club has also hosted groups of similar size without raising safety concerns, the commission said. As the group was swimming at the club, one of its members voiced concerns that ""all of these black kids"" might ""do something to my child."" When confronted by a Creative Steps official, the woman -- a teacher at a local school -- denied the comment but said she was concerned because one of the children ""was a known thief"" and had previously stolen a cell phone. The commission found no evidence that the child was ever accused of or disciplined for stealing at the school. Other group members sent negative e-mails to club board members after the incident. One board member said in an e-mail, according to the commission, ""I feel we were mislead (sic) with the type of camp this was. This camp is a city camp and it is run with tax payers money. This is not the type of camp that is going to bring any new members into the club."" The finding is ""an invitation to sit down with our staff and have the parties settle their differences,"" commission Chairman Stephen Glassman said. ""If they don't, it will go on to a public hearing."" Depending on the outcome of that process, the club could face damages for humiliation and embarrassment, as well as a civil penalty of up to $50,000, commission spokeswoman Shannon Powers said. The public hearing, she said, is held before a body of commissioners. The commission enforces state human rights law, Powers said. It launched an investigation into the incident after being contacted by a number of advocacy organizations following media coverage of the story. Since then, she said, a number of complaints have been filed with the commission. The commission noted in the finding that none of the club's 155 paid members this year was African-American and that last year there were ""179 paid memberships, none of whom were African American."" In addition, the commission said that in 2009, the Valley Swim Club ""made a concerted effort to expand the geographic range of its membership by engaging in a marketing campaign. ... The respondent efforts were mainly directed at areas with overwhelmingly caucasian populations. ... The respondent made no effort to direct such marketing efforts at areas with significant African-American populations."" Glassman said the swim club had 30 days to appeal the finding. Joe Tucker, a lawyer for the club, said his client will do just that. ""We believe this is wrong,"" he said. ""I believe the people at the PHRC are very good people, but they were put in a tough position. ... If the PHRC would have decided against the children or in favor of the club, they would have been painted with the same unfair and untrue racist brush that the Valley Swim Club was painted with."" The day care center had originally contracted to use the pool during the summer, but the club canceled the agreement and returned the day care center's $1,950 check without explanation. The club canceled contracts with two other day care centers because of safety and crowding, swim club director John Duesler said. Those facilities have not protested the club's actions. The issue was exacerbated when Duesler told two Philadelphia television stations that the children had changed ""the complexion"" and ""atmosphere"" of the club. The comment brought protesters outside the facility. Duesler later said that safety and crowding, not racism, prompted the cancellation. As the controversy gained national attention, the swim club asked the day care center to return. Center officials refused and said they would pursue a lawsuit.","State panel finds race was factor in banning minority children from swim club .

"(CNN) -- It's bad enough that the recovery from the Great Recession has been slow and uneven. What's much worse is that several key indicators were heading in the wrong direction well before it started. Median income in the U.S. has been stagnant or worse for at least 15 years, even as the big-ticket items of college, health care and housing have become more expensive. The middle class has for decades been getting ""hollowed out"" by job loss and wage decreases. Social mobility -- the odds that children will do better than their parents -- is now lower in America than in most European countries, an uncomfortable truth for the land of opportunity. Entrepreneurship is declining (the amazing recent successes in the tech industry are the exception, not the rule), as is the percentage of GDP getting paid out in wages and benefits. This dour economic litany has helped give rise to movements of discontent like the tea party on the right and Occupy on the left. It's also led to a flood of proposed solutions ranging from a return to the gold standard to confiscatory taxes on high levels of income and wealth. We don't think such radical fiscal or monetary measures are warranted. The main pilings of our economic system are not so rotten that they need to be replaced. What we need instead is to return to excellence at two of our historical strengths: coming up with important innovations and finding ways to include a great many people in our journey of progress. When it comes to technology, innovation is astonishingly robust these days. Recent digital advances are truly the stuff of science fiction: fully autonomous cars and planes, artificial intelligence systems that can understand and produce human speech, robots for everything from painting cars to milking cows, printers that can make industrial-strength 3-D objects and so on. Technology is racing ahead so quickly, in fact, that it's leaving a lot of our institutions, organizations, policies and practices behind. It's in these latter areas where we must increase the pace of innovation. The solution is not to slow technology down but instead to speed up the invention of new jobs. That requires unleashing entrepreneurs' creativity. It also requires a host of other conditions. • Are our regulations keeping up with new companies that let people summon a ride on the fly or rent out a room in their house? • Are large employers able to look beyond the traditions of resume, transcript and interview when evaluating job candidates and learn how to value alternate signals like performance in a massive open online course? • Will our primary education system decrease its current emphasis on rote learning and standardized testing and start teaching skills computers don't have, such as creativity and problem-solving? • Can we remove the Kafkaesque barriers in place today that prevent so many of the world's most talented, tenacious and ambitious people from immigrating to the United States? Will the government start spending adequately in the areas where we know it pays off, like infrastructure and basic research? Too often today, the answers to questions like these are ""no"" or ""not enough."" We're quickly heading into what we call the second machine age: a time of transformation brought on digital technologies that will be as big a deal as the Industrial Revolution. To succeed in it, we'll need to address the questions above and innovate widely and deeply, for two reasons. The first is to maximize this age's benefits and bounty. The second, more important reason is to include as many people as possible in both producing its fruits and sharing them. The greatest flaw with our current path is the fact that a large group is being left out in every important sense. Too many people aren't getting the skills and support they need in order to participate in a rapidly changing economy and don't feel that they have any stake in a society that's being created around them and without them. As a result, many are dropping out -- of education, of the work force, out of their communities and out of family life. Whether or not the growing ranks of the unincluded and disaffected ever cause social unrest, they're still a deep problem. America's history of assimilation and participation is far from perfect, but it's still impressive. It has contributed to a thriving democracy and a large, stable and prosperous middle class, both of which have been the envy of the world. The evidence is mounting, however, that our great successes of inclusion are starting to reverse themselves. We need to harness our unmatched powers of innovation to make sure that this does not happen.","Authors: Economy is generating tech innovation, but too many people are left out .

Fifteen others were severely injured. The accident happened before dawn 108 miles (175 kilometers) north of Lome as a bus carrying passengers to Lome collided with a truck, according to a government statement read on state TV Tuesday evening. A minibus was also involved in the crash. Survivors said the driver of the full-size bus mistook the truck for a motorbike because the truck had only one headlight. Togo President Faure Gnassingbe expressed his compassion to the families of the bereaved and dispatched a couple of ministers to the scene. About 300 people have died in road accidents in Togo since January, officials said. More than 3,000 people lost their lives and more than 37,000 were injured on the West African nation's roads in the past four years, with a record 753 people killed in 2012. Causes include the bad state of roads, vehicles that have mostly secondhand engines, speed, failure to use seat belts or wear helmets, and driving without license. Road accidents have become a major cause of disabilities in Togo in the past two decades, health officials say. Bus crash kills 36 in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- A traffic snarl outside Washington's Navy Yard -- not a tactical command decision -- prevented a special U.S. Capitol Police unit from responding at the scene of a mass shooting there in September, an internal police report found on Friday. Twelve people were killed in the September 16 rampage by gunman Aaron Alexis, who was also killed during a shootout with other law enforcement officers. The deployment disclosure came after some initial media reports said the Containment Emergency Response Team was one of the first on the ongoing shooting scene, then turned away at the command center, and subsequently pulled back. ""Initial reports of the actions of USCP personnel were inaccurate and failed to convey the nuanced complexity of such situations including the personal and professional impact on potential first responders,"" said a summary of the report by the U.S. Capitol Police Board. The shooting at the Navy Yard facility several blocks south of the U.S. Capitol complex attracted a number of law enforcement, including some Capitol Police officers who ""self-deployed."" The board's review team interviewed dozens of Capitol Police officers and examined written reports, radio transmissions, and command center incident logs. The report did not deal with actions taken by other federal and local law enforcement, including military police officers. Following some initial reports about the CERT's deployment, the local police union at the time had urged an investigation into the team's actions and orders. ""They were prepared to risk their lives to save the lives of the shooter's victims, but were prevented from doing so,"" labor committee Chairman James Konczos said in a statement a week after the shooting. ""It is impossible to say how the outcome would have been different if the CERT team had been permitted to respond."" Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine then ordered the police board review team to look into the allegations the special response team was diverted from the shooting scene. ""Because of traffic gridlock caused by both emergency vehicles and commuter traffic the CERT unit was unable to reach that incident command post,"" said the report. ""The CERT unit then moved closer to the Capitol, increasing its flexibility to respond as needed at either the Capitol or the Navy Yard."" Officials had said there was initial concern the Capitol might become a secondary target, promoting an increased security presence there. CNN's Paul Courson, Carol, Cratty and Joe Johns contributed to this report.","There were suggestions the U.S. Capitol Police special response unit was diverted .

"Meiktila, Myanmar (CNN) -- Hnin Ei Phyu rides her motorbike across the city, goes out to dinner with Buddhist friends and has resumed her studies at a local university. Life has made a 180-degree turn for this 20-year-old Muslim woman. In March last year, her life was shattered by an explosion of sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims in her hometown of Meiktila in central Myanmar, which left more than 40 people dead and thousands more homeless. Hnin Ei Phyu's family fled for their lives during the first of three days of rioting and spent more than a month in a shelter at a nearby sports stadium. Violent clashes . During the clashes, which reportedly erupted after a dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers, rioters set fire to houses, schools, businesses and mosques. People were also beaten, doused with gasoline and set on fire. Meiktila's Muslims were heavily outnumbered and suffered the bulk of the casualties. For more than a month, few (if any) Muslims remained in their homes because they were either destroyed or it simply wasn't safe for them to stay there. Hnin Ei Phyu's family was among the first group of Muslims to return home after the worst of the violence. Unlike others, their house was still standing. While some Muslims were returning, interviews with many people across the city made it clear that trust between Muslims and their Buddhist neighbors was broken. Police and soldiers were now stationed on streets where Muslims lived to protect them against further attacks. Hnin Ei Phyu's university was shut down. She was no longer in contact with her Buddhist friends and her parents would not allow her to go more than a short distance from their home. More than a year on, a return trip to the city revealed that although extremist elements remain, relations have warmed between many Buddhists and Muslims in the community. ""We're close again,"" Hnin Ei Phyu said about her relationships with Buddhist friends. ""We spend time after classes and enjoy each other's company now, whether we talk about movies or eat together."" Time heals wounds . Her mother, Thidar Hla, agreed distrust has gradually given way to friendship. ""Time healed many of the wounds,"" she said. There are no longer police or troops stationed on Thidar Hla's street, and her family is no longer afraid to go anywhere in the city. This change in attitude is not exclusive to one side of the sectarian divide. Last year, U Aung Khin, a 51-year-old Buddhist man, told me he stopped talking to his Muslim friends and would not even go to his usual Muslim butcher because he was afraid his food might be poisoned. ""Now I'd go to a Muslim butcher and my relationships with my Muslim friends are back to normal,"" he said. Sann Win Shein, a Muslim and vice president of a local interfaith group called Meiktila Unity and Prosperity Association, says people have not forgotten what happened but realize that it wasn't necessarily their neighbors who were the main culprits behind the riots. He blames extremist groups, adding that when angry mobs are divided along sectarian lines, normally peaceful people can get caught up in the rage and emotion. He also blames the local police for not stepping in early on -- last year's violence didn't stop until President Thein Sein declared a state of emergency and called in the military after three days of rioting. Leaders of the interfaith group acknowledge that the attitudes of some people might never change, but they insist they're in the minority. ""Within six months many people were back to being friends,"" said Khin Soe, a Buddhist. Khin Soe says he's optimistic this community can avoid a repeat of last year's deadly riots. ""So many of these people have lived side by side for years and have been friends for years,"" he said. This interfaith group, made up of Buddhists and Muslims from the community, started in May 2013 and during the course of an eight-month campaign handed out thousands of t-shirts, baseball caps and stickers with words that translate to ""No religious violence because of me."" Long-persecuted Rohingya . The rekindling of friendships between Buddhists and Muslims in Meiktila is quite different from the situation between Rohingya Muslims and ethnic Rakhines in Myanmar's western Rakhine State. The Rohingya are a long-persecuted minority in Myanmar who are denied citizenship and usually are not allowed to leave Rakhine. Unlike Meiktila, where Buddhists and Muslims live side by side, the Rohingya live in separate villages -- more than 140,000 live in camps for the displaced after their homes were destroyed in riots two years ago. The communal violence there also resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people. Many Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations and were brought here from India when Myanmar was a British colony called Burma. Many ethnic Burmese view the Rohingya as illegal intruders from what's now Bangladesh, and refuse to call them Rohingya, using the term Bengali instead. But in Meiktila, where trust between Buddhists and Muslims is being rebuilt, sections of the city remain in ruins. In the Muslim majority Thiri Mingalar Quarter, there are only rocks and dirt where many homes and businesses used to stand. A few people, who have the financial means, have started rebuilding. Rebuilding lives . The only section of the city that has a lot of construction underway is Chan Aye Tharyar Quarter. All 760 homes in the neighborhood were lost -- the majority of them belonged to Muslim families. Construction has started on about 350 houses. ""I want to bring back those families who lost their homes to these new homes,"" said construction project manager, U Myint Htwe, adding that they're building homes for Muslims, Buddhists, Christians and Hindus. He says the government is covering the costs of building roads, water lines and utility lines, but the money to cover the estimated $6 million needed to replace the homes is being raised privately. Most of the donors are Muslims living in Yangon, the country's biggest city and commercial capital. MM Raunat Group, which is connected to a mosque in Yangon, is handling the fundraising and the rebuilding of Chan Aye Tharyar Quarter. But U Myint Htwe says organizers have only been able to raise half of the money they need so far. He says he has no idea when he'll be able to finish the project. Returning home . Nwe Nwe Oo is one of the Chan Aye Tharyar residents who hope to go back. ""I'm always thinking about it,"" she said. ""I even cry."" She's one of more than 5,000 people still living in shelters and camps for the displaced. Nwe Nwe Oo's shelter is for Muslims and is on the grounds of a local university about 14 miles outside of Meiktila. She has spent more than a year living inside a 15 by 20 foot room in a bamboo shelter without running water with her husband and two children, aged 12 and 14. They have to walk for a few minutes to access the nearest toilet and shower. Nwe Nwe Oo cooks the family's meals over a tiny, charcoal barbecue, one of dozens lined in orderly rows in the camp. Despite the tight living quarters, Nwe Nwe Oo says she is thankful. ""I'm grateful to have a safe place to stay,"" she said. Memories of the riots in Meiktila haven't faded, but many people here are cautiously optimistic about the direction things are heading. Last year, they talked about distrust and broken bonds. Now some of those same people discuss rebuilding the city and rekindling friendships between Buddhists and Muslims, all the while hoping that extremists don't find a way to divide their community again.","Hnin Ei Phyu's family fled their home during 2013 violence in Meiktila .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be part of the magic of taking the World Cup to Brazil, that a city deep in the heart of the legendary Amazonian rainforest would be hosting matches. Barring major mishap, this will come to pass but the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus may well become a venue that is remembered more for tragedy than any football theater. For the 42,000-seater arena, whose four matches include the clash between former world champions England and Italy, has been beset by problems during construction. On Friday, Antônio José Pita Martins became the third worker to die while working in or near the ground, a tally that accounts for half the fatalities during construction of the 12 stadiums for June's finals. The 55-year-old died after being struck on the head by a piece of falling iron as a crane that had been used to build the stadium's roof was dismantled outside the arena in northern Brazil. A hospital statement later said that a combination of head and chest injuries had caused Martins' death. ""With great sadness we send our sincere condolences to the family, on behalf of both FIFA and the Local Organising Committee,"" wrote FIFA Secretary General Jérôme Valcke on Twitter. Work at the Arena da Amazonia, which football's world governing body FIFA had wanted to be finished in December, is one of several stadiums in Brazil running behind schedule - with just 125 days to go before the tournament begins. In December, Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira died after falling nearly 35 meters from the roof of the stadium. The 22-year-old's death, which followed Manaus' first fatality in March 2013, prompted his fellow construction workers to go on strike until they received assurances of improved safety conditions. These appear to still be in some doubt following the death of Martins, a Portuguese national. A statement was released by Brazil's Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo expressing regret for the death. ""The Sports Ministry laments the death of worker Antônio José Pita Martins, victim of an accident at the construction site of the Arena da Amazonia, on Friday, in Manaus,"" he said. ""Personally and in the name of the federal government, I express deep regret and express my feelings and solidarity with the family and friends of the worker."" It is wording with which Rebelo is becoming depressingly familiar, having released a nearly identical statement in the wake of Ferreira's death. Two other workers were killed last November in Sao Paulo, following the collapse of a crane at the stadium set to host the opening game of the finals on June 12, while another died in Brasilia. The Manaus stadium will also stage the following matches: United States-Portugal, Cameroon-Croatia and Honduras-Switzerland. News of the death came a day after fierce clashes between police and citizens of Rio de Janeiro as the latter protested over increased public transport costs. Many Brazilians are unhappy about the huge governmental spending on the World Cup when they say such public services as schools, hospitals and infrastructure are in desperate need of repair.","Third worker dies during construction of World Cup stadium in Manaus .

"(CNN) -- My name is Evan Moss and I'm a 9-year-old boy who likes Pokemon! A lot! When I was 1 month old I started having seizures, and when I was 4 years old I went to Dr. Weiner and he gave me brain surgery to stop my seizures. It stopped my seizures for two years but not my appetite, it just kept on growing! It is still growing. After two years my seizures came back and now they are longer. When was little I had like 15 small seizures a day. Now I have 10-minute seizures but I only have one every 14 days or so. I have two dogs. One is Dinky and the other is Mindy. Dinky is our family dog and he really belongs to my sister, Aria. Mindy is my seizure dog. Getting Mindy took a long time. We had to raise a lot of money and wait almost a year to meet her and then we had to drive from Virginia to Ohio to get Mindy. Having Mindy is very fun! When I first got Mindy it was pretty hard because she didn't listen to me, but now she does and she knows a lot of commands. I've even taught her some new things, like climbing up into the fort section of my swing set. The best thing about having Mindy is playing with her and I love racing with her. If she is on her leash she runs right next to me but I know she can run really fast. I have epilepsy but I can do some extraordinary things like ride a zip line! Epilepsy can also be bad, though, and I've heard about some seizures that can kill you! Sometimes I worry that will happen to me but I don't think about that too much, plus I have Mindy to help me. Mindy barks when I have a seizure so my parents will know. When I have a seizure, my mom and dad give me medicine to help stop the seizure. People ask me a lot what it feels like but it's hard to describe and sometimes I don't remember having a seizure. If I met someone who just found out they have epilepsy I'd say, ""Don't worry, you're not in this alone!""","Evan Moss wrote a book to raise funds for a seizure dog .

"Fort Calhoun, Nebraska (CNN) -- Tim Nellenbach is on a mission as he shows a small group of journalists around his workplace. The manager of the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant and his colleagues are bent on dispelling rumors about the condition of their facility: rumors about a meltdown, about a loss of power. The rumors are patently false, they say, and it's frustrating to have to deal with them while also battling a genuine crisis. These officials are also acutely aware of comparisons to the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March, which crippled a nuclear power plant there, leading to the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. ""There's no likelihood of a Fukushima-like incident here,"" Nellenbach says. So does Gary Gates, CEO of the Fort Calhoun plant. ""It is not another Fukushima. The difference is the rapid flooding that occurred at Fukushima. This was a predicted event, to a degree, from the Corps of Engineers. The floodwaters at Fort Calhoun are outside the plant. There is no water inside the plant. The reactor is covered with borated water. The spent fuel is covered with borated water, which we want it to be. That's intentional. That's where it should be. The floodwaters are outside Fort Calhoun, not inside,"" Gates explains. Still, there is a genuine crisis at the plant. Floodwaters from the swollen Missouri River have engulfed this facility. The parking lots are underwater. The river's fast-paced currents are swirling against several buildings in this compound. Catwalks had to be constructed to allow workers to move from one building to the next. The buildings housing the reactor core, the spent fuel rods and other crucial components are protected by small levees and aqua-berms. But outside those barriers, the water is at least 2 feet above ground level. Officials are keeping a close eye on the network of power transformers here. The transformers are surrounded by floodwater and high-velocity pumps are continually pumping water away from them. The transformers power internal pumps, which operate cooling systems keeping the reactor core and the spent fuel rods from overheating. ""Maintaining electrical power, operating the pumps, is our biggest concern for the station, and we're able to fully do that at this time,"" Nellenbach says. Officials say the plant went off the power grid temporarily on Sunday and was powered by backup generators, but they say it is now back on the grid. The Fort Calhoun plant has been offline since early April for a re-fueling operation. It was scheduled to be back online in mid-June, according to officials here, but the flooding has delayed that. Now, they anticipate the plant will remain offline through the month of August, until the floodwaters completely recede. ""What's keeping me up at night is making sure that we're going to have electricity for everybody,"" says Gates. ""Electricity is so important to... the mitigation efforts of our whole community. Fort Calhoun's safe. It'll continue to be safe."" Gates and his colleagues say the water has not breached the buildings housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, and they're confident it won't. Those buildings and the barriers protecting them are designed to withstand flooding extending 1,014 feet above sea level. The water is now at about 1,006 feet, and they say they do not expect it to exceed 1,008 feet. Officials did not allow journalists directly into the rooms housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, but did allow them to view those rooms via closed-circuit cameras. The rooms did not appear to be damaged by floodwater. Gates says the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited the Fort Calhoun plant in 2009 for not being adequately prepared for a flooding event. Since that time, he says, they've taken steps to upgrade safeguards for the facility, and he says NRC officials were satisfied with the handling of the current flooding. Still, NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko had solemn words for the staff of Fort Calhoun after touring the plant on Monday. ""In the end,"" Jaczko said, ""this challenge is yours.""","The Fort Calhoun nuclear plant is surrounded by floodwaters .

"(CNN) -- A shooting at an LA Fitness gym outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killed at least four people and wounded several others, a local official told CNN. Authorities at the scene of a shooting at an LA Fitness gym near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The shooter, whose identity was not immediately released, was among the fatalities, said Gary Vituccio, manager of Collier township. At least 10 shooting victims arrived at the three major hospitals in the area. A spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital confirmed five female shooting victims arrived at the facility with multiple gunshot wounds. Three were in serious condition, and two were listed as critical, she said. Allegheny General Hospital received two wounded patients at its trauma center, a spokesman said. Both of victims are women and were listed in fair condition, he said. A St. Clair Hospital spokesman said three shooting victims arrived there Tuesday night; two were in stable condition and one patient, who was shot in the chest, died at about 8:55 p.m. It wasn't clear whether the death at St. Clair was included in the fatalities confirmed by Vituccio. Perry Calabro of nearby Bridgeville told CNN he was between racquetball games at the gym when he heard screaming and multiple gunshots. He said he ran out and didn't see the gunman or others. Other witnesses told CNN affiliate WTAE that the lights went out before they saw flashes in dark -- what they later realized was gunfire. Witnesses told WTAE that a man unrecognized by the gym's staff shot people in a Latin dance class. A witness identified as Nicole told WTAE that about 30 women were in the class when ""a middle-aged white male walked into the class. He had a big gym bag."" ""He looked out of place in a class full of women,"" according to the witness, who told WTAE the man put down the bag, turned off the lights and opened fire.","Shooting at LA Fitness gym leaves as many as 10 others hurt .

"(CNN) -- The first patient to be diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, in the United States is recovering well and should be able to go home from the hospital soon, doctors said Monday. The patient, an American health care provider who had been working in Saudi Arabia, is not on oxygen and is eating well and walking around, said doctors in Munster, Indiana. Doctors have also tested others who have come into contact with the patient. So far no one else has been diagnosed with the virus. Medical staff will continue to monitor the situation closely. The patient, whose name has not been disclosed due to federal privacy standards, was working at a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He told his doctors that the hospital had MERS patients, although he does not remember working with any of those infected. The man was on a planned visit to Indiana to see his family. He traveled on April 24 and went to a hospital in Indiana with symptoms April 28. About 50 staffers worked closely with the man, said Dr. Alan Kumar, chief medical information officer with Community Hospital in Indiana. No patients at the Indiana hospital had close contact with the MERS patient, who was in a private triage unit and admitted to a private bed on a general medical floor within three hours of showing up at the facility. His family brought the man in after he complained of flulike symptoms -- shortness of breath and fever. They told the medical staff he had been in Saudi Arabia. ""There was a possible thought initially that it was pneumonia,"" or some other kind of respiratory virus, Kumar said. ""That is why he was in a private room the entire time."" MERS: 5 things to know . The patient never needed a ventilator but was initially put on oxygen. The hospital knew which staffers had close contact with the patient because it uses electronic tracers on staff members, tracking where they go in the hospital and how much time they would have spent with the man. Between that monitoring and video surveillance, the hospital was able to track the patient's entire journey through the hospital system, according to Kumar. Both the family and health care workers have all tested negative for the virus and all are on home isolation, officials said. If any of those exposed have to go out, doctors have advised they wear a mask. Doctors will run a second test on both populations since the virus is thought to have a 14-day incubation period. If they still test negative for the virus, they will be considered clear and safe to return to their regular work and duties. Scientists do not know exactly how MERS spreads, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but they don't believe it spreads through casual contact. The virus poses a ""very low risk to the broader general public,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director for the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, on Friday. MERS mystery: Virus found in camels . Out of an abundance of caution, Indiana health officials and the CDC have acquired the passenger lists from the planes the patient took from Saudi Arabia -- he changed planes in London and landed in Chicago -- and the bus he took to Indiana. Of the 100 or so passengers on the plane, three-fourths have been tested, and none has been shown to be positive for MERS. The patient was not symptomatic at the time of travel, according to the doctors. Health officials are also reaching out to the 10 passengers who shared his bus. Scientists believe MERS spreads through close contact with a patient -- meaning someone would have to have come in contact with some of their bodily fluid. MERS first emerged in 2011, with the first cases being diagnosed in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. There have been 401 confirmed cases in 12 countries, according to the CDC. Of those, 93 people died. Testing for MERS involves looking for the virus' molecular structure in a patient's nose or blood. While the patient in Indiana was the first MERS case on U.S. soil, the CDC has been preparing for such a scenario and had been conducting an awareness campaign with hospitals and doctors since MERS emerged. There are no travel restrictions to the Arabian Peninsula; however, the CDC suggests people who visit there monitor their health and watch for any flulike symptoms. If you do feel unwell after such a trip, be sure to tell your doctor about your travel. There is no vaccine or special treatment for MERS. Doctors said they believe the patient's quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances for getting better. ""MERS picked the wrong hospital, the wrong state, the wrong country to try to get a foothold,"" said Dr. William VanNess, Indiana state health commissioner.

"(CNN) -- In late 2012, some comic book fans were completely outraged. How could Marvel Comics lose Peter Parker, its most famous character, to a brain switch with Dr. Otto ""Octopus"" Octavius, so that ""Doc Ock"" would take over the role of Spider-Man? That development in the final 700th issue of ""Amazing Spider-Man"" sent shock waves across the comic book industry and gave rise to ""Superior Spider-Man"" with the new Spidey, who was secretly ""Doc Ock."" All of that finally comes to an end with the relaunch of ""Amazing Spider-Man."" The first new issue (#1 of course) hits stores on Wednesday, and the anticipation is so strong that at least 600,000 books have already been preordered (it doesn't hurt that it comes with the comic ""Inhuman"" #1 for free). CNN spoke again to once and future ""Amazing Spider-Man"" writer Dan Slott on the new developments surrounding the return of the original Spider-Man. CNN: So why lose Peter Parker and then bring him back? Dan Slott: With ""Superior Spider-Man,"" we took Peter away from everybody for a year. And we showed you how having someone who should never be Spider-Man be Spider-Man, how much you'd miss Peter Parker. And now he's back! Just in time for the movie. It's almost like we planned it. Originally, when we were planning out Superior Spider-Man, editorial was like ""This is a six-issue arc,"" and we said ""No, we can go longer than that."" Then it was ""OK a year,"" and then we said, ""You know if we go a little further, we can make it to the movie!"" It was a lot of faith from Marvel editorial, and I'm grateful they let me try it. CNN: Why do you think Peter Parker is so beloved and important? Slott: Peter is the one and only Spider-Man. He's beyond comic book superhero, he is folklore, he is myth, he is legend! Peter Parker is always gonna be there for us, for every generation, like Robin Hood or Sherlock Holmes or Hercules. This is an enduring hero for all time, the greatest superhero there ever was. It's weird because when we swapped brains with Doc Ock, one of my editors said ""You'll know you did your job right, if when they switch him back, everyone goes 'No!' "" It's kind of fun that there are so many people out there who have become ""Superior Spider-Man"" fans that this has become a tragedy. No matter what you do, something's gonna be a tragedy! But there's also people who are grateful and happy. They're ecstatic Peter Parker is back. CNN: What's new about the new Peter Parker and the new book? Slott: He's the underdog and when he gives his all, he comes through. And with Peter Parker, he has all the problems we've had. And for 50 years, he's whined about it. Now he's the guy who has a new lease on life. This is his second chance, and he knows it. The mopey Peter Parker, that's what's dead. This Peter Parker will try to rise above it to grow up. This Peter Parker is very much a Rip Van Winkle. It's very much the old Chinese curse of ""May you live in interesting times."" Peter Parker is coming back to interesting times. Doc Ock broke it off with Mary Jane. Mary Jane is now dating this fireman. Also, Doc Ock was dating this scientist, Annamaria. She moved in with him. And suddenly Peter Parker wakes up to that! What does he do? We also learn that there was another person bitten by a spider at the same time as Peter. We never knew this all this time, and now this mysterious person is gonna show up. [Editor's note: We have now learned that this character goes by the name Silk.] . CNN: What do you say to fans who have seen it all in terms of superheroes dying and resurrecting? Slott: Let's be fair. Peter Parker didn't die. They swapped brains. So you've seen Peter Parker's physical body up and running for a year and a half. And now he's got his body back. I don't think we've seen a brain-swap in comics last this long! This isn't death of Superman, Captain America or Human Torch -- there's been a really weird spin on this. You've seen that body up and about the entire time. As far as the other Marvel superheroes go, they don't know he's been dead or missing. They just think he's been a colossal jerk. Doc Ock's body was buried and in ""Superior Spider-Man,"" we learned that grave is empty! Ooooh ... CNN: What else can we look forward to in the new stories? Slott: The whole world now looks at Spider-Man differently, some good, some bad. Same great power, all new responsibilities! You've always dealt with a mopey Peter Parker but now that he's coming back with this can-do attitude -- when life gives him lemons, he's gonna make lemon-flavored web fluid. That's our new positive, upbeat Spidey.","Peter Parker, out of commission more than a year, returns as Spider-Man .

"(CNN) -- Troubled by racism and corruption, Italian football's image took another turn for the worst after Lazio president Claudio Lotito revealed he had received ""death threats"" from scores of fans after selling star player Hernanes to Inter Milan. Hernanes, the Brazilian who arrived at Rome-based Lazio in 2010, swapped the Italian capital for Milan at the end of the January transfer window. ""Yesterday, I received between 50 to 70 to 80 telephone calls from pseudo-fans, in which they asked me to leave Lazio and made death threats against me,"" Lotito told reporters. ""I live under escort,"" he added. ""The supporters are part of the club but now they have overstepped the mark."" Hernanes became a firm favorite among Lazio fans after joining the club from Sao Paulo; making over 100 appearances and helping the team win the 2013 Coppa Italia. But, with his contract expiring at the end of the current season, Hernanes would have been able to switch clubs without Lazio commanding a transfer fee, leaving Lotito with no choice but to sell the player.

""He would have stayed here unhappy until June, then gone off to the World Cup, then come back for a few months and left on a free transfer. ""If you want to leave, you've got to say so."" In recent years Italian football has been troubled by racist chanting towards black players, while supporters use football as an excuse to play out long-running spats between different parts of Italy's cities as well as its regions. Match fixing has also blighted Italian football with leading club Juventus relegated to the second tier over the Calciopoli scandal in 2006. Lotito himself was banned from football for two-and-a-half years for his involvement in the Calciopoli scandal. Hernanes, who has played 23 times for his country, will hope to be part of Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad when Brazil hosts the World Cup later this year.","Lazio president Claudio Lotito receives death threats from fans .

"(CNN) -- With so many means for guests to leave feedback on hotels worldwide, it's easy to take those opportunities for granted. But what would workers in the hospitality industry say if they were asked to comment on their employers? We'll soon find out, thanks to a new Tumblr page that lets hotel employees share stories of demanding bosses, long shifts and finicky guests. The inspiration for ""Joey Quits"" comes from a likely source: Joey DeFrancesco, who became a viral video sensation and working-class hero in October for posting a YouTube video of him resigning from his hotel job accompanied by a marching band. With more than 2.8 million views in just over a month, the YouTube video generated more than 4,000 comments and even more e-mails, Facebook messages and cell phone texts, DeFrancesco said. Much of the response came from current and former hotel workers who said they related to DeFrancesco's complaints of struggles with management. ""We did not expect to get all this attention. But when we did, we knew we had to do something with it,"" the 23-year-old Rhode Islander said. Websites such as Hotel Workers Rising are backed by unions and address conditions from a labor standpoint. But ""Joey Quits"" appears to be one of few forums dedicated exclusively to letting individuals air grievances. The site's masthead bears a screen grab from the YouTube video of DeFrancesco's triumphant face next to messages in Spanish and English urging users to submit stories about their hotel workplace. ""Inspired by the success of the 'Joey Quits' video and responses to it from other hotel workers, we created this site to collect stories about unjust working conditions in the hotel industry,"" the site says, also in Spanish and English. The feed, which launched this week, had 10 entries as of Tuesday morning, including videos of DeFrancesco and other former employees of the Renaissance Providence, the site of DeFrancesco's famous resignation. The rest are anonymous or come from users claiming to be former hotel industry employees. CNN could not verify their claims. The goal is not to encourage boycotts of the accused hotels but to hold them accountable by raising awareness of undesirable conditions, hopefully paving the way to stronger labor laws, DeFrancesco said. ""The site is intended for workers so they can read it and know they're not alone, that others are experiencing the same things as them, creating a sense of working-class identity and hotel worker identity that's crucial to transforming the industry and forming unions,"" he said. ""The other audience is the public that's visiting the hotels, so they know how bad conditions are and let their disapproval be known with their wallets until things change.""","""Joey Quits"" Tumblr lets hotel employees submit workplace horror stories .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Thousands of people demonstrated outside the headquarters of Greece's state broadcaster Wednesday in protest over the government's sudden decision to suspend its activities as a budget-cutting move. ERT's TV channels and radio services were pulled off the air overnight, although some employees have continued to broadcast via the Internet. Most of those taking part in the peaceful protest outside ERT's Athens headquarters were employees, but others were ordinary Greeks who turned out in a show of support. Some held banners that read, ""All in the streets,"" urging fellow Greeks to join their cause. Greek unions have said they will fight the decision, which comes as the country struggles with a debt mountain, soaring unemployment and a lengthy recession. The General Confederation of Greek Workers and the Civil Servants Confederation called for a general strike and rally in central Athens on Thursday in support of the ERT journalists. They also urged union members to join ERT staff in their demonstration outside the broadcasting headquarters Wednesday. Government spokesman Simon Kedikoglou cited chronic corruption and mismanagement of funds as reasons why the broadcaster was closed down, at least temporarily. ""At a time when the Greek people are enduring sacrifices, there is no room for delay, hesitation or tolerance for sacred cows,"" Kedikoglou said in announcement shown on the broadcaster. ERT has said the decision means 2,656 employees will lose their jobs. To meet its commitments to its creditors -- the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- the Greek government has to dismiss 2,000 people from the wider public sector by the end of the year and 15,000 by the end of 2014. Kedikoglou said a new television and radio broadcaster would open with a much smaller staff, with existing employees able to apply for new positions. A ""modern television and radio broadcaster will be established that will operate as soon as possible,"" he said. An exact time frame for the new organization has not been announced, but a government spokesman said the new broadcaster should be operational before the end of the summer. The General Secretariat of Information and Communication said the new state broadcaster would be called the Organization of Modern State Television. The European Commission said Wednesday it had not sought the closure of ERT, ""but nor does the Commission question the Greek Government's mandate to manage the public sector."" It added that the commission ""supports the role of public broadcasting as an integral part of European democracy."" Reporters Without Borders expressed dismay over what it said was a ""bizarre"" decision by the government to shut down ERT's activities while carrying out the overhaul of its services. ""Greece has fallen almost 50 places in the past three years in the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index, a record fall in such a short period for a European Union member state,"" a statement said. ""The reasons include violence against reporters covering anti-austerity demonstrations, which goes completely unpunished, and threats against journalists and other news providers by the Golden Dawn party's neo-Nazis. ""Against this backdrop, the closure of ERT's TV stations has dealt a devastating blow to pluralism and freedom of information in Greece."" Reporters Without Borders' secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, is due to fly to Athens on Wednesday to meet with ERT employees. Greek lawmakers agreed in April to cut thousands of government workers to secure another 8.8 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in international bailout funds. Journalist Nathalie Savaricas reported from Athens, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro and Christine Theodorou and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: Greek unions call for a general strike Thursday in support of ERT workers .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine Corps reservist, who had hoped to be free after Wednesday's hearing in a Mexican court, was sent back to prison where he's been held the last three months on weapons charges. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi's next day in court is August 4. He's been imprisoned since March 31 when he drove into Mexico with three firearms in his truck. Tahmooressi has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana. He was detained by Mexican border officials for possessing a .45-caliber pistol, a 12-gauge pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. Although he didn't gain his client's freedom, attorney Fernando Benitez said progress was made. ""It was finally and officially discovered that there are multiple irregularities with the order to search his vehicle,"" Benitez said. Mother: My son is detained in Mexico . The order was dated three days before the incident, according to Benitez, who said that at least 11 pages were missing from the record presented in court. He also contends the Marine reservist wasn't given adequate access to translators. The director of the Tijuana checkpoint told Mexican media last month that Mexican agents at the border gave Tahmooressi a chance to surrender his weapons and return to the United States without incident. Tahmooressi told CNN that's ""a lie."" ""That's not true at all. They never told me anything of that sort,"" he said in jailhouse interview on Sunday. Tahmooressi said the Spanish translator provided to him at the border added to the confusion in communication. ""After I had got off the phone with 911 and I felt like there was no one there to help me, I even told them, I said, 'You can take my guns, take my truck and take all my possessions, just let me go back to America.' And they shook their head no in frustration."" Asked by CNN if he believes he should receive punishment for his mistake, Tahmooressi said no. ""I feel like the punishment was never necessary from the beginning. But once the (Mexican) military people got involved, they were like, 'Look what we found, we found these guns, good for us. Let's get this guy incriminated.' There was some good people at the border who were going to do the right thing, and that's how it should have been from the start."" Following Wednesday's hearing, Jill Tahmooressi meet with her son for 20 minutes. They both remain hopeful. ""He is strong, he is confident and he is very privileged to have Mr. Benitez defend his innocence,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Would you give up a six-figure salary to become a school teacher? That's what 42-year Jon Fitch did. The Vanderbilt MBA graduate was leading a team of 20 people toward the end of his 15-year executive marketing career, while managing a $15 million budget and various responsibilities with Move, Inc. In October he left that career behind and is now found in the classroom working toward a teaching degree and a master's in political science. He says he hopes to teach high school social studies and political science at the community college level. He is paying for his education with his savings and hopes to be teaching by fall of 2012 at the latest. Fitch, who lives in San Jose, California, said climbing the corporate ladder wasn't fulfilling. He decided that teaching was his true calling. ""I'm much happier being out of the corporate environment, which I found to be frustrating and political,"" he said. Fitch says his work-life balance was completely out of balance and he typically found himself working on the weekends and felt tied to his phone 24 hours a day. ""It was hard to have boundaries because you'd hear the 'bing' of a new e-mail and you just had to look at the message,"" he said. His wife had been in advertising and marketing and made the switch to teaching 10 years ago. She was very supportive of his decision to seek a happier work life, he said. ""I think that made a big difference. Otherwise you could be consumed by guilt that you're doing something to make yourself happy while asking others in your household to sacrifice,"" he said. And while 1 in 10 Americans is unemployed, those who do have jobs are finding themselves increasingly miserable at work. Fewer than half of U.S. workers (45 percent) are satisfied with their jobs, the lowest level since record-keeping began 22 years ago for The Conference Board, according to a survey released earlier this month. Fitch said making the decision to switch careers wasn't easy. ""Part of your identity gets wrapped up in what you do, it becomes part of who you are, and to shed that skin, so to speak, is hard,"" he said. ""However, my experience was that money could buy security, but not happiness, and we spend too much time at our jobs not to take the risk and try something new."" Fitch and his wife don't have kids, have saved a lot for retirement and were in a comfortable financial position for him to make a career move -- a luxury that many families don't have. So how can someone less financially stable than Fitch safely succeed at switching careers? Certified career coach Hallie Crawford says it's not impossible, but it might take longer than Fitch to make the change. She suggests creating a financial transition plan and thinking creatively about how to make your move. As part of that plan, ask these questions: . • Could you find a part-time job to support yourself while you're working toward your dream job? • Could you try to gain experience in the field you want by volunteering outside of your current job or doing freelance work? • Can you go to school at night or on weekends to develop new skills? Crawford says you need to develop a practical way and time frame to carry out your plan so you don't create added stress by stretching yourself too thin financially. She once found herself in a similar position where she wanted to switch careers and did it by using a ""bridge"" job to get her there. ""I took a four-day-a-week job that paid a little less than my previous position, and started my career coaching practice on the side, after hours,"" she noted. ""Two years later, I left the old job and starting coaching full time -- and have been coaching ever since."" In addition to creating a plan, Crawford says you should make sure you really want to make a change and that your dissatisfaction ""isn't just a passing phase."" She says, ""Many people think they need a dramatic change because they're so unhappy, but more often than not, they don't need as dramatic a change as they think."" Sometimes you can make adjustments at your current job, find another position within your company or find something that's related to what you're doing, Crawford says. Secret to success . Networking with professionals in the field you want to be a part of is one of the most successful ways to land a job, said the career coach. ""I had a former client reach out to me last week who said that talking with people is the best way to realize all the options,"" she said. The biggest mistake people make is letting fear and negative thinking stand in the way of obtaining a goal, said Crawford. ""I actually think more people don't pursue their dream and give up on it than people trying to make it happen and failing,"" she noted. Fitch says he found a quote he believes is appropriate to the topic of switching careers -- ""We more often regret those things we didn't do, than those things we did."" And so far, the former marketing executive says, he does not regret walking away from his career to pursue his passion.","Survey: Fewer than half of U.S. workers are satisfied with their jobs .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan on Thursday where he plans to encourage a resolution to the presidential election that the United States insists must include a thorough review of ""reasonable allegations"" of fraud. Kerry plans to meet in Kabul with presidential candidates Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani as well as the man one of them will succeed, President Hamid Karzai, to discuss the political transition amid uncertainty over the vote earlier this month. ""While the United States does not support an individual candidate, we do support a credible, transparent and inclusive process that affirms the Afghan people's commitment to democracy, and that produces a president who can bring Afghanistan together and govern effectively,"" the State Department said in a statement detailing Kerry's surprise visit. About 8 million votes were cast in June 14 balloting and provisional results showed Ghani ahead with roughly 56% support to 43% for Abdullah, according to Afghanistan's Independent Elections Commission. Final results will be announced July 22. Abdullah alleged massive fraud in an interview with CNN this week, while Ghani has said the results were ""legitimate and credible."" The Obama administration is looking for a credible outcome involving one candidate or the other, and U.N. officials say sorting out the situation could take a couple of weeks. The inauguration is set for the first week of August. The United States is withdrawing most of its troops by year's end, reducing the primary leverage it has had in Afghanistan. But it still supports the country with billions in foreign aid. Although once an ally of Karzai, Abdullah has in recent years become an opponent and vocal critic of the Taliban. Ghani, also a former adviser to Karzai and finance minister, was once a U.S. citizen, but gave up his passport to run for president five years ago. CNN's Jamie Crawford and Mick Kreve contributed to this report.","Kerry makes unannounced stop in Kabul .

"(CNN) -- Hours after Turkey's prime minister vowed to ""eradicate"" Twitter, Turkish Internet users began to experience widespread disruptions Thursday while trying to access the popular social networking website. Outrage and fury erupted online. Within an hour the hashtags ""#TwitterisblockedinTurkey,"" ""#DictatorErdogan"" and ""TurkeyBlockedTwitter"" surged to the service's top worldwide trends. Meanwhile, Twitter swiftly offered subscribers a work-around via its verified policy account by advertising an alternative way to send out tweets using cell-phone instant messaging. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan first vowed to shut Twitter down at a campaign rally on Thursday in the city of Bursa. ""Now there is a court order. Twitter, mwitter, we will eradicate it all,"" Erdogan said, using a Turkish expression that mocked the name of the social networking site. ""The international community will say this and that, and it doesn't concern me one bit,"" Erdogan added, apparently anticipating the subsequent uproar. ""They will see the power of the Turkish Republic. This has nothing to do with freedom-shmeedom. Freedom is not invading someone's privacy."" Several hours later, the prime ministry released a statement accusing Twitter's management of ignoring court orders calling for the removal of web links from the website. ""Twitter officials remained indifferent to these demands,"" the prime ministry announced, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. ""Access to Twitter may be blocked as a last resort to avert the unjust treatment of our citizens in case of a continuation of this ignorance of the court rulings."" While many Twitter users reported blockages to the website, others quickly advertised workaround procedures. The Twitter crackdown follows earlier threats by Erdogan to shut down popular social networking sites Facebook and YouTube. The latest move against Twitter comes 10 days before Turks are expected to go to the polls in municipal elections that will be held nationwide. The government has also been working to block embarrassing leaks emerging on social media linked to a corruption investigation that embroiled four of Erdogan's former cabinet ministers. Erdogan claims the investigation is a ""coup plot."" He has sought to crush the probe by firing thousands of police officers and prosecutors. Nonetheless, embarrassing wiretaps of telephone conversations between Erdogan, his family members and top members of Turkey's ruling elite have been leaked on a daily basis on an assortment of popular Internet sites. CNN has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the recordings, some of which have been described as ""immorally edited material"" by Erdogan. But the prime minister confirmed some of the conversations, including a call in which he ordered the head of a TV news channel to censor the live broadcast of an opposition lawmaker's speech. On Wednesday, lawmakers from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party succeeded in blocking an attempt by opposition leaders to read out portions of the corruption investigation indictment in an extraordinary session of parliament.","Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to shut down social media sites .

"(CNN) -- Severe storms that pelted the Omaha, Nebraska, area with hail are expected to move east Wednesday and hit parts of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said. Nashville; Louisville, Kentucky; and Cincinnati probably will be pounded with heavy rain and strong winds Wednesday night, the National Weather Service said, with the chance of precipitation at 70% to 80%. Isolated tornadoes and flash floods are possible, Pugh said, though the threat is lower than it was Tuesday. But the hail was what got everybody's attention in Nebraska, pummeling 4,300 vehicles at Woodhouse Auto Family in Blair, about 30 miles from Omaha. Hoods were dented and windshields were shattered, CNN affiliate KMTV reported. Company officials Wednesday estimated damages at $162 million. ""The damage is substantial,"" Woodhouse Chief Financial Officer Paul Cech said. ""We'll get people all over the country calling us trying to get discount prices."" That's exactly what happened the last time the Omaha company's cars got battered in a storm. As soon as the hail subsides, a flood of callers try to get their hands on banged-up vehicles. Some of the hail was baseball-size and smashed windows and damaged siding on houses, KMTV reported. Police in Blair said 20 people were taken to the hospital with injuries, CNN affiliate KETV reported. In several other cities, streets flooded and trees were knocked down. By Wednesday, officials had received at least 12 reports of possible tornadoes in Nebraska, Iowa, Wyoming and Kansas, the Storm Prediction Center said. Grapefruit-sized hail smashes into cars .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods may need to reappraise his schedule after his hopes of getting in four rounds of competitive golf ahead of the British Open were dashed Friday. Woods chose to return after a three month lay-off at the tournament he hosts at the Congressional Country Club but it proved a short lived experience as he failed to make the cut by a distance. The former world number one briefly raised hopes that he could survive for the weekend when he birdied the ninth and 10th around the turn, but his hopes nosedived with four straight bogeys on the back nine. It left him with a 75 and allied to his first round three over 74 meant that on seven over 149 and four shots outside the cut mark. Woods had gone 26 previous events, dating back to the Greenbrier Classic in 2012, without failing to make the weekend. Despite the setback, he adopted an upbeat tone at the press conference when assessing his performance. ""All little things I know I can fix. As I said, it's very encouraging.,"" Woods said. His season has been ruined by a pinched nerve in his back, requiring surgery at the end of March and meaning he missed the Masters and the U.S. Open. Next month's third major of the season at Hoylake is his immediate target as he bids to add to his 14 major titles and close on Jack Nicklaus' all-time record of 18. Woods won at Royal Liverpool in 2006, but has three weeks to attempt to shake off the rust in his game and for the moment is not intending to tee it up at any further tournaments on either side of the Atlantic. The final major of the season comes at Valhalla where Woods won the PGA Championship in 2000. During his layoff, Woods has fallen from first to fifth in the world rankings and he has not won since last August's World Golf Championships event in Akron, Ohio. While he struggled, there was a four-way tie at the top with Australians Marc Leishman and Oliver Goss and American pair Ricky Barnes and Patrick Reed all on six-under. Meanwhile on the European Tour, U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer also disappointed in his first outing since his triumph at Pinehurst. Kaymer shot a one-over 73 at the BMW International in his native Germany to miss the cut on level par. Four players, Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Emiliano Grillo, Pablo Larrazabal and Danny Willett held the halfway lead at 12-under.","Tiger Woods misses cut at Congressional on PGA Tour .

"(Mental Floss) -- Most of us pick up a razor at least every couple of days, and although shaving's a little tedious, it's not too much of a hassle. Many men still prefer shaving with straight razors, although safety razors date back to at least 1762. It hasn't always been quite so easy, though. Let's take a look at the history of shaving. Pre-Gillette could get a little rough . In the days before razors, you could either sport a hirsute look or get creative. Records drawn on cave walls show prehistoric people shaving with clamshells, flint knives, and even shark teeth. It's not clear when these crude implements gave way to what we now think of as razors. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, circular solid gold or copper razors can be found as far back as the 4th millennium BC in some Egyptian tombs. Still other cultures sharpened volcanic obsidian glass and used those. Another story posits that the Roman king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus introduced the razor to his people in the 6th century BC, but shaving didn't really catch on with Romans for another hundred years or so. In the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great encouraged his men to shave so enemies couldn't grab their beards during melees. Alexander's subjects were often shaved using a novacila, a block of iron with one edge sharpened, which sounds like a great way to shred your face. Julius Caesar supposedly preferred to have his beard plucked out with tweezers, although other Roman men used razors or rubbed the beards from their faces using pumice stones. (Ouch!) Mental Floss: When did women start shaving their armpits? Is it safe? Designs for safety razors date back to at least 1762, but they didn't really catch on until 1828, when they debuted in Sheffield, England. In 1847 William Henson invented the hoe-shaped razor that most of us have in our medicine cabinets, and in 1895 a traveling salesman named King Camp Gillette combined this shape with the idea of shaving with a disposable double-edged blade. The resulting safety razor eventually made Gillette a fortune and solved the hassle of having to remove the razor's blade to sharpen it every few shaves. The idea was great, but there was a problem: the blades weren't easy to make. It took another six years for Gillette to find someone who could actually make the disposable blades. MIT professor William Nickerson joined up with Gillette to figure out a way to stamp the blades out of sheets of high-carbon steel, and by 1903 they had their first batch of razors ready to take on America's beards. By 1906 Gillette's design was moving 300,000 units a year. Interestingly, Gillette sold the razors at a loss, but he more than made up for it by selling the blades at a huge profit. Although Gillette's invention came from his notion that he should invent something people bought, threw away, and then repurchased, he wasn't your typical capitalist. He became a strong proponent of utopian socialism later in his life and planned a community in Arizona in which engineers would rationally orchestrate all activity. Gillette even offered Teddy Roosevelt $1 million to serve as president of this planned utopia in 1910, but Roosevelt declined. Mental Floss: Henry Ford's jungle utopia . 1920s: Shaving goes electric . People have been patenting and trying to market electric razors since 1900, but at first they met with little success. (One failed model from 1910 ran on clockwork.) In 1928 a retired Army colonel named Jacob Schick patented an electric razor he had designed, and the world finally had a winner. Schick razors took store shelves by storm in 1931, and they quickly sold millions of units. The real winners in this transition from wet shaving with soap and a brush to electric razors were badgers. Their hair had been highly prized for wet shaving brushes because it retained water so well, so more than a few badgers were spared a shearing as America started plugging in their electric Schicks. Like King Camp Gillette, Jacob Schick was a bit of an odd duck. Part of the reason he went into the shaving business was that he really, really believed in the benefits of shaving. In fact, Schick supposedly thought that if a man shaved often enough, he could lengthen his life to 120 years. Mental Floss: Revisiting 8 'Sesame Street' rumors . The real arms race started in the 1960s . After years of losing market share to their electric competition, Gillette finally hit upon a winning innovation in 1960 when it introduced stainless steel blades. These newer blades were tougher to hone, but they lasted much longer and didn't rust. Consumers loved them. Bic introduced the first totally disposable razors in the sixties as well, which made shaving even more convenient. Gillette struck another blow in 1971 when it introduced the two-blade razor. Other companies followed suit, and now it's just a matter of time before we're all shaving with a 17-bladed behemoth. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden douses the idea of his returning to the United States -- where he faces charges of espionage and theft of government property for leaking sensational details of spy programs -- saying he won't come back unless laws are changed. Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper in an online chat Thursday about conditions for a return home, Snowden said that while his coming back ""is the best resolution"" for all parties, ""it's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistle-blower protection laws."" He pointed out that the government's Whistleblower Protection Act doesn't cover someone like him, a former government contractor. ""There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing,"" he wrote. ""... My case clearly demonstrates the need for comprehensive whistle-blower protection act reform."" Snowden offered his remarks from Russia, where he's been since June having been granted a one-year asylum. From there, he has continued to speak out to journalists and online. Thursday's chat -- coordinated by The Courage Foundation, an organization set up to support Snowden and his cause -- was one example of his outreach, letting him answer questions from anyone who posed a question online. The U.S. government hasn't stayed silent on his case either. On Thursday, around the time that Snowden was answering questions online, Attorney General Eric Holder said that ""if Mr. Snowden wanted to come back to the United States and enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers."" The government would take the same tack with anyone willing to plead guilty., Holder said at the event at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. But in Snowden's case, the attorney general insisted, ""Clemency isn't something that we (are) willing to consider."" Such a standoff is nothing new, as the U.S. government and Snowden have been at odds since the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers first published stories last June based on secret documents he'd provided them. These and subsequent reports transformed the once relatively anonymous 30-year-old into a lightning rod for critics who called him a traitor and a hero for those who cheered his exposing what they see as dangerous infringements on civil liberties. Whatever one's opinion of him, the leaks undoubtedly brought intense scrutiny to the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, causing headaches for the U.S. government, domestically and internationally. This uproar spurred President Barack Obama this month to unveil new guidance for intelligence gathering as well as reforms intended to balance what he called the nation's vital security needs with concerns over privacy and liberties. Nonetheless, some civil libertarians, members of Congress and others complained that Obama didn't go far enough. Among other things, they point to the fact that someone will still collect records of the numbers and times of phone calls by every American -- one of the most controversial programs revealed by Snowden -- even if access to the those records will be tightened and they may be shifted from the NSA to elsewhere. Snowden echoed such critics when asked about Obama's speech in relation to Thursday's release of a privacy review board's report critical of the government. The five-member Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board concluded the NSA's collection of data on nearly every U.S. phone call isn't legal and has proven largely useless in thwarting terrorism. Board: NSA phone data program illegal . ""When even the federal government says the NSA violated the constitution at least 120 million times under a single program, but failed to discover even a single plot, it's time to end bulk collection, which is a euphemism for mass surveillance,"" Snowden wrote, pointing to the review's report. ""There is simply no justification for continuing an unconstitutional policy with a 0% success rate."" In Thursday's chat, Snowden insisted ""not all spying is bad."" He said his issue is more with ""the new technique of indiscriminate mass surveillance, where governments are seizing billions and billions and billions of innocents' communication every single day."" Such programs exist in part ""because new technologies make it easy and cheap,"" not because they are particularly effective in targeting threats and wrongdoers, he claimed. Snowden said he acted because he felt compelled ""to push back."" ""It's not good for our country, it's not good for the world, and I wasn't going to stand by and watch it happen, no matter how much it cost me,"" he wrote. ""The NSA and the rest of the US Intelligence Community is exceptionally well positioned to meet our intelligence requirements through targeted surveillance -- the same way we've always done it -- without resorting to the mass surveillance of entire populations."" His decision to collect and release secret documents have helped make Snowden one of America's most high-profile critics since Wikileaks' Julian Assange. who notably has been one of Snowden's biggest supporters. Yet Snowden said Thursday that he hasn't given up hope for his native land, saying ""what makes our country strong is our system of values."" ""We can correct the laws, restrain the overreach of agencies, and hold the senior officials responsible for abusive programs to account,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Liverpool striker Luiz Suarez apologized Sunday for refusing to shake hands with Manchester United's Patrice Evra before the start of an English Premier League match. The Uruguay international was widely criticized for Saturday's snub which came as they met face to face for the first time since he was given an eight-game ban for racially abusing the Frenchman at an earlier fixture between the two clubs in October. United manager Alex Ferguson called Suarez a ""disgrace"" while Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre was angered by his own player's actions. ""We are extremely disappointed Luis Suarez did not shake hands with Patrice Evra before yesterday's game. The player had told us beforehand that he would, but then chose not to do so,"" Ayre told the club's official website. ""It has been made absolutely clear to Luis Suarez that his behavior was not acceptable,"" he added. Suarez, who scored Liverpool's late goal in the 2-1 defeat, made his public apology later Sunday on the club's website. ""I have spoken with the manager (Kenny Dalglish) since the game at Old Trafford and I realize I got things wrong. ""I've not only let him down, but also the club and what it stands for and I'm sorry. I made a mistake and I regret what happened. ""I should have shaken Patrice Evra's hand before the game and I want to apologize for my actions. ""I would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on playing football."" The incident before kickoff heightened tensions between the arch rivals and there was a reported incident in the tunnel at halftime. At the final whistle, Evra openly celebrated his team's victory in close proximity to Suarez and also drew a rebuke from his manager Ferguson. United responded later Sunday to the apology with a statement on their official website: . ""Manchester United thanks Liverpool for the apologies issued following Saturday's game. ""Everyone at Old Trafford wants to move on from this. The history of our two great clubs is one of success and rivalry unparalleled in British football. ""That should be the focus in the future of all those who love the clubs.""","Luis Suarez apologizes for refusing to shake Patrice Evra's hand .

"(CNN) -- A few days before he graduated, one of my students asked me how does one keep up with public affairs (as I was advocating) when you have a demanding full-time job, a cute but fussy baby, an elderly parent who needs attending and something of a social life? I suggested that he listen to NPR, watch CNN -- and once in a while choose a particular story to follow. For example, the report of what happens when major American corporations break the law. The New York Times recently investigated the ways  the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deals with companies who have violated anti-fraud laws. Very often, the settlement that follows contains a promise not to break the law again, which the Times noted is odd because the company, ""after all, was merely promising not to do something that the law already forbids."" Often the same corporations violate the law again -- and make the same promise again and again. The Times found 51 cases over the past 15 years in which 19 Wall Street firms broke anti-fraud laws they had promised not to break. These firms include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. When faced with these multiple violations, the SEC simply reaches another settlement and extracts another promise, rather than bring a contempt charge in court. Furthermore, these settlements do not even require the companies to admit to the charges brought against them. Instead, there is a provision that lets them ""neither admit nor deny"" the violations, which makes them less vulnerable to investor lawsuits. Shortly after the Times article appeared, the Washington Post reported that the SEC agreed to collect $285 million as a penalty for a $700 million loss to investors due to fraud committed by Citigroup, and again allowed Citigroup to cop the ""neither admit nor deny"" clause. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected the settlement as too weak, joining others who criticized the SEC as toothless, saying it gives a pass to executives and allows corporations to conceal that they violated the law. The director of the Oscar-winning documentary ""Inside Job,"" Charles Ferguson, pointed out earlier this year the widespread fraud involved in the mortgage scandals. Despite corporations having hired people to forge thousands of signatures, ""not only has nobody gone to jail, but there haven't even been any criminal prosecutions. Literally zero under the Obama administration."" When some suggested that bringing cases against high-ranking executives in the financial industry is difficult, Ferguson argued that the common use of cocaine and prostitutes on Wall Street could easily be used as ""leverage."" However, no action has been taken. The main lesson about public affairs, I told my student, is in the reactions that followed the Times and Post revelations. Nothing happened. The rest of the media paid much more mind to the latest person accusing Herman Cain of sexual misconduct than to new revelations about common corporate crime and how corporations get away with it. The White House seemed not to have noticed. We heard nothing from the Department of Justice. Democratic leaders in Congress did not express any outrage, let alone order a new investigation. True, a federal judge rejected a settlement with one of these corporations, but it is far from clear what the final settlement will be. I told my student that such news stories tell volumes about the state of our polity: a strong Wall Street, a weak political class and an exhausted public. Some days one cannot but wonder whether one should join Occupy Wall Street, the tea party or both. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","It's instructive to follow a news story and see how people respond to it, says Amitai Etzioni .
For example, Wall Street firms repeatedly break laws they've pledged not to break, he says .
Etzioni: SEC lets these firms off with weak settlements, and they won't admit wrongdoing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- CIA Director Leon Panetta recently testified to Congress that the agency concealed information and misled lawmakers repeatedly since 2001, according to a letter from seven House Democrats to Panetta made public Wednesday. Seven House Democrats say CIA Director Leon Panetta recently testified that the CIA has misled Congress. The letter to Panetta, dated June 26, was published on the Web site of Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California. ""Recently you testified that you have determined that top CIA officials have concealed significant actions from all members of Congress, and misled members for a number of years from 2001 to this week,"" said the letter, signed by Eshoo and six other House Democrats -- Reps. John Tierney of Massachusetts, Mike Thompson of California, Rush Holt of New Jersey, Alcee Hastings of Florida, Adam Smith of Washington and Janice Schakowsky of Illinois. Read the signed letter on Rep. Eshoo's Web site . The letter contained no details about what information the CIA officials allegedly concealed or how they purportedly misled members of Congress. On February 11, 2003, CIA Director George Tenet told a Senate committee that U.S. intelligence indicated al Qaeda planned to attack targets in the United States and in the Middle East, perhaps with chemical weapons or radioactive materials. On May 15 of this year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the CIA of misleading Congress in a secret briefing she received in 2002. Pelosi said the CIA failed to inform her and others at the briefing about harsh interrogation techniques being used on terrorism suspects. The CIA responded that Pelosi was told about the harsh techniques, including waterboarding, at the classified 2002 briefing. However, the June 26 letter from the seven House Democrats noted that Panetta told CIA employees in a letter dated May 15 -- in response to the Pelosi allegation -- that it was not CIA policy to mislead Congress. ""Let me be clear: It is not our policy or practice to mislead Congress. That is against our laws and values,"" the House Democrats quoted Panetta's letter as saying. The letter from the House Democrats asked Panetta to correct his May 15 statement ""in light of your testimony."" Asked about the Democrats' letter, CIA spokesman George Little said Panetta ""stands by his May 15 statement."" ""This agency and this director believe it is vital to keep the Congress fully and currently informed. Director Panetta's actions back that up,"" Little said in a statement. ""As the letter from these ... representatives notes, it was the CIA itself that took the initiative to notify the oversight committees."" The Democrats' letter became public the night before the House is scheduled to vote on an intelligence spending measure that includes a provision to expand the number of House and Senate members privy to the kind of secret briefing that Pelosi received. The White House opposes the provision to expand the number of briefing participants from the current eight to 40 members of Congress. A White House memo warned President Obama's senior advisers would recommend a veto of the bill if it contained the expanded briefing provision. CNN's Deirdre Walsh, Bob Kovach and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","Letter from 7 House Democrats to CIA Director Leon Panetta  posted on Web site .

"(CNN) -- The cause of Sunday's power outage at the Super Bowl in New Orleans has been traced to a newly installed electrical relay device meant to protect Superdome equipment, a power company and the device's manufacturer said Friday. But the companies appear to be on different pages about whether human error was to blame. The relay, put online late last year, triggered unexpectedly, causing another device to stop supplying power to part of the building, Entergy New Orleans told city officials Friday. The partial outage interrupted the game between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers for about 35 minutes, and city officials have been anxious about whether the outage will impact the city's efforts to attract future big-ticket events. Entergy told New Orleans City Council members that the company still doesn't know why the device triggered, but the relay has been removed, the dome's electrical system is ready to go and steps will be taken to ensure a malfunction doesn't happen again. ""Rest assured, the Superdome is fully functional,"" CEO Charles Rice told the council's utility committee Friday morning. But the relay's manufacturer, Chicago-based S&C Electric Co., says it believes it knows why the problem happened: The relay, it says, wasn't operated at the proper setting. System operators essentially put the relay's trip setting too low, S&C vice president Michael Edmonds wrote to CNN in an e-mail. The electrical load exceeded the trip setting, so the relay triggered, he said. That activated the switch gear, which is designed to cut some power to isolate any problem and prevent system damage and a larger outage. ""Based on the onsite testing, we have determined that if higher settings had been applied, the equipment would not have disconnected the power,"" Edmonds wrote. ""S&C continues to work with all those involved to get the system back online, and our customers can continue to rely on the quality and performance of our products."" Asked whether Entergy agrees with S&C's characterization of the problem, Entergy spokesman Mike Burns responded: . ""Tests conducted by S&C and Entergy on the two relays installed at the Superdome shows that one relay functioned as expected and the other relay did not. ""We will continue to do more testing but we believe that we have zeroed in on the device that caused the outage, and we have removed it from service."" S&C was not represented at the council committee meeting in New Orleans. The company that manages the dome, SMG, told the panel it concurred that the device is linked to the power outage. But the explanation won't end the issue for some officials, as Councilwoman Jackie Clarkson pressed Rice to allow an independent audit. Rice didn't commit, instead replying that a third-party inspector will be used if Entergy and SMG determine one is needed. The relay and switch gear were part of Entergy's 2011-2012 project to improve electrical reliability at the dome, Entergy official Dennis Dawsey told council members. The relay device wasn't put online until December 21. Between then and the Super Bowl, the device functioned properly during three major events -- the New Orleans Bowl, a Saints-Panthers NFL game, and the Sugar Bowl -- Entergy said. Rice said the company would work closely with the device's manufacturer to determine what caused the device to trigger when it shouldn't have. ""We are going to do everything humanly possible (to ensure) we do not experience an event like this again,"" Rice said. An SMG official emphasized to the panel that the power failure had nothing to do with SMG's recent efforts to replace the cables that feed electricity from Entergy's connection points to the dome. The Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District, a state agency that oversees the Superdome, had approved spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace the feeder cables. The SMG official said Friday that the cables were replaced because they were 15 years old, and that SMG doesn't ""see any way (the cables) were involved in this."" The electrical outage at the Superdome set off a storm of social media amusement among viewers and inspired advertising tweets with blackout twists. Carmaker Audi took a swipe at its competitor, tweeting that it was sending ""LED lights"" over to the dome, which is officially named the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. But for the picturesque Super Bowl host city -- perpetually concerned with its reputation, especially since Hurricane Katrina -- the power failure broadcast to the world was a huge embarrassment. Mayor Mitch Landrieu promised that night there would be answers soon. Clarkson, pressing for a third-party examination of the cause, emphasized that the city intends to bid for the 2018 Super Bowl. ""We are in contention for 2018,"" Clarkson said. ""(An outside test) is clearly imperative ... to defy the naysayers that could be arising around the country to say that we shouldn't have this (Super Bowl).""

Initially, the ministry said the boy was shot in the head by an Israeli helicopter. Witnesses disputed that account Friday, saying the boy was shot in the side and the gunfire came from Israeli military vehicles. Israeli Lt. Col.

"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (CNN) -- Iowa officials are concerned about towns along the Mississippi River as floodwaters in the state's eastern counties began to drain toward the river. Two weeks of flooding has left five people dead and forced more than 38,000 from their homes as several major rivers that feed into the Mississippi -- including the Cedar, Des Moines and Iowa rivers -- overflowed their banks. The National Weather Service warned that the Mississippi River was expected to crest at nearly 26 feet at Burlington, Iowa, on Wednesday. That's about 11 feet above flood stage, partly because of levee failures along the Iowa River that have dumped more water into the system. In Washington, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa said the flooding has devastated his state's corn crop and may have inflicted up to $1 billion in damage to Iowa's agricultural sector alone. The flooding has forced farm-equipment manufacturer John Deere to idle two plants in Waterloo, he said. ""Across eastern Iowa, the flooding rivers have washed out railroad lines; Mississippi barge traffic has come to a halt; and closed major roadways,"" said Harkin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. ""Thousands of Iowa businesses, large and small, have been impacted."" In Cedar Rapids, residents were allowed to return home temporarily to retrieve keepsakes and other items Sunday, but authorities said Monday that strike teams had determined the neighborhoods were no longer safe, even for a quick visit. ""We are taking a step back,"" Cedar Rapids Fire Department spokesman Dave Brown said, adding it would be awhile before evacuees would be permitted to go back home. Police set up checkpoints to keep people away from the affected neighborhoods, deemed unsafe after weeks of heavy rain forced the Cedar River from its banks, leaving much of Iowa's second-largest city underwater.  See photos of the flooding » . Evacuees waited in line at the checkpoints Sunday to receive special wristbands that allowed them to go home and gather their belongings. Authorities set a curfew and asked the residents to stay out of the neighborhoods between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., so people stuffed what they could into plastic bags and returned to the checkpoints. One resident, however, grew angry when he was not allowed to pass a checkpoint Monday, according to a news release from the Cedar Rapids Police Department. After being denied re-entry to a flooded neighborhood, Rick Blazek, 53, returned to his vehicle as a state trooper used his police vehicle to block the checkpoint, according to the news release. ""Blazek drove his vehicle toward the state trooper and struck the state trooper three times with his vehicle,"" the release said. Police told Blazek to get out of his vehicle, and when he refused, ""the driver's window was broken out because the doors were locked and Blazek was removed from his vehicle,"" according to the release. The trooper was not injured. Blazek, who was arrested and charged with assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon, could not be immediately reached for comment. Flood-related deaths include a 35-year-old man found on a gravel road near Wapello, an Iowa State University student struck by lightning in Curlew, a farmer swept away by floodwaters in Wright County, a man killed in a car accident in Hamilton County and a 51-year-old woman found dead in her Cedar Rapids home, said Courtney Greene, a spokeswoman for Iowa Gov. Chet Culver's office. ""We're looking at all-time flood records in terms of levels,"" Culver told reporters Monday evening. ""The challenges remain, but we are more determined than ever to win the fight."" Iowa authorities have determined that the death of a woman whose body was found in her car Monday was not flood-related. The woman was found near New London, after her stopped car was hit by a National Guard bus. Investigators determined the woman died before the collision, Greene said. Resident Tracy Murphy was able to return to her home Sunday before authorities deemed the neighborhoods dangerous. She made a beeline for her family photos when she entered her house, parts of which looked as if burglars had ransacked it.  Watch Murphy return home » . ""Anything can be replaced, but your photos can't,"" she said. A trash can was overturned and belongings were strewn across rooms. Murphy's eyes welled up as the realization hit her: ""My whole, entire life is gone."" iReport.com: Photos from Cedar Rapids . The checkpoints -- manned by police and the Iowa National Guard -- remained in place Monday, but Brown said authorities would not be letting residents check on their homes. Strike teams assessed the residential and commercial areas where the waters had receded Sunday and determined those areas were not safe for re-entry, he said.  See a map of the flooding in Iowa » . Veronica Johnson evacuated her home and later had to evacuate her mother's house, she said. She hasn't been able to return in four days -- and not just because of dangerous floodwaters. ""I live by a gas station, and the tankers from underground busted up through the ground, so I have gas spilled all around my house and the whole neighborhood,"" she said. Residents have been getting angry with the authorities who are keeping them from their homes, she said, but she understands safety comes first. ""They have Red Cross, police department, fire department, and the people who they brought in -- the Marines and stuff, the National Guard -- have been excellent,"" she said. ""They are keeping us out of our homes even though we're getting upset with them. We have no right because they're trying to protect us."" Local authorities expect to release a list of areas that are safe by Monday afternoon, with the hope that people can begin returning to their homes Tuesday, Brown said. About 36,000 Iowans were evacuated because of statewide flooding, 24,000 of them in Cedar Rapids. The massive flooding has overwhelmed the city -- which is in a 500-year flood plain, an area the federal government says has less than a 0.2 percent chance of flooding.  Watch residents begin the cleanup process » . ""It's been compared to a 3,000-year flood,"" Cedar Rapids police Detective Brad Novak said. ""So something with that rarity of an event, there is no playbook to go by."" Culver has declared 83 of the state's 99 counties disaster areas. More than 3,300 Iowa National Guard troops have been deployed to help primarily with sandbagging and staging resources, Maj. Gen. Ron Dardis of the Iowa National Guard said Sunday. Another 700 troops were expected to join them Monday.  Watch workers desperately sling sandbags » . There have been 18 weather-related deaths in the state since May 25 -- 12 of them from tornadoes and the rest linked to flooding, Greene said. This month's severe weather has trampled towns from North Dakota to Indiana. The Federal Emergency Management Agency says more than 11 million Midwesterners will be affected by flooding and tornadoes. FEMA has set up six disaster recovery centers in Iowa and has provided nearly $4 million in assistance so far, state and federal officials reported. So far, 24 counties are under federal disaster declarations, making residents eligible for individual aid, Lt. Gov. Patty Judge reported. The flooding is ""some of the worst"" to hit the United States since Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast nearly three years ago, FEMA Administrator David Paulison said Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Diego Costa and Arda Turan took part in training with Atletico Madrid teammates at the Estadio da Luz Friday ahead the Champions League final clash with city rivals Real Madrid. The pair have been an integral part of Atletico's title winning side but remain doubts for Saturday's fixture after being forced off during last weekend's league clash with Barcelona -- the match that saw Atleti clinch La Liga for the first time in 18 years. Costa mainly trained alone on Thursday but was able to join in drills with teammates Friday. The naturalized Spaniard, who has scored 36 goals in 51 appearances this season, reportedly flew to Belgrade for horse-placenta treatment on a hamstring tear earlier this week while Turan has nursed the hip-knock he sustained against the Catalans at the club's training base in Madrid. Atletico manager Diego Simeone, however, remained tight-lipped about the pair's chances of making his starting lineup in Lisbon on Saturday. ""Costa and Arda are important players but they are just names, it will either be them playing or two others who know who they are,"" Simeone told reporters. ""We will examine Diego Costa and the other injury doubts today. They trained better yesterday but we have to see how they feel,"" he added. The Argentine is looking to become just the third non-European coach to win the continent's premier club competition after compatriots Luis Carniglia and Helenio Herrera but is wary of an opponent he knows well. No two teams from the same city have ever contested the Champions League final before or its predecessor, the European Cup. ""We don't know how Madrid will play, we've worked with different possibilities and we will try to block them and find a way to control the match the way we need,"" Simeone said. The sides have met four times already this season with Atletico claiming one league win against Real's two victories in the double-legged Copa del Rey semifinal. The other league match was drawn. Real face injury concerns of their own ahead of the clash that could see them lift the illusive ""decima,"" their tenth European crown which has become an obsession since they won their ninth continental title in 2002. Star players Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale have been struggling for fitness in recent weeks but both are expected to play Saturday. Portuguese defender, Pepe, and French striker, Karim Benzema, however, are less likely to make it. Speaking to reporters Friday, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti said: ""we will assess the injuries at training. Cristiano has trained without problems but Pepe and Benzema haven't trained this week."" ""We will take the decision for tomorrow after this session which they will take part in,"" he added. Ancelotti is aiming to lift the Champions League trophy for the third time as a manager, having done so with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007. But reports have suggested the Italian's position could come under scrutiny should Real fail to win Saturday. Los Blancos claimed the Copa del Rey trophy in April but stumbled to a third placed finish in La Liga behind Atletico and Barcelona. In what may have been comments relating to these reports, Ancelotti said: ""I have clear memories of my last press conference before the 2007 final and I said 'this may be my last press conference, let me enjoy it.'"" ""It wasn't, but this one may be - so let me enjoy it. There's a thin line between an obsession and a dream, but my aim is to realize the dream,"" he said. Real defender, Sergio Ramos, accompanied Ancelotti at Friday's press conference and spoke effusively of his manager. ""Since Carlo Ancelotti arrived he has emphasized hard work and intensity and now that is what Real Madrid are associated with,"" Ramos said. ""He has playing experience which makes him different to other coaches. We realize the efforts many of our fans have to make to come, some will have been saving all year long and that is motivation for the team."" ""Even those who couldn't come, we have to do everything possible to make them happy."" See also: Barcelona appoints Luis Enrique .

"(CNN) -- At least one corner of the solar system may be serving up an ice-and-water sandwich, with the possibility of life on the rocks. NASA researchers, publishing in the journal Planetary and Space Science, have demonstrated that this ""club sandwich"" phenomenon may be happening on Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system and a satellite of Jupiter. This finding means that life could have even arisen on Ganymede. The study suggests there may be a layer of salty water directly on top of Ganymede's rocky core. Chemical interactions between rock and water could lead to the formation of life, scientists say. ""This is good news for Ganymede,"" said lead study author Steve Vance of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a statement. ""Its ocean is huge, with enormous pressures, so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean. When we added salts to our models, we came up with liquids dense enough to sink to the sea floor."" The oceans of Ganymede may have 25 times the volume of Earth's oceans, scientists said. But Ganymede is also smaller; it has an average radius of 1,634 miles, about 41% of Earth's. There is only a handful of places in the solar system thought to have subsurface oceans. There is strong evidence that Europa, another moon of Jupiter's, and Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan have oceans under ice as well. Jupiter's moon Callisto is also a contender. Data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft suggested last month that Enceladus has an ocean at least the size of Lake Superior under its ice layer. Signs of underground ocean found on Saturn moon . Vance and colleagues did not visit Ganymede, obviously, but they performed laboratory experiments here on Earth to simulate what would happen to ice and salty water on the Jupiter moon. They showed that the density of liquids goes up with the presence of salt under extreme conditions inside moons such as Ganymede. Because salt ions attract molecules of H2O, liquid water becomes denser when salt is added. There are many forms of ice, which makes modeling conditions on icy moons complex. You are probably most familiar with Ice I, the ice that floats in a soda fountain beverage because it is lighter than water. But ice molecules get packed together more tightly at high pressures, Vance said. In deep oceans, the dense ice would actually be heavier than water, plummeting to the ocean floor. Vance and colleagues use Ice VI to refer to the most dense and heavy ice that Ganymede may have. On this moon, however, scientists believe the saltiest liquid would be so dense that it would be at the very bottom, above the rock. Computer models taking all of that into account suggest that Ganymede has as many as three ice layers with liquid ocean between them. The models also suggest that ice could form in the seawater -- a process that leaves heavy salts to fall down and lighter ice to float up -- an upward snow effect. In the middle of the layers may be slush from that ice that then melts. Scientists don't know if this model is correct, of course. Senior author Christophe Sotin, also of NASA's JPL, said in a statement that the ""sandwich"" model reflects a stable state, but there are various reasons why the moon might not achieve this structure; it may even alternate between a ""club sandwich"" phase and a structure with fewer layers: light ice, ocean, high-pressure ice. Galileo Galilei discovered Ganymede as well as three other moons of Jupiter in 1610. These moons contributed to the knowledge that our sun and other planets in our solar system do not orbit the Earth, but rather the solar system revolves around the sun. We may learn more about Ganymede and other moons with the potential of life through a space mission called Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE. The mission, being developed by the European Space Agency, will visit Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. It is scheduled to launch in 2022.","Ganymede's oceans may have 25 times the volume of Earth's .

"(CNN) -- A 40-year-old man who allegedly punched and shouted racial slurs at V. Stiviano outside a Manhattan hotel was released on his own recognizance Wednesday as prosecutors investigate possible hate crime charges against him. Dominick Diorio allegedly followed Stiviano -- whose audio recording of Donald Sterling ranting against African-Americans led to his NBA lifetime ban -- from a restaurant to a hotel and taunted her with racial slurs, according to a criminal complaint. When she got into a cab with companions, the complaint said, Diorio ""reached through an open taxi window and struck her in the face with his closed fist,"" causing swelling, redness and pain in her right cheek. According to the complaint, Diorio swung his fists at her, saying, ""Yeah, I'll f**king hit a girl. I'll hit you, you n****r bitch."" David Scott Smith, Diorio's attorney, said outside court that his client ""vehemently denies each and every allegation."" ""I am confident that as this case goes forward and the investigation continues, Ms. Stiviano's allegations will likewise begin to fail and, at the end of the day, the assault charge will be dismissed,"" he said. ""Simply put, a credible victim of a crime does not have her attorneys call the press before she calls the police. Ms. Stiviano seems intent on keeping her name in the spotlight but I can assure you that if this case goes to trial, my cross-examination will last longer than her 15 minutes of fame."" Stiviano filed a formal police complaint Monday -- one day after the alleged assault. Diorio was arraigned Wednesday on a charge of third-degree assault and prosecutors agreed to his release pending an investigation of hate crime charges. The case will be presented to a grand jury. Diorio, who surrendered to police, next appears in court July 30. The complaint said Dioro followed Stiviano on the street while repeatedly calling her a ""n****r bitch"" and a ""whore."" Stiviano told police she was with her sister and a friend at Revel restaurant when a group at another table called her a prostitute and shouted slurs at her, a NYPD official said. Stiviano and her sister exchanged words with the group. When Diorio allegedly put his cell phone near Stiviano's face to snap a photo, she knocked the phone out of his hands and walked out of the restaurant, the police official said. Stiviano told investigators that she and her sister were followed by the group as they walked to the Gansevoort hotel to hail a cab, the official said. Video obtained by police showed the women were followed by two men and a woman from outside the restaurant to the hotel. Outside the hotel, the official said, Diorio allegedly directed more slurs at Stiviano, who got into a cab with her sister. One man held the cab door open, while the other yelled at her and punched her in the face. The man who held the door then spit at her, the official said. The second man has not been arrested. Stiviano and her sister left the cab and got into a shoving match with the two men, the official said. Witnesses told police that Stiviano and the men were in a fighting stance when both men threw punches at her. Two other men intervened and broke up the fight. Security at the Gansevoort called police, the official said. When officers arrived, one of the men who attacked Stiviano was bleeding. He said he had fallen to the ground. A witness provided police the name of one of the attackers, who was located in a Facebook photo of the group from Sunday. The group was out celebrating the suspect's 40th birthday, according to the law enforcement official. Police also identified the second man and were trying to locate him. ""We understand that there are now two videos of the assault that have been located,"" Mac Nehoray, Stiviano's lawyer, said in a statement. ""In addition, several witnesses have been come forward with relevant and critical information regarding the facts surrounding the incident and the identity of the assailants."" The assault came after video surfaced on TMZ that showed Stiviano making disparaging remarks about African-Americans. ""I don't understand black people. You give them a little bit of money, they don't know what to do with it,"" she says in the video that purportedly dates back to 2011 as part of a reality show pilot, TMZ said. CNN reached out to Nehoray for comment on the video but has not received a response. Stiviano is known as the woman who recorded inflammatory remarks by Sterling, owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, which spawned outrage among NBA fans, players and executives. In that recording, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures online of herself with African-Americans, including NBA legend Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. He tells her not to bring Johnson to Clippers games. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise. Sterling sues NBA for $1 billion as questions over his mental state loom . CNN's Joe Sutton and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this story.","Suspect in V.

"(CNN) -- Myanmar security forces have been accused by a rights group of ""systematically"" torturing civilians from an ethnic minority in the conflict-stricken state of Kachin. Bangkok-based Fortify Rights released its report on the alleged torture of Kachin civilians on Monday, the third anniversary of the resumption of hostilities between government forces and ethnic Kachin insurgents following a 17 year ceasefire. The report gathered testimony from 78 survivors and witnesses relating to the alleged torture of more than 60 victims by Myanmar's army, police and military intelligence service, since the resumption of fighting. Fortify Rights' executive director Matthew Smith said the alleged victims were perceived to be aligned with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the ethnic rebel guerrilla force that has battled Myanmar's army for decades. The alleged abuse appeared to have been carried out with the consent of senior officers, he said. ""The torture that we've documented is not a secret practice,"" he said. ""When the police, the army or military intelligence are torturing Kachin civilians, they're not attempting to conceal it. They're sending a very loud and clear message to the Kachin population that any sort of sympathy for the KIA, or any activities with the KIA, will be dealt with very severely."" The report said torture was most often committed by government troops trying to obtain information on the strength and movements of KIA fighters. Alleged victims reported being stabbed, beaten and having wire tied around their necks, hands and feet. Other claims included that security forces had placed bamboo over their victims' heads or shins, and jumped or stood on it. Some were told to dig their own graves before being released, while others were made to lick their own blood off the ground following prolonged beatings, the report claimed. Other alleged victims said they had been sexually abused while detained. Smith said the alleged abuses, which his group believed constituted war crimes, seemed to be being committed with impunity. ""We've documented such consistent practices across many different areas that would indicate that it is certainly a systematic practice and a widespread practice."" READ MORE: Myanmar city forgives but doesn't forget sectarian violence . The report also described the torture sessions as characterized by a degree of ethnic and religious discrimination, with the offenders often denigrating their victims' ethnicity and Christian faith during the ordeal. ""You are Kachin, and we will kill all the Kachin,"" one victim claimed to have been told. Many Kachin are Christian, while Myanmar is a majority Buddhist country. Ye Htut, a spokesman for Myanmar President Thein Sein, said he had not seen that report, but rejected the allegations of torture, accusing Fortify Rights of ""one-sided allegations."" ""Their report is not concrete evidence,"" he said. ""If they have concrete evidence, they can send it to the government and the government will investigate thoroughly and punish (offenders) if we find they've committed these crimes. We'll take action according to our laws."" He said Myanmar security forces would ""never use torture as a weapon in the conflict areas,"" and stressed that any individuals who did so would be in breach of government policy. ""There may be some individuals who commit this crime, but it is not the policy of the military or the government,"" he said. ""You cannot apply the individual action to the government policy. Some U.S. soldiers are making wrongdoing in Afghanistan and Iraq, but we should not say it is the policy of the U.S. military or government."" READ MORE: Aung San Suu Kyi and the Rohingya -- has 'The Lady' lost her voice? Smith said the report had been provided to the president's office. ""If it's not state policy, then they should demonstrate that by credibly investigating and prosecuting those that are responsible for these abuses,"" he said. ""But we're not seeing that, and this has been going on for three years now."" Fortify Rights said it shared the concerns expressed by the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, over allegations the KIA uses child soldiers, forced labor and landmines. But the report's authors had found no evidence of the KIA using torture. Myanmar has been wracked with internal conflict, with ethnic minorities seeking greater autonomy, since shortly after the country, then known as Burma, gained independence from Britain in 1948. The country's quasi-civilian government, which replaced the military junta following sweeping reforms in 2011, has been seeking a national ceasefire with 16 ethnic guerrilla forces. Since the 17-year ceasefire between the military and KIA forces crumbled in June 2011, the two sides have held numerous peace talks, but fighting continues. The United Nations says that more than 100,000 people have been displaced in Kachin State and the north of neighboring Shan State, home to many Kachin, since the violence resumed. READ MORE: Fears of new unrest as Myanmar ponders monk-backed interfaith marriage ban . Amnesty International says the situation faced by the displaced populations, currently housed in over 165 camps, is grave, with ongoing concerns about their access to shelter, clean water and sanitation. It issued a statement saying that the reports of ongoing alleged human rights violations by the military raised ""serious questions about the commitment to human rights reforms in the country"" and threatened efforts to negotiate a nationwide ceasefire. Myanmar's civil society groups have also reported sexual violence against women in Kachin areas since the resumption of fighting. The Kachin Women's Association Thailand said in a statement that recent attacks by the Myanmar army in Kachin areas threw ""strong doubt on the government's sincerity towards the peace process."" Citing recent cases of alleged rape by military forces, it called for tackling military sexual violence to be made a matter of priority during peace negotiations.

"(CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium was packed to the rafters: 200,000 expectant spectators prepared to celebrate Brazil's first World Cup triumph and its arrival as a football superpower. It was the moment the South American country's love of the game, and of its most prestigious competition, became a dangerous obsession. July 16, 1950, the final match of the final group stage. Brazil faced Uruguay, and a draw would be enough to see the host crowned as champion. The champagne was put on ice when winger Friaca gave Brazil a 1-0 lead just after halftime. But the samba beat was silenced when Juan Alberto Schiaffino equalized for Uruguay -- and then the unthinkable happened. World Sport Presents: Racism in Football . Uruguay came forward, Brazil goalkeeper Barbosa stepped off his line, Alcides Ghiggia scuffed a low shot towards the near post ... and the ball nestled in the back of the net. Brazil had lost. A nation's hearts were broken. Lives were forever altered and a national obsession was born. The 63 years since have seen Brazil become football's dominant force. The five World Cups won by ""A Selecao"" is more than any other country in the quadrennial competition's 83-year history. But not one of Brazil's quintet of triumphs has banished the shadow cast by the failure of Moacyr Barbosa Nascimento and his teammates. ""The idea the rest of the world has about Brazil, and perhaps Brazil has about itself to a certain extent, is that it is all about 'joga bonito,' it is all about the beautiful game,"" says Jonathan Wilson, journalist and author of ""The Outsider: A history of the goalkeeper."" ""Actually it is all about winning in Brazil, far more than anywhere else despite the perception,"" he told CNN. ""There's no such thing as heroic failure in Brazil. ""Barbosa was named goalkeeper of the tournament, but he was scapegoated in Brazil because of what happened in the final game. ""He didn't get picked for the next couple of years. He was a very good goalkeeper, but all he is remembered for is that one mistake."" The error which led to Uruguay's second goal hung over Barbosa until his death in 2000. But the saddest moment of his life, he said, was not in the final or its immediate aftermath. Some 20 years later, a woman in a supermarket pointed towards him and declared to the young boy by her side, ""Look at him, son. He is the man that made all of Brazil cry."" ""Under Brazilian law the maximum sentence is 30 years,"" Barbosa remarked on his 79th birthday, just two weeks before he passed away. ""But my imprisonment has been for 50 years."" The disappointment looms large in Brazil's national psyche, and all the more so with the country to host the World Cup again next year for the first time since that fateful day. ""Nelson Rodriguez, the playwright, spoke about 'Our Hiroshima,"" Wilson said. ""It seems monstrously disproportionate and it is, but I think what he means is that it's Brazil's national disaster. ""They've never been in a war, they've never really had a great disaster. They just expected to win. The newspapers on the morning of the game were saying 'Brazil World Champions.' "" The newspapers were wrong. It is this weight which the present day team must carry as it prepares to host the Confederations Cup, a warmup event for the World Cup, which Brazil kicks off against Japan on Saturday. Once again the World Cup is coming to Brazil and once again a nation expects. ""Everybody knows the bad experiences we had in the World Cup in Brazil in the '50s -- we lost, but now we have to recover,"" says Pele, one of football's greatest players and a triple World Cup winner with Brazil between 1958 and 1970. Barbosa's tale is a cautionary one for the current Brazil squad. A mistake by any player next year could be the costliest they ever make. Luiz Felipe Scolari, coach of the last Brazil team to lift the World Cup in 2002, was reinstated in November 2012 to inspire a floundering team. The results have been unspectacular. Scolari has won two, drawn four and lost one of his seven matches back at the helm and the team languishes in 22nd in the FIFA world rankings. A 2-2 draw with England in June was the first match at the refurbished Maracana, a stadium which is both a monument to Brazil's sporting prowess and a mausoleum for past failure. ""We always have good players, but we don't have a good team right now,"" Carlos Alberto, captain of Brazil's World Cup winners of 1970, told CNN. ""We don't have experience, the players are very young. ""Everybody says to these players, 'You have to win, you have to win.' It's not good because they are young, they don't have the experience to play an international tournament."" That 1970 team is often referred to as the greatest of all time, given the style and swagger with which it crushed Italy 4-1 in the final match of the Mexico tournament. The advent of color television made the players, bedecked in iconic vibrant yellow with green trim, appear as if soccer stars from another planet. Alberto does not think the current generation is yet capable of emulating his team's achievements, but he is backing his countrymen to succeed four years later. ""They are going to take the experience of playing in the World Cup next year into 2018. In Russia, I bet you any money Brazil will win!"" he declared. ""Next year, if they get to the semifinals it is OK."" Edu, a midfielder capped 15 times for Brazil between 2004 and 2005, shares Alberto's reservations. The former Arsenal player is concerned a change of management has disrupted a squad short on international experience. ""We're not prepared yet,"" Edu, now director of football at Club World Cup winners Corinthians, told CNN. ""We've changed the coach, which is not normal. ""Usually a coach has four, five, six years to get used to his team. Scolari is lucky, because Brazil has a lot of players to build a good squad. But I'm not sure if they will be prepared enough for the World Cup. ""The Brazilian team is not in the best moment."" One player of whom a huge amount is expected is Neymar, a flamboyant attacker recently signed by Barcelona who is frequently hailed as ""the new Pele."" If Brazil is to finally win the World Cup on home soil, the fleet-footed, shock-haired attacker will have to prove he has shoulders broad enough to carry a nation's hopes. ""Listen, winning the World Cup is very hard because it is a box of surprises. No doubt Brazil is one of the best, but this doesn't mean Brazil is going to win ... The best players in Europe, they are Brazilian,"" Pele told CNN. ""In Brazil we have had a lot of excellent players like Zico, Tostao, Rivelino, Pele, Ronaldinho, but the last two years we have had Neymar. ""He is very talented. I hope he has luck in Barcelona. I didn't like it so much because he used to play in my team, Santos, I lost a good player. He deserves to go to the best team. ""I said to be the new Pele would be very difficult, because my mother and my father, they closed the machine (gestures). But no doubt he is one of the best players who we have in Brazil.""","Brazil will host the football World Cup for first time in 64 years in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Evidence is mounting against camels as leading suspects in a deadly mystery that's claimed more than 100 lives in the Middle East. The biological supervillain is the virus causing MERS-coV, short for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a type of coronavirus. Since the first documented cases in spring 2012, MERS has sickened at least 339 people in Saudi Arabia alone and killed nearly a third of them, according to the country's Ministry of Health. A recent surge in reported cases -- including 26 new ones this past weekend -- has fanned concern the outbreak might be shifting into a more dangerous phase. With any newly recognized virus, disease detectives start with a few key questions. What kind of illness does it cause? How is it spread? And where does it come from? With regard to that last question, a new paper leaves little doubt that at least one answer is camels. Researchers from Columbia University, King Saud University and the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance managed to isolate live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. Should I be concerned about new virus? A genetic analysis found numerous substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. The findings are published in mBio, the open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology. The attention on camels isn't new; in February, the same group published a finding that nearly three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past exposure to the MERS coronavirus. The new paper still leaves many questions unanswered: For example, what other animals might harbor the virus? Could it be bats, as some have suggested? ""There might be another animal, but we don't know,"" says Dr. Ian Lipkin, who organized the research as director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health. ""We need more in terms of surveillance."" Does the virus make camels sick? Researchers don't know, says Peter Daszak, another study author and president of the EcoHealth Alliance, which researches links between animal health and human disease. Perhaps most urgent: Has something recently changed to make MERS-coV more dangerous? Here, some of the evidence is reassuring. Any avid mystery reader knows that a watchdog who doesn't bark can be an important clue. With MERS, there is a lack of alarm bells from the laboratory; so far there is no evidence that the virus is changing to attack people more aggressively or to spread more easily. There isn't enough evidence to draw a firm conclusion, says Dr. Mark Denison, a leading expert on coronaviruses and a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University. It also remains to be seen whether humans are being infected by more than one of the substrains found in camels. ""There's a lot more work that would need to be done"" to prove it, he says. Those who study MERS-coV says it's crucial to pin down just how the virus is transmitted. ""We need to know what people are most at risk,"" Daszak says. ""We don't know if they're involved in camel racing, camel breeding, camel slaughter -- that's really critical right now."" Lipkin says the virus likely spreads in a variety of ways, but he'd like to see more aggressive steps taken to prevent the possibility of people being infected by eating camel meat or drinking raw, unpasteurized camel milk -- both of which are common in Saudi Arabia. He says the Saudis will face special concerns again this fall when millions descend on the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the Hajj pilgrimage. As part of the ritual, animals are sacrificed, and their meat shipped all over the world to help feed the hungry. Saudis: More deaths from respiratory syndrome . ""The butchery will begin in three or four months' time, and we have to have measures in place to ensure that the animals aren't infected,"" Lipkin says. For example, he says, officials could decide to forbid the slaughter of young camels for food since younger animals are more likely to carry the MERS virus. Dr. David Swerdlow, who heads the team responsible for tracking MERS at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says the Saudi government took steps to discourage the spread of the virus during last year's Hajj, including posting warnings to discourage people older than 65, pregnant women or those who were immune-compromised from making the pilgrimage. Health authorities have not yet decided what steps to take this year, Swerdlow says, but the United States is watching the situation closely. ""Any time you have an emerging infection that has a high case fatality rate, that's been around for over a year, that has caused illness in multiple countries, that's caused illness in travelers and health care workers, and for which there is no treatment or vaccine, we're concerned. We've been concerned for a year and a half, and we remain concerned.""","The MERS coronavirus has sickened more than 330 people in Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- Interns -- between office duties, they fetch your coffee, pick up your dry cleaning, maybe even cover for you when you play hooky from the office. But watch your back: That same fresh-faced intern who sucks up to you from 9 to 5 might be gunning for your job or, worse, trying to kill you. At least, that's the premise of Shane Kuhn's darkly comic thriller, ""The Intern's Handbook,"" which was released this month. In Kuhn's story, John Lago is an intern at a prestigious Manhattan law firm. He's also a hit man, hired to infiltrate top-level companies and assassinate crooked executives, all while disguised as a lowly office intern. While the plot may sound far removed from reality, Kuhn has found a powerful theme in the working world. Almost everyone trying to climb the corporate ladder has to start out at the bottom; some huge success stories started out as interns, including people like Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs and Sean Combs. CNN's Anderson Cooper was once a summer intern for the CIA. In recent months, interns have been making headlines, not for the work they do, but for for how little they're paid to do it -- and sometimes, for how they're treated by the boss. A growing number of cities and states are passing laws to protect unpaid interns against sexual harassment and discrimination. There has been a handful of lawsuits from interns against some big targets, including movie studios and media companies, over unpaid wages and overtime. Kuhn, 46, says he, too, started out as an intern and it always struck him as ""odd"" how interns have a combination of anonymity and access. ""An intern is basically someone who is hiding in plain sight. Nobody knows their name, no one could pick them out of a lineup, but at the same time, they do everything for their employers,"" Kuhn says. Kuhn says his novel wasn't inspired by any horror stories from his working past. There were no horrible bosses, just indifferent ones. ""To the boss, interns are complete nobodies they don't even want to look at,"" he said. ""It's all the people working under the boss, the everyday workers, that take advantage of the interns."" Kuhn says at times he felt like ""a bit of an indentured servant"" working for the paid employees in his office. ""If they wanted to go play golf in the afternoon, but they had filing to do or documents that needed to be pulled, they would just have me do it. Then afterward they say to me, 'Hey man, thanks for doing me a solid, Shawn.'"" Nevermind that his name is Shane. Ultimately, Kuhn says, he realized he was not going anywhere as an intern. ""You kind of end up bending over backward and then you don't necessarily get a job,"" he said. ""You just get shuffled off and they bring in a new batch of interns to do all their work for them."" But the Fort Collins, Colorado, author's experiences stuck with him, and eventually became fodder for his fiction. He describes his book as the ""love child"" between two of his obsessions: corporate America and assassins. ""I've always wanted to write a really good assassin's story. To me it's the ultimate blank slate character,"" he said. Previous movies and books put a comic spin on the intern story, but Kuhn had a different vision, saying, ""There could be something more sinister about an intern, something darker. Then it clicked for me, there's my unique take on the assassin story. It seemed like the perfect thing to apply to interns."" While this is Kuhn's first novel, he has worked for nearly 20 years in the film industry, mostly as a screenwriter, penning such B-movies as ""Drive Thru,"" ""The Scorpion King 3"" and ""SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines."" In 1995, he co-founded the Slamdance FIlm Festival, an even more indie version of Sundance in Park City, Utah. He says he wanted his book to capture the feel of a big screen blockbuster. ""I wanted to create enough cues for this to really blow up in your mind and feel like a movie."" Hollywood's taken notice. Kuhn says he's had preliminary discussions with several stars in the entertainment industry about bringing his book to the big screen or television but says he's in no rush to make a deal. ""This is really a dream come true for me,"" he said. ""Finally I'm a published author. I don't want to screw it up. This book is my baby. I'm going to be pretty careful with it."" For now, Kuhn says he's going all-in with ""The Intern's Handbook."" He plans to have the book's jacket art tattooed on his arm at a promotional event this week. He's already written a sequel and has an idea for a third story, and potentially more, in what could be a future ""Interns"" franchise. ""I'm moving forward creatively,"" he said. ""I'm not going to stop. I'm going to keep writing.""","Shane Kuhn's darkly comic thriller, ""The Intern's Handbook,"" debuted this month .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Ali Hassan's body is broken, courtesy of a sniper who blew holes in the soldier's left leg and left hand. The wounds are so fresh that blood seeps through the bandages. He winces as he struggles to try to sit up before giving up and lying back down on the gurney. Staring up at the stained hospital ceiling, Hassan recounts the fierce firefight Wednesday on the streets of Ramadi that landed him here. Across the room, a border guard wounded in the battle for the al Qaim border crossing writhes in pain as doctors examine his legs, which are being held by metal rods rather than bone. In the corner, an Iraqi special forces soldier is wrapped in bandages from gunshot wounds he received in a firefight outside of Samarra. These are just a few of the dozens of the war's wounded that CNN saw Thursday being treated at a hospital in the heart of the Iraqi capital where soldiers, police and border guards are packed four, five and six, in some cases, to a room. Their stories paint a fuller picture of frontline battles detailed at near daily news briefings conducted by Iraq's military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Qassim Atta, who cites the military's ""success"" in battling the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and their Sunni militant allies. He offers up a laundry list of information, from the number of air strikes carried out to the number of ISIS fighters killed. But Atta has offered no details about how many of the country's security forces have been killed or wounded. The ministries of defense and interior have also declined a CNN request for the number of casualties. But the anecdotal evidence, in the form of personal accounts from the wounded and the families of the dead, paint a picture of an Iraqi military that is still very much fighting to hold ground in some areas against ISIS. Hassan, 28, joined the military three years ago as a way to provide for his family, who live south of Baghdad in the city of Hilla. Three months ago, he was deployed to Ramadi as part of the government's effort to hold the provincial capital after nearby Falluja was overrun by ISIS fighters, a bellwether of what was to come for Iraq. Observers predicted the city would fall to ISIS after the extremists swept across the Syrian border last month in a lightning offensive that saw them seize large swaths of northern and western Iraq. But the city has held. Or at least a part of it. ""We ran out of ammunition, and we called back to the base and they said to come back,"" he said. As they started to withdraw on Wednesday, snipers opened fire. When it was over, he and five of his comrades were wounded and two were dead. ""They were still shooting but someone drove a Humvee to us, and he carried us out,"" Hassan said. Within hours, he was transported to the hospital in Baghdad, where doctors have told him he will be released and sent home in a week. Maybe less, he says. ""They told me they need the room,"" Hassan said. 'My friends, they carried me' On the other side of the room, Waad Kareem's mother tends to him, bringing him food and water. He is Ashwak Aboud's only son, and she is worried about his prognosis. The X-rays that hang in a plastic shopping bag off the bed tells the tale: A shattered tibia and fibula in his right leg. A portion of the bone is missing, lost perhaps when ISIS fighters shot him as he was running. Kareem, 29, of al-Kut, was at al Qaim when ISIS fighters swept across, pushing the Iraqi military and the border guards from their posts after they ran out of ammunition and supplies. Rather than surrender to ISIS, he and 10 of his fellow border patrol officers ran six kilometers to a police station. But when they arrived, he says, there was nobody there. With what little weapons and ammunition they had left, they barricaded themselves in the building and fought back. One by one, his comrades were shot and killed. With eight men dead, it was clear they couldn't hold out until help arrived, he said. That's when he and two others decided to make a run for it at night. Kareem said he bolted from the building, only making it a short distance before he was gunned down. He never saw who shot him. Laying in the hospital bed, Kareem covers his eyes with his forearm, not wanting anyone to see the tears he can no longer hold back. ""My friends, they carried me,"" he said. Evacuated from front line . Ali Ahmed, 29, lies in the hospital bed next to Kareem, and listens to the story. He tells him in Arabic, ""It will be OK."" Ahmed, an army lieutenant, knows it won't really be OK for the men in the room. If they are lucky, they will walk again. Not perfectly, but enough to live a life. ""This is what happens when you fight,"" he said. Ahmed was hit by shrapnel during a mortar barrage in Tikrit this week that left the femur in his left leg broken in several places. When asked about government reports that Iraqi troops were successfully retaking Saddam Hussein's hometown, 160 kilometers north of Baghdad, he shook his head. At one point, he said he and his troops appeared to be surrounded by ISIS fighters. ""No food, no water,"" he said. They had to drink water from streams. Ammunition was also running low, he said. Then the shelling started. Ahmed said he was evacuated from the front line by the army. In his hospital bed, he looks down at the long thin screws that have been twisted into his leg to hold the pieces of bone together. At least, he says, he's alive and he will one day go home. Some of his comrades weren't so lucky. Iraq's orphans left to ask: 'Why do these people kill other people?'","Iraqi army soldiers, border guards, tell stories from the front line .

"(CNN) -- An actor escaped death in front of an Austrian theater audience after slashing his throat in a bizarre on-stage mix-up. File image of Daniel Hoevels on stage in Salzburg . Daniel Hoevels, 30, collapsed on stage at Vienna's Burgtheater last weekend with blood pouring from his neck after cutting his throat with what was supposed to be a blunt knife, media reports said Thursday. As he fell injured the audience started to applaud, oblivious to the fact that Hoevels was really hurt, Britain's Telegraph newspaper reported. The actor was rushed to hospital with a knife wound that had narrowly missed his main artery. Fortunately Hoevels recovered after treatment and appeared on stage the following night with a bandage around his neck, Austrian media reports said. Ironically, Hoevels' character was supposed to commit suicide in the stage production of Friedrich Schiller's Mary Stuart, about Mary Queen of Scots. Austrian police are now investigating whether the incident was a mistake or a deliberate attack on the actor.","Hoevels cut his throat with what was meant to be a stage prop .

"Columbus, Georgia (CNN) -- The Huey helicopter came in from the west, the ""pop, pop, pop"" of its blades announcing its arrival. It made a sharp right-hand turn and flared to a landing in the grassy area. The ragtag troop of 10 passengers awaiting its arrival looked far from Army issue, dressed in Aloha shirts, T-shirts, blue jeans, shorts and ball caps. They ducked their heads beneath the blades of the spinning rotor as they made their way to the copter from a protected area off to its front. But Army Special Forces Capt. Homer Haracourt, a four-tour veteran of Vietnam, needed help. He was paralyzed from the waist down, and to make this flight, he'd need the assistance of others. The Army copter's crew obliged, six of them gathering to lift Haracourt into the outside seat on right side of the chopper, the crew chief strapping him in to the canvas seat so he wouldn't fall out the open door. Haracourt beamed as his helpers retreated. The copter fidgeted a bit as the pilot applied power. The skids left the ground, and after a short rotation to the right, Huey 354 sped away on one of more than a dozen hops it would fly this day, one of countless such hops it had flown since it was put into service in Vietnam more than 40 years ago. This is a story of heroes, both mechanical and flesh and blood. None of them will call themselves that, the Huey because, well, it can't. The men who fly it and fly on it this March afternoon because they're way too humble for any bombast. But I'm the witness. I've seen what these guys do, and I'm declaring them heroes. The flight crew on this March Saturday are from the nonprofit  Army Aviation Heritage Foundation in Hampton, Georgia. They volunteer countless hours to restore and maintain Army helicopters from the Vietnam era and then take them to air shows across the country where you can fly on them. Yes, you can fly with heroes. They are guys like Ralph Kahlan, the pilot of Huey 354, carrying Haracourt this Saturday morning at the Thunder in the Valley airshow in Columbus, Georgia. Kahlan, 65, is the assistant dean of the Georgia State University College of Business these days. But he's a veteran of two tours in Vietnam, first as an infantry officer and then as a Huey pilot. He knows what the Huey meant from above and below. ""It was a love-hate relationship as an infantry officer in Vietnam,"" he said. They dropped troops into tough spots but were there to get them out. ""Swore at 'em when they left, couldn't wait for them to show up,"" he said. That was a lot of swearing and cheering in Vietnam. More than 9,400 Hueys were built, according to the foundation. More than 2,000 flew in the war, in God knows how many missions. Watch any news footage from the time, and you'll probably see the Huey, ferrying troops to and from the field, their door gunners firing away at treelines to protect the GIs. The Huey was there at the end too, making flights from the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as it was overrun in 1975. Huey 354 was in the fight. The aircraft giving rides in Georgia this Saturday in March flew 1,417 combat hours in Vietnam. Ask the Army Av guys, and they'll show you the hole in the floor at the left rear. Patched over now, it's where an enemy round passed through during combat in 1971. After that damage, Pat Derry probably flew Huey 354. The Rockford, Illinois, native and Army Aviation Heritage Foundation member is a businessman now. In Vietnam, he was the maintenance test pilot for his unit, nicknamed ""The Comancheros."" That meant before any copter could go on a mission after repairs or servicing, Derry took it up to make sure it worked. ""That's why I knew I flew 354, because I flew every helicopter once every couple of months,"" he said. You can see the unit's logo on the front of Huey 354 today. Derry, who flew under the call sign ""Comanchero 2½"" in Vietnam, doesn't fly copters these days. But he stopped by the foundation's hangar in suburban Atlanta a while back to reconnect with the Huey. ""I didn't get emotional about sitting in it or anything, but it was just kind of a neat deal,"" Derry said. ""Forty to 45 years later, to be able to sit in something that was that big a deal as part of your life is kind of cool."" Back in Columbus, Haracourt is on the ground after a 10-minute hop in Huey 354. The crew that got him on the aircraft has repeated the procedure, transferring the 75-year-old as gently as possible from helicopter to his motorized wheelchair. But there's a hitch; the chair can't seem to navigate the grassy ground where Kahlan has set down the Huey. The crews will have to carry chair and passenger to the tarmac. There are no complaints from Haracourt. ""I'm not bitter,"" he said. ""I signed up for the Army."" So what did he do in Vietnam? Behind him, his daughter, 56-year-old Rosemary Haracourt, shakes her head. ""I don't talk about that. Never have,"" the former Army captain said. What he will tell you is what these Huey rides mean to him: ""Everything!"" And that means if you come to Columbus next March, you could fly with this hero. ""The good Lord willing, I'll be back next year; yes, I will,"" he said.","The Army Aviation Heritage Foundation restores Vietnam-era helicopters .

"(Time.com) -- Last month, Sean Parker of Napster fame launched Airtime. Amid the hoopla of the launch -- attended, for some reason, by Jimmy Fallon and Snoop Dogg -- Parker told an anecdote about meeting his business partner, Shawn Fanning, 15 years ago in a chat room, saying, ""There's something exciting about bringing spontaneity to the Internet. All of your interactions online are constrained by the people you already know."" Time.com: Chatroulette 2.0? Napster founders launch Airtime video chat . So far, Airtime hasn't exactly been a hit. Apparently people don't feel constrained by interacting with the people they know -- they feel comforted by it. But what, exactly, did happen to the chat rooms Parker so fondly remembers? I talked with Joe Schober, the longest-running employee at AOL and its current chief architect. His relationship with the company started in 1988, before it was America Online. Back then it was called AppleLink, a project commissioned by Apple Computer and a company called Quantum Computer Services to connect Apple II and Macintosh computers. The beta test was dubbed ""Samuel"" and for Schober, a teenage fan of BBSes (bulletin board systems), it was an intriguing opportunity. He recalls a ""little frontier town"" where you could initially recognize almost every screen name you came across. When the main chat room filled to capacity, necessitating the creation of Lobby 2, the community celebrated. It only took 23 people to fill a chat room. ""I know for myself, personally, I found it fascinating,"" says Schober. ""The BBS world, it tended to be a one-line experience -- you were the sole user of the service, you could send email, you could leave messages, but it wasn't interactive in real-time in the same way. So the experience of going into a chat room and getting a response a couple of seconds later from someone who was in the same chat room was just really cool."" Time.com: 12 unique compouters, tablets and gadgets that are just around the bend . Slowly, the service grew, expanding to support DOS and eventually Windows. The chat product, called People Connection, had a variety of rooms for people interested in such topics as genealogy and strategy games. Schober remembers a ticker dubbed ""Network News,"" a kind of virtual community newsletter that would let people know when certain chat rooms had a special guest or were discussing certain topics. Schober moved from beta tester to full-time employee in 1992, when the service -- now officially called America Online -- went public. The company was positioned perfectly for the onset of the Internet Age. Windows 3.1 was released, making personal computers both more affordable and easier to use. And, despite our memories of the slow-dialing modems of the '90s, connecting to the World Wide Web was faster than ever at the time. ""In the '80s, if you had a 2400 baud modem you were pretty hot stuff,"" says Schober. ""2400 baud is painful. People talk about their cellphones being slow now; a slow cellphone might be 256k or 512k, so if you think about something being 100 times slower than that, it's ridiculous. So you started getting to the 9600 and 14,400 baud modems that made the speeds a little more comfortable."" Time.com: Google Graveyard, meet Microsoft's Morgue . Participation in chat rooms started to snowball; as more people used them, the variety of chat rooms increased, attracting even more people. Then, in 1996, America Online opened the floodgates by introducing a monthly flat rate instead of charging by the hour. For $19.95 a month, users could now linger in chat rooms for as long as they wanted. The late '90s, according to Schober, was when chat rooms hit their peak. Just how powerful was America Online during this time? Reggie Fairchild, product manager for AOL 4.0, shared this little story on Quora: . ""When we launched AOL 4.0 in 1998, AOL used ALL of the world-wide CD production for several weeks. Think of that. Not a single music CD or Microsoft CD was produced during those weeks."" It worked. People signed up in droves. AOL's subscriber base grew to 17 million in 1999. This is the era that many people, myself included, remember most vividly. As a gawky kid entering high school, chat rooms were a haven from the awkwardness of real human interaction. I'd use them to discuss punk bands like Operation Ivy with other teenagers, to play the chat room-equivalent of Dungeons & Dragons, and talk to what I very much hoped were actual girls. Around 2000, however, I found myself drawn more to AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) than I did to AOL's chat rooms. Launched in 1997, AIM became widespread once it was made available to non-subscribers in 1998. Time.com: AOL's thoroughly modern AIM . Then in the 2000s, the rise of DSL and cable modems made paying AOL a monthly fee for Internet access seem increasingly unnecessary. Friendster launched in 2002, Myspace in 2003 and Facebook in 2004. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft made gaming in chat rooms seem antiquated. Time.com: Atari at 40: Catching up with founder Nolan Bushnell . There were, in short, a lot more options for people who wanted to interact online. AOL's walled garden was officially dismantled in 2006. Chat rooms were available to AIM users until 2010, when AOL announced, ""Since usage of AIM Chat has declined significantly in recent months, our focus has moved to other products."" Today, chat services such as Facebook Messenger and Google Talk (a.k.a. Gchat) are popular, but chat rooms as they existed in the 1990s are mostly a relic. So, is the chat room dead? Schober doesn't think so. ""I don't think people have necessarily stopped using them -- there are just different ways of expressing the same concept now,"" says Schober. ""Now people on Facebook will start a thread on someone's Timeline and really start interacting with one another. It's a different visual format, it's organized differently, but its really the same concept we had around the chat room."" Time.com: Five years ago today, the iPhone went on sale . Yes, that's true, but to me the experience just feels different. That's what Parker was getting at when he talked about the ""spontaneity to the Internet"" during the Airtime launch. In the '90s, I constantly interacted with people known to me only by their screen names; today, I only interact that way in comments sections and on Twitter, and only occasionally. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I'm nostalgic for AOL chat rooms, but would I use them if the company brought them back? No. But that doesn't mean some entrepreneur out there isn't working on something that captures the same spirit, albeit without the same hegemony AOL enjoyed. In the meantime, I'll have to settle for talking with strangers on Twitter. Anybody want to talk about punk bands from the late '80s and early '90s? This article originally appeared on Time.com: . AOL's longest-running employee on the history of AOL chat rooms .","AOL chat rooms, popular in the 90's and early 00's, are less so today thanks to new technology .

"(CNN) -- Could the exchange of five Taliban prisoners for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl set a precedent for swaps involving other countries holding U.S. military or diplomatic personnel? The Obama administration says ""no."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked by reporters whether the United States would consider releasing the three remaining members of the ""Cuban Five,"" a group of men convicted of espionage in the late 1990s, for USAID contractor Alan Gross, who is jailed in Cuba. Fellow soldiers call Bergdahl a deserter . Havana has repeatedly told the Obama administration it wanted to negotiate a deal, saying the men were not spies and were only monitoring exile groups responsible for attacks against Cuba. Gross, who was working for the U.S. Agency for International Development when he was arrested, was charged by a Cuban court in 2011 of being an American spy. USAID has said he was in the country working on a U.S. government project setting up satellite internet connections. Cuban officials tell CNN the United States refuses to engage on the issue. Psaki said the administration remains opposed to such a trade and stressed that Bergdahl's case was an extraordinary measure to free a prisoner of war. What's next for Bergdahl? The Obama administration justified the operation due to Bergdahl's health and safety, which appeared in jeopardy. ""In any case, whether it's Alan Gross or Kenneth Bae or others who are detained American citizens, we take every step possible to make the case and to -- take steps to ensure their return home to the United States,"" she said. Gross's health has been an issue. And Bae is a Korean-American convicted by North Korea on charges of trying to overthrow the government. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Bae's family is also worried about his health. He is widely reported to have been carrying out Christian missionary work in North Korea. ""We look at each case differently,"" Psaki said. There have been other instances when a U.S. administration sought to negotiate the release of Americans being held in non-military situations. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter tried to broker the release of the American hostages in Iran. And in 1985, President Ronald Reagan approved secret arms sales to Iran in an effort to secure the release of seven American hostages being held by Iranians in Lebanon. That was the core of what became the Iran-Contra affair. The deal for Bergdahl also raises questions about the United States and present day Iran. Would the United States, for example, release Iranians serving American-imposed prison terms for violating sanctions or weapons trafficking in exchange for Bob Levinson, the longest-held American hostage in U.S. history? Levinson, a former FBI agent disappeared in 2007 in Iran. It has since been revealed he was working for a group of CIA analysts without authorization of the agency's leadership. Iran has long denied any involvement in Levinson's disappearance, but U.S. officials have said they believe he is alive and have urged the Iranian government to help secure his release.","The State Department says Bergdahl's case does not set the stage for other exchanges .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A TV-size probe adorned with a painting of the Indian flag successfully rammed into the moon Friday evening as part of the country's first unmanned lunar mission, Indian space officials said. The spacecraft carrying India's first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, lifts off from Sriharikota. The Moon Impact Probe detached from the unmanned lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 and made a hard landing on the lunar surface around 8:31 p.m. New Delhi time (10:01 a.m. ET), said the official, Srinivasa Murthy Satish. Space official Shiv Kumar said the 34-kilogram probe hit the moon surface traveling at 1.6 kilometers per second, which is a speed of 5,760 kilometers per hour (3,579 mph). Kumar said the probe transmitted sufficient signals to the mother craft before landing, but no more were expected after the impact. A news release from the Indian Space Research Organization said, ""The probe had a hard landing on the lunar surface that terminated its functioning.""  Watch the launch of India's first lunar mission » . Ramachandra Rao Guruprasad, a spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organization, said the probe was not meant to be retrieved. ""One of the objectives of this probe is to understand the moon for future soft landings,"" he said. He added that the Chandrayaan-1 was to transmit the data it recorded from the probe to the ISRO. The Chandrayaan-1 -- Chandrayaan means ""moon craft"" in Sanskrit -- was successfully launched from southern India on October 22 and is now orbiting the moon. iReport.com: Feeling spacy? Its two-year mission is to take high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the moon's surface, especially the permanently shadowed polar regions. It also will search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks, the group said. The craft is carrying payloads from the United States, the European Union and Bulgaria. India plans to share the data from the mission with other programs, including NASA. The Indian space agency noted that the landing came on a historically significant day -- the birthday of late Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who started the modern Indian space program in 1962. Two years ago, the European Space Agency sent the Smart-1 probe smashing into the lunar surface.","Unmanned Indian probe lands succesfully on the moon Friday  Probe hit the moon at a speed of 5760 kilometers per hour   Two-year mission seeks high-resolution, 3-D imaging of the moon's surface  Probe will also search for evidence of water or ice ."
"(CNN) -- South Korea is suspending exports of tear gas canisters to the Gulf island nation of Bahrain amid pressure from human rights groups, an official said Thursday. ""We've decided to suspend (the shipment of tear gas) because of the unstable political situation in Bahrain, requests from human rights groups and civilian deaths,"" an official with South Korea's state-run Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), which oversees the country's military trade, said. ""We got requests Dae Kwang Chemical Corporation and another company on whether they can get permission to export the tear gas to Bahrain,"" the DAPA official said. ""After discussions with the Defense and Foreign Ministries on the issue, we informed the companies to suspend the exports."" The move by Seoul comes after months of campaigning by rights groups who say the Bahraini authorities' misuse of tear gas has led to dozens of deaths as the Shiite majority protests against the Sunni-led government. The authorities have argued that tear gas is necessary to maintain order. Human rights groups had launched a campaign called Stop The Shipment after leaked government documents appeared to show that Bahrain, a country of 1.3 million people, had ordered around 1.6 million tear gas canisters. In October, the U.S.-based group Physicians for Human Rights reported that Bahrain's police ""weaponized tear gas"" had caused the deaths of at least 39 people since February 2011 in an ongoing crackdown on anti-government protests, a claim the government disputes. Bahrain's Interior Ministry said it had not been informed of any such ban by Seoul. ""Teargas is used by Bahrain's police force only as a necessary and proportionate measure and in public order and riot control situations. It is used entirely in compliance with international law,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday. Bahraini and international rights groups welcomed the move. ""I think it's great news and we commend South Korea on the decision they've taken,"" Bahraini rights activist Maryam al-Khawaja said. ""We're starting with tear gas but we expect to see countries who say they are concerned about human rights stop the sale of all types of weapons to Bahrain.""

"(CNN) -- Many people fail to have great careers because they make excuses to avoid taking action. They dismiss the importance of passion to great careers by claiming that passionate people are abnormal. By contrast, in most people's eyes, those who are normal only need to work hard and they will have at least a good career. But good jobs are disappearing, as bad and great jobs squeeze out the middle range. Hard work alone buys little advantage. The most common excuse is to use the importance of family and personal relationships as the reason to avoid the demands of a great career. But how can you be a great spouse, parent or friend by denying your true identity? Without passion, no one can fully express their talent or define who they are. TED.com: Keep your goals to yourself . Since pursuing your passion is a necessary -- but not sufficient -- condition for a great career, it becomes logically essential to find your passion as a starting point. Nevertheless, many people struggle to find their passions. What mistakes are they making? Often they assume that finding one's passion is a matter of luck. They see that some people found their passions as children. Often others seem to just trip over their passion as they move into adulthood. The process seems random and difficult to view as a methodical process of search. Yes, some are lucky. They have the luck of being born into a family in which a family member or friend shows them a domain that immediately engages them, or one that slowly sneaks up on them. In the absence of the lucky circumstance of their family, the search would have been longer and more challenging. TED.com: A kinder, gentler philosophy of success . But notice that some who pursue a childhood or family ""interest"" do so only as a convenient default choice. It was there and so they chose it to avoid further thought or uncertainty. It is hardly an interest, although they may speak of it very positively -- the better to tell themselves or others that they made a ""wise"" choice. The majority of us do not have the advantage of circumstance, and therefore have no choice but to search for our passion. Many people fail to find their passion because they either fail to search methodically or search persistently. Some will simply not commit the time and energy to a search that can often be frustrating. In fact, they want their ""destiny"" to find them; they do not want to find it themselves. You cannot find your passion idly staring into space, hoping for it to appear as a revelation, from one book, article, blog posting or casual conversation. TED.com: 4 lessons from robots about being human . Those who search and find their passion place themselves in intensely stimulating environments, and stay there until the job is done. It can be intellectually exhausting. There are many such environments. Some read voraciously; others seek out many people in many situations and engage them in intense conversation. Some do both. Others visit every major museum and gallery in North America. They find their passion by immersing themselves in human experience. But you cannot just read, talk or experience. You must also have your mind in high gear. You must be fully engaged, reading and thinking to a purpose. You must be constantly saying to yourself about whatever book, fact, argument, person or experience is at hand: Why? What if? Why don't they? Yes, it is intense. And yes, too few are practiced in this art, no matter their level of education. But you will never find your passion in the modern way: by surfing or browsing. Recognize the superficiality implied by those words and by our impatient, thoughtless world. You will have to stand against the popular culture to find your passion. Too many do not have the independence of mind or force of commitment to do so. TED.com: Inventing is the easy part . Take the time you need. Recognize your mind's natural tendency to resolve its painful uncertainty by rushing to judgment, even to the judgment that it is time to give up. How will you recognize your passion when you encounter it? Usually, it is quite easy. One moment you are reading in hopes of finding a topic of great interest; then you find that you are reading and do not want to stop. Or you find yourself in a regular conversation, and you start talking with excitement about an idea. Or you find yourself in an activity and you lose track of time itself. The rule of passion is simple: the mind cannot stop thinking about that which it loves. Your passion is what you would do even if you won the lottery. Even with a passion identified, there is a common pitfall. Some people find their passion, and then relying on no more than popular opinion, they dismiss the passion as one that ""cannot be turned into a livelihood."" And they move on to try to find a second, more practical love. That is not necessarily a bad choice since one could certainly have more than one love. But before you look for a second love, you should creatively examine whether your first found love could support a career. Research the experiences of those who have found ways to pursue such livelihoods. Never take conventional wisdom as anything other than folklore, to be tested against your logic and experiences. Remember that passion is necessary for a great career, but it is not sufficient. There's no magic here. Success also demands persistence, focus, discipline, independence of mind, resourcefulness, experimentation and high creativity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Larry Smith.","Larry Smith: Most people fail to have great careers because they make excuses .

"(CNN) -- Christmas came early this year for pimps and johns in Canada. Last week's unanimous decision by the Supreme Court of Canada to strike down all remaining prostitution laws is not only a victory for the professional sex workers who brought their case through the legal system, it is a triumph for those who live off and enjoy the commercial sex industry. Tragically, it's a time bomb for hundreds of thousands of vulnerable and exploited women, girls and boys. We are documentary filmmakers and our film, ""Tricked"", opened last week in New York City. For 3 years, we embedded with vice cops, met with the johns, pimps, girls and boys entangled in the professional sex world. We went to the dungeon of a dominatrix, filmed the partially legal model in Sweden and met sex workers advocating for legalization. We followed abolitionists, lobbyists, hobbyists, survivors, the FBI, grandmothers, gay sex workers, transvestites, drug addicts, alcoholics, college kids and PhDs. All had stories to share and a unique perspective on this complex issue. By the end of our extensive investigation, focused on the United States, we shared a conclusion: the commercial sexual sale of someone's body is not empowering, does not offer gender equality and in most cases is a form of modern day slavery. The myths used by advocates of prostitution are universal. The selling of sex is legal in Canada, but the decision ended prohibitions on operating brothels, making a living from working for a prostitute and communicating in public about prostitution. While striking down these three laws arguably protects the constitutional rights of a certain class of sex worker, it does so at the expense of another more plentiful group: those harmed by the sex industry. Efforts to legalize prostitution are based on the outdated assumption that prostitution is a victimless crime, a view that is effectively used by the pro-legalization lobby. That's simply not true. For the majority of commercial sex workers, the sex industry is a continuum of harm that feeds on vulnerabilities and spits out damaged victims. In the United States the FBI estimates that 85% of commercial sex workers experience some degree of force, fraud or coercion (the federal definition of sex trafficking). There is no definitive evidence that legalization ends the exploitation of sex workers. According to several undercover cops we interviewed, a majority of girls have pimps in the legal brothels of Nevada. Most of the girls and women we filmed worked ""legitimate"" escort services for their pimps. Danielle did escort work by day and street work by night -- all her money went to her pimp. In Las Vegas, Cindy worked through licensed escort businesses but had to hand over all her earnings to a violent and controlling pimp. Legalization could potentially cut down on violence by johns, but it cannot control the violence outside brothel walls. Another myth often cited by supporters of legalization is that there is a health care benefit, but recent statistics from Germany, where prostitution is legal, show that less than one tenth of 1% of sex workers actually use the health insurance system. Throughout the sex industry, we found a strong dominance of pimp culture. Where pimps operate, most take 100% of the money earned by the sex workers. For them, there's a strong financial incentive to continue business as usual. Would legalization change this truth or eliminate pimps? Commercial sex workers face violence, whether in brothels or at ""home"" with a pimp. According to one study, working in prostitution is 51 times more violent than the second-most violent profession for women (working in a liquor store). Sex workers said they had been subjected to beatings, knifings and rape. Worse than the physical abuse is the ongoing trauma. Years later, those we interviewed struggle with PTSD, chronic pelvic disease, the repercussions of forced abortions, depression, drug addiction, self-mutilation and shame. We need a comprehensive approach to the sex industry that involves social workers, law enforcement, employers, politicians and citizens as a whole. The first step is to recognize the harm that naturally occurs in the sex industry. The second step is to establish support systems to help victims overcome their traumas and become survivors. And third, we need to stop future victimization by combating the vulnerabilities in our youth. The current evil in the system preys on the vulnerable among us. Prostitution is the fastest growing criminal industry in the world, but legalization and decriminalization is not the answer. The Canadian decision ignores the most important part of the sex industry dilemma: the victims and those adrift in harm's way. The rights of the small percentage of voluntary sex workers should not take precedence over the lives, bodies and souls of those who are forced to work in prostitution as sex slaves.

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Henry Cuellar has lost patience with President Barack Obama over his response to the surge of minors from Central America crossing the southern border. The Texas lawmaker has criticized the administration's handling of what it has called a ""humanitarian crisis,"" and is urging a reluctant Obama to visit affected areas. He's also unwilling to write Obama a blank check for his $3.7 billion proposal to Congress for addressing the matter. ""We just can't just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want,"" he told CNN in an interview. He also says he hopes Obama's decision to skip a border visit doesn't become his ""Katrina moment,"" a reference to how the heavily criticized federal response to the devastating hurricane and its aftermath was a defining moment in George W. Bush's presidency. Cuellar's sentiment is right in line with Republican critics giving Obama heat over the unexpected influx of minors from Central America, many of them unaccompanied, and now mired in bureaucratic limbo and caught in the middle of a partisan political firefight. But Cuellar's a Democrat who is going after a President of the same party in a high-stakes election year during which immigration has gained prominence as a campaign issue. He told Fox News on Wednesday that he's gotten calls and visits from White House officials but is not giving much thought to that. What's going on? ""I'm more concerned about my constituents,"" Cuellar said, noting the perils facing the tens of thousands of kids coming across the border in record numbers and overwhelming border and immigration services. While the current crisis is taking place in Cuellar's back yard in conservative-led Texas, his crossing of Obama and Democrats is not new for him. He was endorsed by the Conservative Club for Growth during his 2006 primary and backed George W. Bush in the 2000 election that propelled him to the White House. His bruising 2004 primary battle for the House seat then held by Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, who at the time headed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, won him few friends in the caucus, comprised of Democrats. Cuellar endorsed Hillary Clinton over Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination and even raised money for her campaign. He also was one of 27 Democrats who voted against Wall Street reform legislation backed strongly by Obama early in his presidency. And in 2001, Republican Gov. Rick Perry's appointed Cuellar as Texas secretary of state, a post he held for 10 months. Democrats were unhappy about Cuellar's 2012 support of a redistricting proposal backed by the Perry administration. Critics said he supported the proposal in an effort to ensure a favorable district for himself, a charge he denied. Some Democrats also question Cuellar's latest move: a plan to introduce bipartisan legislation on Thursday with Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn to address the southern border situation. That measure favored by GOP members would reverse a Bush-era law that allows illegal immigrant children from Central American countries to stay in the United States as their cases wend through the backlogged adjudication process. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, a staunch immigration reform advocate, said on CNN's ""Crossfire"" on Wednesday ""I wouldn't not support the legislation."" After Obama's Texas trip, what now for the immigration crisis? Boehner on immigration: When will Obama take responsibility? Obama seeks emergency immigration funds, more authority .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy is well versed to talk about the pressures the modern day sport star faces. As a former world No.1 golfer and one half of a sporting super couple -- with tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki -- the Northern Irishman knows all about living in the full glare of the media spotlight. So perhaps it is not surprising that the two-time major winner has warned that as the global interest in sport increases, so will players have to deal with the type of stress-related illness that prompted England cricketer Jonathan Trott to pull out of the Ashes tour. Trott's decision to come home from Australia has prompted a debate about the relentless schedule of many sports and the support on offer to players if they succumb to mental health issues. ""It's sad to see something like that happen and it just shows what a mental toll sport can take on you sometimes,"" McIlroy told reporters at Royal Sydney, ahead of this week's Australian Open as he talked about Trott's decision to leave the tour. ""Hopefully he gets home and spends some time with his family and recovers and can come back. ""As sport becomes so big and there's so much pressure and so much on the line, it's becoming more and more common that these sorts of stress-related illnesses are happening and it just shows how much of a mental toll it takes on you sometimes."" The rivalry between the England and Australia cricket teams is one of the oldest and fiercest in world sport, with the players often exchanging insults on the pitch -- a practice known as ""sledging."" The sledging in the current series, which Australia lead 1-0 after winning the first Test match in Melbourne, saw Australia captain Michael Clarke fined for a barb aimed at England bowler James Anderson. ""I think the sledging this year has probably been a bit worse than other years as well,"" said McIlroy. ""It looks like they're just having a go at each other after every ball ... it would be really tough to take that for however long you're out there for. ""They seem to really get at each other's throat whenever they're in there."" For McIlroy, 2013 has been a frustrating year. Since switching to playing with Nike clubs, he has struggled to recapture the form which saw him win four PGA Tour and two European Tour events in 2012 as well as the PGA Championship. ""It's been a long year, I guess mentally more than physically,"" said the world No. 6. ""Physically, golf doesn't take that much out of you but mentally it's quite draining, especially this year for me, not just the golf and being frustrated with my game but having to answer the questions and having to come up with reasons why I'm not playing well and all that stuff."" McIlroy will hope to end the year with a win, but he is up against a strong field in Sydney featuring world No. 2 and home-crowd favorite Adam Scott. ""I've said for the last couple of months I just wanted to try and finish this season strongly and get some momentum to go into 2014,"" added the 24-year-old McIlroy. ""This would be the perfect place to get that first win of the year and give me a sort of springboard into the next season.""","Rory McIlroy says pressure in sports is leading to increase in stress-relates illnesses .

"(CNN) -- Ash from an Indonesian volcano has led to the cancellation of a number of flights in the region since Friday, with travelers heading to and from the country now advised to check with airlines to confirm the status of their flights before traveling. Mount Sangeang is a small, uninhabited volcanic island in Indonesia's Lesser Sunda Islands. It's considered one of the most active in the area by scientists. Friday's volcanic activity shot thick plumes of ash and sulfur dioxide more than 20 kilometers into the sky, which then drifted as far as northern Australia. Some airlines decided to ground flights in and out of Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport on Monday morning, due to worries that the ash cloud was approaching. However, the most recent reports say the ash is dispersing. On Saturday, all flights to and from Australia's Darwin Airport were canceled because of the hazardous ash cloud but have since resumed. ""Virgin Australia continues to monitor Volcano Sangeang in close consultation with the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center,"" said the airline in a statement on Monday. ""There may be some changes to scheduling of Denpasar services today. ""Virgin Australia will endeavor to contact all guests with affected affected bookings. We also recommend customers continue to check the flight status page on our website."" Denpasar services to and from Darwin resumed on June 1, said Virgin. On Monday morning, low-cost carrier Jetstar canceled two flights out of Singapore and Perth that were due to stop in Denpasar, following nine other international and domestic cancellations over the weekend. Qantas was also forced to ground fights over the weekend due to the ash, but has since resumed operations as normal. According to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Program, intermittent historical eruptions have been recorded at Sangeang since 1512, most of them during in the 20th century. The last confirmed eruption of Mount Sangeang was in 1997. Why airlines can't fly through ash . The International Civil Aviation Organization set up the International Airways Volcanic Watch Operations Group in response to a number of serious aviation encounters with volcanic ash in the 1980s. Composed of experts from nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers, the organization alerts the aviation industry of the location and movement of clouds of volcanic ash. For instance, Indonesia's volcanic eruptions are monitored by the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center. ""Volcanic ash in the air is composed of fine pulverized rock and accompanied by a number of gases, which are then converted into droplets of sulfuric acid and other substances,"" says the center. ""It is potentially deadly to aircraft and their passengers. The most critical effect is caused by ash melting in the hot section of the engine, and then fusing into a glass-like coating on components further back in the engine, causing loss of thrust and possible 'flame out' (engine failure). ""In addition there is an abrasion of engine parts, the airframe and parts protruding from the aircraft, and possible clogging of the fuel and cooling systems."" The Darwin center cites an incident in June 1982, when a British Airways 747 suffered severe damage and had all four engines flame out upon encountering ash from Mount Galunggung in Indonesia, descending to 12,000 feet before being able to restart some engines and make an emergency landing in Jakarta. ""Three weeks later the same thing happened to a Singapore Airlines 747, which this time lost two engines and also made an emergency landing,"" the center said. ""Quite apart from the safety consideration, volcanic ash has caused very expensive damage to aircraft; most estimates cite costs to aviation of over $250 million since 1982."" The world's Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers use satellite information, ground reports from volcanology agencies, pilot reports, meteorological knowledge and numerical models to track and forecast ash movements.

"(CNN) -- Here's an uncomfortable truth confronting Chinese President Xi Jinping: It's 2014, but the pro-democracy, pro-rights sentiments that manifested across China as demonstrations in 1989 are still alive and well. For 25 years, the Chinese government has tried to expunge the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen massacre from history to deny people inside the country any knowledge of the event. And as the second largest economy in the world, Olympic host, and U.N. Security Council member, Beijing has also maintained to the outside world that June 4 is ""much ado about nothing"" and a ""strictly internal affair."" Beijing's strategy of suppression has proved successful in some quarters. Many in China have generally focused on getting ahead economically while staying away from politics. But in other quarters, the strategy has produced the opposite outcome, fueling domestic demands for accountability and ongoing attention to China's abysmal human rights record. ""Harmonious society,"" ""social stability,"" ""stability maintenance"" -- these are the watchwords of the current Chinese government. But imposed stability is oxymoronic. Not a week goes by without hundreds of protests over land or housing issues in rural areas, and environmental or infrastructure projects in major urban areas. China's security forces and judiciary systems are using increasingly heavy-handed tactics to track and suppress all manners of peaceful expressions in ethnic minority regions. Uyghur Muslims are prohibited from wearing beards. Prosecutions are set up against those who know Tibetans who self-immolated. Despite a proliferation of laws, there are few avenues for public feedback, let alone redress or debate without fear of reprisal for ordinary citizens. The combination of repression and denial of justice are clearly breeding more, not less, discontent in China. Every year in the weeks leading up to June 4, critics of the Chinese government anticipate higher-than-usual scrutiny, ranging from arbitrary impositions of house arrest to people being taken to police stations to ""have tea."" This year's crackdown started early and ferociously. In early May, roughly a dozen people gathered in a Beijing apartment to discuss Tiananmen. They sent a photograph of the group and a brief summary of the discussion to friends and contacts. Within a few days, five of them, well-known human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, academics Xu Youyu and Hao Jian, blogger Liu Di, and dissident Hu Shigen had all been criminally detained on charges of causing a disturbance. Previous gatherings like this had merited the attention of the police, but had not resulted in actual charges. So spooked are Chinese authorities that Ding Zilin, the founder of the Tiananmen Mothers, a group formed to press for accountability for family members' deaths in 1989, has been told she may not return to Beijing in early June. This will be the first year she must observe the anniversary of her son's death from afar. China's central and local governments occasionally make concessions, seemingly designed to placate popular frustrations. The widely loathed arbitrary detention system known as ""re-education through labor,"" in which people could be incarcerated by police for up to three years with no trial, was abolished in late 2013. Some of the most controversial chemical and industrial facilities have been shut down or construction put on hold. But many of these are half measures, or only temporary fixes. In response to the political status quo, a law-based, rights-oriented consciousness has emerged in China, and advocates known as the weiquan have started a ""rights defense"" movement. These activists, who endure police monitoring, detention, arrest, enforced disappearance and torture, monitor and document human rights cases across the country. Some of their most prominent members were involved in the 1989 protests, and they say that Tiananmen and its legacy informs their current efforts. Four of these lawyers were detained and tortured in Heilongjiang province in March 2014, yet have continued to try to represent politically unpopular cases. Similarly, the New Citizens Movement is an informal group that has advocated the promotion of civic rights and participation, including the public disclosure of officials' assets to curb corruption, or protecting the rights of children of migrant workers. At least five of its members, including prominent lawyer Xu Zhiyong, have been sentenced this year on charges of ""gathering crowds to disturb public order."" These activists, too, know the price they are likely to pay for their efforts, yet they carry on, believing that transforming society into a democracy that respects the rule of law requires citizen participation. The Internet and social media have replaced the hand-lettered placards at Tiananmen, but the messages are similar: accountability for abusive officials, transparency from the state, justice for all. Independent Chinese organizations try to engage directly with United Nations organizations. But these kinds of actions often provoke extraordinary wrath of the government. One activist, Cao Shunli, was imprisoned in 2013 for her efforts to participate in a review of China's record at the United Nations Human Rights Council. She died in detention in February 2014 after being denied adequate medical treatment. A truly confident leadership in Beijing would recognize these demands for what they are: efforts to improve life for ordinary people across the country. And while such groups are prevented from gathering at Tiananmen, they increasingly find one another and try to push for change via social media and legal channels. They show no sign of scaling back their demands for human rights. So, will the Chinese government meet them halfway at least?","June 4 marks the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre .

"(CNN) -- From the British Museum to the Louvre, the world's leading museums house treasured artifacts and storied works of art. They may protect centuries of culture, but they don't want to be perceived as dusty relics themselves. In response to growing numbers of visitors and, in some instances, creaky infrastructure, these and other iconic museums are undergoing unprecedented expansions. From London's Tate Modern to the Louvre in Paris, museums are adding extensions, constructing new branches, and erecting gleaming new exhibition spaces, often with the help of the world's leading design firms. The Tate Modern, the world's most popular museum of modern art, receives around five million visitors a year. That is twice the number that Trustees had in mind when they opened the museum in 2000. So, as part of a £215m ($357m) expansion plan, the museum commissioned Herzog & de Meuron to convert underground oil tanks into subterranean galleries, which opened in the summer of 2012. Museums of wonder . When the final expansion is complete at the end of 2016, the museum will have expanded its area by 60%, adding 20,670 square meters of space. The additional space is equivalent to nearly four American football fields. Chris Dercon, the museum's director, sees the expansion as essential to accommodate the museum's expanding collection and programs. ""It is about transforming the museum into an even more open, engaging place for increasingly diverse audiences,"" he says. ""Our audiences want us to offer many different activities - to be a place for acquiring knowledge, meeting people, discussing ideas, being entertained - and they want to be participants in their own right. The new Tate Modern will be a place to enjoy art from all over the world in all its variety, and will provide artists and visitors with the different kinds of spaces they need to do so."" Nearby, the British Museum has sunk £135 million ($224 million) into its World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre, which opened in March. Designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour+Partners, it stretches out over nine floors and will include 1,100 square meters of gallery space devoted to temporary exhibitions. Growing audience . In 2013, more than 470,000 visitors filed through the museum's blockbuster show ""Life and death in Pompeii and Herculaneum."" As with many of its other shows, the museum had to stage the exhibition in its former Reading Room. ""This has limited what we can achieve in terms of exhibition narrative and the display of loan objects,"" says Hannah Boulton, the museum's head of press and marketing. ""The new dedicated space means we can encourage the widest possible audience to come and experience our exhibitions."" Expansion doesn't always involve the original building. In recent years the number of museums opening satellite branches has increased dramatically, and looks set to increase in the coming years. London's Victoria & Albert Museum, the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design, will open the V&A Dundee in Scotland in 2017. It marks the first time that a design museum will be built in the UK outside of London. The Louvre Abu Dhabi opens in 2015 with a price tag of $650 million. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it will sit on Saadiyat Island and touches both sand and sea. It's meant to look like as if it is floating from a distance. About two-thirds of the structure will be covered by a white dome, with a diameter of 600 feet. Geometric openings in the roof will create a ""rain of light"" meant to invoke light entering a souk . Curators go to Harvard . University museums see expansion and renovation as key to their mission, too. In November, Harvard University's three art museums -- the Fogg, the Busch-Reisinger and the Sackler -- will re-open under one roof. Starchitect Renzo Piano has consolidated the Harvard Art Museums under a single glazed rooftop structure, while restoring and upgrading the 1920s Georgian revival architecture. Like museum officials elsewhere, Harvard's administration believes the museums' facelift will help them inspire the students and community they serve. As Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust says: ""Renzo Piano has designed a building that is as beautiful as the works of art it will house and as thoughtful as the people who will work and learn within it.""","The world's biggest museums are adding new wings to accommodate visitors .

"(CNN) -- The first time I spoke to Norma Bastidas, she was having a rough couple of days. Thirty miles into her attempt to set the record for the world's longest triathlon, Bastidas, 47, had to start over due to a GPS malfunction. The saltwater off Cancun, Mexico, was eating away at her gums and throat. Her face was sunburned. She'd been stung several times by sea creatures, so her lips were swollen. ""I wanted to look like Angelina Jolie, but I probably look like Mickey Rourke in 'The Wrestler,' "" she joked. Her laid-back sense of humor belies an ambitious drive. A year ago, Bastidas didn't even know how to swim. But on March 20, she finished swimming 95 miles in the Caribbean to complete that leg of her triathlon challenge. On April 4, she crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, averaging about 130 miles a day on her bike. In 1998, Australian David Holleran completed a triathlon consisting of a 26-mile swim, 1,242-mile bike ride and a 310-mile run. He holds the record for the longest triathlon, according to Guinness World Records. Bastidas will more than double that distance, swimming 95 miles, biking 2,932 miles and running 735 miles for a total of 3,762 miles before reaching Washington near the end of April. It's a grueling journey, even for someone used to tackling ultra races. But there's something driving Bastidas other than the desire to break a world record: She's determined to raise awareness about human trafficking and stop it. ""I'm prepared to do whatever it takes,"" Bastidas said after a particularly rough patch of riding in Mexico. ""If you don't risk everything, that's not courage."" Just a few days ago, the triathlete hopped off her bike and laced up her sneakers to begin her run into the U.S. capital. ""Her triathlon route covered major human trafficking routes,"" team member Alexis Rhyner said when I asked why Bastidas was traveling so far. ""It was also important to her that the route pass through both countries and both capitals, to unify both nations to fight the issue together and take responsibility for what is happening in and between our two borders."" Thousands of children are sold for sex every day in Mexico and the United States, according to iEmpathize, a child advocacy group Bastidas has teamed with to film a documentary of her journey. ""We all know it's wrong,"" Bastidas said. ""It's still happening. And it's preventable."" She was sexually abused, first by a family member, she said, then again later in life. At 17, she said she was kidnapped in Mexico City by men who intended to sell her into slavery. She escaped only with the help of the brother of one of her captors. Some days, when Bastidas finishes her mileage, survivors wait to thank her. ""You can't meet someone who's said, 'I've been raped, too' and go home and not care about it,"" she said. ""What I do is that just remind people it's not just a cause. We're your family, your sisters, your daughters, your mothers."" She tells anyone who will listen that what she's doing is a metaphor for life. If she can do this -- break the world record for the longest triathlon -- then human trafficking can be eradicated forever. ""This is the best way I can illustrate that nothing is impossible,"" she said. Bastidas first started running in 2006 when her oldest son, Karl, was diagnosed with an incurable eye condition called cone rod dystrophy. Soon after she signed up for the Canadian Death Race -- and made it 56 miles before having to pull out due to hypothermia. Since then she's run hundreds of races and even climbed the world's seven highest peaks on seven continents to raise money to find a cure for genetic blindness. With this triathlon, she's supporting a new cause. Anywhere from 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders each year, according to a 2007 report from the U.S. State Department. Those lucky enough to be rescued are left with permanent physical and emotional scars. Bastidas wants the ""Be Relentless"" documentary to change people's perceptions of true strength. It's not the strength it's taken her to attempt the world's longest triathlon. It's the inner strength found in women and children who survive years of unimaginable abuse. ""It's only 3,500 miles,"" she told me emphatically, at the beginning of her journey in Cancun. ""It's so worth it. Think about it! It's a child's life. It's a human being's life. (This is) nothing -- it's nothing compared to that.""","Norma Bastidas plans to swim, bike and run 3,762 miles .

"(CNN) -- Three New Jersey teenagers were charged Wednesday with assault and robbery in what authorities described as the bullying of a 15-year-old high school freshman who committed suicide after he was attacked in March. Notably, New Jersey's aggressive anti-bullying law was signed by Gov. Chis Christie on March 26, just two days before Morristown High School freshman Lennon Baldwin took his own life at his home. Prosecutors cited the new law Wednesday in announcing charges stemming from an assault on Baldwin on March 6 and the robbery of Baldwin three days later. ""It is the toughest law on bullying in the nation,"" Morris County, New Jersey, Prosecutor Robert Bianchi stated. ""This case again underscores our need as a society to eradicate the bullying of our youth, as regrettable consequences such as this case, are far too numerous to be anywhere near acceptable."" Morris County prosecutors charged two juveniles and an adult, 19-year-old Michael Conway, with assault, robbery, theft and making terroristic threats against Baldwin. According to a news release from the Morris County prosecutor's office, Baldwin was assaulted at his high school, and the incident was caught on surveillance video. When school officials suspended his alleged assailant, the teenager ""made numerous attempts to contact Mr. Baldwin for the purpose of instructing him to go to the school administration and tell them that the incident (assault) was ... a joke,"" prosecutors said. Baldwin did just that, according to the news release, but a suspension against the alleged assailant remained in effect. Prosecutors said Baldwin was accosted three days later in a parking lot by the first student and two more individuals who robbed and threatened him. Nearly three weeks later, Baldwin ""tragically took his own life,"" prosecutors said in their release. In addition to other charges, Conway also has been charged with lying to police. He is free on $1,500 bail. The two juveniles have been released from detention facilities and remain under house arrest. It could not immediately be determined whether the defendants have retained attorneys, or when the case will go to court.","New Jersey Gov. Christie signed a tough new anti-bullying law on March 26 .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the smallest countries in Africa, and one of the poorest in the world, but Burundi is showing the way in the development of tennis on the continent. Ravaged by civil war since gaining independence in the 1960s, its relative recent political stability has helped it embrace a sport that is battling to maintain its foothold in the planet's second-largest land space. Africa has not produced a grand slam singles finalist since Kevin Curren at the 1985 Wimbledon Championships, while Wayne Ferreira reached the semis of the Australian Open for the second time in 2003 and former world No. 3 Amanda Coetzer was similarly successful in '96-97. Kevin Anderson is currently the continent's top-ranked player at No. 35, and yet another South African -- Chanelle Scheepers -- is its top woman at 92nd. But the future may lie in a country which is rebuilding itself after conflicts which saw more than half a million people killed and mass migrations of its fleeing population. Burundi will soon open Africa's third high-performance tennis center, after Pretoria and Senegal's Dakar, plus host a series of top age-group tournaments and an international event. ""We would like every country in Africa to replicate the experience of Burundi,"" the International Tennis Federation's development projects administrator Frank Couraud told CNN. ""They are not rich, but they really wanted to have this center. I met everyone from the government -- the vice-president, the minister of sport, the Olympic committee. They value tennis very much."" It's not an attitude that's prevalent in Africa, where tennis ranks below sports such as football and athletics when it comes to government funding. The ITF has three development officers across the continent and supports national tennis federations with equipment and skills programs aimed particularly at young children, but its resources are limited. ""It's very difficult to fight against football -- it's the sport in Africa and they are doing so well,"" Couraud said. ""In a country like Kenya, if you speak to the Olympic committee for funding for coaches, they say our priorities are track and field because this is where we get the medals. ""We need more funding. We would love to see the governments being more committed to developing the game. If you look at our budget ($4.3 million each year) it's what (soccer's ruling body) FIFA gives to maybe one or two nations. There's a huge discrepancy."" Burundi has also produced a potential future star in Hassan Ndayishimiye. The 17-year-old was included in the ITF's grand slam team for Wimbledon this year and surprisingly made it to the second round of the boys' singles. Ranked only 112th in the juniors, he received a wildcard into the qualifying draw and beat three players well above him to progress into the main section. It's a small step, but has earned him a place in the team to tour North America ahead of September's U.S. Open along with Madagascar's Zarah Razafimahatratra -- who's in her second year with the program. With Tunisia's Ons Jabeur winning the 2011 French Open junior girls' title, having been runner-up in Paris last year, there are signs that the ITF's development work in Africa is producing results. ""We have to focus on these players who have got through the systems, who are very talented, who have big hearts,"" Couraud said. ""When you see Hassan or Zarah on the court they give 200%, they work very hard. We give them the right opportunity now so one day they become professional tennis players -- and then suddenly other African kids will relate to these players. ""When Yannick Noah won the French Open in 1983, in Cameroon and many countries kids identified and wanted to play tennis because they saw Yannick winning. Even to have players in the top 100 on the professional circuit, I'm sure this is going to have a positive effect."" But it's a huge step from being a good junior to a successful professional, especially in a place where travel and equipment are more expensive than the U.S. or Europe. ""If you want to buy equipment in Africa, sometimes a city doesn't even have a sports shop that sells rackets. If they do, it's three times the price in Europe,"" Couraud said. The Frenchman estimated that a top-20 junior might have only a 50% chance of making it -- and it could take at least four years to crack the top 100 in the seniors. It can cost $70-80,000 a year to fund top coaching and tournament travel, so the best option for African players -- for those who have adequate schooling -- has traditionally been to win a college scholarship in the United States. That was Anderson's route, following the likes of compatriot Liezel Huber and Zimbabwe's Black siblings Byron and Wayne -- who won grand slam titles in doubles events, as has their sister Cara. ""It's a very good option. One of the problems of being in South Africa is we're pretty far from the tennis scene. The amount of flying you're going to be doing, the expense of that is pretty high,"" Anderson told CNN. ""Recently a lot of juniors have ended up going to college in the States. There are a lot of tournaments there, you can play a lot of matches in the spring and during the summer you can actually go and play in the professional tournaments."" The 25-year-old, now based in Chicago, won his first ATP Tour title in February at his home SA Open, which returned to the men's circuit in 2009 after a 13-year absence. He said the tournament has provided much-needed visibility for tennis in South Africa, where rugby, cricket, soccer and golf are dominant. ""The toughest thing is a lack of quality exposure. A lot of South African players are pretty sheltered when they go out there for the first time,"" Anderson said. ""For myself it took me quite a few years to feel completely comfortable, regardless of who I was playing. You don't always know the person and it's easy to build them up in your eyes. You've got to play some guy who's got two coaches and an administrator, and you're there by yourself -- sometimes it's pretty daunting."" While Anderson believes Africa needs more high-profile singles players like Curren, Ferreira and Coetzer to grow the game, his former compatriot Huber is not so sure that it will change the status quo. Born in Durban, she went to the Van der Meer academy in Hilton Head, South Carolina, at the age of 15 in 1992 after being frustrated by her lack of opportunities back home. ""I was already playing an age group up and winning those tournaments, and the federation didn't have any more money to send us anywhere,"" the U.S. citizen said. ""It was an unfortunate time, it was around when apartheid ended, and if anything it should have been a time when South Africa got the boom, but really it was society trying to figure it out -- where do we stand, where do we fit in. ""It was a confusing time. A lot of people were let go of their jobs and other people were hired and tennis in South Africa went through a dip there."" Huber was able to take up the academy place only after its owner Dennis van der Meer offered her a cut-price rate of $150 a week -- and even then her father had to beg the air fare from a local businessman. ""In South Africa I don't think they are looking at it as a business. That's kind of what hurts the most,"" said the 34-year-old, who has won six grand slam doubles titles and been ranked No. 1 in the discipline. ""When Wes Moodie and I won Wimbledon doubles titles in 2005, I actually thought it would change tennis in South Africa. Nothing changed. Maybe there's more important things to spend money on, maybe tennis is not important. ""Maybe it's more important for the government to build schools. I'm not there so I'm not sure why tennis is not getting funding. But it shows."" Her disappointment with the tennis authorities in her former homeland grew when they refused to pay for her plane ticket for an important Fed Cup teams match. ""We had the opportunity to get back in the World Group -- and they didn't pay my ticket,"" said Huber, who has since represented the U.S. at the Olympics and in Fed Cup. ""We had Amanda Coetzer in the top-10 at the time, but having a good singles player didn't raise the profile. I don't know what it will take."" Huber has sponsored an under-15 girls' tournament in South Africa for almost a decade, and has offered to train players for free at the tennis ranch she runs in Texas with her husband Tony, but has been disappointed with the response from South African Tennis. ""In four years we've had three kids over. We were there (South Africa) in March and did a clinic for kids -- it was a big disappointment. We thought we might see the next Ferreira or Coetzer, but the talent wasn't there,"" she said. ""I thought it would be a huge event, wanting to give something back, but the organization just wasn't there. I ended up using some of the balls I brought back from Australia. The facilities are the same as when I grew up. It's an eye-opener that it hasn't changed.""","African tennis is struggling to produce top-level professional players .

"(CNN) -- Stalk much? Facebook Breakup Notifier, a new app for the site, is super simple -- and will probably be super popular. It lets users pick certain friends whose relationship status they'd like to monitor. If one of those relationships changes, the user gets notified by e-mail. ""You like someone. They're in a relationship. Be the first to know when they're out of it,"" promises the app's website. So, if that old high school flame suddenly becomes ""single"" or the receptionist you've pined for decides that her on-again, off-again relationship is now ""complicated,"" you can swoop right in. Created by developer Dan Loewenherz, the app, at least in concept, definitely has a stalkerish vibe. But among single-and-interested folks, who can deny that the social-networking mega-site is used to keep up with the romantic doings of others? ""Sure, it's a little creepy but I imagine that it will be hugely popular,"" wrote Martin Bryant for the tech blog TheNextWeb. ""[A]nd hey, if you're worried about being stalked maybe you should be more careful about who you approve as a Facebook friend?"" Theoretically, the app could be used by friends who just want to keep up with the love lives of their buddies so they can be there with a pint of ice cream and a shoulder to cry on when things go sour.

"(CNN) -- Thirty years ago around this time of the year, scientists announced that the probable cause of AIDS had been found. Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, would subsequently enter our lexicon and become synonymous -- no matter where you lived -- with death. Since then, more than 75 million people have acquired HIV and nearly 35.6 million have died of AIDS-related illnesses. With no cure in sight, it seemed that ending this epidemic would be a Sisyphean task. But investments in AIDS research, prevention and treatment have yielded tremendous dividends. As a result, we have before us the opportunity to end one of the greatest public health crises in history. More people than ever are receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy, and are living healthier, longer lives. There have been historic declines in AIDS-related deaths worldwide. From 1996 to 2012, antiretroviral therapy averted 6.6 million AIDS-related deaths, including 5.5 million in developing countries. The annual number of new HIV infections has also dropped by 33% since 2001. In 26 countries, the rate of new HIV infections among young people (ages 15-24) decreased by 50% since 2001. For the first time, we have the ability to end the transmission from mother to child and to keep mothers alive. Merely a decade ago, few believed they would see a cure in their lifetimes. However, several people who have been cured have helped shine a light on how a cure for all could be found. The case of a Berlin patient, the first person to be cured of HIV, was reported in 2008 and represented a watershed moment in HIV research and a proof of principle that a cure was possible. Last year, researchers documented the case of the first child to be functionally cured of HIV. Yet despite these promising developments, the epidemic is far from over. We are one year away from the target date for achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care set forth in the United Nations 2011 Political Declaration on AIDS, and we have a lot of work to do to meet that goal. Of the 35.3 million people living with HIV, nearly two out of three living in developing countries are not on HIV treatment, either because they do not have access or do not know their HIV status. Scaling up access to HIV treatment remains an essential prerequisite for ending AIDS. In addition to saving lives, it has proven to be highly effective at preventing HIV transmission because treatment reduces the chance the virus can spread by 96%. We must also improve our health systems to support the scale-up of core interventions that we know work, including expanded access to HIV prevention and treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, harm reduction, and voluntary medical male circumcision. Effective outreach to those most at risk—and most in need—is also critical. Key populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender individuals, people who inject drugs, young girls and women often face substantial barriers to obtaining prevention, treatment and care services. As a result, efforts to reduce HIV transmission among vulnerable populations remain insufficient. Moving forward, research on a cure and vaccine remains essential and must be a priority. The quest for a safe and effective vaccine to prevent HIV has seen hopeful signs of progress. Recently, an experimental vaccine ""cleared"" HIV in monkeys infected with the virus. Broadly neutralizing antibodies that protect against a wide range of strains of HIV have been discovered. Experts are following up the RV144 trial in Thailand, the first vaccine to show a modest protective effect in humans, in order to understand why some people were more protected than others and how to make the protective effect last longer. HIV cure research has gained momentum and picked up speed. The first organization to aggressively pursue cure-focused HIV research, amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, has intensified its cure research program and set a goal to find a broadly applicable cure for HIV by 2020 with its ""Countdown to a Cure for AIDS"" initiative. The foundation plans to invest $100 million in cure research over the next six years. And on World AIDS Day last December, President Obama announced $100 million in reprioritized funding over the next three years to launch a new HIV Cure Initiative at the National Institutes of Health. The scientific obstacles to a cure have been illuminated, and with a vigorous research effort and sufficient investment, these challenges can be overcome. While we now have the tools to begin to end the HIV epidemic, achieving an AIDS-free generation is threatened by a considerable gap between available resources and the amounts needed to scale up high-impact interventions. Investing now in these interventions will not only accelerate progress in reducing AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections, but it will also lower the long-term cost of the HIV response. Strong, continuous U.S. leadership at this critical moment is key. Innovative financing options and strategies need to be explored to ensure that the global HIV response is sustained. UNAIDS supports many countries in developing HIV investment cases, which enable countries to estimate future resource gaps, identify new sources of domestic financing to help close the gaps, and agree on ways to enhance the efficiency and impact of spending. More than 30 countries are now planning to develop their own investment cases by the end of this year. Lastly, we must eliminate stigma, discrimination and punitive laws and practices that continue to undermine efforts to provide critical services to prevent and treat HIV, especially among vulnerable populations. We're seeing a growing conservatism in a growing number of regions and countries. State-sanctioned homophobia in many countries remains a formidable barrier to the implementation and uptake of HIV programs. More than 80 countries criminalize homosexual behavior. The anti-homosexuality laws that have gone into effect in India, Nigeria, Russia and Uganda, for example, could impede their national responses to HIV. Studies have clearly shown that criminalizing same-sex sexual behavior poses an immense structural barrier to HIV prevention. We all are stakeholders in the opportunity before us now. Addressing the unfinished business of ending the pandemic will require the cooperation and full commitment of national government leadership, scientists, civil society, and people living with HIV. But through continued and strengthened solidarity, we will be able to rise above the challenges that remain ahead to ultimately achieve the goal of an AIDS-free generation.","Kenneth Cole, Michel Sidibé: Today, we still don't have a cure for AIDS .

"(CNN) -- A court in Egypt has sentenced to death more than 500 supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood following violence that broke out in the southern city of Minya last August. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry puts the number of those sentenced at 529. A single policeman was killed. Only 147 of the defendants were reportedly in court Monday. Sixteen people were also acquitted at the hearing. Another 683 defendants -- including the Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader Mohamed Badie -- appeared before the same judge Tuesday in relation to the unrest. Their case was adjourned until April 28. CNN spoke to its correspondent in Cairo, Ian Lee, independent Egyptian journalist Shahira Amin and Egyptian legal historian Khaled Fahmy about Monday's mass sentence. What happened in Minya? A police officer was murdered during the pro-Morsy riots in Minya last August. The violence followed a deadly crackdown by security forces on two Cairo sit-ins being held by supporters of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, had been toppled in a military coup in July 2013. Defense lawyer Khaled El-Komi told CNN the charges against the defendants appearing Tuesday include breaking into a police station, attempted murder, disturbing public peace and public order. The death sentence imposed on 529 people -- will it be carried out? Lee said it was ""highly unlikely"" that all those sentenced to death would be executed. He said Egypt had a large appeals process and the country's chief Islamic authority -- the Grand Mufti -- also had to approve the death sentences. Many death sentences in Egypt are later reduced, or overturned, Lee said. ""When you hear something like this, well it is shocking, but you do have to step back and say there's a lot between the sentencing and the execution."" Fahmy also said it was most likely the sentences would be appealed and revised. ""With regard those on the run, they automatically have the right for an entire new trial, in addition to the right of appeal following the issuance of the sentence,"" he said. Ahmed Shabib, a lawyer representing some of those sentenced to death, said that they would appeal the verdict after the Grand Mufti had made his decision allowing the court to announce its final ruling -- set for April 28. How was the trial conducted? The Minya court has been criticized for taking just two sessions to reach its verdict against the 529 people convicted. ""Never before has a court issued such a large number of death sentences in such a short period of time -- only two sessions,"" Fahmy said. The Egyptian news organization Ahram Online said the court had issued its verdict ""-- the biggest capital punishment verdict in the history of the Egyptian judiciary -- without hearing the defense arguments."" El-Komi told CNN his team of lawyers weren't allowed inside the courtroom. He said they didn't have any time to plead the case or review the evidence as the first procedural session was on Saturday, before being postponed until Monday -- when the verdict was issued. One defendant told CNN he hadn't been summoned for questioning by the prosecution or by the court for the trial. The man, who requested anonymity, said he hadn't been in Minya during the incident. The verdict was ""unjust"" he said and the accusations ""invalid."" Another defendant -- who also asked not to be named -- told CNN he had been at home during the violence. He said he believed he had been added to the list of defendants just because he was a member of the anti-coup alliance. Ten members of the alliance had also died that day, he claimed, and no one had been held accountable. How does the sentence compare to others? Fahmy said the court's ruling made a ""mockery of the entire Egyptian legal system."" ""As a historian of the Egyptian legal system, I can confidently say that this court ruling is a travesty of justice,"" he said. ""Never before in Egypt's long history has there ever been a ruling so obscene in its contradiction of the very principles of justice."" Fahmy described the ruling as ""particularly perverse"" as it handed down death sentences against 529 defendants accused of killing a single police officer. Journalist Amin said the sentence was ""ridiculous and a grave injustice."" ""Ridiculous because it's not possible that 529 people can murder a police officer -- which was one of the charges against the defendants. The other charge is less serious of course -- destruction of public property -- and doesn't deserve a death sentence."" Amin said the judiciary was displaying double standards. She pointed to the death of Khaled Said in 2010, whose alleged brutal beating by security forces is said to have been one of the factors behind the 2011 revolution that led to the ousting of then-President Hosni Mubarak. ""The killer of Khaled Said got a 10-year prison sentence,"" she said. Meantime, Ahram Online pointed to the sentencing of a police officer to 10 years imprisonment for the deaths of 37 Islamists in a police van last year as a ""sharply contrasting verdict."" How has the Egyptian public reacted to the verdicts? Amin said the verdict had been received with shock. ""The harsh sentence came as a big shock to me and many others including Egypt's liberals, many of whom oppose the Muslim Brotherhood,"" said journalist Amin. ""Morsy's supporters are calling it a 'death penalty for the judicial system in Egypt',"" she said. ""You still find supporters of the military who say that they deserve it, these are terrorists. That's because the country is extremely and deeply polarized and anyone seen to show sympathy -- even remotely -- for the Muslim Brotherhood is labeled a traitor and accused of being one of them,"" she said. Fahmy said he had little doubt that the ruling was politically motivated. ""It is as if the judge wanted to appease the military rulers of the country who decided to wage a 'War on Terror' and have declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization,"" he said. Fahmy claimed the sentence had made ""a mockery of the entire Egyptian legal system,"" and in the process undermines a fundamental pillar of society -- the very principle that the regime is accusing the Muslim Brotherhood of doing. ""In other words, if there is anyone who is undermining the stability of the Egyptian state, it is the judiciary and its incessant desire to appease the military and the police,"" he said. Amin said it was ""clear that courts are being used to settle political scores."" ""The courts are one more battleground for the political standoff between the military backed authorities and the Islamist group,"" she said. ""So basically, the verdict is a threat to Muslim Brotherhood supporters -- and also to opponents of the regime in general -- that there's zero tolerance for dissent."" Lee said the verdict can be seen as part of the ongoing crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and their supporters in which hundreds have died and thousands arrested. The irony, he said, is that while 529 people were sentenced to death over the killing of one police officer and attempted murder of another, no one has been held accountable for the deaths of hundreds of protesters. How has Egypt's government responded? Egypt's government, through its foreign ministry, stressed the independence of the country's judiciary in a statement to CNN. ""The Egyptian government would like to affirm that the Egyptian judiciary is entirely independent and is not influenced in any way by the executive branch of government, as dictated by the democratic principle of separation of powers,"" the ministry said. The ministry pointed out that the Minya sentence had been issued by an independent court ""after careful study of the case; that it was only the first verdict in the trial process; and that the defendants would be able to contest the verdict in the Court of Cassation."" What about the Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brotherhood issued a statement saying the sentence ""violates judicial norms."" ""The shocking and unprecedented sentencing of 529 Muslim Brotherhood supporters without due process is evidently inhumane and a clear violation of all norms of humane and legal justice,"" it said in a statement on its website. ""The verdict is yet another clear indication that the corrupt judiciary is being utilized by the coup commanders to suppress the Egyptian revolution and install a brutal regime which has already surpassed decades long of oppression and tyranny in Egypt's history."" In December, Egypt's interim government officially declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. It said anyone who was a member would be punished, as would those found to be giving the group financial support. What's happened to Mohamed Morsy? Morsy, the former head of the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, was elected president in 2012. Shortly after winning, he resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party in an effort to show that he would represent all Egyptians. But he was ousted in a coup in July 2013 amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts, including organizing attacks on Egyptian troops in the Sinai Peninsula and fueling ""sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in Egypt."" 529 sentenced to death in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- The United States isn't the only Western country dealing with racial tension. Racism is alive and well in Europe, as shown by an ugly, explosive remark at a high political level in Italy that surfaced this weekend. Roberto Calderoli, an Italian senator, compared Cecile Kyenge, the country's first black Cabinet minister, to an orangutan. He also is quoted as saying that Kyenge's success has encouraged illegal immigration to Italy and that she should be a minister ""in her own country."" There's been an uproar since he uttered the words, and there are calls for him to resign -- one news channel poll said more than 80% of viewers believe he should. An online petition calling for his resignation has been started. Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the talk is ""unacceptable beyond any limit."" It is the latest in a string of racial slurs and insults directed at Kyenge, a Congolese-born member of the Democratic Party. She assumed her integration minister post last April in the country's coalition government. Calderoli, a member of the anti-immigration Northern League party, made the remarks this weekend at a political rally. ""I love animals -- bears and wolves, as everyone knows -- but when I see the pictures of Kyenge, I cannot but think of, even if I'm not saying she is one, the features of an orangutan,"" he was quoted as saying. ""If I've offended her,"" Calderoli said after his remarks were publicized, ""I apologize."" ""It was a joke, a comment in a joking way. There was nothing particularly against her. It was just my impression. ... It is all very well that she be a minister, but in her own country. Given that this government needs to govern Italy, I hope that it is done by Italians,"" he said. Kyenge responded diplomatically, saying Calderoli ""does not need to ask forgiveness to me, but he should rather reflect on the political and institutional role that he carries. It is on this that he needs to make a profound reflection also to then apologize. ""Also, he must go beyond putting everything on a personal level. I think the time has come for us to study the problem of communication,"" she said. Kyenge moved to Italy in the 1980s to study medicine. She became an Italian citizen and is an ophthalmologist in Modena. Her ascent to a top position reflects the success of immigrants but also has fanned the flames of nativism. She received death threats before visiting an area where the Northern League is powerful, and the reports of slurs have emerged persistently. A local politician recently said on Facebook that Kyenge should be raped so she can understand the pain felt by victims of crime, which some politicians blame on immigrants. She's been called a ""Congolese monkey,"" ""Zulu"" and ""the black anti-Italian."" One Northern League official said ""she seems like a great housekeeper,"" but ""not a government minister."" Letta, who called the episode ""shameful"" and ""intolerable,"" made an appeal to Northern League leader Roberto Maroni to ""close this chapter right away."" If he doesn't, ""we will enter a logic of complete confrontation which I don't believe he needs, no one needs it,"" Letta said. ""Neither does the country need it.""

"(CNN) -- Reality singing competition ""The X Factor"" has lost its flagship star and its place on Fox's lineup. On Friday, judge Simon Cowell announced he was leaving the American version of ""The X Factor"" to return to the original UK iteration, news that came as Fox confirmed ""The X Factor"" is being canceled after three seasons. ""Unfortunately, there is no 'X Factor USA' without Simon Cowell, but we understand and support his decision to focus on the international formats and on the next phase of his personal life,"" Fox Broadcasting's chairman of entertainment, Kevin Reilly, said in a statement. ""We wish him the very best, and it's our sincere hope that we work together again soon.""

Thank you for the support and the fun we have had together. It's never forgotten. We found some amazing talent. And now the search begins to find the next star. That's why we make these shows."" Cowell launched ""The X Factor"" in the United States in 2011 after serving as a judge on Fox's other singing competition, ""American Idol,"" for eight years. The newer show had an uphill battle from the start, considering that it was up against both ""Idol"" and NBC's talent show, ""The Voice."" It didn't help that ""The X Factor"" had a revolving door of personalities as the series tried to stand apart: Paula Abdul, Nicole Scherzinger, Britney Spears, L.A. Reid, Demi Lovato, Kelly Rowland and Paulina Rubio have all joined Cowell, the mainstay judge, on the program. ""X Factor"" had just as tough a time securing consistent ratings. According to Entertainment Weekly, ""The X Factor"" averaged 7.1 million viewers and a 2.3 rating among adults 18-49 on Wednesday nights, an average that includes seven days of DVR playback. In a statement released by Fox, Cowell said that he's had ""a fantastic time"" on both ""X Factor"" and ""Idol"" and that ""apart from being lucky enough to find some amazing talent on the shows, I have always had an incredible welcome from the American public (most of the time!).""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Seventy-two police officers were killed in an attack early Tuesday by suspected Maoists in eastern India, authorities said. About 200 officers from the federal Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and a local police group were conducting a road inspection in Chhattisgarh state's Dantewada district when the assault occurred, according to officials. Dantewada's top district administrator Reena Kangale told CNN that the attackers fired at the security officers and set off landmine explosions. The attack and subsequent shootout lasted four hours, she said. Authorities launched rescue operations after the shootout ended, she added. There was no immediate report of casualties on the Maoist side, Kangale added. The road inspection by the officers was being carried out ahead of a planned transportation of food to a camp of internally-displaced people, she explained. India regards the communist rebels as its gravest internal security threat. The Maoists, on the other hand, have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. In February, India's home minister P. Chidambaram acknowledged that more than 900 people, including almost 600 civilians, were killed in Maoist-related incidents in 2009. Some 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said. ""I am confident that the state governments concerned will gradually gain the upper hand and re-establish the authority of the civil administration,"" Chidambaram told an internal security conference on February 7. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, conceded last year that the nation's fight with the Maoists had fallen short of objectives. Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among youth and the intelligentsia, officials suspect. ""We have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace,"" Singh said last September. ""It is a matter of concern that, despite our efforts, the level of violence in the affected states continues to rise."" In 2008, 1,591 Maoist rebel attacks killed 721 people, according to government officials. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call ""class enemies,"" the rebels are also believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.","72 police officers killed in an attack by suspected Maoists in eastern India .

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder says he sees ""racial animus"" in strident Republican opposition to some Obama administration policies. Some media conservatives say he's playing racial politics. Holder on Sunday told ABC's ""This Week"" that ""there's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed at me (and) directed at the President. ... There's a certain racial component to this for some people."" Holder said he also stood by comments from a 2009 speech in which he said America is a ""nation of cowards"" on race and sees a crop of new voter identification laws, many of them passed by GOP-controlled state legislatures, as a way to disenfranchise minority voters. Some conservative figures accused Holder and the White House of ""playing to the fears and anxieties of minorities in hopes of scaring them to the polls in November,"" as Wall Street Journal opinion writer Jason L. Riley wrote in an editorial for the paper on Monday. ""The willingness of the Obama administration to stoke racial divisions for political gain is astounding,"" Riley wrote adding that the voter identification laws are intended to ensure ""ballot integrity"" and that there's no proof they suppress minority votes. Former Illinois Republican congressman turned conservative radio host Joe Walsh Tweeted: ""Simple question for Eric Holder and all others who use race to protect Obama: Is it possible to oppose Obama and not be a racist?"" The Washington Times, a conservative newspaper, said Holder had ""thrown down the race card."" Opinion: Why Holder remarks made white people mad . Both sides are echoing a refrain sounded throughout Obama's presidency but the volume is so loud that neither side can hear what the other is saying, experts say. For example, Holder's claims speak to subtle institutional racism that is sometimes harder for those in the majority to recognize. ""That's how racial animus or hostility works -- it doesn't require people to be conscious about it,"" said Imani Perry, an African-American studies professor at Princeton University. As attorney general, Holder is likely speaking to some sentiment held by the Obama administration, said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University. ""I rarely think of Eric Holder being rogue in his comments,"" Neal said. ""He is just the one who is allowed to speak that way publicly."" And not all conservatives are motivated by race, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. ""I have no doubt there are conservatives who disagree with the president on policy grounds,"" Gillespie said. ""And I think people need to examine their hearts sometimes and examine the ways in which stereotyping informs the ways we view things."" Holder: 'We are at a dangerous time' Even former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's call to impeach Obama factors into the hot air surrounding race and politics, experts say. ""The reason why this comes up is that the people who support her score higher on the racial resentment battery,"" Gillespie said. All of this means that voters should take a long and introspective look at what motivates their reactions to politicians and policies, experts say. ""Bias can manifest itself in lots of ways. And nobody gets a free pass on this,"" Gillespie said. ""Sometimes you are more likely to be supportive of people who are like you and less likely to help people who are not like you. When that manifests in the workplace or in politics it is an issue."" Have your say .","Attorney General Eric Holder sees racial animus in conservative pushback .

"(CNN) -- It started with the denial of a growing health crisis. Nearly 40% of Georgia's children are overweight or obese -- the second-highest rate in the nation -- yet 50% of Georgians don't consider child obesity a problem. What's more, 75% of parents of obese children don't think they have a problem on their hands, according to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, the state's largest pediatric health care system. In response, Children's Healthcare crafted an ad campaign intended to highlight the roles of parents and caregivers in the widening epidemic. The posters and TV spots of obese children with doleful eyes were as stark as their accompanying messages: ""Being fat takes the fun out of being a kid,"" and ""It's hard to be a little girl if you're not,"" to name a few. ""We felt that because there was so much denial that we needed to make people aware that this is a medical crisis,"" Chief Administrative Officer Linda Matzigkeit said. ""We knew flowery ads don't get people's attention. We wanted to come up with something arresting and hard-hitting to grab people."" The buzz began almost as soon as the ads started appearing in September on billboards, buses and train platforms around Atlanta. Critics felt images from the Strong4Life campaign were too negative and perpetuated weight-based stereotypes without providing concrete solutions. ""There seems to be this perception that it's OK to shame children and families struggling with obesity because that will provide an incentive to lose weight,"" said Rebecca Puhl, director of research and weight stigma initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at Yale University. ""However, research in weight bias shows that when individuals feel shamed or stigmatized because of weight they're actually more likely to engage in behaviors that reinforce obesity: unhealthy eating, avoidance of physical activity, increased caloric intake."" The TV spots stopped airing in Georgia in October and most of the billboards have come down. But conversations around the campaign continued online and in media coverage worldwide, raising debate over what makes an ad effective when it comes to combating obesity. Mommy bloggers take on anti-obesity ads . As far as Children's Healthcare is concerned, the fact that the ads sparked debate means they achieved their goal, regardless of the reaction. ""Our intention was to get people talking about childhood obesity and we did that. We can't do this alone; it's going to take a whole community of physicians, parents and caregivers to solve the problem,"" Matzigkeit said. ""If parents continue to be in denial we're not going to get past this crisis."" It's a crisis that has been fostered by a culture of convenience: fast food, calorie-dense meals and car-centric cities slowly building up to national obesity rates of 33.8% among adults and 17% in children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Stormy Bradley realizes now that she was one of those parents who didn't recognize her daughter had a real problem. ""It's just a phase; she'll grow out of it,"" she told herself. ""I think I should've been more proactive earlier on,"" the Atlanta mother said. ""I just didn't want to have a conversation that would upset her or put a rift between us, also because I knew that would mean me having to face my own issues with weight."" Then, Bradley saw an ad on Facebook in February 2011 looking for overweight children. She asked her 13-year-old daughter, Maya Walters, if she was interested and at the audition, the two learned about the substance of the ads. They also heard about the potential backlash they could face if she accepted the part. ""I was a little bit hesitant but then when I thought about it, I was like well it'll be a good message to other kids like me,"" Maya said. What's the message? ""Being overweight is a problem, but you're not the only one dealing with it,"" she said. Feedback from her peers has been positive, she said -- most were surprised to see her on TV and billboards. She also became involved in the media blitz defending the ads, appearing on local news and the Today Show. Through the experience, Maya and her mother were offered the chance to utilize the hospital's Health4Life clinic, where she developed small changes to her daily routine through consultations with doctors, psychologists, nutritionists and exercise physiologists. And, she's sticking with it, she and mother attested. Fruits are surprisingly filling, she said. She can't remember the last time she drank soda after giving up sugary beverages for water and the occasional packet of sugar-free drink mix. She typically exercises at least 30 minutes a day, either by walking the dog with her mom or going to the park or playing on the Wii her younger brother. By the time school began last fall, she was ready to try out for the cheerleading squad and made it, which means two training sessions a week along with two to three games. ""The smaller things definitely make a change,"" she said in a phone interview Sunday as she and her mother drove to a ""Black Girls Run"" event in Lithonia, Georgia. ""It's very hilly in my neighborhood but now when I walk the dog I don't get as tired. With cheerleading, we have to run a mile at least. And before I couldn't do the whole thing but now I can."" Maya came to the campaign as a paid model, but the hospital considers her an example of how Strong4Life helps children set goals for a healthy lifestyle, complete with videos documenting their journeys. She's not the only one, according to the hospital. The Health4Life Clinic had 350 patient visits in 2010 and nearly 600 patient visits in 2011, with physicians treating more than 100 children with fatty liver disease and/or cirrhosis, conditions that are rarely seen among children who are not overweight. The multi-disciplinary approach is widely regarded as an effective tool in helping families make small changes in their daily routine. But among critics, those tools were buried far too deep within the initial ad campaign. ""The stark settings, their forlorn looks and body language convey an image of kids who are alone and don't have the support of the community. They teach us that we should feel sorry for fat kids and that it's normal to tease and abuse them,"" said Amy Farrell, author of ""Fat Shame: Stigma and the Fat Body in American Culture."" ""The approach should be to try to change those ideas with positive messages that encourage kids, parents and the community to get involved in encouraging kids to be active and eat well,"" said Farrell, a professor of American studies and Women's & Gender Studies at Dickinson College. In recent weeks, critics of Strong4Life's ads have compared them to a new campaign encouraging New Yorkers to cut their portion sizes. The Health Department's posters also employ austere black-and-white scenes of obese people, but the messaging is more direct. One poster shows a man with his leg amputated below his knee, crutches leaning against the wall, with the message ""Portions Have Grown: So Has Type 2 Diabetes, Which Can Lead to Amputations."" Still, the poster is generating controversy for a different reason, after the New York Times revealed that the image had been digitally altered to remove the man's leg. ""This issue isn't about one actor, but rather the 700,000 New Yorkers who struggle with diabetes, which kills 1,700 people a year and causes amputations in another 3,000,"" Health Department spokesman John Kelly said in a statement to the paper. ""Advertising to warn the public about health concerns saves lives, and we will continue our efforts to warn New Yorkers about diabetes."" The hard-hitting tone of Children's Healthcare's ads were inspired by Georgia METH Project's ""Not Even Once"" campaign, along with other state-led campaigns against smoking and drug abuse, which tend to pair a minimalist aesthetic with brutal, straightforward wording. With smoking and drug abuse, the main targets of public health initiatives are users. But campaigns to combat obesity, especially childhood obesity, set their sights on those struggling with their weight, caregivers and the community -- essentially, society at large. ""The target is everyone, whether they're fat or not, that somehow we should all be taking responsibility for what's perceived as an epidemic,"" said Farrell. ""The stigma itself needs to be addressed itself because until we do that, why would a fat child want to go out on the playground and be teased? We want to create an environment where people are not treated so poorly because of their bodies that they'll want go out and enjoy physical movement."" It's a sentiment that representatives from Children's Healthcare agree with, one that they say moves the discussion beyond an ad campaign to a movement that fosters healthier lifestyles. That means training pediatricians and health care providers on how to talk about obesity with families; it means giving families the tools to start making steps toward positive change. ""If you look at steps it takes to initiate long-term change, the first thing you need is to be aware that there's a problem and then you need the intent to change,"" said Dr. Mark Wulkan, the hospital's chief surgeon and professor-in-chief of pediatric surgery at Emory Hospital in Atlanta. ""The first phase of the ad campaign was about raising awareness and generating the intent to change. Now, it's becoming a movement, where we move on to changing the culture that has created this epidemic.""","Ads meant to raise awareness among parents of child obesity epidemic, hospital says .

"Washington (CNN) -- After weeks of talking past each other, congressional leaders and President Barack Obama talked to each other Wednesday evening -- only to emerge evidently no closer to a deal to halt the government's budget stalemate. The White House meeting, coming a day after the start of the federal government shutdown, served at least one purpose, in that key players in the debate gathered together in the same room for over an hour: Obama called it ""useful,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was ""worthwhile,"" and House Speaker John Boehner cast it as a ""polite conversation."" But while the sides talked, there was no indication they agreed on anything or even shifted their views. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, for instance, went so far as to call it ""unproductive."" Neither side discussed any potential compromises, with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden doing most of the talking and Boehner making clear he won't go forward with a ""clean"" funding bill -- with no Obamacare amendments -- a GOP congressional source said. Republicans, led by tea party conservatives in the House, have demanded provisions to defund or delay Obama's signature Affordable Care Act be attached to any government spending plan, a strategy that Democrats have called a non-starter. Moreover, the parties are on the verge of another crisis -- over whether to raise the debt ceiling by October 17, at which point the federal government won't be able to pay its bills. ""At times like this, the American people expect their leaders to come together to find ways to resolve their differences,"" Boehner said. ""The president reiterated one more time tonight that he will not negotiate."" A few minutes later, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid claimed that it was Boehner -- not the president or his fellow Democrats -- who has refused to budge on budgetary matters, saying ""we're through playing these little games."" Reid said Democratic leaders offered Boehner ""a lifeline"" by setting up negotiations ""about anything that you want to talk about"" so long as the House agrees to reopen the government first. ""I thought that they were concerned about the long-term fiscal affairs of this country. And we said, 'we are too. Let's talk about it,'"" the Nevada Democrat said. ""My friend, John Boehner ... cannot take yes for an answer."" In an interview with CNBC prior to the meeting, Obama said he was ""prepared to negotiate on anything"" regarding the federal budget -- but only after Congress passes ""a clean piece of legislation that reopens the government"" and allows the U.S. ""Treasury to pay for things that Congress itself already authorized."" ""Am I exasperated?"" Obama said of Boehner, who is under pressure from fiscal hawks, and is refusing to let the House vote on the Senate-approved spending plan. ""I am absolutely exasperated, because this is entirely unnecessary."" The president foreshadowed Boehner's comments that he wouldn't negotiate with Republicans in their attempts to tie government funding to Obamacare changes. Doing so, the president said, would set a dangerous precedent. ""If we get in the habit where a few folks, an extremist wing of one party ... are allowed to extort concessions based on a threat of undermining the full faith and credit of the United States, then any president that comes after me ... will find themselves unable to govern effectively,"" Obama said. ""And that is not something that I'm going to allow to happen."" Americans hurt as DC 'squabbles like kids' GOP spending measures unlikely to advance . Fresh off having sent four separate proposals tying funding the government to either delaying or defunding Obamacare -- each of which was rejected by the Senate -- the GOP-led House continued to work Wednesday, albeit on another plan Democrats say won't go anywhere. A day after an initial effort failed because the short-term proposals comprising a tiny portion of the overall federal budget lacked the necessary two-thirds majority support due to Democratic opposition, the House passed -- with majority support -- bills to fund national parks, the National Institutes of Health and District of Columbia operations. The incremental approach pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas seeks to pressure Democrats to approve spending for programs that Republicans like, but not Obamacare. Yet Obama has signaled he'd veto those measures should they reach his desk. That's unlikely, given that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has dismissed the GOP approach as ""reckless and irresponsible."" Shutdown 'extremely damaging' to U.S. intelligence operations . While expressing openness to budgetary negotiations generally, Democrats have said they'll only talk after Congress passes a clean spending measure. Both Democrats and Republicans say such a bill would pass the House with support from the Democratic minority and moderate Republicans. So far, Boehner has succumbed to pressure from the tea party right to avoid a vote that would pass something without causing some harm to the health care reforms. One problem is that conservative House Republicans from home districts with no realistic Democratic challenge feel emboldened to pursue a more extremist ideology backed by their supporters, CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. ""More people say raise the debt ceiling and fight the health care debate somewhere else,"" he noted. ""But there's enough here, if you think of a Republican going home to his district, there's enough here to understand why the Republicans think they're on safe ground dragging this out."" Decision to raise debt ceiling, or risk default, looms . The looming debt crisis could pose even more headaches, and confrontation, in the coming weeks. Failing to raise it may mean a U.S. default on its debt, something Obama stressed in Wednesday's White House meeting that the country can't afford to do, according to Reid. Obama offered no indication that he'll budge. Noting that such Republican brinkmanship in 2011 led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, the president said Tuesday he ""will not negotiate over Congress' responsibility to pay bills it's already racked up."" Writing the same day in USA Today, Boehner dug in his heels on the issue, saying ""there is no way Congress can or should pass such a bill without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit."" Raising the debt ceiling? Still, that crisis is still a few weeks away. The government shutdown is the one currently affecting hundreds of thousands of furloughed government workers, not to mention millions of others who rely on government programs, visit national parks and have some other type of interaction with affected programs. One moderate Republican who has backed a clean spending measure, Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, said that ""both sides have dug in."" Democrats, who he said ""won't even have a discussion,"" put House Republicans in a tight spot where they feel compelled to hold their ground or else ""set a bad precedent that the Senate would be somewhat dictating how the House runs."" But if Democrats agreed to listen, Grimm expressed optimism ""that we would put a package together and solve the problems at once, so we can get the government funded, stop the shutdown, and also deal with the debt ceiling so we don't have another crisis a week or two away from now."" Government shutdown forces clinical trial patients to wait . Pelosi said that scores of Democrats have reluctantly offered to back a plan to fund the entire government at a figure that's been bandied about by Republicans, albeit well below what her party members want. The other option would be to reconcile budgets passed by both chambers earlier this year in a conference committee, as is Washington custom. But what Democrats won't stand for, Pelosi said, is GOP legislators shuttering the government due to their opposition to Obamacare, which previously passed through Congress and withstood a Supreme Court challenge. ""That's not what our Constitution had in mind: that if you don't like something, you threaten to shut down the government,"" the California Democrat said. ""It's not that kind of system."" A blow to the economy . The shutdown of the government -- the country's largest employer -- isn't happening all at once. Federal employees who are considered essential will continue working. Those deemed non-essential -- up to 800,000 -- could be furloughed, unsure when they'll be able to work or get paid again. The shutdown could cost the still-struggling U.S. economy about $1 billion a week in pay lost by furloughed federal workers. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Congress still gets paid . While many agencies have reserve funds and contingency plans that would give them some short-term leeway, the economic effect would snowball as the shutdown continued. The total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers, said Brian Kessler, economist with Moody's Analytics. His firm estimates that a three- to four-week shutdown would cost the economy about $55 billion. And it's already had political ramifications extending beyond the United States. On Wednesday, Obama canceled planned visits next week to Malaysia and the Philippines as part of an Asian swing that will include a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Bali. Obama will still attend the ASEAN summit, his office said. CNN's Tom Cohen wrote and reported from Washington, and CNN's Greg Botelho did the same from Atlanta. CNN's Brianna Keilar, Athena Jones, Dana Bash, Jim Acosta and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Senate Minority Leader McConnell calls White House meeting ""unproductive""

"(CNN) -- The headlines seem like something from the past: Congressional hearings are held to debate women's access to contraceptives. A talk show host uses a derogatory and misogynist term to describe a graduate student seeking access to contraception on her campus. And for-profit employers are suing the government to avoid providing coverage for contraception within their employees' insurance plans on the basis of their personal beliefs. But this is no flashback: These conversations about contraception are happening now, in the present day, with outdated views and inaccurate information playing a leading role. As physicians dedicated to improving the health of women, we ask: Why is contraception still seen as controversial in the face of overwhelming evidence about its benefits? Why is birth control questioned, in this day and age, despite its widespread acceptance and use? In the current debate, science and facts are being drowned out by highly vocal and misinformed voices; as physicians, we must set the record straight. In the case that comes before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, owners of the craft store chain Hobby Lobby and furniture makers Conestoga Wood will argue against a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires insurance coverage of all FDA-approved contraceptive methods within employer-sponsored health insurance plans. In enacting this provision, the government agreed with America's medical professionals: Birth control is essential health care that must be covered like any other preventive service. Opinion: Corporations playing religion card over birth control . Let us make clear that we respect the rights of others to have their own personal beliefs. However, in exercising these beliefs, the owners of Hobby Lobby are denying scientific fact and asking to restrict employees' access to important preventive care. For example, one of the debates with the Supreme Court case centers around the employers' opinion on how contraception works: The employers think that certain forms of contraception (emergency contraception pills and intrauterine devices) cause abortions. But what they believe about science is contradicted by the science itself. Emergency contraception pills work by inhibiting or postponing ovulation, or the release of the egg, and this prevents fertilization from occurring. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) work by preventing sperm from reaching the egg, either by creating a barrier or by creating an environment that inhibits the mobility and viability of sperm or, in the case of copper IUDs, potentially by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg before a woman is pregnant. None of these contraceptives causes abortion. Already, contraceptive care is essential preventive care for millions of women. The ability to time and space children reduces fetal, infant and maternal morbidity and mortality. Contraception can help families better plan for pregnancies, leading to more optimal health outcomes. Planned pregnancies lower the risk of potentially serious issues such as low birth weight, preterm birth and small-for-gestational age. They also prevent an unanticipated worsening of health for women with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. Of course, contraception reduces unintended pregnancy. There is a reason why, in a recent poll, a majority of Americans favored coverage of contraceptives: It is because we need look no further than our own homes to see the value of contraception. The typical American woman will have two children in her lifetime. That means she will spend more than three decades trying to avoid pregnancy. Virtually all American women who are or have been sexually active have used contraceptives at some point during their lives. The value to women's lives and families is clear. But for a woman to make the best decision about the birth control that is right for her, coverage of all FDA-approved contraceptives is necessary. Cost of contraceptive care can be a major factor that determines not only which method a woman uses but whether she is able to use birth control at all. This is especially true for low-income and hourly workers. Birth control is often an additional health expense that many women simply cannot afford if money is tight, putting them at high risk for an unintended pregnancy. We see this problem frequently when we counsel our patients about the most effective contraceptives, namely IUDs and implants. These methods are up to 20 times more effective than the birth control pill in preventing pregnancy, and they are often the safest options for our patients. But high up-front costs put these methods out of reach for a lot of women. Insurance coverage for contraception without a co-pay would allow a woman to choose the best method for her, not just what fits in her budget. Taking away coverage would effectively block access to those most-effective methods. Birth control is not only safe and effective preventive care, it is also care that physicians support and millions of women need. Allowing an employer's personal values to trump his or her employees' right to care would allow the beliefs of the few to trump the health of many. That's both bad policy and bad medicine. As physicians committed to the health care and well-being of women, we urge the Supreme Court to consider the crucial individual and public health issues at stake when they weigh their decision in this important case. The health of millions of women and their children hangs in the balance. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Jeanne A. Conry and Dr. Nancy L. Stanwood.","Supreme Court will hear arguments about Affordable Care Act provision .

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (Reuters) -- Raid Israel to capture soldiers, battle tanks in the valleys of southern Lebanon and launch Katyusha rockets at Israeli towns -- a new Hezbollah computer game puts players on the frontline of war with the Jewish state. Some 1,200 people were killed in Lebanon in last year's conflict between Hezbollah and Israel. ""Special Force 2"" is based on last year's 34-day conflict between the Lebanese guerrilla group and Israel. ""This game presents the culture of the resistance to children: that occupation must be resisted and that land and the nation must be guarded,"" Hezbollah media official Sheikh Ali Daher said. But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev responded by saying: ''It should come as a surprise to no one that Hezbollah teaches children that hatred and violence are positive attributes.'' Designed by Hezbollah computer experts, players of ""Special Force 2"" take the role of a Hezbollah fighter, or Mujahid. Weapons and points are accumulated by killing Israeli soldiers. The game, launched on Thursday, recreates key phases of the conflict, which was triggered when Hezbollah forces raided northern Israel and captured two soldiers, saying they wanted to negotiate a prisoner swap. Hezbollah takes huge pride in its military performance in the war, which killed 158 Israelis, mainly soldiers. Some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in Lebanon. Israel says Hezbollah was weakened in the conflict, in which the group was forced out of its strongholds along the Israeli border and an expanded international peacekeeping force deployed in southern Lebanon under a U.N.-brokered cease-fire. Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim group backed by Iran and Syria, declared the outcome of the conflict a ""divine victory."" ""Through this game the child can build an idea of some of ... the most prominent battles and the idea that this enemy can be defeated,"" Daher said. The game retails at about $10 in Lebanon and is produced by volunteers. Hezbollah is expecting strong demand for the game at home and abroad. Hundreds of copies have been reserved in advance in Lebanon. The 3-D game forces players to think and use their resources wisely, reflecting the way Hezbollah fights, Daher said. ""The features which are the secret of resistance's victory in the south have moved to this game so that the child can understand that fighting the enemy does not only require the gun.

"Washington, Illinois (CNN) -- Steve Bucher knew something was ominous about the weather. ""The sky was just rumbling for 20 minutes,"" Bucher said on CNN's ""New Day,"" on Monday, the day after a devastating tornado outbreak destroyed his Washington, Illinois, home and dozens of others in several Midwestern states. ""I told my wife I've just never heard anything like this in my life."" Soon, she was begging him to go downstairs into their basement. ""Within 30 seconds, the house was literally vibrating from the direct hit of this funnel cloud,"" Bucher said. ""Next thing we know, things are cracking, and glass breaking and furniture came around the corner, missed us even though it came down the hallway where we were,"" he said. ""I think my attitude was in the next minute and a half, we're either going to be in heaven, we're going to be in the hospital or we're going to walk out of here. Completely in the Lord's hands which one of those three things was going to happen,"" he said. How to help . The storm took most of his house down to the decking over his walk-out basement, but neither he nor his wife was hurt. ""Everything else is rebuildable,"" Bucher said. ""I couldn't replace her."" The storm that destroyed Bucher's home was part of a multi-state outbreak of tornadoes and powerful winds Sunday that caused damage in several states, including Missouri, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. Six people died in Illinois and two men were killed in Michigan, according to authorities. As many as 200 people were injured through Illinois, officials said. Some 120 of those injuries came in Washington, said Jon Monken, director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Seven of those injuries were ""traumatic,"" Monken said. The storm destroyed or seriously damaged as many as 400 homes in Washington alone, Gov. Pat Quinn told reporters Monday. Damage was also reported in the adjacent northern Illinois towns of Diamond and Coal City, in Champaign County in central Illinois, in southern Illinois' Washington County and in Massac County -- in the extreme southern tip of the state. Incredible footage of the tornado in Washington, Illinois . Quinn declared seven counties a state disaster area, including Tazewell County, just east of Peoria in central Illinois, where a tornado left parts of Washington in ruins and one person dead. ""Devastation. Sadness. People that lost everything,"" is how Washington Mayor Gary Manier described the scene to CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" Another tornado in Washington County, Illinois, east of St. Louis, left a path of debris that stretched more than three miles, according to a preliminary survey by the National Weather Service. While the bulk of the storm system had moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean and the threat of severe weather Monday was small, damaging wind gusts of up to 40 mph were still possible in parts of the Northeast, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said Monday morning. In the Great Lakes region, 50 mph gusts were possible, she said. Hundreds of thousands of people remained without power. CNN affiliate WTVG: Storm leaves trail of damage . 'Complete destruction' The storm struck the town of Washington around 11 a.m. Sunday, when many of its 10,000 residents were at church. That's where Curt Zehr was when cell phones started chirping out storm alerts and the congregation headed to the basement. His wife and son, Mike, were at home. Zehr's wife texted to say they'd seen the tornado hit Washington, about a mile to the south. ""Then, about five minutes later, she texted me and said the house is gone,"" Zehr told CNN. ""I said, 'Whose house?' "" She said, 'Our house.' "" Mike Zehr said it wasn't long after they saw the storm hit Washington that they realized it was headed straight for them. They took to the basement and within a few minutes, Mike Zehr said, the house exploded with the loudest sound he's ever heard. ""The next thing we know, it's completely quiet and the sun's just shining through the stairs in the basement,"" he said. And their house was gone. Dozens of others had similar experiences. ""It was complete destruction,"" resident CNN iReporter Anthony Khoury, who filmed the tornado tearing through his neighborhood, said Sunday. ""There are people in the streets crying."" Resident Michelle Crumrine said the winds swept her home and everything in it clean away. ""A lot of people have a pile of rubble still, and I don't have anything,"" she said. ""It's gone. I don't know where it went."" On Monday, a National Weather Service survey team confirmed the storm had winds of 170 mph to 190 mph, producing EF-4 damage, the agency said. Earlier, the weather service had said such a confirmation would make the tornado the most powerful November twister in the state since at least 1950. CNN affiliate KTVI: 2 killed in New Minden, Illinois . Damage elsewhere . In Washington County, the county coroner's office identified two dead there as 80-year-old Joseph Hoy and his 78-year-old sister, Frances. They died when a tornado obliterated their family farm in New Minden, the office said. A 51-year-old man was killed in the town of Washington. Steve Neubauer was found near his home, Tazewell County officials said. Three other deaths happened in Massac County, across the Ohio River from Paducah, Kentucky. Authorities identified the storm victims as Kathy George, 58, Robert Harmon, 56, and Scholitta Burrus, 63. In Perry, Michigan, a 59-year-old man was found dead, tangled in live power lines. Phillip Smith's wife reported him missing after he didn't return after going out after the storm passed. Officials said a 21-year-old man was killed Sunday in Jackson County, but didn't release his name. Brutal winds also flipped over at least six trucks on highways about 80 miles west of Chicago, the Ogle County Sheriff's Office said. Officials in Missouri and Indiana were also dealing with storm damage. In Missouri, state emergency officials said a tornado may have hit Scott County, where heavy winds overturned three rail cars and blew over four mobile homes. And the mayor of Kokomo, Indiana, declared a state of emergency and closed schools Monday. While the state of emergency was set to be lifted at 6 a.m., ""unnecessary travel in the affected areas is still prohibited,"" city officials tweeted. There, the roof of a building sat in the middle of a road. A car rested on the mountain of rubble from a leveled home. At least 600,000 customers in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan were without power as of Monday afternoon, officials said. Some outages in southwest Michigan may not be fixed until the weekend. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is scheduled to tour the storm damage Monday. Soldier Field, O'Hare affected . Officials delayed the NFL game between the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens for almost two hours as storms approached Chicago, warning spectators to leave the stands at Soldier Field and head for covered areas. ""The rain started coming, the skies got black, the wind was insane, and they evacuated us to underneath the concrete concourse,"" said Jim Arnold, who was at the game with his 11-year-old daughter. ""We've been through 15-degree-below weather and winds, but never anything like this,"" Arnold said. ""The winds gusted at 70 mph, and the winds and the rain were horizontal and everybody was running. It was just crazy."" After the storm passed, fans returned to their seats and the game resumed . Thousands of travelers scheduled to fly through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport also had to grapple with the storm. More than 270 flights were canceled Sunday, and delays overnight stretched for an hour or more. Unusual outbreak . Sunday's storms accounted for more than half of the tornado warnings issued in Illinois since 1986, the National Weather Service said Monday. CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the storms came later in the year than some might have expected. ""The primary time for tornadoes, as we well know, is springtime. Then we see a second high that comes in the fall,"" she said. ""Is this late? It is rather late, because the temperatures have been very warm."" ""On the backside of that, temperatures are dramatically cooler. So that cold air is filtering in behind it, warm air out ahead of it,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The Pakistan military has declared that not only is it in contact with Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar but that it can bring him and other commanders to the negotiating table with the United States. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Afghan Taliban leader, has been a fugitive from U.S.-led forces since 2001. The acknowledgment of on-going communication with Taliban forces using sanctuary in Pakistan to launch military strikes against U.S. troops in neighboring Afghanistan is part of a new diplomatic overture to help the Obama administration find an end to the long-running conflict. But a spokesman for Pakistani Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) disputed CNN's report, which was based on an exclusive interview with ISPR director general Maj. Athar Abbas. In the interview, Abbas said in return for any role as a broker between the United States and the Taliban, Pakistan wants concessions from Washington over Islamabad's concerns with longtime rival India. Read a transcript of the interview . And senior U.S. officials have told CNN the Obama administration is willing both to talk to top Taliban leaders and to raise some of Pakistan's concerns with India.  Watch how Pakistan's military says they can bring Mullah Omar to the table » . With ISAF commanders conceding the military fight against the Taliban in key areas of Afghanistan is at a ""stalemate"" and that a recent influx of American combat troops is hoped to break the deadlock, the consensus among military and diplomatic figures in the region is that the United States cannot win the war in Afghanistan militarily. Most believe a resolution to the conflict will ultimately be a political, and economic, one rather than a military victory that will necessitate negotiations with the Taliban. Such a resolution will have to be struck with the involvement of Pakistan, India, Iran and possibly Saudi Arabia, as well as NATO and the United States. And with the Pakistan military, with its intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI), now going public with its offer to act as broker to help initiate talks, this could be the first opportunity for a breakthrough in ending the Afghan war that began with the U.S. invasion in 2001. Abbas told CNN after its ""very intense relationship"" with militants during the fighters' alliance with the United States during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Pakistan military is now still in contact with militant commanders such as Mullah Omar, Jalalladin Haqqani, Mullah Nazir and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar of Hizb-e-Islami. ""That's right, the ISI was in the forefront of the whole struggle against the Soviets. Now, by maintaining the contacts with the organizations like (Mullah Omar's Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar) doesn't mean that that state policy is (to be) providing them physical support or the funding or training,"" Abbas said. After the 9/11 attacks Pakistani policy to support the groups did a ""U-turn"", he said. ""And the state followed, the army followed, the ISI followed. Having said that no intelligence organization in the world shuts its last door on any other organization. So therefore the contacts are there. The communication remains. But it doesn't mean you endorse what they are doing in Afghanistan. You know you have nothing to do with it because your plate is full."" And even further, Abbas said, the Pakistani military has the ability to get the Taliban to the table with the United States to broker a cease-fire by jump-starting a dialogue between the warring parties, Abbas said. ""That's right. Dialogue,"" Abbas said. ""Eventually, one would have to return to the dialogue table. I think that can be worked out. That is possible."" Retired Gen. Hamid Gul, a former head of the ISI, Pakistan's equivalent of the CIA, is known as the ""Godfather of the Taliban."" He, too, said talks can be arranged. In terms of U.S. interests in Afghanistan, he said, there is only one man who can make it happen. ""Mullah Omar, nobody else,"" Gul said. He insisted the Obama administration, through the Pakistan military, can access Mullah Omar. ""Why not?"" he said, ""Is he a terrorist by any definition? Has he indulged in any act of terrorism?"" Gul added a stated Taliban condition to any discussions, the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan first, was not necessarily a fixed demand and, with concessions from Washington, could be softened and make way for negotiations to begin. But the ISPR issued a statement that ""strongly denied"" the remarks made by Abbas ""that the Pakistani military is in contact with Taliban leader Mullah Omar and it can bring him and other commanders to the negotiating table."" ""The remarks attributed to (the director general) are totally baseless, fabricated and taken out of context and ISPR rejects that,"" the statement said. The U.S. envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, told CNN's ""The Situation Room that the tight link between the Taliban and al Qaeda makes talks with the Taliban ""a non-starter ... unless the Taliban repudiates al Qaeda publicly."" The first response from the Obama administration to the Paksitani army's overture came from Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, who did not find the relationship between Pakistan and the Taliban surprising. ""There's been long allegations that there are continued contacts,"" he said. ""And I think it's a step forward for the Pakistanis to say publicly what everyone has always assumed."" Holbrooke also did not discount the possibility of talks with the Taliban. ""I'm not going to rule out or rule in anything on such a hypothetical basis,"" he said. ""And I'm not going to get drawn into speculation on an issue this complicated. ""There is room in Afghanistan,"" he said, ""for Taliban people who've fought with the Taliban, who were willing to participate in the political structure, who were willing to dissociate and renounce Al Qaeda, and who were willing to lay down their arms.","Pakistan military official claims talks possible between U.S. and Taliban .

"(CNN) -- It may have cost a reported $134 million to bring Gareth Bale to Spain, but on Wednesday he scored a priceless goal as Real Madrid beat archrivals Barcelona 2-1 to win the Copa del Rey. The Welshman, who was signed from Tottenham Hotspur in September 2013, produced a stunning solo strike to give Real their first trophy under Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti. Real's triumph condemned Barca to three successive defeats for the first time since January 2003 and crushed the Catalan team's final realistic chance of winning silverware this season. It capped off a miserable seven days for Gerardo Martino's Barca, who were last week knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid before losing at Grenada in La Liga on Sunday. While Real's big-money recruit flourished, Barca's star signing floundered. Neymar arrived at the Nou Camp amid much fanfare last June, but the Brazilian spurned a glorious opportunity to level the match in the final moments when he fired a close-range effort against the post. The first goal of a tense contest at Valencia's Mestalla Stadium arrived on 11 minutes after a rapid Real counter attack. Bale set Angel di Maria racing free and the Argentine composed himself before firing a low shot through goalkeeper Pinto and into the corner of the net. Pinto's attempts to save the shot had Barca fans pining for Victor Valdes, the team's longstanding goalkeeper who is unavailable after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last month. Real had injury problems of their own with FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo missing through a hamstring injury, although his absence was barely felt as Los Blancos dominated the first half. Barca struggled to match their vibrant opponents, with Lionel Messi cutting a particularly forlorn figure. It looked as if Bale had doubled Real's lead midway through the second period, but the winger saw his close-range header chalked off. Moments later, Barca found an equalizer from the unlikeliest of sources. Young defender Marc Bartra chose the perfect time to score a rare goal as he powered a firm header beyond Iker Casillas from Xavi's 68th-minute corner. But Real, and Bale, were not to be denied. With 85 minutes on the clock and extra-time looming large, Bale unleashed a punishing burst of pace to surge past Bartra near the halfway line. Bale soared towards goal and, under pressure from the pursuing Bartra, coolly poked a shot under the advancing Pinto. Barca should have leveled in the 90th minute, but Neymar could only find the post when presented with a clear sight of goal. While Martino's men must now contemplate a somber end to the season, Real have it all to play for. Ancelotti's team face Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals, while they also sit just three points behind city rivals Atletico at the top of the La Liga table. Man City struggle . Meanwhile in England, Manchester City lost ground in the Premier League title race after a 2-2 draw against bottom club Sunderland. Brazil midfielder Fernandinho got City off to the perfect start with a goal inside the opening two minutes, but Sunderland hit back in the second half with two goals from young English striker Connor Wickham. Sunderland looked to set to grab a much-needed three points, but City found a last-gasp leveler when goalkeeper Vito Mannone fumbled Samir Nasri's tame shot into the net with two minutes remaining. The draws leaves City third in the Premier League table and hands the initiative to second-place Chelsea and leaders Liverpool in the battle for the championship. Both Chelsea and Liverpool know that they will be crowned champions if they win each of their remaining four games, with the two set to meet in what is shaping up to be a title decider on April 27. Everton suffered a setback in the battle for the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot after losing 3-2 at home to Crystal Palace. Goals from Jason Puncheon and Scott Dann gave Palace a 2-0 lead before substitute Steven Naismith pulled a goal back for the hosts in the second half. Striker Cameron Jerome restored Palace's two-goal lead, with the London club resisting an onslaught in the final moments after Kevin Mirallas pulled a goal back for Everton. Defeat leaves Everton in fifth place, one point behind fourth-place Arsenal with four matches remaining.","Real Madrid win the Copa del Rey after beating Barcelona 2-1 .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has stepped up activity at its main nuclear test site, possibly preparing to carry out a fourth underground blast, South Korea said Tuesday. The report comes just days before U.S. President Barack Obama is due to arrive in South Korea as part of a visit to several Asian countries. ""We confirm that we have spotted several activities related to the nuclear test in Punggye-ri in North Korea,"" the South Korean Defense Ministry said in a statement. It declined to specify what the activities were, saying the information was classified. The ministry said it had increased its military preparedness since Monday morning and was monitoring around the clock for signs of activity at the Punggye-ri site in a northeastern region of North Korea. North Korea said last month that it wouldn't rule ""a new form of a nuclear test"" to strengthen its nuclear deterrent. Experts have speculated that that could refer to the testing of a uranium bomb. 3 previous tests . The reclusive regime in Pyongyang is known to have conducted three previous tests, all of them believed to be based on plutonium. The most recent one took place February 2013. The past tests prompted international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions aimed at hampering the North's weapons program. Since the last underground detonation, South Korean officials have repeatedly said that they believe North Korea is ready to carry out another test at any time, pending a political decision to go ahead with it. ""A lot of activity is currently being seen, so our forces are keeping in mind the possibility that North Korea may suddenly conduct a nuclear test in a short period of time, or as in previous cases, deceive us with what appears to be a nuclear test,"" Kim Min-seok, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said Tuesday, according to the local news agency Yonhap. Obama visit 'dangerous' The reports of activity come ahead of Obama's South Korean visit, which begins Friday. The North Korean Foreign Ministry on Monday described Obama's trip as ""a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region."" North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un's regime carried out a series of missile and rocket launches in March, prompting condemnation from the U.N. Security Council. An artillery exercise on March 31 near the border with South Korea resulted in a brief exchange of fire between the two sides after North Korean ordnance landed in South Korean waters. North Korea's series of provocative acts were seen as a response to joint U.S.-South Korean military drills in the region. The exercises take place each spring and regularly draw angry reactions from Pyongyang. Are suspected North Korean drones a threat to South Korea?

"(CNN) -- The anchor of MSNBC's ""Way Too Early"" apologized Tuesday for ""ill-advised"" references to Mexicans and Cinco de Mayo. Thomas Roberts, who hosts the show from 5:30 a.m. to 6 a.m., told viewers via Twitter that a segment that featured a correspondent in a sombrero swilling tequila was not intended to demean Mexicans. ""On Monday, Cinco De Mayo, 'Way Too Early' made sarcastic references to the way some Americans celebrate the holiday,"" he tweeted. ""It was not our intention to be disrespectful and we sincerely apologize for the ill-advised references."" The apology came after Hugo Balta, the president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, said in a written statement, ""This is simply the worst example I have seen of a discriminatory stereotypical portrayal of any community by any media. The fact that this was done by a news organization is abominable. This wasn't a chance occurrence. This was a planned segment where many decision-makers at MSNBC's 'Way Too Early' program agreed on the content and execution which concluded on what was seen nationwide."" Balta added in a Skype interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol: ""It made me ashamed for the journalists, for this network MSNBC, to show a segment that is full of stereotypes about the Mexican community."" During several moments in the show on Monday, correspondent Louis Burgdorf appeared in a suit and tie and a sombrero. ""Happy Cinco de Mayo. Let me just take a shot here to get the thing started,"" he said before appearing to take a drink. ""Ole!"" Later, Roberts was shown dancing with a maraca in one hand while there were margarita glasses and bottles of ""tequila"" on his anchor desk. Burgdorf also popped into the closing shot, in which he apparently pretended to drink from one of the tequila bottles for several seconds as Roberts explained the background of the holiday. Roberts also will apologize Wednesday on the air, according to several media reports. How not to celebrate Cinco de Mayo .

"(CNN) -- Google Music, an online music store and ""free locker"" for digital music, was rolled out to the public on Wednesday. On Thursday, however, questions abounded as to whether the service will amount to simply a ""me too"" move, following Apple and Amazon's well-worn trail through the digital-music forest, or a significant step toward making Google an e-music player. And while much of the always ready-to-attack tech blogosphere was less than enthusiastic, it's legitimate to ask whether that's even the real question. In a way, the product is just one more front in the battle between Android and Apple. Away from the desktop, iTunes users must have an iPod, iPhone or other Apple device to play the music, movies and other content they download. By selling more widely usable mp3s, Google Music will be viable across multiple devices. And, of course, Google would prefer you to choose a device running its Android operating system. ""In the end, this isn't about helping Google 'catch up to iTunes' -- it's about filling the big, gaping, musical hole in Google's mobile business,"" Peter Kafka wrote for All Things D. While no single Android phone has approached the popularity of the iPhone, Android smartphones as a whole have become a serious force, capturing more than half the overall market during the last quarter. (Android phones amounted to 52% of the global market compared to about 15% for the iPhone, according to Gartner). Gizmodo's Adrian Covert, who it's safe to say was unimpressed with Google's offering, says that nothing that was rolled out on Wednesday would entice iTunes or Amazon users to switch. Google Music is expected to soon offer 13 million songs from three of the four top record labels (Warner Music balked) as well as independent bands and includes free cloud storage for up to 20,000 songs. (Apple's similar iMatch costs $25 a year). ""The technologies might be current, but the ideas behind Google Music are tired,"" Covert wrote. ""Speaking of old and tired, were you really pining away for another a la carte music store? Probably not. Most of us have been buying tracks from iTunes and Amazon for years."" But: Is enticing users to switch even the goal? For someone trying to decide between buying an Apple or Android device, iTunes could be a deciding factor. Google Music, at least in part, could take that bullet out of Apple's gun. ""There are two things the critics decline to acknowledge: that Google is providing a simple, free service, and that all Google products start out underwhelming and gradually expand,"" Devin Coldewey wrote for TechCrunch. ""Android was a mess when it showed up. And it's still a mess -- a mess blowing up to the tune of half a million devices a day."" And with a long-term investment of resources (and, presumably, the successful wooing of more record labels), the Google Music vs. iTunes tilt could eventually rival the current iPhone vs. Android fight. ""Apple now faces its arch rival in the retail-music sector where Apple is a juggernaut,"" wrote CNET's Greg Sandoval. ""But it also means that iTunes will face a company with deep pockets, a history of success in music (YouTube is one of the popular music distributors on the Web) and popular consumer devices, Android phones and tablets, that can help market the music store. This is something few previous rivals possessed."" But first, Google will have to get over the cool reception the launch got in some quarters, largely dinging the company for lacking innovation in a product that got a star-studded, splashy roll-out.","By offering mp3s, Google Music can be used on a host of devices .
Some tech writers were cool to Google's rollout, saying it's nothing new .

"This story contains graphic depictions that may be disturbing to some readers. Most girls who engage in compensated dating don't view themselves as prostitutes, a social worker says. HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- She doesn't want to be identified, except by her nickname ""Sze,"" and she has a secret past. Her father doesn't know what she did as a 16-year-old, and she hopes he never finds out. But Sze, now 19, wants young girls to hear her story so they never make the same mistake. ""My first customer was an ordinary man in his 40s. We skipped the dinner part and went straight to the guest house for sex,"" Sze recalled. ""Actually, I was a bit scared, but I knew this was the only way I could get money. This customer wasn't bad, though. We just had sex, he paid, and then he left. I thought this was easy money, and that's why I continued doing this kind of thing."" For a year and a half, Sze was part of a growing social phenomenon among teens in Hong Kong called ""compensated dating,"" a practice in which a young woman agrees to go on a date with a man for a fee. More often than not, the date involves sex. Sze said she started compensated dating because many of her classmates at an all-girls school were doing it. She says she became jealous when she saw the designer clothes, bags and cosmetics they bought with the money they earned through compensated dating. Sze wanted the same for herself, so her classmates introduced her to Internet chat forums where she met male customers.  Watch young women describe why they do it » . The practice can have deadly consequences. Last year, a 16-year-old Hong Kong girl was killed in a gruesome murder after she went to a 24-year-old man's apartment for a compensated date. The man, Ting Kai-Tai, killed the teenager, dismembered her body and flushed the remains down the toilet. A jury convicted him of murder and sentenced him to life in prison. Sze told CNN she knew a compensated date could go horribly wrong. She would set ground rules with clients on the phone first. She charged them $350 for a date and clarified how many times she would have sex with them. She said sometimes the customers would stray from the rules, asking for more sex or refusing to wear a condom. ""Sometimes, I did feel shame. I kept asking myself why I had to do this kind of thing to make money. But the feeling didn't stay long. I would relax when I wanted to buy something. I just thought I could always quit after a short time or whenever I wanted,"" Sze said. Most girls who engage in compensated dating don't view themselves as prostitutes, said social worker Chiu Tak-Choi. ""For the girls, they don't think so because they think they can quit anytime. The girls -- even though they post their details on the Internet -- they think they can quit. Even if they encounter the guys, if he is not good-looking, she can quit and say 'I don't do it.' They think they have a lot of power to control whether they do it or not, so they think of it very differently from prostitution."" Chiu, the social worker, is currently working with about 20 girls who are trying to leave the world of compensated dating. It is hard to quantify how big the problem is in Hong Kong because the business is conducted under the radar, he said. Chiu believes the problem is getting worse because his caseload has doubled in the past two years. Prostitution is illegal in Hong Kong, and legal experts say that compensated dating is a form of prostitution. ""The law prohibits soliciting for immoral purpose,"" said Stephen Hung, a criminal litigator with Pang, Wan & Choi. ""When a court looks at sentencing, the greater the age difference, the more serious it (the sentence) is."" Why do young girls get involved in compensated dating? The reasons vary from an unstable home life to a desire for material goods, Chiu said. One 14-year-old girl told him she started compensated dating when she lost her cell phone. She said her parents wouldn't buy her a new one, so she thought she could earn some fast money with paid sex. She had her eye on an expensive cell phone. When the money from the first compensated date didn't cover the cost for the new phone, she went on a second paid date. Girls involved in compensated dating don't necessarily come from poor families, Chiu said. They are from all levels of socioeconomic classes, he said. Improved family communication is one solution to preventing girls from becoming involved in compensated dating, Chiu said. ""The family has to do its part. I think caring for children is very important. Whenever they have problems, they can ask someone for help."" Sze said she was saved by a social worker who stepped in on her behalf. After a pregnancy scare and a number of unpredictable customers, Sze said her self-esteem plummeted. The social worker helped her get back on track. ""She helped me understand that making money respectably is actually not that hard in Hong Kong. I finally realized that it was wrong to make money by selling my body. It just wasn't worth it."" Sze now works at a hair salon to earn a living. She has tried to talk her old friends out of compensated dating, but they are not listening, she said. ""They felt annoyed when I talked to them about this. I'm now reluctant to get in touch with them. They just tell me they're different. Maybe they have more serious family problems or some other burdens. I know I can't control their thinking, so I just stopped trying to help them.""","""Compensated dating"" growing among Hong Kong teen girls, social workers say .

"(CNN) -- It's been difficult for die-hard fans of ""Breaking Bad"" to let go of the main character, Walter White -- and it turns out it's not been easy for the actor who portrayed him, either. Bryan Cranston tells Parade magazine that it's been hard letting go of the years of portraying such a rich character. ""Usually when you get a role they give you a set of circumstances: 'He can do this, but he can't do that,' "" he said. ""With Walter White, over the course of six years, I covered it all. I could kill someone; I could caress my baby and kiss my son on the forehead. The whole spectrum of the human experience."" The actor has taken on the role of President Lyndon B. Johnson in the Broadway production of ""All the Way"" and said the current president could learn a thing or two from the former leader. ""There are two things LBJ had that our current president doesn't have,"" Cranston told parade. ""One is extensive experience in Congress. By the time he became vice president, Johnson not only knew everyone, he knew what their pet projects were. So he was ready to make deals and trades."" ""The second thing is the (political) climate. In LBJ's time, politicians knew they'd have to cross the aisle: 'Our philosophies might be opposite, but I'm going to try to work with them.' And what we have now is a digging-your-heels-in: 'They are trying to hurt the country. Only our way is the right way' -- whether you're in the Republican or Democratic camp. It is so polarizing and distrustful and disrespectful."" Cranston is also moving on to blockbusters, with a part in the new film ""Godzilla,"" slated for release in May. In it, Cranston plays a scientist. He said he had some trepidation about taking on the role. ""I initially turned it down -- I thought, 'I can't do ""Godzilla"" after ""Breaking Bad""; that's a huge step down,' "" he said. ""But I was surprised at the level of the writing, and the director, Gareth Edwards, had some great ideas to strengthen the heart of the story. And why not do something that's fun and escapist?

"(CNN) -- Old habits die hard. When asked what would represent an acceptable finish at his first major for nearly a year Tiger Woods replied: ""First. It's always the case."" Such are the standards of a player who sits on 14 career majors, just four shy of the greatest of all time Jack Nicklaus. Woods might be ring rusty after his four-month injury layoff but the swales and hollows of Royal Liverpool will be familiar to him when the British Open starts on Thursday. The world No. 7 bossed the field the last time the Open was held at Hoylake, romping to a five shot victory in 2006. But after going six years without victory in a major championship, the 38 year old acknowledges he contends in a different playing field these days. ""It gets harder every year because the field gets deeper,"" he told reporters. ""Guys coming out here are bigger, stronger, faster and more athletic. ""When I first started I think I averaged around 296 yards (in driving distance). ""I walked with Gary Woodland on Sunday and he said he has finally found a driver and ball combo that he can hit 320 yards through the air. The game has changed a lot."" Woods returned to competitive action on the PGA Tour in June after a spell on the sidelines having had surgery on a back injury. He failed to make the cut at Congressional but has undoubted pedigree when it comes to the British Open. Aside from a missed cut at Turnberry in 2009, Woods hasn't finished outside the top 23 in the last eight incarnations of golf's oldest major, adding two more wins to his first in 2000. He famously strolled to victory at Hoylake in 2006 using his driver just once in four rounds as the course baked in the face of a heatwave. ""It feels great to come back to Hoylake,"" Woods said after completing a full practice round. ""I'm at three Opens and hopefully, I can get more than that. ""There have been a couple of changes and overall the golf course is a little softer than '06. ""I have played three practice rounds now and had three different winds which has been helpful to see the course in different conditions. ""It was hot, the ball was flying and it was very dusty in 2006. Now we are making ball marks on the green. ""On Saturday it was running and fast but on Sunday with the rain balls were checking and it played longer. Today the greens were faster and very close to game speed.""","Tiger Woods preparing for his first major championship in nearly a year .

"(CNN) -- As Europe struggles to recover from crisis, two of its most powerful leaders are meeting to thrash out the next stage. British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are this week in Sweden, discussing jobs growth and the future of the European Parliament. The talks come after support for anti-EU parties soared in May's European elections, as frustrated voters turned away from the established political leaders. Europe's long-term unemployment crisis is high on the agenda of the Stockholm meetings. Youth unemployment in the European Union reached a record high of 23.4% in January, according to Eurostat. But the European unemployment numbers paint an unequal picture. Countries like Greece, Spain and Italy have suffered high unemployment rates since the onset of the eurozone crisis, with harsh austerity measures contributing to job losses.

"(CNN) -- John Yates believes when it comes to the power of the federal government, he is just a small fish caught up in a prosecution meant for corporations. And the Supreme Court thought enough of his appeal to hear the matter later this year. The justices agreed on Monday to take up the case in which prosecutors used a law typically applied to corporate records to convict Yates of getting rid of three illegally caught grouper. The question is whether the law against obstructing an investigation into business practices is too vague. It was passed in the aftermath of Enron and other big scandals of that kind. The actual legal language in dispute involves efforts to conceal, cover up, falsify, or make a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object. Yates, 61, owns the Miss Katie, a commercial fishing vessel moored near Bradenton, Florida. It was operating off the Gulf of Mexico in 2007 when she was boarded by state officers working with the National Marine Fisheries Service. They discovered 72 undersized red grouper, and told Yates to leave the catch there, and head back to shore so agents could seize it. When the Miss Katie arrived at port days later, a government inspector counted only 69 fish that were below the 20-inch minimum harvesting size. Yates still claims the deputy originally miscounted the fish. Prosecutors alleged Yates had ordered his crew to throw the smaller fish overboard, and charged him with destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation. A jury eventually convicted the Holmes Beach man and he spent 30 days in jail. The Justice Department said Yates does not dispute now that he ""directed the destruction or concealment of the fish"" but argues that the law used to prosecute him does not apply. Yates says the conviction has hurt him economically and wonders why the government was so insistent they ""have a pound flesh"" by prosecuting him for what he called a simple civil infraction. The justices will not retry the facts, but only will consider whether the law was properly applied. A number of legal and political advocacy groups have rallied to Yates' cause, saying ""misuse"" of government discretion to use criminal law rather than civil law to handle a range of regulatory enforcement is hurting the justice system. ""Overreach by any branch of government steps on the rights of all Americans, whether on our country's street corners or our nation's boardrooms,"" said William Shepherd, representing the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, which filed an amicus brief in the case. ""Overreach impacts real people."" The case is Yates v. U.S. (13-7451).","Florida fisherman convicted under law crafted for corporate prosecutions .

"(CNN) -- A car bomb went off in the restive northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Sunday, killing nine people, while 10 others were killed in clashes there, security officials said. The explosives-laden car targeted a joint security patrol of the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces, police officials told CNN. Five Iraqi soldiers and four members of the Kurdish forces were killed, while another 12 people were injured. Separately, four Iraqi soldiers and six gunmen were killed in clashes between the army and insurgents in two neighborhoods in eastern Mosul, military officials there told CNN. Seven Iraqi soldiers were wounded. Army Gen. Abdul-Hussein Aydan told CNN the Iraqi army had launched a military operation in eastern Mosul against armed groups ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for the end of April. Mosul is a predominantly Sunni city about 420 kilometers (260 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad. It is considered one of the most dangerous cities in Iraq, with al Qaeda-linked groups active there. In al-Dibis, about 310 kilometers north of Baghdad, a suicide bomber targeted a security checkpoint manned by local police and Kurdish forces, killing six people and wounding seven others. The town is located near the city of Kirkuk. In Sulaiman Bek, also north of Baghdad, gunmen attacked the house of a leader of the local Awakening Council, killing three of his family members, police officials in Tikrit said. The leader was not in his house when the attack happened but two people were snatched from the house, police added. Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq and Sahawat, are composed primarily of Sunni Arab fighters who turned against al Qaeda in late 2006. The U.S.-backed movement is credited with having contributed to a drop in violence across Iraq, but council members have become targets for remaining jihadists. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003 . Violence has escalated over the past year; the United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with more than 8,800 people killed, most of them civilians. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report .","Car bomb in Mosul targeting security patrol kills nine people, police say .

"(CNN) -- Summer is a time for grilling, relaxing and apparently getting your life together -- at least on television. Those lazy, hazy days this year are featuring reality shows aimed at everything from weight loss to ego adjustments. Programs such as NBC's ""Losing It With Jillian Michaels"" and ""Breakthrough With Tony Robbins,"" as well as VH1's ""You're Cut Off"" and ""Bridal Boot Camp"" are part of a hot trend offering audiences plenty of self-help viewing along with their lemonade and barbecues. ""During the summer, people are more tuned into those types of pursuits,"" said Deborah King, author of ""Truth Heals: What You Hide Can Hurt You."" ""[Viewers] are thinking more about health, how to feel better and how to feel healthier so they are more inclined to go that route."" Dog-day television viewing has changed in the past decade, based a great deal on the success of the reality program ""Survivor,"" which helped kick off the reality TV craze when it debuted in May 2000. Before CBS premiered the series, which drops contestants in the wilderness to compete against each other for $1 million, summertime viewing was pretty blah and standard, said Al Norton, who blogs about television at his site, Two Tivos to Paradise. ""It was only 10 or 15 years ago that summertime was all about reruns,"" Norton said. ""I think there is a general feeling among viewers that your standards for what you are willing to watch are a little bit lower during the summer."" The self-help shows are also more conducive to viewers' TV habits in the warmer months as opposed to series such as ""Lost"" or ""Fringe,"" where the audience is called upon to remember plots from week to week, Norton said. ""In general, the viewing audience is less in the summer because people are on vacation, the weather is nice and people are out. People aren't necessarily going to follow a show every week,"" he said. ""Most of those self-help shows are pretty self-contained."" That means viewers can hop in and out of such shows, without missing a beat. Check out an iReport review of ""Losing It With Jillian Michaels"" Laura Baron hopes audiences do that for her new series. Baron serves as the life coach on VH1's new summer reality series ""You're Cut Off,"" which bills itself as a ""princess rehab"" for ""nine spoiled rotten princesses."" The women, who believe they have been chosen to participate in a show called ""The Good Life,"" are moved into a home and forced to forgo all of the amenities they enjoyed in the real world. Baron said people are looking to shed more than just heavy coats when the weather turns warmer. ""People are probably more open in the summer and looking at themselves,"" ""When you are doing self-help in the winter when it's dreary outside, your journey is not as fulfilling. There is something about summer that offers possibilities."" Author King agreed and said such reality shows are also tapping into the viewing public's desire to improve their health and wellness, even if it's vicariously through watching others. ""I've seen the interest in such programming increase from year to year,"" said King. ""It's something people are concerned about and focused on more and more.""","Summer time has become destination TV for self-help reality shows .

"CNN -- One evening in the spring of 2010, Keith McSpurren settled down with his children in his home in Toronto to watch play-off hockey on television, a ritual repeated in millions of households across Canada. But as he watched the presenters running through the news of the day, he suddenly saw something in the background that had probably gone unnoticed to most. ""I take an odd pride in this, but I knew I had made it when I watched TV and sure enough behind the guys there's a CoverItLive console,"" McSpurren said. ""I hit pause on the DVR and asked my son, 'See that thing in the middle? That's our software. That's what dad does.'"" The console McSpurren had spotted will be familiar to almost anyone who has looked at a news website in the past couple of years. As the thirst for instant news has grown ever more insatiable, the ""live blog"" a time-stamped, regularly-updated, predominantly text-based report of breaking stories has become a staple of internet news and sport coverage. CoverItLive, which McSpurren developed in 2007, is the most commonly used live-blogging platform, and is regularly embedded on the websites of outlets as disparate as the BBC and Fox News; the Weather Channel and WWE.com -- as well, it seemed, as in the CBC Hockey Night Live studios. More than 600 live-blogging ""events"" take place on CoverItLive every day, attracting unique readerships that, according to McSpurren, can run as high as 14 million per event -- a record currently shared by coverage of President Obama's Nobel Peace Prize speech, and a cricket Test match in India. Reports have claimed CoverItLive events attract 82 million visitors per month. The console can be managed by a single journalist and refreshes instantly with new content, which can include pictures, videos or Twitter feeds, as well as the reporter's text commentary. Readers can interact through a comments box, vote in polls or enter trivia quizzes. The combined package of news and interactivity lends itself especially well to sport coverage, where it can mimic the experience of watching a match and discussing it with friends. But in recent years, live-blogging has also become the default approach to covering much harder breaking news stories: the uprisings of the Arab spring, the phone-hacking scandal in the UK and the Norway shootings, for example, were all covered in live blogs on almost all major news platforms. The duration of events can make live-blogs especially ""sticky"", encouraging readers to stay on a single page for longer than they ordinarily might. If a news story continues to develop throughout an entire day, the live-blog can become the one-stop shop for breaking developments alongside a digest of what has happened so far. It can later become an archive of how events unfolded in real time. ""The core figure to us is the number of readers times the duration they spend on the software,"" McSpurren said, stressing the multiplication. ""Something like the Casey Anthony trial in the United States (which was live-blogged in its entirety), was on from nine in the morning to four in the afternoon. It's infinitely better from a business point of view than a really great event that's only on for 35 minutes."" An average visitor to a CoverItLive event stays for 12 minutes, according to McSpurren. The live-blogging phenomenon actually pre-dates CoverItLive by several years, and probably has its roots among the team of sports obsessives of CricInfo, who first provided ball-by-ball coverage of cricket matches in the mid-1990s. Both the BBC and the website of the Guardian newspaper in the UK soon picked up the baton, and the Guardian in particular cultivated a unique tone and community among its sportswriters and readers, who pore over every minute of a football match or cricket games in over-by-over mini-reports. What not to blog . But for all the recent proliferation of live blogs, some media analysts say that rolling coverage is not always appropriate, pointing to some notable lapses in editorial judgment. In 2008, for example, the Rocky Mountain News was widely criticized when one of its reporters live blogged, via Twitter, the funeral of a local toddler, who had been killed in an accident. Updates from the stream included ""family members shovel earth into grave"" and ""people are again sobbing"". This month the BBC website also attracted criticism for its somewhat oxymoronic coverage of ""Amy Winehouse death -- LIVE!"" Scott Murray, a former online sport editor at the Guardian, who has contributed live online commentary since 1998, said: ""It kind of makes sense to do something like the phone-hacking scandal on a rolling blog, because on the first few days, something was happening every half an hour. But Amy Winehouse, it just doesn't make any sense. That's just a news story: someone has died. And that's it."" By definition, live blogs demand frequent updates, and thus reporters are often encouraged to substitute instant snaps for more considered journalistic analysis, or even silence. ""It's like 24-hour news on TV,"" said Murray. ""You always have to have something to fill it. That's when you're going to get all this hot air and speculation."" McSpurren agrees that the true strength of live blogging relies on the skills of the reporter to offer relevant analysis, publish pictures and launch appropriate poll questions. ""Our business isn't magical,"" he said. ""It really is dependent on the person running the event. If all you're doing is regurgitating what they see on the TV screen anyway, there really is no point for them to be there."" The continued success of live-blogging seems certain, however. CoverItLive was acquired by Demand Media in February and several alternative, similar platforms have also recently launched. McSpurren said that the business is working with news organizations to improve CoverItLive's compatibility and to offer better tools for journalists. Meanwhile consumers continue to make live-blogs the best read articles on most news sites. ""People like immediacy,"" said Murray. ""And I guess it means more people are getting interested in news, politics, sport, whatever, because there are new ways to consume it all.""","Live blogging of events, from news to sports, has become widespread .

"(Mashable) -- AT&T, criticized and even despised for its inability to keep up with growing mobile data usage, thinks it has found the solution to its network woes. And all it will cost the telecom giant is $39 billion and months (or even years) of regulatory hurdles. In a stunning move, AT&T has acquired T-Mobile USA for a whopping $39 billion from Deutsche Telekom. Along with acquiring approximately 8% of AT&T, Deutsche Telekom will also be gaining a seat on AT&T's board of directors. The new combined entity, if it can garner regulatory approval, will be largest carrier in the U.S. by leaps and bounds. AT&T and T-Mobile USA combined have over 25% more subscribers now than Verizon (125+ million vs. 93+ million). This acquisition isn't about subscriber bases, though; it's about improving AT&T's reliability and preparing it for the 4G era of wireless communication. The spectrum problem . AT&T's press release tells a very clear story of why AT&T bought T-Mobile and why T-Mobile bought AT&T. It's no secret that AT&T has a tattered reputation. The iPhone may have brought it millions of new customers and billions in revenue, but the vast increase in data usage has also strained the network to unacceptable levels. There wouldn't have been so much hype surrounding the Verizon iPhone if AT&T's network didn't drop so many calls and upset so many customers. And while AT&T is investing billions to upgrade its network, it takes years to get the approval to build new towers, especially in metropolitan areas such as San Francisco. Without a dramatic move, AT&T's network wasn't going to get better anytime soon. Two sections of AT&T's press release are devoted specifically to this problem. It's a testament to just how crucial this problem is to AT&T's future. The first problem it addresses is spectrum: The wireless carrier simply doesn't have enough wireless spectrum to fuel the accelerating growth it has experienced over the last few years. ""AT&T's mobile data traffic grew 8,000 percent over the past four years and by 2015 it is expected to be eight to 10 times what it was in 2010,"" AT&T explained in its announcement. ""Put another way, all of the mobile traffic volume AT&T carried during 2010 is estimated to be carried in just the first six to seven weeks of 2015."" AT&T believes it will take years until more spectrum is opened up by the U.S. government for mobile broadband use. The simplest way to get its hands on precious broadband is through acquisition, and T-Mobile USA has the most GSM broadband spectrum after AT&T. The infrastructure problem . The second problem is infrastructure. AT&T simply can't build towers fast enough, and the approval process to build the unsightly things acts as a major roadblock to the company's efforts to boost its network reliability. So if you can't build towers fast enough, what's the next best way to get them? That's right: You acquire them. ""At closing, AT&T will immediately gain cell sites equivalent to what would have taken on average five years to build without the transaction, and double that in some markets,"" AT&T notes in its press release. ""The combination will increase AT&T's network density by approximately 30 percent in some of its most populated areas, while avoiding the need to construct additional cell towers."" $39 billion is a lot of money to buy some towers, but because T-Mobile USA utilizes GSM technology (rather than the CDMA technology employed by Verizon), it can immediately use them to boost its network. If the deal is approved, expect AT&T to quickly offload some of its mobile data traffic on T-Mobile's infrastructure. AT&T may be talking a lot about 4G in its press release, but T-Mobile has no LTE technology or infrastructure to offer. No, today's acquisition is all about bolstering AT&T's network and beginning the process of repairing its reputation. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- An explosion in a bus station filled with laborers killed 18 people in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, authorities said Friday. The explosion injured 66 people Thursday night, said Manzo Ezekiel, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency. The workers were on their way home for the May Day holiday when the blast occurred. Ezekiel said it hit about 100 meters from the scene of an April 14 explosion that killed 71 people. In that blast, about 130 people were hurt when a parked vehicle exploded in the Nyanya Motor Park bus station crowded with early morning commuters. Boko Haram's leader claimed responsibility for the April 14 bombing. The Islamist militant group -- whose name means ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language -- has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders.

"(CNN) -- No one wants to spend their vacation in the bathroom. Reports of an outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea at sea have some imminent cruisers worried. ""My mother, who is a first time cruiser, is seriously reconsidering our choice for our family vacation,"" wrote CNN reader Monica Mancera in an e-mail. The University of Texas at Austin student is booked on a Carnival cruise with her family in March. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an outbreak this week of gastrointestinal illness on Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas; the cause has not yet been determined. More than 650 passengers and crew have become ill, according to the cruise line. The outbreak is the second so far this year aboard a cruise ship. Just the thought of wasting precious vacation time has worker-bee bystanders riled up: So glad it's not me! Poor suckers! And cruise skeptics have another opportunity to ask: What were they thinking? ""I feel bad for sick people, but I don't understand the desire to be on the petri dish in the first place,"" wrote one CNN reader. Cruising represents one of travel's deeper divides. Love it or hate it, most of the keenest objections are only half true -- or false, depending on how you look at it. Floating petri dishes? Cruise ships are ripe for spreading illness. Outbreaks of norovirus, the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States, occur most frequently in close quarters, according to the CDC. Nursing homes, dormitories and cruise ships are common transmission grounds. In 2013, the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program logged nine gastroenteritis outbreaks aboard ships, seven of which had a confirmed cause of norovirus. About 1,200 cruise passengers were affected by those norovirus cases. Three of the affected sailings were from U.S. ports, with about 700 passengers sickened, according to Stewart Chiron, CEO of CruiseGuy.com. To put those figures in perspective, the industry's Cruise Lines International Association says more than 10 million passengers embarked on CLIA member cruise ships from a U.S. port in 2012, and norovirus sickens an estimated 21 million people in the United States every year, according to the CDC. More outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been reported aboard cruise ships since 2001, according to CDC statistics. The government agency says the spike is tied to an increase in both passengers and ships sailing the seas as well as an overall increase in norovirus outbreaks. ""There are attempts to control these types of outbreaks, but it's hard to guarantee that it's not going to happen for any particular cruise,"" said Dr. Lin Chen, director of the Travel Medicine Center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts. So yes, the threat of illness is real. Yet the number of reported outbreaks among thousands of annual sailings has ranged in recent years from less than a dozen affected sailings to about three dozen. Bottom line: More people are getting sick on land. (Granted, that's little comfort if you're vomiting violently at sea). Are ships or passengers unsanitary? Norovirus, the most common cruise ship outbreak offender, spreads quickly from person to person but can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water or from contaminated surfaces. The CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program conducts regular unannounced inspections of cruise ships. Explorer of the Seas, the Royal Caribbean ship currently experiencing an outbreak, scored a 98 out of 100 on its last inspection in July 2013. ""Something like this is not representative of an unclean ship,"" said Colleen McDaniel, managing editor of CruiseCritic.com. ""It doesn't mean this particular vessel was unclean. It just means there was an outbreak on board. They're ending the cruise two days early and doing a really deep cleaning of the ship. It's not likely to happen on the same ship again."" Unlikely, but not unheard of: Princess Cruises' Crown Princess had norovirus outbreaks on two consecutive sailings in 2012. In 2010, the CDC issued a four-day no-sail recommendation for a Celebrity Cruises ship after three consecutive outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness. The deep cleaning upon Explorer of the Seas' return to port ""will be the third aggressive sanitizing procedure the ship has undertaken since we became aware of the issue,"" Royal Caribbean said. Cruise lines activate CDC-monitored response plans when outbreaks are detected. Measures include increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfection, isolating ill people, distributing information about proper hand-washing and hygiene as well as illness updates and regular reporting to CDC Vessel Sanitation Program officials. Hygiene is extremely important when outbreaks occur. Proper hand-washing, avoiding contact with ill passengers and direct contact with public surfaces such as restroom door handles can help stem the spread of highly contagious illness. The CDC offers health tips for cruisers on its website. Avid cruiser Marcy Webster and her husband won't be changing their plans for an upcoming sailing on Royal Caribbean's Allure of the Seas. ""It is not the cruise line's fault. It is a passenger who came onboard sick and spread the virus everywhere. On every cruise I have been on, the crew is diligent in keeping things clean and making passengers use hand sanitizer,"" Webster, of Keller, Texas, wrote in an e-mail. ""Bad things happen. If you stop your life for fear of what could be, you never experience anything."" CNN's Katia Hetter contributed to this report.","Some travelers hesitant to cruise due to gastrointestinal illness outbreak aboard ship .

"(CNN) -- A Southwest Airlines plane moving on the ground collided with a JetBlue plane parked at another gate at Boston Logan International Airport Monday morning, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. There were no injuries to Southwest passengers or crew, the airline said in a statement. The JetBlue plane had no passengers or crew on board, according to Real Hamilton-Romeo, spokeswoman for JetBlue. The Southwest plane, a Boeing 737, was being pushed back from a gate and clipped a parked JetBlue Airbus A320, according to a statement from Southwest Airlines. The winglet of the Southwest 737 struck the horizontal stabilizer of the JetBlue A320, according to Matthew Brelis, Director of Media Relations at Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Boston Logan International Airport. Southwest worked to get the 108 passengers scheduled to be on board re-accommodated on other flights to their destination of Kansas City, according to a statement from the airline. A replacement aircraft was later provided for that flight. The Southwest aircraft involved in the incident is out of service for repairs and inspections, the Southwest statement added. Though Brelis said there was no impact to Logan airport operations, both airlines experienced delays. The Southwest flight landed more than five hours later than originally planned. The flight, scheduled to land in Kansas City at about 9:35 a.m. did not land until 2:39 p.m. CT, according to the Southwest website. The JetBlue flight, which was being prepared for boarding, also experienced delays on its way to Chicago, according to JetBlue spokeswoman Hamilton-Romeo. The A320's two subsequent flights were canceled. An FAA official told CNN Monday that the agency will investigate the incident.

"(CNN) -- One of China's controversial ""baby hatches"" has been forced to shut down, at least temporarily. The facility in the southern city of Guangzhou opened in January but has been overwhelmed with abandoned infants, forcing a suspension of services. The first of the facilities opened in 2011 and increased to around 25 hatches countrywide. More of the special rooms, which are equipped with a cradle, incubator and delayed alarm to allow mothers to drop off unwanted babies anonymously, are planned. While abandoning infants in China is illegal, the practice is relatively widespread, especially in poorer areas. The Guangzhou ""baby safety island,"" as they are known in Chinese, has received 262 babies since it began operation in late January, according to Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua. All 262 babies suffer from disabilities or diseases such as cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome and congenital heart disease according to Xinhua. The scheme's proponents argue that the hatches are key to saving the lives of children who would likely die if abandoned on the street. Since its opening, the facility received an average of around five babies a day. The staggering number of infants who have been abandoned in the city has meant that the hatch's operator has not been able to keep up with the volume. The city's Welfare Center for Children has had to add spaces to take their facilities to 1,100 beds, but these are already full. Xu Jiu the center's director told Xinhua that the Guangzhou baby hatch had received a disproportionate number of infants. ""The number of babies we have received is much higher than in other parts of the country over the same period,"" he said. He added that it could be parents who are unable to cope with the heavy economic burden of trying to treat incurable diseases. ""Parents bring their ill babies to big cities in the hope of having them cured. But many just end up abandoning them,"" he said . He was not able to predict a date when normal service would resume, but rather said that the center would focus on the children already in their care. The unprecedented response to the facility's opening is causing some to question the wisdom of the scheme. However, the government appears to be standing by the hatches. Li Liguo, Minister of Civil Affairs, told reporters in the background of the country's annual meeting of parliament this month that they ""do more good than harm.""

"(CNN) -- The death of Tom Sparks, a 33-year-old former TV host from California who was participating as a third-season contestant on ABC's reality show ""Wipeout,"" likely was caused by a pre-existing condition, but the Los Angeles County coroner's office is still examining all possibilities. Sparks died on November 5 of an apparent stroke that his doctors believe was triggered by a pre-existing disease that causes unnatural blood clotting, according to a statement his father released to the Idaho Mountain Express. Sparks previously had worked in radio in Idaho, according to his résumé. An autopsy was conducted on November 8, but test results are still pending. ""There's nothing we can confirm until we look at everything,"" the coroner's office told CNN. ""We don't want to jump to any conclusions yet."" A source close to the production company that produces ""Wipeout"" for ABC said that Sparks began to complain of knee pain while running through the first part of an obstacle course challenge during taping on October 19. Although Sparks was in good spirits, the spokesperson said, producers pulled him from the course. Medics realized he was also experiencing shortness of breath and sent Sparks to a hospital close to ""Wipeout's"" set. Between the day of taping and November 5, Sparks was transferred to Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, California. The Endemol spokesperson said the company requires all participants to undergo a full physical screening, but it's highly unlikely that Sparks' disease -- antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or APS -- could have been detected, and Sparks did not list it as a pre-existing condition. ""We offer our heartfelt condolences to the family,"" ABC and Endemol said in a joint statement. ""This is a tragic loss and our thoughts are with them at this time."" Sparks was survived by his wife, Kate, according to the Idaho Mountain Express. The couple would have celebrated their two-month wedding anniversary on November 6.","Tom Sparks, a 33-year-old Californian, died November 5 of an apparent stroke .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal and state governments should move to a single lethal drug for executions instead of complex cocktails that can be botched, a group of criminal justice experts said in a new review of the death penalty in the United States. The experts also recommended that governments should let the public know more about their processes in carrying out the death penalty. The report comes as the Justice Department conducts a review of federal and state death penalty procedures, including the drugs used, following a botched execution in Oklahoma last week. Documents: Not enough left to finish botched execution . The Constitution Project published the report called ""Irreversible Error,"" the work of bipartisan group of experts, including former elected leaders who oversaw executions, and anti-death penalty activists. The study was already in the works before the failed execution in Oklahoma. The group doesn't take a position on whether the death penalty should be used, but rather suggests ways to improve the system, the Constitution Project says, to ensure it is being carried out fairly. ""Without substantial revisions -- not only to lethal injection, but across the board -- the administration of capital punishment in America is unjust, disproportionate and very likely unconstitutional,"" former Virginia Republican Attorney General Mark Earley, a member of the committee that produced the report, said in a statement. Former Texas Gov. Mark White, a Democrat and death penalty supporter who co-chaired the committee, said in a recent opinion piece in Politico that he regrets airing an election ad in which he boasted of overseeing the executions of 19 people during his time in office. Among its 39 findings, the report warns that executing people convicted of felony murder violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which bans cruel, unusual and excessive punishment for crimes. In some states, someone could be convicted of felony murder without killing or even intending or attempting to kill, the report says. ""Including accidental and non-intentional murderers among the death-eligible creates perverse outcomes â€” those least ""deserving"" of a death sentence can be sentenced to die while premeditated and intentional murderers may avoid capital punishment,"" the report says. The report suggested improving clemency procedures and better access to the courts for defendants on death row. The report also takes on the issue of executing people suffering from mental retardation, which the Supreme Court banned in 2002. Some states, the report says, have overly stringent standards for people to be declared mentally handicapped. The move to a single lethal drug, the report says, would make sure the government is using ""the most scientifically reliable methods to minimize pain and suffering during an execution."" States also should make public what drug is used and allow the public to have input on the process. Currently, some states do not identify the drugs they use for lethal injections. Some manufacturers refuse to allow their drugs for such use. Court rules to keep lethal-drug sources secret .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Saudi Arabia targeting al Qaeda-linked militants have embarked on a large counterterror operation across the country, authorities said Tuesday. Security forces arrested 62 members of a terror cell linked to al Qaeda in Yemen and Syria, Saudi state media reported, citing the Interior Ministry. Police still sought 44 others suspected of involvement with the terror cell, the Saudi Press Agency said. The terror group planned to target installations inside the kingdom with the support of al Qaeda, state-run TV reported. The arrests were made across the country over the past two months, Saudi Interior Ministry spokesman Maj.-Gen. Mansour Al-Turki told CNN. ""This was a very significant counterterror operation and sweep that showcases quite clearly how committed the Saudi government is to combating al Qaeda within its borders and beyond,"" one senior-level Saudi government official told CNN. ""This operation is not over yet."" This source, not authorized to speak to the media, requested anonymity. ""One of the most important aspects of this was focusing on and disrupting support these terrorist cells in the kingdom were giving to al Qaeda-affiliated fighters and cells in Yemen and in Syria,"" the official said. ""As announced, this operation is not over yet -- the Interior Ministry is still on the hunt for dozens of others."" With the exception of a Palestinian, a Yemeni and a Pakistani, those seized were Saudis, Al-Turki said. The raids were not done in conjunction with the counterterror operations staged in Yemen over the past two weeks. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report .","With the exception of a few, most seized are Saudis .

"(CNN) -- ""The Little Sisters do incredible work in the world and this case ... has brought their work to light."" That's NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue on Fox News, discussing (and disputing) the lawsuit brought on behalf of The Little Sisters of the Poor, a religiously affiliated, nonprofit charitable organization challenging the exemption procedures under Obamacare's contraception mandate. And Hogue is right: The sisters, admirably, run nursing homes across the country. But the lawsuit brought in their name at the very least is, as The New York Times editorial board wrote, ""an unjustified attempt by an employer to impose its religious views on workers"" and at worst a wrongheaded co-optation of the notion of religious liberty. Either way, it certainly fits with the ongoing conservative partisan agenda to unravel the Affordable Care Act . The Little Sisters of the Poor order, based in Colorado, is already exempt from Obamacare's requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans cover the cost of contraception without a co-pay as part of ensuring comprehensive preventative health care for women. To claim that exemption, the Little Sisters simply have to sign a short form stating their religious exemption to contraception. That's it. This is not about the nuns having to cover contraception. This is about a piece of paper. In essence, the plaintiffs in the case are arguing, as Amanda Marcotte of Slate has pointed out, that filling out a form is a violation of their religious freedom. Sound a bit far-fetched? Indeed, that's what a federal judge and two appellate courts have already ruled. And yet the case, and the ongoing conservative opposition to the contraception mandate, continues on. Late last month, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor surprisingly gave the nuns a temporary reprieve, blocking the requirement until the merits of the case can be considered . Certainly conservatives aren't pursuing attacking the contraception mandate to win a popularity contest. Data show that 98% of sexually experienced Catholic women of child-bearing age have used a method of contraception other than natural family planning at some point in their lives and that 82% of Catholics -- and 89% of Americans overall -- say that contraception use is morally acceptable. Even so, conservatives grasping for any threads to try and unravel health care reform turned their ire on this portion of the Affordable Care Act . But the administration has already amended the law to address the objections of religious conservatives -- mainly, it should be noted, Catholics, as it was the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that helped lead the push against the contraception mandate. The Obama administration exempted all religious organizations, including churches, from the mandate. And the administration created the exemption for religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations that object to birth control. In signing a simple self-certifying waver, these nonprofits alert their insurance companies or third-party administrator to their objection, and that company then provides contraceptive coverage at no charge to women who work at the nonprofit. The Little Sister's counsel argue that signing the exemption form is still tacitly facilitating the provision of contraception through the nonprofit's insurer. Except it's not. As Michael Hiltzik points out in the Los Angeles Times, ""The sisters' insurer [Christian Brothers Employee Benefits Trust] is also exempt from the mandate, because the health plan isn't governed by ERISA, the federal law under which the mandate is imposed. In other words, signing the form doesn't lead to contraceptive services either."" So one can't help but wonder what's really motivating the lawsuit. The Little Sisters are being represented by a religiously affiliated legal group pushing a broader conservative agenda to dismantle Obamacare. While the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty has pursued a handful of bipartisan cases, the majority of its lawsuits hew to the agenda of the religious right. It's an agenda to which the Becket Fund is tied ideologically and financially, the monitoring organization Political Research Associates has noted. In addition to Catholic Church-affiliated backers, the Becket Fund enjoys major support from ideologically driven conservative foundations, such as the Bradley Foundation, whose other grantees include the Heritage Foundation and the Hudson Institute, partisan institutions leading the conservative fight against Obamacare. Note the Becket Fund is also the source of the attorneys behind the Hobby Lobby case in which a private corporation that willingly opts to receive special, favorable government treatment under that status is nonetheless alleging it should also qualify as a religious entity for purposes of exemption from the health care law's contraception mandate. Here's the thing: No one is saying that the Little Sisters of the Poor should have to pay for contraception for their employees. There's an exemption under Obamacare. For which the nuns qualify. If only they would sign the form. In other words, the law already works for groups like the Little Sisters. They don't want to fund contraception coverage and, under Obamacare, they don't have to. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn .","Sally Kohn: Suit on behalf of Little Sisters of the Poor challenges contraception mandate .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Philadelphia abortion provider who killed babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors was found guilty of first-degree murder on Monday. The conviction on three counts of first-degree murder means Dr. Kermit Gosnell, 72, could be sentenced to death. Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore sobbed after the verdict in the high-profile case was announced. Gosnell appeared shocked. He let out a sigh and shook his head back and forth. Defense attorney Jack McMahon told CNN it's too soon to tell whether he will appeal the conviction. ""We were disappointed. We put on a vigorous defense. We think it went well for us in the courtroom,"" he said. ""But the jury spoke, and we respect the jury's verdict."" Gosnell also was accused in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, 41, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion at his West Philadelphia clinic. In that case, the jury found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Gosnell, who is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist, was also found guilty of 21 counts of abortion of the unborn, 24 weeks or older. In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. Abortion doctor case triggers painful memories for ex-patient . The case next moves to the penalty phase, when jurors will weigh whether to give Gosnell a death sentence. It's possible the doctor will testify, said William Brennan, an attorney who represented Gosnell earlier in the case. ""I would think there would be a lot of mitigation in this case and I think probably, and this is a guess, but probably at that time the jury would hear from Dr. Gosnell,"" he said. Earlier Monday, the jury, after deliberating for two weeks, said it was hung on two counts, and the judge instructed them to continue trying to reach a verdict on them. Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart also told jurors that their progress showed they were ""considering the evidence seriously."" Gosnell's co-defendant, Eileen O'Neill, 56, was found guilty of conspiracy to operate a corrupt organization and two counts of theft by deception for operating without a license to practice medicine. O'Neill, a medical school graduate, was not charged with performing illegal abortions. Both pleaded not guilty. Eight people involved in Gosnell's clinic, called the Women's Medical Society, have pleaded guilty to various charges, including four to murder. The grand jury report from 2011 says the ""people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than Gosnell himself, and not even a single nurse,"" yet they still made diagnoses, performed procedures and administered drugs. McMahon, in an impassioned, 2Â½-hour closing argument, said that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. Gosnell also was accused of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. The remains of aborted fetuses were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer at the clinic, the city's chief medical examiner Sam Gulino testified. Former employee Kareema Cross said Gosnell regularly performed illegal late-term abortions that he routinely recorded as ""24.5 weeks."" McMahon, who called no witnesses, accused prosecutors of ""the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system,"" even adding that they are ""elitist"" and ""racist."" Gosnell has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income, minority women. McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance. During his closing remarks, Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Edward Cameron turned to Gosnell and yelled, ""Are you human?"" Gosnell smirked at Cameron without speaking. Cameron then continued, declaring, ""It's time for us to extinguish the fire he created."" The doctor was first charged in January 2011. The case has drawn national attention and sharp criticism from anti-abortion activists. But that doesn't mean it sets a precedent, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said. ""The testimony in this case was so graphic and so horrific. It was described literally as a house of horrors taking place in this Philadelphia clinic,"" Callan said. ""So I think that most objective observers will say that ultimately this will be an isolated case, hopefully, and that it's simply a case where prosecutors had to act. It had nothing to do with being pro- or anti-abortion."" After Monday's verdict, the leader of one anti-abortion group said justice had been served. ""Even as we celebrate this verdict, we honor and mourn as well those among our nation's weakest children who did not receive 'their day in court' -- and we must remember that Gosnell is not an outlier within the abortion industry,"" Lila Rose, president of Live Action, said in a written statement. ""We cannot allow these 'guilty' verdicts, welcome as they are, to make us complacent when it comes to the continuing abuses happening even now in abortion facilities throughout our nation."" More restrictions on abortions will lead to more cases like the Women's Medical Society, not fewer, abortion rights advocates argue. ""We thought we had said goodbye to back-alley abortionists,"" said Jessica Arons, head of the Women's Health and Rights Program at the Center for American Progress. ""Legal access to abortion helps counteract ""predators"" who ""prey on vulnerable women,"" Arons said. ""It's not that we need more laws or stricter laws,"" she said. ""Pennsylvania just didn't do its job in enforcing the laws against him earlier."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Josh Levs, David Ariosto, Jason Hanna and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Defense attorney: ""The jury spoke and we respect the jury's verdict""

"Beijing and Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- China state media said Google's decision to quit censoring its China Web site ""violated its written promise"" and was ""totally wrong."" In the chess game between Beijing and Google, Google has redirected all search traffic from mainland China to Google's Hong Kong site, google.com.hk rather than pulling out of China. Although Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to Beijing in 1997, the region operates with some autonomy and has a free press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs weighed in on Tuesday, saying Google's moves won't impact Sino-U.S. relations -- despite a raft of editorials in state media over the weekend lambasting Google and accusing the company of having close ties to the Obama administration. China state media step up rhetoric against Google . ""The Google incident is just an individual action taken by one company -- I can't see its impact on Sino-U.S. relations unless someone wants to politicize it,"" said Qin Gang, ministry spokesperson. ""I cannot see its impact on China's international image unless someone wants to make an issue of it,"" Qin added. ""It is not China that has undermined its image but rather it is the Google company itself."" The government wouldn't comment whether Google's actions were legal or if the government planned further action. The next move may be for China to block access to Google.cn -- as it has done for Web sites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Google quits censoring search in China . ""We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision, though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services,"" David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote in a statement posted on the company's official blog. As of 9:30 p.m. ET, Google users in China could still access Google.cn but results on politically sensitive search terms, such as ""Tiananmen Square massacre"" or the outlawed religious group ""Falun Gong,"" were being blocked when searched from Beijing -- suggesting that although Google is no longer self censoring, China state censors of ""the Great Firewall"" may be. Google-China move hurts businesses, academics . A similar search in Hong Kong, however, successfully loads searches for controversial terms. Google indicated yesterday in a blog post that using the Hong Kong site could be patchy or slow due to so much traffic being redirected to its servers there. Google made the announcement on its Web site at 3:03 a.m. local Beijing time (3:03 p.m. ET). China Daily, a state-run media organization, responded with a story four hours later quoting an unnamed official from the Internet bureau under the State Council Information Office. ""Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks,"" said the official. ""This is totally wrong. We're uncompromisingly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues, and express our discontent and indignation to Google for its unreasonable accusations and conducts,"" the official said. Instead of shuttering its operations in China, Google plans to continue operating there. ""We intend to continue R&D work in China and also to maintain a sales presence there, though the size of the sales team will obviously be partially dependent on the ability of mainland Chinese users to access Google.com.hk,"" wrote Drummond of Google. The company on Monday also launched a dashboard page, which it promises to update regularly each day, that will show which Google services are available in China. According to the page, YouTube, Google Sites and Google's Blogger apps were blocked, with some others partially blocked, such as Picasa.

"(CNN) -- She's an acerbic columnist who's made a living lighting up politicians and public figures in the opinion pages of The New York Times, but the only lighting up that Maureen Dowd did for her latest piece was the type typically done by her brethren over at High Times. (OK, fine, her story was about the kind of marijuana that you eat, not smoke, but you get the point. Don't be such a buzz kill.) In her column published Tuesday, Dowd examined Colorado's growing pains with its exploding marijuana industry. Her objective was to point out that for all of the revenue, tourism and cases of munchies that have made it an economic windfall for the state, legalizing pot hasn't been without problems -- she quoted health officials who say hospitals are treating ""growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana,"" and she brought up cases in which overly potent pot candy may have led one man to kill his wife, and another to leap to his death from a hotel balcony. Gauging by the chatter on social media, her point was lost amid the cautionary tale she told. While she was in Denver, she decided to experiment with edible marijuana for the first time. From the sound of it, it will probably be her last. ""I figured if I was reporting on the social revolution rocking Colorado in January ... I should try a taste of legal, edible pot from a local shop"" she wrote. ""What could go wrong with a bite or two? Everything, as it turned out."" Dowd said that after eating pot-infused chocolate-flavored candy, she ""lay curled up in a hallucinatory state"" in her Denver hotel room bed for eight hours, paranoid that a room-service waiter would narc on her. ""I became convinced that I had died and no one was telling me"" she wrote, invoking memories of the Dearborn, Michigan, cop who called 911 to report that he and his wife may have died after consuming pot brownies. That call, which occurred in 2007, went viral at a time before everyone had a Twitter account. That's not the case anymore; Dowd's long, strange trip has been retweeted thousands of times.

"(CNN) -- Companies that made and set up trailers used as emergency housing after Hurricane Katrina have agreed to a nearly $43 million settlement with people who say they were hurt by formaldehyde in the units. The settlement has been submitted to a federal judge in New Orleans, said Gerald Meunier, a lawyer for plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. A hearing has been set for September for final approval, but a preliminary OK could come this week, he said. An estimated 60,000 people are believed eligible for a share of the settlement, he said. As many as 114,000 households were lodged in ""FEMA trailers"" after the disaster, which killed more than 1,700 people when it struck near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line in August 2005. More trailers were deployed after Hurricane Rita, which struck southwestern Louisiana and southeast Texas a month later. But as CNN first reported in 2007, the units -- built originally as campers -- led to widespread complaints that high levels of formaldehyde were causing respiratory ailments and irritation for those living in them. Formaldehyde is an industrial chemical that is linked to nasal cancer, respiratory problems and leukemia. It was used to make particle board and plywood in the campers, which the government later banned for long-term housing. More than $37 million of the settlement will come from seven companies that made travel trailers that the Federal Emergency Management Agency deployed across the hurricane-stricken Gulf Coast after Katrina, Meunier said. The amount is a significant extension of a preliminary deal struck in April, which involved fewer manufacturers, he said. The remainder of the settlement will come from contractors who installed the units, Meunier said. A lawyer for the manufacturers and contractors declined comment on the settlement Wednesday. Six smaller manufacturers have already agreed to separate settlements, most of which remain under seal. Another settlement, in 2011, saw mobile-home builders paying more than $2.6 million over the claims. The amount each plaintiff receives will depend on how many people participate, a number Meunier said can't be calculated at this time. Lawyers who represented them will receive a portion of the settlement -- to be determined by the court -- as payment, he said. CNN's Matt Smith and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","An estimated 60,000 people could share in the settlement, a lawyer says .

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. The Cleveland Clinic is consistently among the country's best in quality ratings, and its costs are among the lowest. CLEVELAND, Ohio (CNN) -- As he walks the halls of the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Steven Nissen makes the next generation of health care in America sound quite simple. ""Everything that we do is done with the patient at the center of the picture, not the doctor at the center,"" Nissen says as he takes a visitor on a tour of the clinic's world-renowned cardiac center. The clinic is consistently among the country's best in quality ratings, and its costs are among the lowest -- which is why President Obama often cites the Cleveland Clinic as an example of how health care in America should be, and why Nissen and other leading doctors here are frequently consulted by lawmakers and administration officials pushing major reforms this year. Nissen says the clinic's organizational structure -- and its pay structure -- are what make it different. Go inside the Cleveland Clinic on State of the Union with John King, 9 a.m. ET, Sunday. The traditional model is for the nonsurgeons and surgeons to be organized in separate groups --- imagine a Department of Medicine and a Department of Surgery. The cardiologist works in the former, the cardiac surgeon in the latter. Add in a financial model where doctors are paid on a ""fee-for-service"" basis. ""Everyone wants to do their procedure,"" is how Nissen explains the most frequent result. ""One of the things we say in medicine is, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. ""And so if you are a cardiologist you want to do your procedures, if you are a surgeon you want to do your procedures and frankly people sometimes end up getting multiple procedures when a single collaborative procedure would have actually solved the problem. One of the ways you facilitate collaboration is you take the issue of personal income out of the equation."" At the Cleveland Clinic, Nissen and other doctors are paid a fixed salary. ""I get the same check at the end of the month whether I do a thousand procedures or one,"" he said. ""And so I'm not incentivized to do more than what is necessary to help the patient. We all get the same check, whether we do an operation or an angioplasty. So we have taken that issue of income out of the equation."" As a result, Nissen says cardiologists and surgeons share notes and ideas -- and work together to give the patient the best care -- and to emphasize choices that help prevent major procedures and surgeries. The clinic staff tries to set an example: Yoga classes on the roof; exercise facilities; healthier choices in both the staff and public cafeteria; walking routes in the halls and on the grounds; a policy that forbids hiring smokers. So far, CEO Dr. Toby Cosgrove says the staff has lost a combined 75,000 pounds -- an emphasis on wellness that he says will without a doubt lower the hospital's own health care costs. ""Seventy percent of the cost in health care is from chronic disease,"" Cosgrove told us in an interview at his Cleveland Clinic office. ""And chronic diseases come from really three big things -- from obesity, from lack of exercise and from smoking. And it also results in 40 percent of the premature deaths in the United States. So we have to do something as a nation to begin to deal with all those."" Cosgrove, like Nissen, is an enthusiastic proponent of major national health care reforms that bring coverage to the estimated 45 to 50 million Americans who lack health insurance and that put an emphasis on primary and preventive care. ""We believe that the government ought to incentivize quality,"" Nissen said. ""If you can do a better job and you can prove you are doing a better job, then you ought to be paid better. And if you are not doing a good job, then you ought to be paid less."" Cosgrove, however, does sound some cautionary notes as the key committees in Congress set about the difficult business of writing legislation. Paying for reforms is a dicey political proposition, and mindful of campaign promises not to add to the tax burden on middle class families, Obama has insisted that a major chunk of the money needed to pay for reforms can be found in ""cost savings"" in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Cosgrove said there is without a doubt ample waste in those programs. But he warns any savings need to be arrived at carefully. ""If you begin to take money away, my concern is that you begin to drive quality down,"" he said. ""The first thing that you will begin to see happening is a deferment in investment in infrastructure. A classic example of this is what happened to the national health system in England. I mean they didn't invest in their infrastructure for 50 years. And now a lot of hospitals in England are 100 years old and way behind."" Again, Cosgrove is emphatic that there are substantial cost savings in federal health programs that can be achieved over time. But he says a rush to squeeze savings from federal programs could cause a shock to a fragile delivery system. ""The concern right now is 50 percent of the hospitals in the United States are running in the red,"" he said. ""So if you begin to look at reducing the amount of money coming into hospitals to look after patients, I think you are beginning to look at a failure of a group of hospitals."" Cleveland Clinic is among the trailblazers in electronic record keeping and interaction with patients. Many leave the clinic with home devices to test heart rate, blood sugar levels and blood pressure that automatically use wireless transmission to send the results to a home computer and then on to the clinic. Doctors say the impact on the quality of care is nothing short of astounding -- a dangerous reading results in an urgent alert e-mail to the doctor and his staff, and that time is precious in altering approaches to, say, keep blood pressure under control and avoid escalation to a more serious -- and more expensive -- medical episode. Doctors say patients who know their physicians are getting frequent updates on their vital signs often are more likely to stick to their diet or take their medications properly. Obama's stimulus legislation included funding for an expansion of electronic record keeping, and he has held up the practice as a revolutionary way to improve quality and cut costs. In another cautionary note, Cosgrove, however, said over time he believes widespread electronic record keeping -- and sharing -- will lead to fewer duplicative tests and other cost savings, but that the jury is still out on that question. ""What we've seen is our quality's gone up -- substantially,"" Cosgrove said. ""What we haven't seen is our costs come down. It's like the difference between an abacus and a cash register. Clearly the cash register is better, gives you a better record. But it isn't cheaper.""","President Obama often cites clinic as example of how health care should be .

"(CNN) -- Hidden high among the forested volcanoes of central Africa, the mountain gorilla was unknown to science until 1902, when two were first encountered by a German explorer -- and promptly killed. It set the tone for the relationship. For much of the time since, due to deforestation and poaching, it has seemed the mountain gorilla was swiftly destined to be lost to the world again. Not long after the species' greatest champion, the American zoologist Dian Fossey, was killed in Rwanda in 1985, there were fewer than 300 of the giant primates left in the wild. These days, however, while the species remains endangered, their numbers have grown to nearly 800. This is due to the efforts of conservationists such as those working in Volcanoes National Park, in northwest Rwanda, where Fossey established a research center which continues to run in her name today. Efforts to change attitudes towards the mighty animals have seen them become an important source of income for the local economy through the tourists they bring, and turned poachers into vocal advocates for conservation. The world's largest mountain gorilla population, thought to number less than 500 animals, is found in a mountainous region known as the Virungas, incorporating Volcanoes, Uganda's Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, and Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A second, smaller population can be found in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, in another region of Uganda. See also: Rwanda's conservation king . The Karisoke Research Center, operated by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and located in Volcanoes National Park, is the world's most important facility for studying the mountain gorilla. Veronica Vecellio, its gorilla program coordinator, said she developed the desire to work in her field after seeing ""Gorillas in the Mist,"" the 1988 film which popularized Fossey's story. ""Studying Dian Fossey, it's really clear how one person can really make the difference,"" said Vecellio. ""It's what inspired me."" Staff at Karisoke, which have observed the animals for more than 40 years, study the behavior of 10 groups of gorillas -- including those initially named and studied by Fossey, and their offspring. Vecellio said the center focused on new research topics every year -- it had been able to learn, for example, that the life expectancy of a mountain gorilla was 35 years, as the animals had been under observation for their entire lifespan. Fossey had believed in preserving the gorillas' isolation by keeping tourists away. But today the tourism generated by the gorillas is essential to the local economy, and the organization that carries Fossey's name is in favor of the visitors. ""It's thanks (to) gorilla tourism that the gorillas are so well protected here in Rwanda,"" said Vecellio. ""I'm sure that if she was still there now, she would just appreciate the fact that thanks to the tourists, the gorilla (gets) to be alive. Before it was her keeping the gorillas alive, and now it's the tourism."" Fossey was found murdered in her cabin in the Virunga Mountains in 1985, and is buried in the park. Her killer has never been found. See also: Central African gorillas may go extinct . Mountain gorillas are not frequently hunted for their meat, but can be maimed or killed by poachers leaving traps or snares for other animals. They have also been killed for their body parts to be sold to collectors. Francois Ndungutse grew up in the area and used to hunt in the park. The former poacher says the last animal he killed was about eight years ago -- these days he urges people to protect the park's animals as part of their livelihood. ""We used to live near this volcanic park, depending on it,"" he said. ""At that time, we were very poor ... we were relying on the park to get the meat."" He said he and fellow poachers were persuaded to change their ways due to education programs from government agencies. ""In order to stop all this ... poaching, deforestation or any other illegal activities, it was a combined effort of the former Rwanda National Parks and Tourism Office and the current Rwanda Development Board (RDB),"" he said. ""The RDB met us and gave us a plan of action and showed us how we can live without poaching in the parks."" Vecellio said one of the amazing things about studying mountain gorillas was how close the primates let observers come to them, compared to other species she had studied. ""I started with western lowland gorillas, and the top distance was 50 meters to have them doing their activities,"" she said. ""But here you can approach a gorilla very close, and they ignore your presence ... you can be there and just be a natural part of the forest and collect your data.""","There are only 800 mountain gorillas, found across two habitats in central Africa .

"Dallas (CNN) -- Five decades after it served as the backdrop for a nation's grief and disbelief, Dallas' Dealey Plaza took center stage once again Friday as Americans commemorated the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. ""A new era dawned and another waned a half century ago when hope and hatred collided right here in Dallas,"" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said in his remarks commemorating Kennedy's death. Rawlings then read the final words of the speech Kennedy was to deliver that day. That was followed by a moment of silence at 12:30 p.m., the time Kennedy was shot a few feet from where Rawlings spoke. Bells tolled, and after a brief pause, cadets from the Naval Academy sang ""America the Beautiful."" Historian David McCullough read excerpts from famous Kennedy speeches. Some 5,000 invited guests were expected to attend the commemorative events, which was bookended by bagpipers -- a JFK favorite -- playing under a spitting gray sky. The tightly choreographed and secured event was the culmination of a series of commemorations Friday, including wreath-laying events in Kennedy's home town of Boston and at his Arlington National Cemetery gravesite. In Washington, where flags flew at half-staff over the Capitol and White House, Kennedy's last living sibling, Jean Kennedy Smith, participated in the Arlington wreath-laying. Earlier, Attorney General Eric Holder visited the gravesite. And in the House of Representatives, where Kennedy served from 1947 to 1953, the Rev. John Robert Skeldon of Fort Worth, Texas, reminded lawmakers in his opening prayers that ""in commemorating such a one whose life and presidency were cut short, we do so not to sow in tears, as the psalmist says, but rather to reap with shouts of joy."" ""Help us, Lord God, to make the late President's inaugural vision our own so that together as fellow Americans we may 'ask not what our country can do for us, but rather what we can do for our country,'"" Skeldon prayed, invoking Kennedy's famous words. The Dallas event was designed to be a delicate balancing act of honoring Kennedy's memory without sensationalizing his murder, and to help the city throw off its reputation as ""the city that killed Kennedy."" It opened with a video from an organizer speaking of that goal, and continued in Rawlings remarks, which keyed off Kennedy's call for the United States to embrace and conquer a ""New Frontier"" of challenges . The mayor spoke of a Dallas that took up the mantle of Kennedy's challenge of American betterment and transformed itself with a ""sense of industry born of tragedy"" into a city that he hopes would make the president proud. ""He and our city will forever be linked, in tragedy, yes,"" Rawlings said. ""But out of that tragedy, an opportunity was granted to us: the chance to learn how to face the future when it's the darkest and most uncertain, how to hold high the torch even when the flame flickers and threatens to go out."" Boy who witnessed JFK assassination recalls the day . JFK assassination a collective memory for American children . A new JFK monument also was unveiled, in the infamous section of land known as the ""grassy knoll."" The inscription on the monument is the final paragraph of the speech JFK intended to deliver at the Dallas Trade Mart on November 22, 1963: . ""We in this country, in this generation, are --- by destiny rather than choice --- the watchmen on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our power and responsibility, that we may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint, and that we may achieve in our time and for all time the ancient vision of ""peace on earth, good will toward men."" That must always be our goal, and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. For as was written long ago, ""except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."" Is there more to the JFK assassination? Other Dallas events . Conspiracy theorists, who have typically gathered on the plaza on each anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, were barred from the plaza. Instead, The Dallas Morning News reported, the group planned to hold an event at the nearby JFK memorial, and then move to Dealey Plaza after the main event was over. Demonstrators gathered at Dealey Plaza on Thursday, and many chanted: ""No more lies. No more lies."" The remarkable Sixth Floor Museum, which chronicles the Kennedy assassination, was set to open from 3 to 8 p.m. CT. Parkland Hospital, where Kennedy died, planned a brief morning ceremony, where the flag will be lowered to half-staff. Also in Dallas on Friday, a candlelight vigil for J.D. Tippit was set for 6 p.m. at the site where the 39-year-old Dallas police officer was shot. ""I think the remembrance of him calls attention to all of the officers killed in the line of duty. We should remember those who have given their lives for our city,"" Marie Tippit, who had been married to the officer for 17 years, told the Los Angeles Times this week. She told the paper she will also attend the ceremony at Dealey Plaza. 5 things you might not know about JFK's assassination . Finally, the Texas Theatre, where Lee Harvey Oswald was apprehended by police, was to screen part of the movie ""War Is Hell,"" the film that was showing when Oswald slipped into the audience without paying. Commemorations elsewhere . 50 years later, Jackie Kennedy's pink suit locked away from view . The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston asked visitors to gather to watch a video musical tribute to the President that includes James Taylor. A moment of silence was held at 2 p.m. ET, the time when a doctor approximated Kennedy died. Moments of silence were also planned at various other locations around the nation. And online, a handful of Twitter accounts focused on recreating Kennedy's movements that fateful day, culminating in breaking accounts of the aftermath of the shooting.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN)  -- The bodies of a 22-month-old girl and her mother have been recovered from the rubble of the I-35W bridge collapse, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office said Friday. The remains were found Thursday. Hana Sahal was in a car with her mother, Sadiya Sahal, 22 -- a nursing student from Somalia -- when it plunged into the Mississippi River, said Omar Jamal, a spokesman for the family.  See photos of victims of the collapse » . Sadiya Sahal died of blunt-force and penetrating abdominal injuries. Hana, the only child believed to be a casualty of the disaster, died of blunt-force head injuries, according to the county medical examiner's Web site. Authorities informed Sahal's family Thursday that the child had died, said Jamal, director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center. The family was told Friday that Sadiya Sahal's body was identified. Funerals for both are planned for Saturday, Jamal said Friday night. Sadiya Sahal was five months pregnant, he said. Divers on Friday pulled more human remains from the river, but the Hennepin County sheriff's office did not specify whether the remains represented one body or more. The discovery of another victim would mean at least nine people were killed when the bridge fell six stories into the Mississippi during the evening rush hour on August 1. The medical examiner's office still listed eight victims on its Web site, however, and said that as of Friday evening, all remains found had been identified. Other victims may still be trapped in the rubble.  Watch 'traffic cam' video of the chaos moments after the bridge collapse » . Federal officials investigating the disaster said Friday an aerial photo made before the bridge collapsed shows where construction equipment was placed on the structure and could help investigators determine why the bridge fell. ""This gives us an outstanding depiction of what, in fact, was on the bridge as it relates to the loads that were provided by the construction company: the equipment, the positioning of the equipment, where the loads were. All of that data will be put into our ... computer model,"" Mark Rosenker, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Friday. Part of the investigation is focusing on construction work on the bridge before it fell. Crews were using heavy equipment to resurface parts of the deck and make other repairs. The eight-lane bridge was down to two lanes to accommodate the work.  See a diagram of the bridge's structure » . The I-35W bridge was classified as ""structurally deficient"" by state bridge inspectors for at least 17 years. U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said Friday that Minnesota will receive an advance of $50 million in federal emergency relief for debris removal and other operations in preparation for reconstruction. The money is an advance on the $250 million Congress authorized before its August recess began. Congress must pass legislation to appropriate the $250 million before it can be released, Peters said. The state also received $5 million in emergency aid the morning after the disaster, and $5 million was secured by Minnesota's congressional delegation to set up alternative transportation options for motorists.

"(CNN) -- The mother whose toddler died in a hot car near Atlanta last month says she finds comfort in faith but struggles to get through each day. ""Leanna Harris is living every parent's nightmare -- the child she bore and loved every moment of his life has died. For most parents, it is difficult, if not impossible, to comprehend such a thing. ""But for Leanna, that nightmare is all too real. She will never again be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him,"" her attorney said Tuesday in a statement. The statement marked the first time Leanna Harris has publicly described her feelings since she made remarks at the funeral for her 22-month-old son, Cooper. His death in a hot car tapped parents' outrage, garnered national headlines, and sparked a wide-ranging debate about whether more can be done to prevent such deaths. ""She mourns Cooper's death deeply, in her own private way. She takes comfort from a strong faith in God, but the loss is still overwhelming. Getting through each day seems almost impossible,"" said Harris' attorney, Lawrence Zimmerman. He asked for privacy for his client, comparing her situation to that of vindicated Atlanta Olympic park bombing suspect Richard Jewell. ""She asks that she be allowed to grieve in private without reporters calling, following or watching her home. Since his death, she has been unable to have that time of mourning that every bereaved parent needs. Please allow her the dignity to mourn her son in private,"" Zimmerman wrote. 'Constant speculation and innuendo' Police say Leanna Harris' husband, Justin Ross Harris, left Cooper strapped into a car seat in his SUV for seven hours while he went to work on June 18. Records show that the mercury topped 92 that day, and police say the temperature was 88 degrees when the boy was pronounced dead in a parking lot not far from his father's workplace. Ross Harris has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and child cruelty. He remains in jail. Leanna Harris is not a suspect, although police have alleged she behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her boy. For example, Ross and Leanna Harris took turns dropping off and picking up their son at day care, and on the day Cooper died, Leanna arrived and was told that Cooper hadn't been dropped off that morning. ""Ross must have left him in the car,"" she allegedly told day-care employees. The day-care workers told police they tried to tell her that there could be a multitude of reasons that Cooper wasn't dropped off, but she insisted that Ross left him in the vehicle, Cobb County police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at a hearing for Ross Harris. He also said that Leanna Harris made an odd remark to her husband while the two were in an interview room after Ross Harris' arrest. ""She asked him -- she had him sit down, and he starts going through this. And she looks at him, and she's like, 'Well, did you say too much?' "" the detective testified. Leanna Harris' attorney did not address those specific allegations in his statement, but warned against jumping to conclusions. ""Reporters have delved into Leanna's upbringing, her employment, quizzed people for information about her marriage, and her sex life. The constant attention has prevented her from returning to work,"" Zimmerman wrote. ""Dealing with her grief has become more difficult as the days go on, however, in large part because of the constant speculation and innuendo in the media. Newspapers, television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in which Leanna's every word, action and emotion -- or failure to cry in front of a crowd -- is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning."" 'I miss him with all of my heart' Leanna Harris told CNN at the beginning of the investigation that a lawyer had advised her not to speak to the media, so not much is known about her. She did not testify at her husband's probable cause hearing, but arrived before the proceeding began and took a seat with family members, holding hands with the woman sitting next to her. She did speak at her son's funeral. She told mourners in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, that before Cooper's birth, she was concerned ""about never being able to have a child."" Leanna Harris described the toddler as perfect and told how he changed her and her husband's lives. ""As children do, he turned our lives upside-down,"" she said. ""Cleaning, changing diapers, dinner, bath time. Finally, what I would call mommy time. I wouldn't trade it for the world."" Leanna Harris said Cooper had had trouble sleeping of late, and he had slept with her and her husband the two nights before he died, ""snuggling in between both of us."" ""I remember turning over in the middle of the night. His mouth was open and his full toddler lips just breathing right into my face. I will cherish that moment forever."" She said she was ""happy"" that Cooper would miss some of life's letdowns, including his first heartbreak, his parents' and grandparents' deaths and who to sit with at lunch at middle school. ""I miss him with all of my heart. Would I bring him back? No. To bring him back into this broken world would be selfish,"" she said. The mother closed by saying that she wasn't angry with her husband and that Cooper ""meant the world"" to Ross, whom she described as a ""wonderful daddy.""

"(CNN) -- This was not in the script. In a season where Real Madrid has appeared irrepressible at times, a 1-1 draw against relegation-threatened Valladolid was not what manager Carol Ancelotti might have anticipated. A ninth minute injury to Cristiano Ronaldo, making him doubtful for this weekend's game against Celta Vigo and perhaps even the Champions League final, merely rubbed salt into the wounds. Ronaldo appeared to leave the field as a precautionary measure with a hamstring strain before his teammates were forced to settle for a frustrating point against a resilient Valladolid. The result leaves Real four points adrift of leader Atletico, who face Malaga on Sunday before a final day showdown with Barcelona. ""It is practically gone now but while there is a mathematical chance then Madrid are obliged to keep going,"" goalscorer Sergio Ramos told reporters. ""It has been a long season and it takes its toll on the body. ""We wasted a unique opportunity and we will now have to examine it calmly. With 10 minutes to go we relaxed, and against a side battling for survival, they are always going to make it difficult for you,"" The title is now surely between leader Atletico Madrid and second place Barcelona. Should Barcelona defeat Elche, it will need to see off Atletico at Camp Nou to claim the title. Real, which began the contest without the injured Gareth Bale, adjusted to the loss of Ronaldo and moved ahead 10 minutes before the break. Ramos, who has scored five goals in his past four games, unleashed a fine free-kick from 25-yards which flew into the net. The home side, which has struggled throughout the season for goals, improved after the interval and slowly took the initiative. And it came as little surprise when Humberto Osorio headed home Marc Valiente's corner with five minutes of normal time remaining. The loss of Ronaldo, who has scored 31 league goals this season and 50 in all competitions, will be of greatest concern to Ancelotti. Real faces Atletico in the Champions League final on May 24 in Lisbon and will be keeping a close eye on the Portugal midfielder over the next week. Anceloitti's side, which takes on Celta Vigo in its next match, finishes the campaign at home to Espanyol on May 18.","Cristiano Ronaldo limps off during Real Madrid's draw at Valladolid .

"(CNN) -- A series of gold-framed pictures cover the wall from left to right inside the working space of Senegalese human rights activist Bineta Diop. Nelson Mandela, Paul Kagame, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Yasser Arafat -- they're all here. This is Diop's wall of memories, reminders of meetings and accomplishments over the years. ""You meet them and you have to discuss and still you know you want to convince them that they need to do more on the issue of protection, on the issue of promotion and women leadership,"" says Diop, who's met a myriad of politicians and dignitaries throughout her career in human rights. As the founder of Femme Africa Solidarity (FAS), a women's empowerment organization, Diop has been leading women-led peace building in the most fragile regions of Africa, including countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan and the Central African Republic. She says her mission to promote gender equality on the continent is worth the risk. ""We, Africa women, realize that our continent was torn about by conflict -- we realized that women was used as weapons of war, rape was used as weapon of war, the body of women was used in the battlefield and we said, 'We need to do something for this and nobody can do it for us but ourselves,"" Diop explains to CNN. Having founded FAS in 1996, Diop has also been striving for stronger policies for women and for an increase in the number of female politicians in governments. It's a demanding role, one that requires the activists to live out of a suitcase. Recalling a recent typical week, Diop, who is also the Special Envoy for Women, Peace and Security of the African Union, says: ""I was in Addis. From Addis I went in South Africa and I went to Mozambique to meet the president of Mozambique. The day after I was back to Dakar. Two days after I was back to Geneva and I traveled to New York for one day. I came in the morning, I left the next day in the evening. I went back to Geneva, go to Paris and then came back to Senegal. So it's a life of crazy."" Over the years, Diop has led numerous on-the-ground campaigns for gender parity while trying to make sure women play a leading role in African development. ""We look at peace and security like a male-dominated structure and we say we need to dismantle it. Dismantle it and bring women's voices and their contributions,"" she says. ""I always say military knows how to wage war but women also know how to wage the war to bring peace without guns."" Diop, whose efforts for peace in Africa were recognized internationally in 2011 when TIME magazine named her in their annual list of 100 most influential people in the world, started her mission close to home focusing on conflict resolution during election periods by assembling her own ""women's situation room."" Diop's three-prong strategy starts with mobilizing women from all different walks of life. ""Second, we mediate among the different political parties that was coming into conflict, through the women. And the third was the monitoring of the election -- to say let's get the result from the ballot, not the bullets."" She adds: ""That's why Senegal now have, almost 50% of women in parliament to make a difference."" Also contributing to an increase of women in Senegalese National Assembly is the Parity Law -- which requires all political entities to put forward an equal number of men and women candidates -- passed into legislation in 2010. Eighteen years since the group's inception, Diop says she's proud of the gains made for women on the continent -- but adds that there's still more work to be done. ""It's coming, we are having Africa women heads of state,"" she says. ""We have three now. But also we see in politics, no more are we saying women cannot be president or women cannot be prime minister, women cannot be ministers in politics. But we still have few women billionaires. We have millionaires but few billionaires. So that glass ceiling in economics, we also need to break it. ""We are getting there. Africa is moving, the gender evolution is there. It's coming but we need to double our efforts."" READ THIS: Africa is rising, but for whom?

"(CNN) -- Cyprus has beaches to stretch out on, ruins to wander and an authentic cheese to chew on. It's the island of love, or lust -- depending on whether you're an Aphrodite or Agia Napa fan. But it's suited to calmer pleasures, too. You can search for its elusive sheep, explore monasteries and mountains or drink an ancient wine. 1. It's the original island of love . Cypriot legend claims Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, was born and rose from the foam (""afros,"" in Greek) near a rock off what's now Aphrodite's Beach. Waves breaking over the rock create pillars of foam that islanders say look just like the goddess herself. However, the place name in Greek, Petra tou Romiou (Rock of the Greeks), has nothing to do with Aphrodite. It's associated with Greek hero Digenis Akritas, who threw huge rocks at his enemies. Those that missed landed in the sea -- and became tourist attractions. 2. A whole town has World Heritage status . Cyprus is a small island with a vast amount of history. At the end of a stream of souvenir shops in Paphos you'll find an archaeological site dating to the 4th century BC. But that isn't what makes Paphos historically unique -- the remains of ancient tombs, fortresses and palaces have made the whole town a Unesco World Heritage Site. Paphos is a top international treasure. 3. It has the world's oldest wine label . To be exact, the Cypriot dessert wine commandaria is recognized as the world's oldest named wine. Knight crusaders are thought to have named it in the 13th century, but it may have been made for 5,000 years. King Richard the Lionheart of England is said to have been so taken with commandaria that at his wedding he pronounced it ""the wine of kings and the king of wines."" Produced in the fertile high-altitude slopes in the southwest of Cyprus, it has a sweet, herby taste that evokes the island's aromas. More: 11 places to go in 2014 . 4. Carnival is a Dionysian blend . Carnival in Cyprus is a unique blend of ancient Greek and later traditions. It's believed to have begun under Venetian rule in the 16th century, involving masked balls and fancy dress. Earlier celebrations of Dionysus probably lent it a wild edge. In recent times it's been held in the days preceding Lent and is mainly associated with the city of Limassol. It retains an untamed spirit, kicking off with the gaudily dressed Carnival King riding through town on his carriage. 5. The ancient tombs are rock solid . The Tombs of the Kings are Paphos's main tourist attraction and an important reasons for the site's World Heritage listing. Called ""monumental"" and ""magnificent"" by the UN, the 4th-century-BC resting places are carved from solid rock, complete with Doric pillars. They're unique in Cyprus because of their peristyle court structure, influenced by Egyptian architecture. In layman's terms, this means they were built like courtyards with colonnades and roofs. The ancient Egyptians believed the tombs of the dead should resemble the houses of the living. Despite the name, no kings are actually buried here -- only members of high society. The tombs got their name because of their grand appearance. 6. Its national symbol is a (very shy) sheep . It's the national symbol, but you may never see it. Cyprus's mouflon is one shy sheep. It was once considered vermin, so you can't entirely blame hunters for its demise. By the 1930s there were only 15 mouflon, technically a subspecies of wild sheep, left on the island. But conservation programs mean there are now thousands -- somewhere. A couple of small herds are kept under protection. One is at Stavros tis Psorkas on the west side of the Troodos mountains -- but, even here, the animals keep a low profile. 7. Cyprus haloumi is the real deal . Eat it raw and it squeaks in your teeth, grill or fry it and it's crispy and gooey -- haloumi cheese is served almost everywhere on Cyprus. It's typically made from goat's or sheep's milk -- sometimes both -- that's been soaked in brine and mint. Many Cypriot families make it themselves. The United States and the EU have recognized haloumi as a traditional Cypriot product, so officially haloumi is only haloumi if it's made in Cyprus. 8. The Roman mosaics are among the world's best . Discovered by accident in 1962, Paphos's mosaics once decorated the houses of the island's most wealthy Roman colonists. Described by the UN as ""extremely rare and rank(ing) among the best examples in the world,"" they show great artistic skill but also tell compelling stories. The Four Seasons mosaic in the House of Dionysus (the god of wine) shows winter as a gray-haired old man warming himself up with a drop of vino. 9. The diving is world class . Cyprus has one of the world's widely acknowledged top 10 wreck diving sites. It's the wreck of the Zenobia, off the coast of Larnaca. The cargo ship sunk in the 1980s and is still largely intact, with carpets and vending machines rotting on her decks. It's said the owners never claimed on the insurance. Barracuda and tuna have now made it their home. 10. Hankies have manifold powers . Tie a handkerchief to a tree and who knows what might happen? Islanders say infertile women can bear children, lost husbands return and family feuds be resolved. A tree at the entrance to the Christian catacombs in Paphos shows ample evidence of this apparently pagan practice. It's adorned with handkerchiefs, ribbons and votive rags. It's said if you want your lover to come back to you, attach something that was once his or hers -- even a sock -- to increase your chances.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- When the Japanese business community talks about the incredible bounce back of Japan's supply chain, the name Renesas Electronics is usually on the tip of their tongues. You can see why. Their factory in the city of Naka is humming with life today, showing little signs of the devastation it suffered following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago. The remarkable part of Renesas' success story is not that it was achieved, but that the full recovery of its plant happened months ahead of schedule. ""I was wondering if this sterile room or this factory would ever be the same again,"" said Naka Plant general manager Takashi Aoyagi, pointing out the immaculate, sterilized production floor where the company's microchips are manufactured. Aoyagi was at the plant when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck on March 11, creating a force so powerful that he was thrown across a room with the furniture. Ceilings caved in, computers cracked and critical air filters were jammed with dust -- Renesas' computer chips rely on sterile, dust-free conditions for production. Aoyagi was looking at a clean-up operation unprecedented in the firm's history. The worldwide auto industry was also looking at an unprecedented problem because of the damage to this one plant. When 70% of all drivers in the world start their cars, the microchip inside the vehicle's computer whirls to life. This computer chip is essential to the car's functionality, though most vehicle owners have no idea of its existence or that it traces back to Renesas Electronics. Drivers may still not know the name Renesas, but automakers got a jarring lesson in the importance of the company's role in the car parts supply chain. The auto industry began to raise the alarm shortly after the earthquake -- production lines around the globe could grind to a halt without a rapid recovery at Renesas. The company, with its highly specialized technology, had forged a relationship with so many car manufacturers that the bulk of the industry relied on its microchip. New auto sales plummeted 37% after disaster . ""You have people outside of Japan who relied on most of components outside of Japan to not source from other countries. Thinking before, Japan would have been a very reliable source. Now understanding that it's not the case, even for Japan,"" said William Saito, a council member on national strategy and policy for Japan's government. Automakers like Nissan say they learned that lesson and have diversified their supply chain. What that means for companies like Renesas Electronics is the company is looking at more competition and a demand for reductions from its buyers. Renesas' president, Yasushi Akao, said the lessons of the supply chain break is another hurdle for Japanese companies, which already face economic headwinds of the strong yen and high production costs in Japan. But he believes his company can survive and even thrive amid the global economic pressure. ""I really believe it's part of our company's power,"" he said. Akao points to the remarkable weeks after the quake. Thousands of workers descended on the Naka factory, working without electricity or running water in sub zero, winter weather. Half of the people working on rebuilding the company were volunteers from Renesas' customers and partners. ""They never complained,"" recalled plant manager Aoyagi, who still gets emotional thinking about the massive effort. He said the workers and volunteers organized themselves and even found ways to find water and food on their own, while focusing on getting the company back to pre-quake status. He admits his company is facing new pressures and will have to deal with them, despite the fact that the Naka factory is a shining example of the supply chain's rebound. But he believes his company can do it. Aoyagi then paused and looked out at the sterile production room, busy with the massive orders from his customers around the world. He has recent history as proof of what determination can do.","Renesas Electronics, which makes microchips, suffered huge amount of damage .

"(CNN) -- A judge sentenced a self-help expert to a total of two years in prison Friday for his role in the deaths of three people in a 2009 sweat lodge ceremony in the Arizona desert. Prosecutors had sought consecutive three-year sentences for James Arthur Ray on each of the three counts of negligent homicide on which a jury convicted him. The judge instead imposed three two-year terms, to be served concurrently. Ray and his attorneys asked for probation, but Judge Warren R. Darrow said the evidence shows ""extreme negligence on the part of Mr. Ray."" ""A prison sentence is just mandated in this case,"" he said. During the trial, prosecutors argued that Ray's recklessness caused the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota. At least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. The lodge, made of willow trees and branches and covered with tarpaulins and blankets, was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke, prosecutors alleged. They also said Ray didn't monitor the temperature inside the lodge or the well-being of participants and was indifferent to those having trouble. Ray's lawyers countered that the deaths were the result of a tragic accident, not a crime. They asked witnesses who were in the sweat lodge whether they signed a release form warning them of the dangers. All replied that they signed, but some said they didn't read the form. Ray's attorneys also suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide, rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the deaths. Ray tearfully told the court that he has ""no excuse"" for what happened that October day or since. ""At the end of the day, I lost three friends, and I lost them on my watch,"" he said. ""And whatever errors in judgment or mistakes I made, I'm going to have to live with those for the rest of my life."" Ray asked Darrow to sentence him to probation, saying he is no threat to society and promising never to conduct another sweat lodge ceremony again. ""It pains me beyond belief to be here today, with the best of intentions gone wrong,"" he said. Before Darrow announced his judgment, prosecutor Sheila Polk characterized Ray as a dangerous ""pretender"" who had cast himself as a victim of an overzealous prosecution. And relatives of the victims told Darrow that Ray has done little to redeem himself and that he deserved the maximum possible sentence of nine years in prison. ""My heart's been ripped out. My life has been blown apart, and the pieces are yet to land,"" said Virginia Brown, Kirby Brown's mother.","James Arthur Ray is sentenced to a total of two years in prison .

"(CNN) -- The Formula One team never to have won a point has new owners. Caterham F1 has been sold by Tony Fernandes and his partners to a consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern owners, who are led by former Midland and HRT F1 principal Colin Kolles. Under the terms of the deal, the team will continue to race as Caterham F1 and will retain their base at Leafield, 75 miles north west of London. It will be run by former Dutch F1 driver Christijan Albers, who will be assisted by Manfredi Ravetto, replacing current team principal Cyril Abiteboul. ""We are aware of the huge challenge ahead of us given the fight at the bottom end of the Championship and our target now is to aim for tenth place in the 2014 Championship,"" said Albers in an official statement. ""We are very committed to the future of the team and we will ensure that the team has the necessary resources to develop and grow and achieve everything it is capable of."" It ends a four-year stint in the sport for Fernandes, who combined his role at Caterham with being chairman at football club Queens Park Rangers, who recently were promoted to the English Premier League.

"(CNN) -- Want to know the real secret to being a success on Wall Street? If you're a college student aiming to land a top job at the world's most famous financial district then it might just help to take up a sport -- but perhaps not the one you're thinking of. Basketball? Baseball? Neither. The answer is ... lacrosse. The ""Lacrosse Bros."" culture is well known on Wall Street -- but the way in is blocked to all those who failed to play the sport to a high level at college. The unofficial club has played a leading role in helping former college lacrosse stars walk into some of the biggest jobs in New York City. ""I think that playing college lacrosse translates pretty well into the corporate world,"" leading lacrosse star Garrett Billings tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""College is a high-pressure environment and a lot of the people who play lacrosse go to very good schools. ""You have to stick to your books, study hard and get on with your work. ""With lacrosse you're working in a team environment, which is really beneficial when it comes to business."" The Virginia Lacrosse Alumni Network, to which Billings belongs, has helped hundreds of graduates reach Wall Street, while other schools boast similar systems. Employers often look for the competitive edge which lacrosse players possess as key to their success. ""I have a bunch of friends who work on Wall Street and there's a big link between college and there,"" says Billings, who earns his living by playing lacrosse and coaching for Canada's Toronto Rock team. ""A lot of the guys go out of their way to help graduates from their old schools get a job. ""Lacrosse is big on Wall Street and has helped a lot of people."" While the ""Lax Bros"" continue to rule on Wall Street, Billings has trodden a different path away from the world of bankers and investors. One of the most sport's most prolific goalscorers, the 28-year-old has been the standout player for the Toronto Rock over the past season -- though last weekend he suffered a serious knee injury that will rule him out until next year. Billings, who runs the club's community program as part of his job during the week, has been one of the leading voices in promoting the sport in recent years. Box lacrosse, which is played inside hockey arenas during the summer on artificial grass, has been gaining popularity across the U.S. and Canada. Paul Rabil became the first lacrosse player to take his earnings from the sport to over $1 million after attracting a host of big name sponsors. Rabil, who boasts one of the most powerful shots in lacrosse, has teamed up with the likes of Red Bull and Warrior as the sport's brand becomes more attractive to investors. The growth of lacrosse and the rising profile of stars such as Rabil has convinced Billings that the sport is only going to get bigger and bigger. ""In the U.S. it's growing like wildfire,"" says Billings, who also plays field lacrosse in the summer. ""In Canada, it's a lot more of a natural progression, where it's basically you're signing up one kid at a time. ""That's what I do for the Toronto Rock, which is helping minor associations grow and try and help figure out how we can capture the same growth that's happening south of the border. ""I think it's happening and with the Toronto Rock being a high profile team and on television all the time, it helps that but there is work to be done."" Billings has spent his entire life in love with lacrosse. He is only half-joking when he says ""when I'm not playing lacrosse then he's usually thinking about lacrosse."" But this summer, he's got something else to think about -- his wedding. Billings will marry fiancee Alicia Paglia on June 7 after proposing late last year -- a moment which was more terrifying than any he has faced on a lacrosse field. ""I proposed on Christmas Eve,"" he says. ""Maybe it was a bit clichÃ© but she didn't have a clue it was coming. ""I spoke to her dad the day before and we decided that I'd do it in front of the family when we were giving presents. ""She really wanted me to get her the box set of 'The Sopranos' but then with my last gift, I gave her the ring and asked her to marry me. ""I was pretty confident she'd say yes but that's the most nervous I've ever been. She had no idea whatsoever it was coming."" With his injury blow, Billings will have more time to plan his nuptials. It didn't prevent him from becoming the first player in the history of the National Lacrosse League to register 100-point hauls (a combination of goals and assists) in three successive seasons, though he will miss the climax to the campaign. ""I couldn't have got luckier to play for the Toronto Rock because it was the team that I grew up watching,"" says Billings. ""I got to come here, play a lot and they've treated me great. ""We ended up winning a national championship and it's kind of a dream come true being able to play for these teams and accomplish the goals I've strived for my whole life.""","Garrett Billings is a Canadian lacrosse player .

"Washington (CNN) -- Could former U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross be part of a new prisoner swap? Two Cubans convicted of spying in the United States are pushing for the deal. They argue that U.S. President Barack Obama could follow the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl with a similar exchange, swapping three of their imprisoned colleagues in exchange for Gross. ""The only thing missing is political will,"" Fernando Gonzalez told reporters Tuesday, speaking from Havana in a teleconference broadcast at the Cuban Interests Section in Washington. ""I cannot think of a reason for him not to do something similar to what he did (with Bergdahl)."" Gross, 65, is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing satellite communications equipment to Cuba as part of his work as a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was convicted in March 2011. Gonzalez is one of the ""Cuban Five,"" a group of Cuban agents who were arrested in South Florida in 1998 and convicted of espionage in 2001. Two of them -- Fernando Gonzalez and Rene Gonzalez -- were released from prison and have returned to Cuba. Gerardo Hernández, Ramón Labañino and Antonio Guerrero remain in prison in the United States. Since their conviction, the agents have been the focus of an international campaign by the Cuban government to have them freed. Both of the freed agents have joined the lobbying effort. The pair already say the Bergdahl exchange shows a deal is possible, despite the criticism Obama has faced since the controversial swap of the U.S. soldier for five Taliban figures who'd been detained at Guantanamo Bay. ""I think this is the time to do it. I think we had never had a more favorable moment to go that route than we have now. I think that the end result would have an important and positive impact, not only on us, but also on future generations,"" Rene Gonzalez said during Tuesday's teleconference. But State Department officials have stressed that Bergdahl's case is different, given that he was a member of the U.S. armed forces who was captured in the midst of a military conflict. However, State Department officials say they are taking steps to ensure that Gross is returned to the United States. ""Alan Gross is an international development worker, and his situation is not comparable in any way to those of the convicted Cuban intelligence agents. The Cuban intelligence agents were tried transparently under due process rights that we extend to all defendants in our judicial system,"" a State Department spokesman said in an e-mail to CNN. ""Cuban government interlocutors frequently attempt to compare Mr. Gross' imprisonment to that of five convicted Cuban intelligence agents, three of whom continue to serve sentences in the United States."" U.S. officials said Gross was merely trying to help Cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on Internet access. But Cuban authorities say Gross was part of a plot to create ""a Cuban spring"" and destabilize the island's single-party communist government. U.S. federal prosecutors called the ""Cuban Five"" a dangerous undercover spy cell. The Cuban government said they were gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against Cuba. The apparent U.S. reluctance to pursue a swap hasn't stopped the Cuban government from pushing for it and saying that it would be open to discussing the matter with the United States. ""We are not talking about an exchange, we are talking about unilateral decisions which, obviously, would have to be interrelated,"" said Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabañas. ""The United States government has called on us to discuss humanitarian concerns. We, too, have a number of humanitarian concerns. We have said repeatedly that we are willing to seek a solution."" CNN's Patrick Oppmann and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Cubans say the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl shows a prisoner swap is possible .

"(CNN) -- If clamping down the privacy settings on your Facebook page isn't enough to help you sleep at night, take a cue from the youth of America. Try the ""super-logoff."" Performing the trick doesn't take superhuman powers. Instead of just closing a browser window or clicking the ""log off"" button at the top right of the Facebook homepage, some young, privacy-concerned users are simply deactivating their Facebook accounts each time they leave the site. Then they reactivate their accounts to log back on. Why go to all this trouble? Well, for one, it's not hard. Facebook makes it notoriously difficult to fully ""delete"" an account. But ""deactivating"" an account is easy -- it only takes a single click, and deactivated Facebook users maintain all of their friend connections, wall posts, photos and the like. The upside, for the privacy paranoid, is that when a ""deactivated"" user isn't on Facebook, no one else can see their profile, post on their wall or tag them in photos. For privacy-minded people, it's a soothing alternative. It gives them ultimate control. Microsoft researcher and social media expert danah boyd (she doesn't capitalize her name), who identified the trend this week on her blog, believes young people may have good reasons for deactivating and reactivating their accounts frequently. ""In many ways, deactivation is a way of not letting the digital body stick around when the person is not present,"" boyd writes in a November 8 post. ""This is a great risk reduction strategy if you're worried about people who might look and misinterpret. Or people who might post something that would get you into trouble."" She credits Michael Ducker, a program manager at Microsoft, with inventing the ""super-logoff"" term. As part of her field work, boyd has spoken with kids who use the technique to maintain control of their pages. One person she mentions on her blog, Mikalah, ""wants to be a part of Facebook when it makes sense and not risk the possibility that people will be snooping when she's not around."" The blog All Facebook adds that this practice is fundamentally different,  and in some ways simpler, than changing your privacy settings on the site: . ""Notice that, while you or I might think that spending five minutes setting your privacy settings correctly might solve the hassle of having to deactivate your account when you log out, in reality these are two actions that accomplish different things,"" Jorge Cino writes on that Facebook-focused blog. ""Mikalah and others like her want their friends to post stuff on their wall or tag them in a photo, but they don't want them doing it when they're not there to make sure it's okay. Most importantly, someone like Mikalah doesn't want any friends of friends digging up her profile when she's not 'around.' Deactivating her page literally erases her from Facebook. She becomes untraceable."" Others don't go quite as far, says boyd. Instead of deactivating her account, Shamika engages in practice known as ""whitewalling,"" boyd says. She deletes every ""like,"" comment and photo almost immediately after it's posted. ""When I asked her why she was deleting this content, she looked at me incredulously and told me 'too much drama,' "" boyd writes. She continues: . ""Pushing further, she talked about how people were nosy and it was too easy to get into trouble for the things you wrote a while back that you couldn't even remember posting let alone remember what it was all about. It was better to keep everything clean and in the moment. If it's relevant now, it belongs on Facebook, but the old stuff is no longer relevant so it doesn't belong on Facebook. ""Her narrative has nothing to do with adults or with Facebook as a data retention agent. She's concerned about how her postings will get her into unexpected trouble with her peers in an environment where saying the wrong thing always results in a fight."" These stories add interesting nuance to the debate over young people and privacy on the Internet. The general line of thinking -- which is backed up by some surveys -- is that young people care less about online privacy than older people. A Forrester Research study released this week, for example, found that fewer members of Generation Y say they are ""very concerned"" about social network privacy than Baby Boomers. But there appears to be more going on. A Pew Internet report, released on May 26, found young people are more likely than their older counterparts to alter their Facebook settings and to actively manage their online identities. From that report: . ""Young adults are the most active online reputation managers in several dimensions. When compared with older users, they more often customize what they share and whom they share it with."" This suggests younger people do care about their privacy and reputation online and will take steps -- sometimes big ones, as boyd's blog post shows -- to manage these increasingly important digital identities. What do you think of these practices? If you use the ""super-logoff,"" or plan to try it, let us know in the comments section below.","Some Facebook users deactivate their accounts instead of just logging off .

"(CNN) -- The entryways to some of the University of Chicago dorms near the corner of East 61st and South Cottage Grove resemble the doors of a prison. And if you look around, it's clear that instead of trying to keep trouble locked in, the 123-year-old private school is trying to keep trouble out. The university's stone wall near that intersection appears to have had graffiti scrubbed off. And the U. of C. chose to situate its Department of Safety & Security less than a block away. There are bright yellow signs on nearby telephone poles with the words ""safe passage"" on them. They arrived last year after a budget crunch caused Mayor Rahm Emmanuel to close 50 city schools, forcing displaced students to walk not only farther from home, but across warring gang territory -- some in this neighborhood -- to attend classes. These students, many of whom are black and Latino, are supposed to stay on the ""safe passage"" routes to avoid being accidentally shot by fighting gangs. As if bullets can read signs. Against this backdrop, the university is bidding for President Obama's presidential library, with a projected cost approaching half a billion dollars. (The deadline for bids is June 16; Honolulu, where Obama grew up, and New York are also expected to make pitches.) And this has presented Obama with a political -- and arguably moral -- bind that his former community-activist self might have taken on quite differently. Some context: Emmanuel, Obama's friend and former White House chief of staff, is despised by the black community in this town. And at least six shootings happened within blocks of Obama's Hyde Park home this past weekend alone, a situation crying out for solutions and funds to pay for them. Just to the west of East 61st and South Cottage Grove, the residents want the university to build a trauma center to help save the lives of the people living in the high crime/low income neighborhoods that surround it. Currently the university's renowned hospital is unable to treat adults injured in falls, car accidents and assaults, though it does operate a trauma center for children 16 and under. It had a trauma care unit in 1986 but closed it two years later because of annual losses of $2 million -- a combination of high volume, patients without insurance and insufficient public aid. This mattered, for example, to an 18-year-old youth activist by the name of Damian Turner, who in 2010 was caught in the crossfire of a drive-by shooting just four blocks from the school's hospital, but had to be driven 10 miles to be treated. He died en route. In 2013, Northwestern University studied gunshot wounds recorded by the Illinois State Trauma Registry from 1999 to 2009 and found that living more than five miles from a trauma center decreases chances of survival. Adults living on the city's predominantly black south side do not live within five miles of such a center. That's a problem. Opening a $700 million ""hospital for the future"" -- as the university did last year with its Center for Care and Discovery, focused on cancer, neuroscience and advanced surgery -- while telling neighbors a trauma center is too expensive to run, is also a problem. And it certainly doesn't help that Emmanuel, the man responsible for closing so many schools in this black neighborhood, is lobbying state officials to pony up $100 million for the library. No money to educate black children safely near their homes. Too expensive to run a trauma center to help black victims of shootings. But half a billion for a vanity project with the Obama name on it. With the location of the library set to be named sometime next year, it would appear the President has little choice but to avoid placing the library at the university lest he run the risk of, for one thing, making his My Brother's Keeper initiative look hollow. It's either that or try to force the university's hand -- no adult trauma center, no library. Hawaii is looking better and better, isn't it? This week a local organization, STOP, Southside Together Organizing for Power, is holding a series of peaceful protests on and around the university campus to oppose putting the library there and to raise attention for the need for a trauma center. Their demonstrations started with a sit-in on the construction site for a parking ramp near the school's new Discovery center. Video shows it ended with protesters being dragged off the premises by university police for trespassing, with some protesters injured in the process. ""The University of Chicago upholds the right to peaceful and safe demonstrations, but cannot allow protests that jeopardize anyone's safety,"" a statement read, adding it has established locations for demonstrations. ""No arrests were made, and no charges have been planned."" And no resolution in the near future. ""If the University of Chicago Medical Center cared about the safety of black kids, they would provide a trauma center, because right now in Chicago black kids are the leading population that are suffering from trauma,"" said demonstrator Veronica Morris-Moore, while holding an icepack on a wrist she said was injured in the skirmish. Next to her was 18-year-old Victoria Crider, whose leg was elevated on a desk, her ankle in an air cast. STOP's office is on East 61st, just a few blocks west of the school. ""Barack Obama has made it a point in his administration to not only preserve the life of black people, but black men,"" Morris-Moore said. ""And the university can play a part and they're just choosing not to."" She said ""there's a lot of burden"" on Obama to push for a trauma center. ""Clearly they're not listening to us. Clearly they're just going to keep pushing us around ... keep harming us until we go away. And we're not going away. But we are getting tired and we do need help from people the university will listen to. And they will listen to (Obama). So in some respect he does owe us some attention."" When more than 40 people are being shot in a weekend -- some in and around that neighborhood -- as happened last month, a lot more than attention is needed. Which could make Obama's return to Chicago every bit as stressful and as political as any day in Washington.","LZ: Violent area around Univ. of Chicago is near where pricey Obama library might go .

"(Mashable) -- Microsoft is set to unveil the next generation of Windows today. The new operating system, currently known as Windows 8, is the tech giant's attempt to regain ground that it has lost to Apple, which surpassed Microsoft last year as the world's most valuable company. It isn't the MacBook or Mac OS X Lion that has Microsoft executives worried, though. It's the sheer dominance of the iPad. The iPad hasn't skipped a beat since its debut last year. Thanks to Apple's ingenuity, a shockingly low starting price and a strong marketing campaign, the device has sold more than 25 million units in less than a year and a half. More importantly, it has defined a whole new category of consumer devices. And it dominates that category with an iron fist. iPad competitors have come and gone, but none have been able to make a dent in the iPad's rapid growth. HP has given up on the TouchPad, the RIM Playbook has underperformed and countless Android tablets have fallen by the wayside. Nothing has emerged as the alternative to the iPad. Windows 8: One OS to rule them all . This presents a dangerous problem and an opportunity for Microsoft. The tech giant cannot let Apple monopolize the tablet market like Microsoft did with the desktop OS. That would seal its fate as a technology power destined to diminish into a shell of its former self. There is a need for a legitimate alternative to the iPad, though, and the company that gets it right will emerge in a strong position to take a big piece of the fast-growing tablet market. Success in tablets would boost Microsoft's profits, ease investor concerns about the shrinking PC market and set it up for future growth. That's where Windows 8 comes in. The next generation OS, which will be unveiled at the Microsoft Build conference on Tuesday, is not only designed for PCs, but it is also made to work on tablets as well. We got a taste of its touchscreen capabilities at the D9 conference earlier this year, but we expect Microsoft to unveil the first Windows 8 tablet during Tuesday's keynote. Our sources tell us that the device will be manufactured by Samsung but has been designed meticulously by Microsoft in an attempt to create the iPad alternative. Will Microsoft's gamble work? Can the company create an OS that works seamlessly on both tablets and PCs? And most of all, will it be useful enough, different enough and cheap enough to give the iPad a run for its money? We'll be closer to knowing the answers to those questions Tuesday morning. The tablet wars are about to begin in earnest. See the original article on Mashable.com . © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Paris (CNN) -- Questions were raised Friday over the training of the pilots on the doomed Air France Flight 447, after analysis of the plane's voice and data recorders by a French investigation body. The recorders from the plane, which plunged into the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009 on its way from Brazil to France with the loss of 228 passengers and crew, were recovered in May, after almost two years on the sea bed. The data they provided has shed new light on the final minutes of the flight, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis, the BEA, said as it issued its third report. The crisis arose after a problem involving blocked pitot tubes -- devices that measure a plane's air speed -- which led to the disconnection of the autopilot, it said. The recorders revealed the pilots had failed to discuss repeated stall warnings and ""had received no high altitude training"" to deal with the situation, the BEA said. The pilots got conflicting air speed readings in the minutes leading up to the crash and, after the stall, responded by pointing the nose upward, rather than downward, to recover. They failed to regain control of the aircraft and no announcement was made to the passengers before it plummeted from the sky. The descent from 38,000 feet took 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Air France defended the pilots' performance, saying there was ""no reason to question the crew's technical skills"" in the face of ""multiple improbable factors."" But an aviation expert questioned why the pilots did not correct the stall. ""Dealing with a stall situation is a fundamental part of being a pilot -- if you take private flying lessons, it is one of the things they teach you within the first few hours,"" said David Kaminiski-Morrow, an editor at Flight Global. ""Nobody seems to understand yet why they couldn't get out of the stall, why the pilots were unable to apply what -- in hindsight -- seems to be a fairly straightforward procedure,"" he said. The BEA issued 10 new safety recommendations, including ensuring extra training for pilots on manual handling of a high-altitude stall, such as that experienced by AF 447, and asking regulatory authorities to require airlines to equip planes with an image recorder to show what is displayed on the pilots' whole instrument panel. The BEA also recommends that the triggering of location transmitters and a video recorder should be mandatory when an emergency is detected on board an aircraft. CNN's aviation correspondent Richard Quest said the report ""shows that the original incident  -- the blocked pitot tubes and failed speed sensor -- was serious but not catastrophic."" ""It should have been relatively straightforward to deal with for an experienced flight crew. However, it was the response of the pilots which ultimately doomed the aircraft,"" he said. ""By focusing the attention on the way the cockpit crew handled the emergency, the BEA is recommending further training for pilots in dealing with high-altitude crises. ""Sources in the industry tell me that this incident, among others, is leading to a rethink and renewed emphasis on piloting skills."" Kaminiski-Morrow said modern-day planes are capable of flying themselves most of the time, which means pilots have to be capable computer managers. ""The danger of this is that when things start going wrong, is the pilot still in the loop?"" Kaminiski-Morrow said. ""The computer might recognize what's wrong, but if the pilot doesn't, how will he get out of it? French Transport Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told French radio network RTL that the BEA was responsible for establishing ""the facts"" and that it would be the courts' role to assign any blame. Air France and Airbus are being investigated for alleged involuntary manslaughter over the crash. In its response to the report, Air France said the two co-pilots and the captain ""showed an unfailing professional attitude, remaining committed to their task to the very end. Air France pays tribute to the courage and determination they showed in such extreme conditions."" It went on: ""From the flight recorder data, it has been established that the combination of multiple improbable factors led to the disaster in less than four minutes: the icing of the pitot probes was the initial event that led to the disconnection of the autopilot, the loss of associated piloting control protections and considerable roll movements. ""After the manoeuvres carried out by the crew in deteriorated and destabilizing piloting conditions, the aircraft stalled at high altitude, could not be recovered and struck the surface of the Atlantic Ocean at high speed."" All 228 people aboard the Airbus A330 Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris were killed in the crash. The bulk of the wreckage was found earlier this year after a search by robot submarines of an underwater mountain range. More than 150 bodies have been brought up from the scene of the crash, but more than 70 will never be recovered. CNN's Jim Bitterman and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: An aviation expert wonders why the pilots were not able to deal with the stall .

"(CNN) -- Fresh bilateral talks have started in Geneva this week between the United States and Iran over Tehran's nuclear ambitions -- but it is unlikely that the P5+1 group will lift major financial sanctions before the July deadline for this round of negotiations. Instead, the most likely scenario appears to be an extending of the current interim agreement. Although the IAEA recently verified that Iran has eliminated its second stage uranium enrichment capacity, which was something of a significant concession, Tehran is unlikely to gain a permanent lifting of oil and banking sanctions by way of return. Nevertheless, there is still a clear trend towards a break between commercial and nuclear diplomacy. Even if the latter stalls, the former is a train that has left the station -- and that will constitute the decisive and irrevocable breakthrough in the end. As the nuclear talks continues the cat-and-mouse pattern begun more than a decade ago, commercial engagement is heading into uncharted -- and likely irreversible -- territory. The ink is not yet dry on November's Joint Action Plan, which was intended to ease sanctions: Russia has promised to buy 500,000 barrels per day of Iranian crude oil, lifting its exports by 50% and adding $1.5 billion a month to Iran's struggling economy. A $20 billion barter deal is in the works, exchanging Iranian oil for Russian industrial goods and food. With Ukraine revealing a deep fissure between the West and Moscow, it is unlikely that Russia would comply with any extension of sanctions anyway. Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif has firmly declared that there will be no agreement until all sanctions are lifted. The rest of the world is taking him at his word as well. At the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos this January, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani met with CEOs and with EU Commission President Barosso, followed by a large French business delegation -- including major firms such as GDF Suez, Lafarge and Alstom -- visiting Tehran in February. Renault has resumed car part shipments to Iran. Clearly, the business community moves faster than governments. China already does more than $20 billion per year in trade with Iran, and is responsible for most of the $16 billion direct foreign investment into Iran during 2013 double the volume in the previous year. In February China's commerce minister Gao Hucheng signed an agreement in Tehran aimed at doubling non-oil trade in the coming years. Chinese-Iranian trade and investment volumes have fluctuated due to sanctions -- and with the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan all but complete, both countries are accelerating plans to deepen the ""new Silk Road"" rail and highway corridor across the only country that separates them. No doubt the next Afghan president, who faces empty coffers as American aid slows to a trickle, will welcome his neighbors' initiative. There have been plenty of other willing sanctions busters. Turkey has sold close to $10 billion in gold to Iran in exchange for much needed gas. Turkmenistan and other Central Asian republics have conducted oil swap deals with Iran in which they ship crude across the Caspian Sea to Iranian terminals and Iran delivers oil to their clients via its Persian Gulf terminals. The message is clear: Sanctions are a false piety, and while they have been disastrous for an economy which might be on a par by now with Turkey or Mexico, they don't seem to have damaged Iran's nuclear program any more than fresh sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis will hurt its military. The IAEA has said that Iran's centrifuge count, necessary to enrich uranium, has risen from 300 to 19,000, with a potential timeline to test a nuclear weapon of anywhere from one to three months. Some experts argue that even a military strike on one of Iran's major nuclear facilities at Nantaz or Arak would only delay nuclear weapon breakout capacity by six to 12 months. As far as global companies are concerned, therefore, blocking them from making commercial inroads into Iran makes little, if any, logical sense. While America prides itself on doing the ""heavy lifting"" of conflict and diplomacy to liberate Iraq and contain Iran's nuclear program, the rest of the world seems to simply want Washington to get out of the way. Today's dynamic is reminiscent of when Libya opened up to the rest of the world in 2003: once Tripoli had pledged to abandon its nuclear program, Europeans raced into the country to make deals, with then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair lobbying for years on behalf of then-leader Muammar al-Gaddafi and Western business interests. Observing how Iraq's oil sector has played out is also instructive. America sacrificed more than 4,000 lives on Iraqi soil in order for Royal Dutch Shell, Russia's Gazprom, Malaysia's Petronas, and PetroChina to dominate the country's production and exports. The Iran dynamic is similarly shifting from isolation to tug-of-war: whoever builds the most ""Silk Roads"" connecting commercially to Iran wins. A simple look at a map will suffice: Iran is a large and centrally located nation with thousands of years of regional ties -- and a large diaspora -- which serve to keep the country connected. It is not Cuba (not that isolating Cuba has led to regime change either): decades have been wasted pretending that a central civilization such as Iran could be contained, or believing that it is deeply irrational, a cause rather than a country. Bringing Iran fully into the global economy is an opportunity few are willing to resist any longer: even American companies. Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and other American food producers and traders have been among the chief beneficiaries of loopholes and exemptions in existing sanctions. Now others want in on Iran's lucrative market, not least oil and industrial giants eager to access and overhaul Iran's decrepit energy infrastructure. Under the vague provisions of the Geneva agreement, GE and Boeing now claim they have the right to inspect and repair American-made aircraft engines used in Iran's civilian aircraft. If one year from now Iran remains close to developing a nuclear weapon, then we can expect that Russia, China, India, Turkey and other nations will nonetheless have moved well ahead in exploiting the current thaw to lock-in long-term deals with Tehran. Furthermore, the European temptation to tap Iran's energy supply and access its flows through the Nabucco and other gas pipelines will prove overwhelming, especially in the aftermath of Russia's ever unpredictable aggression in eastern Europe. The U.S. stands little chance of unwinding these commercial arrangements, even if Iran proves recalcitrant on the nuclear front. Instead, Western countries should understand that their leverage can be more effective if applied to a dynamic of engagement than one of containment. The U.S. should add its weight to this tug-of-war over Iran. If the West fully lifts sanctions for the first time in decades, it can strongly re-shape Iran's economic and diplomatic constellations. The U.S. should, as it has done in Myanmar, allow American companies to invest directly except with blacklisted individuals and entities, and with certain additional reporting compliance requirements. After decades of leading isolation and sanctions, President Obama had an impactful visit to Yangon in 2012 and U.S. companies now enjoy a privileged status in Myanmar. Iran's recent cancellation of a $2.5 billion China National Petroleum Corporation project for the joint development of the South Azadegan oil field project is a very strong sign that an open Iran will choose Western quality goods and services over China's often under-whelming technology. Places like Dubai, whose long-standing Iranian trade has been curbed substantially due to sanctions, would likely have a greater role in the race for the economic and strategic spoils in Iran. Indeed, the UAE has just concluded a high-level agricultural and industrial delegation to Iran that explored both investments in Iran and facilitating Iranian exports. In a more regulated framework, Dubai will become the offshore hub for Iran's rehabilitation for at least a decade or more, a safe city to negotiate with Iranian counterparties, a location where investors can place collateral for transactions rather than with Iranian banks directly. This would also make it easier to monitor a large portion of the investment into Iran. Oman, which in recent years has been a back-channel mediator between the U.S. and Iran, has just unveiled plans for a 1,000 km gas pipeline to Iran, making it another crucial Arab ally in overseeing the evolution of Iran's energy sector. Lifting sanctions would not suddenly make Iran or Iranians pro-Western rather than playing the country's central geography to multi-align in all directions with China, Russia, India, Europe and others. But it would empower a stronger commercial constituency inside Iran to keep access to its markets open -- and more openly oppose Tehran policies that risk undermining their gains. This hardly amounts to an anti-nuclear lobby, but would certainly constitute one with a lot more to lose by supporting the regime's agenda. Iran will only accept such a path as a genuine two-way street. As such, it must hold up its end of the bargain -- or face fully justified Western measures -- from sabotage to cyber-attacks to airstrikes -- to delay its nuclear program. But America should not delude itself: Even a nuclear Iran is one most of the world will do business with.","Khanna: There is a clear trend towards a break between commercial and nuclear diplomacy .

"Vienna, Austria (CNN) -- Negotiations between Western powers and Iran to reach a permanent agreement on the future of Tehran's nuclear ambitions are likely to be extended beyond the July 20 deadline, a senior U.S. official and a Western diplomat told CNN on Tuesday. The sources, who did not speak for full attribution, said the United States and its partners in the negotiations -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- had not started talking about an extension with the Iranians. But there are a number of potential time frames being discussed among the United States and its partners, ranging up to six months, the sources said. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday in Vienna the negotiations have not yet bridged some ""very real gaps."" Kerry told reporters there had been ""tangible progress on key issues,"" but negotiators have yet to arrive at a ""workable formula."" He said he would return to Washington to consult with the White House and lawmakers on options for moving forward, including whether to extend the talks beyond the deadline. ""Our team will continue working very hard to try to reach a comprehensive agreement that resolves the international community's concerns,"" Kerry said of the negotiators. Despite the continued differences, Kerry said he believed there was a way ahead. ""But -- and this is a critical point -- while there is a path forward, Iran needs to choose to take it. And our goal now is to determine the precise contours of that path, and I believe we can,"" he said. Responding to reporters' questions, he added that trust has to be built because of Iran's past track record in pursuing a secret nuclear program. Tehran insists its nuclear ambitions are peaceful, but the world powers fear it plans to build nuclear weapons. ""We don't see any benefit in Iran developing a nuclear weapon,"" Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif told NBC's ""Meet The Press"" on Sunday. He said Iran has a number of advantages over its neighbors, including ""the fact that we have better technology,"" which Iran doesn't need to augment with nuclear weapons. Possible extension . While a six-month extension would give them the maximum negotiating time, the Obama administration has domestic considerations to weigh, including a November deadline after which new sanctions on Iran would have to be imposed under U.S. law. There are also opponents in Congress who could use the chance for an extension to try to torpedo a deal. When asked about prospects for an extension, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he was ""not in a position to speculate about which path will be taken."" An interim deal that took effect in January required Iran to dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions. That set the stage for the current talks on a permanent accord. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report. Labott reported from Washington and Crawford from Vienna.","John Kerry: There are still ""very real gaps"" between Iran and six world powers .

"(CNN) -- A new South Dakota law requiring a woman to get counseling at a ""pregnancy help center"" and wait 72 hours after a physician assessment before having an abortion appears destined for a legal challenge. Law opponents say the waiting period would be the longest in the nation. Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who signed House Bill 1217 on Tuesday, is anticipating such a move. The restrictive bill's prime sponsor, Rep. Roger Hunt, has pledged to raise private funds to help finance any needed defense, Daugaard said in a statement. ""I think everyone agrees with the goal of reducing abortion by encouraging consideration of other alternatives,"" Daugaard. ""I hope that women who are considering an abortion will use this three-day period to make good choices."" The law, which also requires the woman to receive counseling at a ""pregnancy help center,"" is currently scheduled to take effect July 1. But the American Civil Liberties Union and a regional office of Planned Parenthood said they will file a lawsuit to stop the law. ""Planned Parenthood's legal team has determined that this bill is such an egregious violation of the Constitution, that we will file suit if the governor signs it,"" said the Planned Parenthood office for Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota before Daugaard's action. ""The law also purports to ensure that women are 'informed' before consenting to an abortion, but actually imposes requirements that are both impossible to meet and require physicians to flood their patients with false and misleading information,"" the group said in a statement. Chris Hupke, head of South Dakota's Family Policy Council, told CNN Sioux Falls affiliate KSFY that ""Planned Parenthood has not done anything to police itself when a woman is being coerced into this action."" Hupke says the centers will provide important counseling about abortion and offer alternatives ""so that women get the information so that they can make an informed decision, a voluntary decision."" The Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based research center for sexual and reproductive health, says that 34 states require that women receive counseling before an abortion is performed. Twenty-five of those states also require women to wait a specified amount of time -- usually 24 hours-- between the counseling and the abortion procedure, the group says. Language at the beginning of the bill states that it establishes ""certain procedures to better insure that [abortion] decisions are voluntary, uncoerced, and informed, and to revise certain causes of action for professional negligence relating to performance of an abortion."" Under the law, no physician may have the pregnant woman sign a consent for the abortion on the day of the initial consultation. The doctor must perform an assessment and cannot schedule a procedure ""to take place in less than 72 hours from the completion of such consultation and assessment except in medical emergency."" The physician will discuss risk factors with the woman and must provide information on ""pregnancy help centers,"" according to the law. The woman must undergo a pregnancy center consultation prior to the day of any scheduled abortion and provide written proof to the doctor. Planned Parenthood said the centers ""must have as their central mission a desire to dissuade a woman from having an abortion, no matter what her particular risks or circumstances."" South Dakota obstetrician Marvin Buehner told CNN Rapid City affiliate KEVN that the new law is ""government-mandated interference in the doctor/patient relationship.""","South Dakota governor signs abortion bill .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The conservative advocacy group Tea Party Express massed at the U.S. Capitol on Saturday to protest health care reform, higher taxes and what they see as out-of-control government spending. iReporter Justin Hall attended Saturday's rally. ""We think things can get a lot worse before they get better,"" he said. Marchers en route to the rally held no feelings in check as they waved signs reading, ""Proud member of the angry mob,"" ""I didn't vote for this Obamanation,"" ""Fire the czars"" and ""You represent us, not rule us."" Nazi imagery and a poster of President Obama as an African witch doctor were popular images. The march leading to the Capitol stretched for blocks on the final day of the Tea Party Express' cross-country bus tour, which began August 28 in Sacramento, California. En route, the group hosted rallies in about 30 cities. An official crowd estimate was not available, but reporters at the scene described the massive crowd as reaching the tens of thousands. At each stop, the tour highlighted members of Congress ""who have voted for higher spending, higher taxes, and government intervention in the lives of American families and businesses,"" according to The Tea Party Express Web site. One woman at Saturday's events summed up her feelings about issues this way: ""It's too much too fast."" A major theme of the rally was the push for less government. ""The government should be doing things that are authorized by the Constitution; they should be doing things that the people want, not things that they just decide are nifty. We can't afford these things anymore.  Watch protesters converge on the Capitol » . ""The government should be concentrating on cutting spending on all the programs, not thinking of new, wonderful ways of spending more .... I've voted my whole life. This is the first time in my life I've gotten off the couch and said, 'I'm sick of this. It's only three hours away, and I'm going to be there.'"" Yet another man said, ""We're here to let the government know that we do not want government involvement in our health care nor do we want the higher taxation that comes along with such a proposal."" iReport.com: iReporters trade barbs . Several speakers were to speak throughout the afternoon, with events wrapping up about 4 p.m. ET. The tea party movement gained momentum this year; several parties were held across the country this summer to protest Obama and the Democrats' economic stimulus plans, among other things. On July 4, nearly 2,000 advocates, toting signs and chanting slogans, rallied outside Congress. Activists said the TEA Party Day -- an acronym for ""Taxed Enough Already"" -- was in response to runaway government spending. But now, the focus is on health care reform, an issue that has prompted a more encompassing debate. ""What brought everything together was the Obamacare idea, which contains every odiferous objection,"" Tea Party Express organizer Mark Williams said in August. Although Tea Party Express tour was funded by Our Country Deserves Better, a conservative political action committee, Williams said his organization is nonpartisan, and that the rallies are not aimed at one politician over another, namely Obama. iReport.com: Images from the rally . ""This is not people upset over one particular politician or one particular party,"" Williams has said. ""In fact, if you ask the Republicans in the crowd, you'll find they are just upset at their party as they are at the Democrats."" Members from conservative groups such as Freedom Works, run by former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, Campaign Liberty and the Institute for Liberty also were expected to participate in Saturday's rally.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning will receive a classified document that seeks to justify the administration's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks, chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said late Wednesday. ""I am pleased that the president has agreed to provide the Intelligence Committee with access to the OLC (Office of Legal Counsel) opinion regarding the use of lethal force in counterterrorism operations,"" the California Democrat said in a statement. ""It is critical for the committee's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations."" The announcement came shortly after an administration official said that President Barack Obama had yielded to demands that he turn over to Congress the classified Justice Department legal advice that seeks to justify the policy. The developments came the night before confirmation hearings are to be held for Obama's CIA director nominee, John Brennan, and amid complaints from senators, including several Democrats, about secrecy surrounding the drone policy. ""Today, as part of the president's ongoing commitment to consult with Congress on national security matters, the president directed the Department of Justice to provide the congressional Intelligence committees access to classified Office of Legal Counsel advice related to the subject of the Department of Justice White Paper,"" an administration official said. The 16-page white paper -- titled ""Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaida or an Associated Force"" -- is a policy paper rather than an official legal document. Memo backs U.S. using lethal force against Americans overseas . The president, the official said, was turning over the information because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy. Opinion: Bring drones out of the shadows . In a 2012 speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Brennan asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because, ""There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat."" This does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson, United Nations special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, who announced plans in October to investigate U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. The drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies has been one of Brennan's biggest legacies in the four years he was the president's principal adviser on terrorism. According to a count by the public policy group New America Foundation, at least 28 of al Qaeda's leading members have been killed in drone strikes, including the U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, who played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Human rights groups in the United States are particularly aggrieved by the targeted killing of al-Awlaki, who was killed by a drone. His teenage son died in a separate strike. On Wednesday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said the attack that killed al-Awlaki was justified. ""This is somebody who had said that he didn't want his U.S. citizenship anymore, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told MNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" ""He had officially joined al Qaeda,"" Rogers said. ""Al Qaeda had declared war on the United States."" Rogers continued, ""The legal basis of this goes back many, many years when U.S. citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the United States. So what they were saying is, once you've made that choice, you no longer get the protections that you would. I mean, if you join the enemy overseas, you join the enemy overseas. And we're going to fight the enemy overseas."" In his speech at the Wilson Center, Brennan said that drone strikes are ""ethical"" because of ""the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an al Qaeda terrorist and innocent civilians."" And Obama himself defended it in an appearance last October on ""The Daily Show."" ""There are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world, and you've got to make a call and it's not optimal,"" he said. ""And sometimes you've got to make some tough calls. But you can do so in a way that's consistent with international law and with American law.""","NEW: Senate committee will get classified document Thursday .

"(CNN) -- South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius was involved in a nightclub dispute over the weekend, after another patron ""started to aggressively interrogate him"" on matters relating to his murder trial, his spokeswoman says. Reports of the incident and subsequent tweets by Pistorius -- his first activity on Twitter since the one-year anniversary of his girlfriend's death -- have grabbed headlines in South Africa and around the world. Pistorius, 27, is accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, on February 14, 2013. The Olympic sprinter admits firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, but denies murder, saying he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder. South African media reported Monday that Pistorius had been involved in an altercation Saturday at the VIP Room in the Sandton area of Johannesburg. Pistorius' spokeswoman Anneliese Burgess confirmed to CNN Tuesday that her client had been at the venue with one of his cousins, sitting in a VIP section, when he was approached by another patron. ""The individual, according to my client, started to aggressively interrogate him on matters relating to the trial. An argument ensued during which my client asked to be left alone,"" she said. ""Oscar soon thereafter left the club with his cousin. My client regrets the decision to go to a public space and thereby inviting unwelcome attention."" The day after the incident, Pistorius tweeted a photo montage showing him with children on prosthetics or stumps. The text accompanying the photos reads, ""You have the ability to make a difference in someones life. Sometimes it's the simple things you say or do that can make someone feel better or inspire them."" This was followed by a second tweet, in which the sprinter posted a photographed passage from ""Man's Search for Meaning,"" a book by Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. The text says love is the ""ultimate and highest goal"" and describes how a man with nothing ""may still find bliss ... in the contemplation of his beloved."" ""In a position of utter desolation, when a man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way -- an honorable way -- in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment,"" it says. Pistorius posted a third tweet Monday, a prayer written across a photo of a misty river -- credited to the Christian website crosswalk.com. The text reads: ""Lord, today I ask that you bathe those who live in pain in the river of your healing. Amen."" The postings have prompted messages of support, bewilderment and condemnation on the social media site, with some Twitter users questioning why Pistorius had visited a nightclub while on trial. Pistorius' murder trial has been adjourned until August 7, when closing arguments are scheduled to begin.","Oscar Pistorius is accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February 2013 .

"(CNN) -- When Sunday Oliseh was a young boy kicking a football around the dusty streets of Lagos, he never dreamed he would one day carry the hopes of 170 million people on the world's biggest sporting stage. ""As a child, the World Cup was something that was not for us but for others,"" says the man who became one of Nigeria's pioneering football exports. ""It was something like a mirage for my nation until my generation came around."" Indeed, football was not even considered a respectable profession in the Oliseh household. ""For my parents growing up, football was taboo and you could understand them because way back then, in Africa, nobody made a living out of playing football,"" the 39-year-old tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""For my parents, there was no way you could play football because you're going to grow up, become older and be unemployed, so you had to be schooled and I really thanked them because it's made me get that education that has helped me to manage myself as an adult. ""In the do-or-die world of football, if you're not really educated and paper smart, you could sign contracts that will hurt you forever, so I thank them immensely."" Oliseh quickly won over his parents when he earned a contract at local club Julius Berger. Now known as Bridge Boys, it has provided a stepping stone to bigger things for a long line of international players. ""I remember coming home with my first wages and my father called my brothers and said, 'Look, your brother is earning way, way more than I earned as an accountant for his first contract,' "" Oliseh recalls. ""That's when we were just like, 'Wow, there's something starting here.' "" It was a journey that would take him far from home -- to clubs in Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands. Oliseh, a defensive midfielder, would captain his country, win an Olympic gold medal, and star at World Cups in the United States and France. African nations had regularly appeared at the World Cup since the 1970s, but Nigeria had to wait until 1994 for its first appearance. The scene was the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, and the opponent was a star-studded Bulgaria team that would go on to reach the semifinals. ""We were so nervous,"" Oliseh says. ""The men's room was filled up before the game."" The talented Super Eagles (and their bladders) needn't have been so concerned. Oliseh and co. powered to an impressive 3-0 victory and topped the group despite losing to an Argentina team captained by Diego Maradona. ""I got the opportunity to rub shoulders with the player whose poster was on my wall at the time,"" Oliseh says. ""He was the best player of our generation. That was when it dawned on me that I was ready for the big league."" The Super Eagles lost to eventual runner-up Italy after extra time in the last 16, but their swashbuckling style captured the imagination of fans around the world and set the tone for a golden age of Nigerian football. Next came Olympic success at Atlanta '96, beating Argentina 3-2 in the final with a last-gasp winner. ""My parents called me the next day and said, 'Son, you owe us money!' and I said, ""How come Papa and Mama?"" and they said, 'All the neighbors have been here drinking so when you come back, you have to pay us back!' ""Nigeria went crazy. The President gave the whole country two days off. No work, we had to celebrate this -- so that shows you how much it meant to my nation and to Africa."" For Oliseh, the 1998 World Cup was even better as he scored one of the goals of the tournament in a 3-2 win against Spain, though Nigeria would lose heavily to Denmark in round two. The goal was not only special for sending Nigeria into the knockout stage, but also because it was predicted by former teammate Dosu Joseph -- a goalkeeper whose career was ended by a serious car crash. ""All I could think about was, 'Damn, Dosu Joseph said this!' So he was the one I was running up to in the stands, to my brother to just share the moment with them,"" Oliseh says. ""And my nation was going through a dark period at the time. Our President had just died, and this victory united our nation again."" These were halcyon sporting days that the football-mad country has yet to repeat. Oliseh helped Nigeria qualify for the 2002 World Cup, but was not selected for the finals. As would happen again at the team's next appearance -- at Africa's first World Cup in 2010 -- Nigeria exited at the group stage. But now, Africa's most populous nation is daring to dream again. And the omens are strong. Just like in 1994, the Super Eagles will go into the World Cup finals as African champions, and in Brazil they have been handed what is on paper a favorable draw after qualifying undefeated. Once again they will face Argentina, along with Iran and tournament debutant Bosnia-Herzegovina in Group F. But while the makings of a good team are there, Oliseh warns the present squad will have to go a long way to match the vintage sides of the mid-'90s. ""The World Cup group of 1994, as far as I see it, was the most solid team Nigeria ever produced,"" Oliseh says. ""Football in Nigeria during our generation hit the highest it could go. It became worldwide, it became a nation of footballers."" By comparison, today's Nigerian stars have had a head start in making it in the game -- in many ways they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Victor Moses, Efe Ambrose and Emmanuel Emenike all earn big money plying their trade for Europe's elite teams, having been scouted and groomed from an early age. ""My generation was blessed with this burden of being pioneers,"" Oliseh says. ""You didn't have anybody who had done it before that you could ask and say, 'Look, what is it like?'"" ""When I went to the Italian league I was the first -- I had no other Nigerian to call up and say, 'How did you cope?' "" No matter. With a confident and enthusiastic attitude to life, much like his playing style, the position of nomadic footballing trailblazer suited Oliseh. He was one of the first Nigerians to play in Belgium, spending four years at RFC Liege before moving to Reggiana in Italy after the 1994 World Cup. A season in Serie A was followed by a move to FC Cologne in Germany then a sojourn in Holland with Ajax of Amsterdam. While in the Dutch capital Oliseh would endear himself to the Ajax faithful with his dancing goal celebrations, picking up three trophies. Oliseh returned to Italy in 1999 for one season with Juventus before moving back to Germany, this time with Borussia Dortmund -- winning the Bundesliga title and a runner-up medal in the UEFA Cup. Each country provided different lessons in football and in life. ""The moment I got to Italy, then I found out football was not a pleasure, it was business,"" he says. Germany taught him discipline and was ""where my way of living as a man was built."" Playing for Juventus, meanwhile, enabled Oliseh to live and play alongside legends of the modern game like Zinedine Zidane and Alessandro Del Piero -- which he describes as ""great for my own education as a person."" While there have been many Nigerians and thousands of Africans to follow in Oliseh's footsteps in the 20 years since he made the move to Europe, African national teams have not developed in the same rapid manner. Pele famously said an African nation would win the World Cup before the year 2000 -- a prediction that has yet to be met. No African team has ever gone beyond the quarterfinals. Oliseh, who has set up coaching projects in Belgium since retiring in 2006, has strong opinions on why this is the case. ""I think an African country will eventually win the World Cup. What is lacking now, it's simple to say ... what is wrong is that we don't plan well. We leave the planning 'til late,"" he says. On the park, Oliseh also has a radical diagnosis for player development and tactics. ""Africans need to learn how to start pressurizing the opponents. Football has changed now. It's no longer football where you pick individuals and expect them to do well,"" he says. ""Now it's more about team work, team dynamics, team schemes, things that are planned out. How to look at the opponent, how to bring about antidotes to the opponent's playing star. ""When it comes to physical strength and bursts of speed, you can't beat an African. But what is lacking now is just that technical and tactical know-how. Then we'll get it."" Oliseh's World Cup days may be long past, but come June and July he will be watching events in Brazil with avid interest. ""If I was to live without football now, I think I would die -- even my kids sometimes are bored because Papa is always watching games.""","Sunday Oliseh played for Nigeria at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups .

"(Mashable)  -- Can't get enough of Mark Zuckerberg? Well, if the upcoming movie ""The Social Network"" doesn't sate your desire for the Facebook founder, he's slated to star in his own comic book come December. Bluewater Productions -- a Canadian production company specializing in comic books, graphic novels and multimedia that has previously told the tales of celebs like William Shatner, Roger Corman, Ray Harryhausen and Vincent Price, among other luminaries -- plans to release ""Mark Zuckerberg: Creator of Facebook"" as a 48-page saga that seeks to answer the question: ""Who is the real Mark Zuckerberg?"" Is he the philanthropist who recently donated $100 million to public schools in Newark? Or is he the darker character we're all anxiously awaiting meeting in David Fincher's ""The Social Network""? ""Rightly or wrongly, Mark dealt harshly with some people on his way to where he is today"", says comic book author Jerome Maida. ""As we see, he left many people feeling betrayed. I try my best to be fair here. No one is totally innocent in this story. I try to represent each of the major players' point of view."" Zuckerberg has become a figure of massive public interest over the last couple of years as Facebook has reaped both praise and torrents of criticism. It will be interesting to see how history looks back at this period in the coming years -- we'll certainly have a trove of source material in the archives if this Zuckerberg-centric storytelling trend continues. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(Mashable)  -- Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Kinect systems for the Xbox 360 to retailers, the company announced Wednesday. Kinect, a controller-free gaming system that competes with the Nintendo Wii and Playstation 3 Move, has been selling at an impressive rate since it launched in November. During the first three months after its launch, this rate was fast enough to earn Kinect the title of ""fastest-selling consumer device."" According to Guinness World Records, which officially confirmed the record today, Microsoft sold an average of 133,333 units per day between November 4 and January 3. ""The sales figures here speak for themselves,"" said Gaz Deaves, gaming editor for Guinness World Records in a statement from Microsoft. ""According to independent research, no other consumer electronics device sold faster within a 60-day time span, which is an incredible achievement considering the strength of the sector."" In comparison, it took the Nintendo Wii about two years to pass the 10 million sales mark (although to be fair, Nintendo's system was about $100 more expensive at launch than Microsoft's sensor). Kinect sales have unsurprisingly slowed since the holiday season and the initial launch. If sales had continued at the newly announced record rate, Microsoft would be announcing it had sold more than 18 million units instead of 10 million. Even so, at this point it looks safe to call the device a smash hit. © 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.","Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Kinect systems for the Xbox 360 .

"(CNN) -- These are tough times for hard-working families. Too many Americans are either unemployed or underemployed. Families are juggling bills they can't pay. Many believe they are working harder but only falling farther and farther behind. Worse yet, some Americans have given up looking for work altogether. According to the June unemployment report, the number of Americans actively searching for a job is at a three-decade low. Of those who found a job, nearly one in three had to settle for part-time work. So, it may be surprising to learn that more than 4.5 million open jobs went unfilled the month before. Although several factors contributed to these numbers, in this weak economy, many Americans are not equipped with the necessary knowledge and training for high-demand careers in the changing 21st century job market. Fifty-two percent of adults have not been trained with the literacy skills needed for success in the workforce. And two-thirds of Americans with disabilities do not participate in the workforce at all. The status quo isn't working. There are more than 50 workforce development programs spread across nine federal agencies meant to help people find meaningful employment. These programs are well intended, but unfortunately, even with a price tag of nearly $18 billion each year to taxpayers, very few have been evaluated to determine if the programs even work. Simply put: Our nation's job training system is overly complex and terribly failing those who need it most. That's why we are proud to support the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (H.R. 803) which renews our nation's workforce training laws for the first time in more than a decade. This overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, which passed the House earlier this week, will improve our nation's workforce development system, improve job opportunities for the underemployed, and, most importantly, help put millions of unemployed Americans back to work. In this stagnant economy, it is more important than ever that we create a system to prepare workers for 21st century jobs and help businesses find the skilled employees needed to grow a healthy economy. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act improves the workforce development system by eliminating 15 duplicative programs, empowering local boards to tailor training services to their region's specific needs, and supporting access to real-world education and development through on-the-job training. This bipartisan bill also aligns workforce development programs with economic development and education initiatives. Furthermore, it lets businesses identify in-demand skills and connect workers with the opportunities to build those skills. By demanding more effective and more accountable government programs, the act will reform the workforce development system in a way that will provide real results to those searching for jobs at a lower cost to taxpayers. The bill is a great example of what Congress can accomplish when both sides come to the table to work toward the common good. While it took a more than a year for the Senate to get on board, once implemented, the act will help Americans -- from recent college graduates to veterans to dads looking for work since the recession began -- find good-paying jobs that build a foundation for easier lives and more opportunities. So, what's next? The bill is headed to the President's desk because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid chose to finally work with Republicans. We hope he will do the same with dozens of other jobs bills collecting dust in the United States Senate. After all, while this legislation is a step in the right direction, there is much more work to do to build a healthy economy. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- After news hit that ""Teen Mom's"" Farrah Abraham made a so-called sex tape with Lindsay Lohan's ""The Canyons"" co-star James Deen, there were conflicting stories about its existence and its origins. When originally approached about it on April 8, Abraham, 21, said she knew of no such tape, but implied that something she might not have intended to go public could exist. ""If I have my own personal stuff, then that's my own personal things and if there's anyone that's trying to be rude or just get at me, then my lawyer will take care of that,"" she said. Then professional porn actor Deen said he and Abraham had shot a full-fledged adult film together. He told CNN: . ""Essentially, this is what happened, I was approached (to star in the movie) and we had this long conversation about how I was the wrong person for the job. Not to be arrogant because I'm not famous, but people that are watching porno, I'm in porn and they would say, 'Hey look it's James Deen in this porno.' (Those in negotiations) said 'No, it's fine. We want to set this up like you and her are dating' and I'm like no, absolutely not. They were like, 'No, it's going to be great: we'll set you up on a date and call the paparazzi' and I'm like no, that sounds like the worst experience of my life. Absolutely not going to do that. I think what happened now, the company has its marketing strategy, she and her people have their marketing strategy. I don't really care, but why can't the marketing strategy be, It's gonna be cool! Wanna see it? World's best porno comin' out soon!"" Deen continued: . ""I picked her up from her hotel room and drove her to set, somebody took a picture of us walking out of the hotel room, I get a call the next morning asking if we're dating, I say no and they said, well what were you doing and I said we were shooting a porno. Now there's this whole thing. They're saying please don't say any details and I'm like, I have no desire to say anything to anyone. To me, this isn't even a story. But, also, I do porn every day."" Now Abraham admits that a tape with Deen does exist and is negotiating its distribution. A spokeswoman for MTV had no comment on the matter. When asked how, between Abraham and his ""The Canyons"" co-star Lindsay Lohan, Deen has managed to get tangled up with controversial starlets, he said, ""I don't know. Maybe I'm the new sex tape."" ""Oh wow,"" he noted ""that's gonna be a good headline. But I mean, sex tapes are played out and everyone knows they're fake now. Like the Kim Kardashian one - everyone's like, that's obviously fake. She was paid a bunch of money to make a sex tape with her boyfriend. And the Tila Tequila one, everyone's like, oh wait, that (other) girl does porn, she's just in this movie with her. I think everybody has kind of figured out that sex tapes are a hoax, so I think now management is like, you should just hang out with James Deen. It'll be like you're doing a sex tape -- it'll be the same drama and controversy and stuff, it'll be all crazy. Or maybe I'm just in ... a place at ... a time?

"(CNN) -- The way we watch TV is changing. People want to decide when, where and on what screen they watch their favorite shows. One of the simplest tools for viewing your shows from any device is the Slingbox, which is releasing two new models of its popular TV-streaming tool. The Slingbox is a device that streams content from cable and satellite providers to mobile devices and computer, allowing you to watch whatever is playing on your TV or recorded on your DVR far from your home. Instead of having to plant yourself in front of the living room television to watch a new episode of ""Breaking Bad,"" you can watch a live or DVR stream of it from another room, state or country using a smartphone, tablet or computer. The two new Slingbox models add in some key features that were absent from the previous model, the Slingbox Pro HD. The smaller $180 Slingbox 350 can stream videos up to 1080p and has simplified the set-up process. The $300 Slingbox 500 also streams1080p HD content and has a variety of connection options, including HDMI, component and composite for linking to your other devices and television set. The 500 adds a rough first go of a promising new feature called SlingProjector which makes it possible to stream content, such as photos, from your mobile devices or computers back to the TV. The old trapezoid design has been overhauled. The Slingbox 350 is a small and light box covered in pattern of small diamond shapes. The larger Slingbox 500 has a slick undulating rectangle body, that while pretty to look at, makes it difficult to stack other boxes on top of it. For the many people playing device Jenga in their entertainment centers, that means the 500 will always have to be perched on top of the Xbox, DVR, DVD player or Wii. The company is also updating the companion software, SlingPlayer, and temporarily dropping its price from $30 to $15 for iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps. The Slingbox 350 and 500 go on sale this Sunday. The announcement isn't a complete surprise. The devices were spotted earlier this month on the shelves of a Best Buy by Dave Zatz. And it's been four years since the last Slingbox hardware release; that's eons in gadget years. In that time, Slingbox was bought by satellite company EchoStar. Slingbox is a makeshift solution to cable's slow move onto the Internet and mobile devices. There are a host of business reasons these companies don't stream all their content on demand to any device with an Internet connection. For example, content is still expensive to produce and advertisers pay less for online placement than they do for television airtime. It's estimated that by the end of 2012, 3.58 million people in the United States will have opted out of cable for alternative services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime according to the Convergence Consulting Group. These consumers, called cord cutters, will only account for 3.6% of subscribers. Not enough to leave behind a profitable-but-aging business model just yet. Cord cutters cobble together an alternative to cable using a combination of services and sometimes illegal streaming sites. It can be hard work that requires time and a larger amount of technical know-how than many cable subscribers are likely to have. Many shows are available for streaming, but the market is heavily fragmented. Some shows are available for free online but delayed, others through subscription services. You can buy episodes through stores like iTunes or download official apps for the channels you like. Some of the solutions only work if you have cable, like the HBO Go app that requires you also have a cable subscription. The Slingbox is a pat solution for people willing to pay for cable or satellite subscriptions, who want to watch shows on other devices (a trend called ""place shifting""). It does have its limitations. Only one person can control the TV at a time, so if you're trying to stream ""True Blood"" from a hotel in New York while your husband and kids are watching ""SpongeBob"" at home in California, their channel will change. However, it is still one of the better options in a market of imperfect solutions. Until cable companies and content creators embrace Ã  la carte television, tools like Slingbox are a necessary stopgap for a lot of people.","Slingbox lets you watch what's playing on your TV from a mobile device or computer .

"(CNN) -- Crowds of angry Muslims attacked Buddhist shrines and homes, torching some of them Sunday in Bangladesh to protest after a photo of a partially burned Quran was posted on Facebook, police said. The protesters chanted anti-Buddhist slogans, blaming the burning of the Muslim holy book on a Buddhist boy, district police superintendent Saleem Jahangir said. The boy is tagged in the photo but did not post it himself, Jahangir said. The boy's account has been deleted and police are not naming him. The violence began in Ramu in Cox's Bazar, a town south of the capital Dhaka on the coast, early Sunday and it spread in the adjacent areas through Sunday evening, Jainul Bari, administrative chief of the tourist district, told CNN. ""We've called in army along with paramilitary troopers and police who were constantly guarding the areas to ward off any further violence,"" Bari said. At least seven temples were burned in Ramu and five others were damaged in other areas, police said. At least 50 houses were damaged or destroyed, they said. Police were not able to provide information on the number of people injured in the violence. ""Now the situation is under control,"" Jahangir said. Bangladesh Home Minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, who visited the scene of the violence Sunday, said blamed the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party for the attacks. The minister said the violence was planned, citing evidence of gunpowder and petrol found in the burnt monasteries and houses. The government formed a committee to investigate the violence, with a report due in 10 days. The south Asian nation is about 90% Muslim, the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimated in its 2011 survey of the global Muslim population. It is less than 1% Buddhist. Actual or reported Quran burning has led to violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Relatively peaceful Bangladesh was one of many countries that saw demonstrations recently against the online video ""The Innocence of Muslims,"" which portrays the prophet Mohammed as a womanizer and child abuser.

"(Ars Technica) -- Buying a home video game console may soon become a lot more like buying a cell phone, according to a new report suggesting Microsoft is planning to offer a subsidized, $99 bundle including a 4GB Xbox 360 and Kinect sensor to anyone who commits to two years of a new, $15 monthly online service package. According to a report from The Verge, which cites unnamed sources, the new subsidized bundle will be available ""as early as next week"" in Microsoft's retail stores. The $15 monthly subscription would reportedly include all the online game play features of a current Xbox Live Gold subscription, alongside unspecified additional content from cable or live sports video providers. Such a new content plan could help position the Xbox much more directly as a full-service living room entertainment center, rather than primarily as a video game system. That's a transition Microsoft has been signaling for years with its slow accumulation of online entertainment apps, and one that seems somewhat natural given that entertainment apps are already more popular than online gaming on the Xbox 360. The report also fits with a recent leak that suggested Microsoft would be rolling out a ""strategy to further monetize (the) Xbox subscriber base"" in time for the holiday season. The total two-year cost for the subsidized bundle as described comes in at $459, compared to the $418 Microsoft currently charges for a 4GB Xbox 360 and Kinect bundle ($299) and two years of Xbox Live Gold ($59/year). Whether that extra cost would be worthwhile depends largely on the precise features Microsoft offers for the new monthly subscribers, and how comfortable consumers are with being essentially locked to their game system for a two-year period (Microsoft would reportedly mimic cell phone providers in charging an early termination fee to those who decide to drop out before the term is up). Economical or not, such a move would represent a major change in the way game consoles are presented to consumers. Rather than offering hardware as a loss-leader for the eventual sale of games and accessories, Microsoft would essentially be subsidizing Xbox 360 sales to attract the potentially much more lucrative flow of monthly video subscription revenue. Given the relative sizes of the current markets for console games versus video services, that might not be such a crazy idea.

"(CNN) -- Fountains of red-hot lava shot up from the intensifying Mayon volcano as the Philippines awaited an imminent eruption, the country's national news agency reported Tuesday. Tens of thousands of people have already fled their homes. More than 9,000 families -- a total of 44,394 people -- are being housed in evacuation camps after authorities raised the alert status of the country's most active volcano, Albay Province Gov. Joey Salceda said. The Philippine Institute on Volcanology and Seismology was considering ratcheting up the volcano alert to the highest level, which would mean an eruption was underway, the Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported. But officials said not everyone is heeding their warnings -- some villagers were spotted within the danger zone checking on their homes and farms on the foothills of the volcano. The government is trying to enforce a ""no man's land"" rule in the designated danger zone, with military and police instructed to double the personnel manning the nine checkpoints and double their foot patrol operation inside the restricted area, PNA reported. ""Mayon continued to show an intense level of activity during the past 24-hour observation period. Seismic activity remained elevated in number and size as the seismic network detected a total of 1,266 volcanic earthquakes,"" it said in a statement about the last 24 hours to 7 a.m. local time on Tuesday (6 p.m. ET on Monday). People in surrounding Albay Province have flocked to town centers to catch a glimpse of glowing lava cascading down the slopes of Mayon since the mountain began oozing fiery lava and belching clouds of ash last week. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video . The volcano, located about 500 km (310 miles) south of the Philippine capital of Manila, has erupted 49 times since its first documented eruption in 1616. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and devastated several towns. Its last major eruption was in 1993. Since then, it has remained restless, emitting ash and spewing lava.","Thousands of people evacuated from base of Mayon volcano in Philippines .

"(Fast Company) -- Microsoft has dialed up its competition in the search-engine wars with the introduction of a daily deals facility on Bing. Microsoft knows daily deals are the hottest meme at the moment, so its announcement is suitably cheeky and aggressively street-hawkeresque (we kid): ""Calling all bargain hunters, deal lovers, Groupon groupies and Living Social fanatics! Things just got easier"" it trumpets, making no bones about mentioning the biggest name in daily deals right now, Groupon, to gin up interest in its service. Bing Deals arrived Thursday on desktop PCs and smartphones (where it's possibly most useful) via Bing's dedicated, simpler, mobile site m.bing.com. It promises to give access to ""more than 20,000 unique offers in over 14,000 cities and towns across the U.S."" But how has Microsoft managed to amass such a diverse coverage and ad-partnership pool already, you may wonder? The answer is that Bing, unlike Google's more head-on direct competitor efforts, is actually assembling daily deal offers from sites like Groupon, Living Social, Restaurant.com ""to name a few"" into one location, making it easy to work out where you can find a super-cheap purchase, or perhaps a spontaneous birthday gift for someone. It's using technology from The Dealmap (""a leading source for people to find and share the best local deals"") to power its systems, which means as well as location-based deal discovery, you'll also be able to share results with people via email. It seems the system is spread throughout Bing, as well -- if you search for a local restaurant using Bing, then the engine will ""make sure you know"" about any deals that establishment may have available by listing them directly beneath the business details in the search window. The system appears ideal for consumers previously uninterested in deals sites like Groupon -- which may offset the slight brand erosion each of these individual sites may suffer as their deal offers are wrapped into Bing's front-end UI. In launching daily deals, Bing is stepping up its competition with Google and jumping aboard the (already bursting) daily deals bandwagon. With new data suggesting total revenues from daily deals services could reach as much as $6 billion by 2015 in the U.S. alone, this is a fast-growing market segment that Microsoft simply can't ignore. So how can Microsoft grab a share of this if it's just gathering together everyone else's deals? By selling ads to you when you surf to its pages.

"(CNN) -- South Sudan's President has reached a cease-fire deal with a rebel leader following five months of violence in the world's youngest nation. The deal signed Friday in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa comes a week after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with President Salva Kiir. During the meeting, he pushed for Kiir to hold face-to-face talks with rebel leader Riek Machar. ""I saw with my own eyes last week the stakes and the struggles in a new nation we helped courageous people create,"" Kerry said Friday after the deal. ""The people of South Sudan have suffered too much for far too long. In this most recent crisis alone, over one million people have been displaced, even more now face the prospect of famine ... there have been human rights abuses on a massive scale committed by both sides."" Thousands of people have been killed and more than 1.3 million displaced since clashes erupted in December between forces loyal to the two rivals. The parties signed an initial peace deal in January, but it fell apart days later. Kerry welcomed the new peace agreement, saying it ""could mark a breakthrough for the future"" of the young nation. ""The hard journey on a long road begins now and the work must continue,"" he said. Mark Simmonds, British foreign minister for Africa, hailed the ""long overdue step"" but noted the persistence of fighting despite the deal. ""It is essential that both sides ensure its immediate implementation and take full responsibility for the forces under their control. Only with continued engagement and the genuine commitment of both sides will South Sudan be able to pull back from catastrophe,"" he said. ""This conflict has caused innumerable deaths, forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, and brought the country to the brink of famine."" The violence started late last year after Kiir accused Machar of trying to oust him through a coup, a charge he denied. Since the attempted coup, violence spread rapidly, with reports of their forces conducting mass killings nationwide. The violence ran down ethnic lines --- the Nuer tribe backs the rebel leader while the President hails from the Dinka tribe. In April, militia seized the strategic oil town of Bentiu, separated terrified residents by ethnicity and slaughtered at least 400, the United Nations said. South Sudan celebrated its independence from Sudan three years ago after an internationally brokered referendum.

"(CNN) -- Adolescent kids retreat to their rooms when you try to ask them how they are and hide out with their friends so often that they spend less and less time with family, right? Maybe not so much, according to a new study. In the nearly 200 families tracked, kids generally spent increasing amounts of one-on-one time with parents in their early adolescent years. Time with the folks started to drop when they were about 15. The time teens spend specifically with their dads may have critical benefits, the study from Pennsylvania State University found. The more time spent alone with their fathers, the higher their self-esteem; the more time with their dads in a group setting, the better their social skills. Your father, yourself: 4 women look back on their dads . ""The stereotype that teenagers spend all their time holed up in their rooms or hanging out with friends is, indeed, just a stereotype,"" said Susan McHale, director of the Social Science Research Institute at Penn State. ""Our research shows that, well into the adolescent years, teens continue to spend time with their parents and that this shared time, especially shared time with fathers, has important implications for adolescents' psychological and social adjustment."" Researchers studied families with at least two children over a period of seven years. ""It's very rare to have longitudinal data over such a long period of time for four members of a family,"" said Ann Crouter, dean of Penn State's College of Health and Human Development. ""It takes an incredible amount of time and effort to mount a study of this kind."" The researchers caution that the study was not representative of the whole country. The families studied are ""almost exclusively European American, working- and middle-class families living in small cities, towns, and rural communities."" Further studies are needed to look at more diverse samples of the U.S. population, they say. The study, published in the journal Child Development, found that kids spend less and less time with their parents in group settings as they go through their preteen and teenage years. But one-on-one time increases up until about age 12 and then stays relatively flat before starting to decline a bit around age 15, says Crouter. Parents spend roughly seven to eight hours a week in group settings with their kids ages 8 to 15, the study found. Mothers get in about an hour and 15 minutes alone with their firstborn kids and more than an hour and a half with second-born kids each week. Dads get in just over an hour of one-on-one time with first- and second-born kids each week. Numerous other studies have found benefits for kids who spend more time with their families, such as fewer delinquent behaviors and less likelihood to give in to peer pressure, the study notes. In this study, the findings about fathers proved to be very interesting, Crouter said. While increased time with Dad showed key benefits for self-esteem and ""social competence,"" time with Mom did not show the same correlations. ""In two-parent families, the mother's role as caregiver is so scripted that her involvement can easily go unnoticed and unacknowledged,"" researchers note. Meanwhile, kids whose fathers spend one-on-one time with them ""may develop higher general self-worth because their fathers go beyond social expectations to devote undivided attention to them."" Also, time with dad often involves ""joking, teasing, and other playful interactions,"" the study says. ""Fathers, as compared to mothers, were more involved in leisure activities"" and had more ""peer-like interaction"" with their children, which is ""crucial for youth social development."" Daughter's in love, Dad feels jilted . There's also the possibility that time with dad goes hand-in-hand with self-esteem for another reason: Some fathers may be more ""drawn to"" their children who ""have higher self-worth and social competence,"" the researchers suggest. They point to another study that found dads are more affected by their kids' personalities than moms are in how they parent. So in some cases, dads spending more time with certain kids may be the result of the kids being more social -- not the cause of it. ""This doesn't mean that mothers aren't important!"" McHale said. ""The youth in this sample were in general well-adjusted, suggesting that there were good things going on in their families on the whole."" Another previous study found that children who spent more one-on-one time with their mothers were less often depressed; that correlation was not there with fathers. Parents who have a son and a daughter generally spend more time alone with the child of the same sex, the Penn State study found. And parents generally spend a bit more time with second-born children, bolstering previous studies suggesting that parents learn from their experiences with their first children and are better able to maintain close relationships with the younger children during adolescent years, the study says. Other studies have busted stereotypes about dads, including how much time they spend with their children. The Families and Work Institute found (PDF) that dads spend substantially more time with their kids under age 13 than they did decades ago. As of 2008, employed fathers spent about three hours a day with their children, while employed mothers spend nearly four hours.

"Washington (CNN) -- The rules for takeoffs and landings at Newark Liberty International Airport have changed after two planes came within yards of colliding last month, the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday. United Express Flight 4100, an Embraer ERJ-145 operated by ExpressJet, was cleared to take off on runway 4R at the same time United Airlines Flight 1243, a Boeing 737, was landing on the intersecting runway 29 on April 24. The 737 flew 135 yards vertically and 50 yards laterally from the smaller regional jet. ""The FAA has investigated the recent air traffic incident at Newark and has taken steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future,"" according to a statement from the agency. Runway 29 is no longer used for arriving flights when planes are taking off on the intersecting runway 4R. In the April incident, on air traffic control radio captured by the website LiveATC.net, the tower can be heard telling the pilot of the 737 to ""go around"" and circle the airport. The controller told the ERJ to watch out for the larger plane on the right. ""Yeah, we were putting the nose down, and, he was real close,"" the pilot responds. Close calls at Newark have happened before, including four in 2008, according to a Department of Transportation inspector general's report. In one instance, on January 16, 2008, a 737 from Continental Airlines (which has since merged with United) was at risk of hitting an Embraer 145 operating as Continental Express. It happened at the same intersection and involved the same type of aircraft as April incident, but the planes never got within a mile of each other. That case was attributed to a mistake by an air traffic controller. The National Transportation Safety Board will not make a determination of what caused the most recent incident until it releases its final report, which is expected to take months. United Airlines is working with the agency to investigate the incident, an airline spokeswoman has told CNN. CNN's Laura Dolan contributed to this report.","The FAA changes runway rules at site of near miss at Newark Airport in April .

"(WIRED) -- The ability to control a Windows desktop with a simple hand gesture could become reality sooner than we once thought. The Daily got a sneak peek at two Microsoft-developed Windows 8 notebook prototypes with built-in Kinect sensors. The system would allow for gesture recognition in portable devices for the first time. The prototypes ""appear to be Asus netbooks"" and ""feature an array of small sensors stretching over the top of the screen where the webcam would normally be,"" The Daily reported. 3-D gesture control on a laptop could offer more interactive, Kinect-style PC gaming, as well as new computer interfaces and ways to control one's notebook. Microsoft opened up its Kinect SDK to developers in June, and recently said it would be bringing Kinect to desktop PCs in 2012. The Xbox Kinect console itself is already in 18 million households the world over. Although Microsoft popularized it, the 3-D gesture recognition space is rapidly becoming a hot area of innovation. Another company, SoftKinetic, is working on similar technology aimed at the notebook market. Using a different technology than what the Kinect currently incorporates, the SoftKinetic system can sense motion as close as 5.9 inches away. And then there's LG and Samsung, whose upcoming Smart TVs have taken a cue from Microsoft, and will incorporate Kinect-style gesture recognition, along with other forms of interface control like voice control, and touchscreen remotes. Although Microsoft is demonstrating and testing this technology, finished Kinect-based portable products may not come straight from Redmond, but rather from developers or OEMs. Windows 8 is set to debut in beta in February. We should start seeing finished Windows 8 products (notebooks and tablets) arriving toward the middle and end of this year. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- Should a sporting event be allowed to continue if a key participant dies during competition? Golf's European Tour insisted it should be following the death of Alastair Forsyth's caddie Iain McGregor on the final day of the Madeira Islands Open Sunday. Known affectionately as Mac by his friends, McGregor collapsed on the fairway with a suspected heart attack as Forsyth was playing the ninth hole -- the last of his round -- and was later pronounced dead. After an initial indefinite suspension of play, and discussions with a number of players and caddies, the European Tour decided the tournament should be completed. ""Everyone at the European Tour extends our deepest sympathies to the friends and family of Iain at this time,"" read a European Tour statement. ""Following consultation with the players and caddies involved, however, it has been decided that play should continue and the tournament should finish."" Forsyth, who revealed the 52-year-old Zimbabwean's death was one of the toughest experiences he has ever had to deal with, backed the European Tour's decision, insisting McGregor would have expected the show to go on. ""Everybody is in shock. To see that happen to someone in front of your eyes -- I don't know how or when you get over that,"" Forsyth told the European Tour's official website. ""Myself and playing partners Adam (Gee) and Tano (Goya) met tournament officials and spoke to (European Tour chief executive) George O'Grady on the phone before taking the decision to play on, because we felt that was what Mac would have wanted."" Forsyth went on to pay a glowing tribute to a friend and colleague that leaves behind a daughter. ""He was a guy I've known for 15 years and was very popular amongst the caddies. Obviously my thoughts go out to his family at this time. For something like this to happen so suddenly is so sad,"" he said. ""He's was far too young for this to happen. He was the life and soul of the caddies' lounge and a nice guy who will be sorely missed. I'm absolutely numb."" But while Forsyth welcomed the European Tour's decision to play on, it was a move that did not prove to be a unanimous one among the Scot's peers, with Sweden's Joel Sjoholm, who had previously worked with the caddie, leading the way, expressing his disbelief that the event had continued. Sjoholm's state of shock and disbelief was shared by many. Prior to McGregor's collapse, the tournament had been reduced to 36 holes due to adverse weather conditions. Daniel Brooks eventually went on to claim the Madeira Islands Open title, beating Scott Henry in a playoff at the Clube de Golf do Santo da Serra. Brooks, however, was unable to bask in the glory of his maiden European Tour win, given the day's tragic events that had occurred earlier in the afternoon. ""It's great to get a win, but it's not nice to do it in these circumstances,"" he told the European Tour's official website. ""It's horrible what happened out there so my condolences go out to all of his family.""","Caddie Iain McGregor dies after suspected heart attack at Madeira Islands Open .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A 13-year-old boy is in intensive care in Beijing after two adults assaulted him by releasing compressed air into his body using a mechanical pump at an automobile repair shop. Chinese media reported that the boy, Du Chuanwang, who lives in Shandong Province on China's east coast, suffered from dozens of puncture wounds in his intestines and multiple organ failure. The boy helped out at the auto repair shop, where two co-workers allegedly inserted the nozzle of an air pump into his anus and filled his body with air. The suspects have been detained. Local police posted a message last week on Sina Weibo, China's microblogging site, saying that the two men pushed the boy to the ground during the attack, and that the incident was a ""prank."" Ai Qingze, the head of the Shandong hospital where Du received initial treatment, told the China Daily newspaper that upon seeing his inflated belly, the surgeons there cut his abdomen open to expel the gas and saw that his small intestines were bleeding. Ai said the boy's liver, kidneys and stomach were also damaged. Family members of forced abortion victim in China cite continued harassment . Du was in a coma for eight days following the assault. He woke up three days ago and was transferred to the intensive care unit at Bayi Children's Hospital in Beijing on Thursday. ""We can only provide the necessary life support to him for now, as his condition is very complicated, and the doctors have not yet devised a final treatment plan,"" a hospital official told CNN. Hospital officials declined to give more details about Du's current condition. Angel Mom, a charity group that helped arrange the hospital transfer, posted on Weibo that Du has a serious nose infection that is causing necrosis. A photo in the post shows massive decay of the boy's nose and cheek. The post also said that after 20 hours of treatment, the boy's digestive tract has stopped bleeding, and his acid and electrolyte levels have returned to normal. Du's father, uncle and grandfather went along to Beijing. The boy's mother died six years ago. Police handling of alleged sexual assault in China sparks uproar . The family said they earn around 5,000 yuan ($780) per year from a small plot of land. ""We sent him to the repair shop because our family is close with the owner,"" said the grandfather. ""Since his mother passed away, his dad hoped the owner of the repair shop could take care of him. We think of the owner as the boy's guardian."" The repair shop owner did not pay him money but bought him clothes and other items, according to the grandfather. He said the teenager does not actually work there but helps with simple tasks. China Daily reported that his treatment at the first hospital, in Shandong, cost about 100,000 yuan, and that the repair shop owner paid for 60% of it. Angel Mom said it has received over 400,000 yuan in donations for the boy but has since suspended the donation drive, as the money seems to be enough for his treatment for now -- it would start accepting donations again if more funds are needed. The family said Du's father had received 101,500 yuan of the donations so far. Deadly ax assault in China spurs online buzz .

"(CNN) -- Can the media get over their collective obsession with weight? Fat chance. For some strange reason, here we are again, talking about Michelle Obama's derriere. And, for good measure, Chris Christie's girth. Watch: Why is Washington Post highlighting Michelle Obama's rear? It's easy, it's fun, it's good for clicks and ratings. It's also kinda cheap. The Washington Post used a pretty flimsy peg -- Alabama high school football coach Bob Grisham caught on tape -- to run a Style section piece on the weighty issue. ""Fat butt Michelle Obama,"" the coach is heard saying, declaring her overweight. Grisham was suspended by the school (he says he misspoke). But this is national news? Really? Talk Back: Should Christie be shamed into losing weight? Of course, the paper dressed it up with highfalutin' sociology. ""The focus on this first lady's posterior has historical antecedents,"" the article says, launching into questions about how black women have long faced scrutiny about their bodies. Well, maybe. And yes, Rush Limbaugh and Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner have sounded off about Obama's bottom. And yes, the fact that she has mounted an anti-obesity campaign does sort of put her in the crossfire. Watch: Chris Christie's doughnut diplomacy with Letterman . But as the Post acknowledges, Michelle Obama is a 5-foot-11-inch woman with toned arms who is widely viewed as being in good shape. She's not a triathlete; she's a working mother of two. So when the story asks, ""What is it with Michelle Obama's critics and the fixation with her derriere?"" I would turn that question around. What is the media fixation with publicizing it every time some bozo sounds off about her backside? This is an uncomfortable reminder that the media business celebrates models bordering on anorexic, making perfectly proportioned young girls and women feel heavy because they don't have superthin (and often airbrushed) celebrity bodies. This may help promote the fashion industry, which considers normal women plus-size, but it bears little relation to real life. Christie is a different case. Having endured endless jokes about his oversized frame, the New Jersey governor shrewdly decided the best path was to poke fun at himself. Watch: Is Facebook over? More friends taking 'vacations' from site . So he appeared on David Letterman's couch this week, one of his chief tormenters, and promptly shoved a doughnut into his mouth. He allowed that he didn't mind fat jokes if they're funny. It was self-deprecating humor that showed Christie to be a real human being. But the truth is that the teasing does bother Christie. And there is a serious question here beneath the laughter. Christie is grossly overweight, and his health would be a legitimate issue if he runs for president in 2016. Which, as you may have noticed, is four years from now. Doughnuts aside, Christie treated the matter more seriously at a news conference, saying that he's ""remarkably healthy"" but that ""my doctor continues to warn me that my luck is going to run out relatively soon."" The governor showed he had lost none of his feistiness after Connie Mariano, a former White House physician, said on CNN: ""I worry that he may have a heart attack, he may have a stroke. ... I worry about this man dying in office."" Christie upbraided her Wednesday for diagnosing him without an examination: ""She must be a genius. She should probably be the surgeon general of the United States."" He said she was just another hack seeking ""her five minutes on TV."" Well, you started it with your doughnut diplomacy, Governor. Watch: Doonesbury's plea to save newspapers (and his strip) If Christie becomes a White House contender, everything is fair game. He can hardly complain about other folks after his ""Late Show"" shtick. But I can't help but think it is easier for pundits to pontificate about Christie's weight than to examine his record in Trenton. Everyone who has worried about those extra pounds can relate to the story, but the coverage is out of hand. If I never read another word about Michelle Obama's behind, I may go celebrate with a Krispy Kreme. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Media obsessed with Chris Christie and Michelle Obama's weight .

"(CNN) -- Broken bodies of children. A dead mother. A wailing father. That was the scene outside of a school in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, where authorities said more than 100 people were killed Friday in fighting between security forces and al Qaeda-backed Sunni fighters. The fighting follows news a day earlier that militants tried to take control of the city of Samarra to the south, violence spurred in part by an escalating conflict between Iraq's majority Shiite government and a Sunni minority who claim they are disenfranchised. The violence has left hundreds dead in recent months, raising fears it could return Iraq to the level of violence in 2006 and 2007, when bodies littered the streets. Nearly 500,000 people are estimated to have been displaced this year in fighting, primarily in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, the United Nations refugee agency said Friday. But that number is expected to climb, said Adrian Edwards, the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees. On Friday, Hares Hammadi al-Bajari was among dozens trying to flee the fighting in Mosul, where militants were attacking police stations and security checkpoints. With a round-the-clock curfew in effect that banned people from driving, Bajari, a taxi driver, set out on foot with his family to try to make it to safety in the nearby Kurdish-controlled Duhok province. ""Kurdish security forces were welcoming families,"" police Lt. Salah Othman said. But as Bajari neared the checkpoint on the outskirts of Mosul's al-Zahraa neighborhood, according to Othman, fighting resumed. The family was forced to regroup outside a school to wait for a lull in the fighting and try again, he said. That's when a barrage of mortars struck near the building, landing among the families. A video posted on Facebook purports to show the aftermath of the bombing. A man can be heard screaming: ""Let them see. ... See these children? See what's left from the mortar round? They are targeting women, and these dead children."" The footage shows the bodies of a number of children, including some missing body parts. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the video. But it correlates with the description of the attack given to CNN by Othman. At least 17 people were killed in that attack, according to Iraqi health officials. Another 55 people, including 22 Iraqi police and 33 militants, were killed and 43 wounded in fighting that broke out across the city, the health officials said. Scores more were killed when gunmen and several suicide bombers attacked an Iraqi munitions storage in western Mosul, security forces said. By nightfall, Iraqi security forces had retaken control of a number of the police stations and checkpoints, authorities said. The fighting in Mosul mirrored an attack a day earlier in Samarra, when gunmen attacked security checkpoints and took control of portions of the city. The attackers are believed to be members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, an al Qaeda splinter group also known by its acronym ISIS.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- An explosion on an oil tanker off the Japanese coast set off a huge fire Thursday and left the vessel's captain missing. Ships and aircraft battled the blaze on the Shoko Maru, a 998-ton tanker anchored about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the port of Himeji in western Japan, the coast guard said. Rescuers have recovered seven members of the eight-person crew, the coast guard said, but the ship's 64-year-old captain is still missing. Four of the rescued crew remembers were seriously injured in the blast, the Himeji fire department said, and all seven of them were taken to hospitals after arriving in the port, which is about 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Osaka on the Seto Inland Sea. The tanker wasn't loaded when the blast went off Thursday morning, the coast guard said, reducing fears of a major environmental disaster. Video footage showed water cannons dousing the stricken ship as large black plumes of smoke rose from a blaze roaring inside its body. Later images showed the tanker scorched, smoldering and listing to one side. There was no immediate danger to other ships, as the tanker was located outside of the port facility, the coast guard said, adding that an exclusion zone was being set up around the damaged vessel. The coast guard said it was still investigating the cause the explosion on the ship, which belongs to Shoho Shopping Co. Ltd, a company based in Hiroshima, Japan.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese police intercepted more than 3,600 crocodiles last week that were destined for dinner plates in the country's Guangdong province. The Siamese crocodiles were seized Tuesday in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region after they crossed over the China-Vietnam border, according to reports in the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency. Officials believe they were headed for restaurants in southern China -- known for its exotic dining options. Several of the crocodiles died from heatstroke during transportation, officials said, while the others are being treated by veterinarians. The Siamese crocodile, which can grow as long as 13 feet (3.96 meters) is one of the world's most endangered reptiles, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Hunting and habitat disruption has led the species to near extinction in the wild but they are extensively farmed in Thailand and Cambodia. Zheng Yuanying of the Green Eye of China environmental protection group told Britain's The Guardian that a strong black market has persisted in the region despite government efforts to crack down on exotic animal smuggling. ""Although people all know it is illegal to eat these wild creatures, they will still eat them as long as the market sells them. What's needed is a long-term, stronger campaign to explain to people why they shouldn't eat crocodile,"" he said. Earlier this month, China met with other Asian countries to enhance collaboration between countries to combat illegal wildlife trafficking, according to a report by TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network. The provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China accounted for 68.3% of the national trafficking total in 2011, according to the report.","Chinese police intercepted more than 3,600 crocodiles near China-Vietnam border .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Wang Jingyao creaks open a metal door to let us into his cramped apartment. In a modest living room, he shows us a meticulously kept shrine to his wife. ""My wife had always been a kind person since she was young. She was kind-hearted and gentle,"" he says. The photos come from a different era in China. One shows Wang and his wife, Bian Zhongyun, shoulder to shoulder and smiling at the camera. They made a handsome couple. Both joined the Communist Party in the heady post-revolution years of the early 1950s. Wang was a historian at the Chinese Academy of Science. Bian became a respected educator at an elite Beijing middle school. They dreamed of helping the Party build a new China. But just a few years later, Party loyalty proved no protection for Bian. As the madness of the Cultural Revolution engulfed Beijing, she became the first victim. ""We trusted the Party, but no one ever thought it would become a party that murders people,"" says Wang. Red Guards, Mao's enforcers . In one sense, the events that led up to Bian's death began with the bruised ego of Mao Zedong. In the early 1960s, China's great revolutionary hero was still smarting from the catastrophic failure of the Great Leap Forward, a policy of collective farming and industry that directly and indirectly caused the deaths of millions of Chinese. Mao called on a new revolution to stamp out what he called bourgeois and counter-revolutionary influences. Conveniently, for Mao, the ensuing chaos helped shore up his personality cult and get rid of his political opponents. The early enforcers were the Red Guards, a proxy army of children and young adults that violently struck out at anyone not toeing the Maoist line. Intellectuals, educators as well as artifacts were all targeted. A favorite method was to whip their elders with the heavy metal buckles on their leather belts. But this was no random chaos. ""There was absolutely a top down approach to the violence and there is plenty of evidence that everything was very carefully planned,"" says historian Frank DikÃ¶tter. ""There were constant messages going from the Party to the students. There was nothing spontaneous about it."" Beatings, then an awful climax . The trouble started in the early summer at Bian's school in Beijing. Led by their leader Song Binbin, the students labeled Bian as a counter-revolutionary and ""opposing Chairman Mao,"" according to historian Wang Youqin, who attended the school at the time. Soon the attacks got physical with Bian and other teachers put through so-called ""struggle-sessions."" ""Students ran onto the stage to strike Bian with iron-clad wooden training rifles. Each time Bian fell to the floor, someone would douse her with cold water and drag her upright again by the hair to endure further criticism,"" says Wang. Bian reached out to the Party to stop the beatings but she got no reply. Despite the obvious risks, Bian kept returning to the school. Perhaps she felt there was nowhere to hide. On the afternoon of August 5, 1966, the beatings reached their awful climax. 'We couldn't stop the beatings' The students of '66 are now in their 60s. I meet a group of them in a teahouse in Beijing. They have had careers and full lives but all seem haunted by the bloody events of that August. Liu Jin was a student leader at the school when the Red Guards targeted Bian. ""I didn't know what to do,"" she says, ""I blame myself for not stopping it."" ""We couldn't stop the beating, because it would have been doing something against the trend. I respected Ms. Bian, but I was too afraid to say anything,"" says Feng Jinglan, another former student. The mob beat Bian for three hours. They used the legs of their school desks spiked with nails. ""She looked miserable. I could never forget this. She lay on the ground, her eyes were blurry, she was foaming at the mouth,"" recalls Liu. She says they carried Bian in a wheelbarrow to a hospital across the street from the school. Wang Jingyao got the news about his wife in a phone call from the school. ""They told me that she was injured and I should go. So I went with my four children,"" says Wang, ""I remember that hospital very clearly."" Sensing the worst, Wang took a camera. He took pictures of his mortally wounded wife as evidence. The images are haunting and graphic. In one, his four children stand over their mother who lies on a gurney still clutching her handbag. ""I laid a cloth over her face so my youngest wouldn't see. She had already passed,"" says Wang. No charges, no justice . The authorities quickly cremated the body and no one has ever been charged despite, presumably, hundreds of witnesses. Instead of condemning the murder, Mao seemed to embrace it. Just days later, he held a mass rally for the Red Guards in Tiananmen Square where Song Binbin presented a Red Guard armband to the Chairman. The official sanction of the violence was complete. ""After Song Binbin presented the armband to Mao, the number of murders increased massively,"" says Wang Youqin, who has obsessively tracked the killings by interviewing hundreds of family members. ""The Red Guards killed almost 2,000 people in the first two weeks alone."" She says they only stopped when the Beijing municipal government eventually called them to halt in September. The Cultural Revolution would drag on for a decade. In a society where educators and elders are traditionally revered, the brutal violence against teachers shocked many, but over the decades, the Communist Party has helped erase discussion of the stain on their history, and the violence is rarely discussed in public. But that may be changing. Breaking the taboo . Over the past year, those closest to the events are tentatively trying to break the taboo. Song Binbin, Liu Jin and a handful of former classmates publicly apologized for the killing of Bian. ""I participated in the revolution voluntarily, no one forced me,"" says Liu, ""but after Bian's death my faith was turned. I had to question my beliefs."" All of the former students we interviewed said they were powerless to stop the killing. Song declined to be interviewed. But their apologies haven't led to a widespread reckoning with the past. And few, if any, believe the Communist Party will tackle the issue. ""There is hardly a person within the Cultural Revolution whose hands are not dirty in some way. It is socially and politically explosive and that is why the apologies are not likely to go much further than they have already,"" says DikkÃ¶ter. For Wang Jingyao, they are too little, too late. He says he still wants justice for his wife's murder. ""I can't accept them, the so-called apologies are hypocritical and not sincere. They just want to cover up their involvement,"" he said, ""they just want to slip away unpunished and turn this page over.""","Decades later, former students apologize for failing to stop teacher's murder .

"(CNN) -- As divers searched frigid waters off South Korea in low visibility, hoping to save hundreds of passengers, a dominant theory began to emerge about how the ferry sank. It most likely struck something in the water, said Peter Boynton, a retired U.S. Coast Guard captain. ""The speed with which this ferry began to list and then roll over on its side suggests significant damage, most likely causing major flooding that would cause a vessel of this size -- almost 500 feet long -- to quickly roll onto its side. That's very likely the result of significant damage,"" he said. Some passengers reported hearing a loud bang before the ship began sinking. That could be from cargo shifting or ""some other internal damage,"" Boynton told CNN's ""New Day."" ""But it does sound, from initial reports, it was more likely that something was struck."" When the ship left Seoul, it traveled through fog, which may have put it off course, said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general for the Department of Transportation. ""So if they hit something, that would have meant they were out of the channel, which is quite easy to do,"" Schiavo said. 'We are not dead yet' passengers texted . But the South Korean Oceans and Fisheries Ministry said Thursday that the ferry did not deviate significantly from its intended route. The agency approved the ferry's intended route, and ""there was no huge difference between their plan and the actual track chart,"" spokesman Nam Jae Heon said. Schiavo said other possibilities include engine failure or an explosion, particularly in the engine room. ""But that probably alone wouldn't account for the sinking this quickly. It probably was something else that happened,"" she said. Making matters worse, the ferry carried dozens of vehicles. Once an auto deck is breached, ""it's typically open to very significant flooding,"" Boynton said. That could explain ""why the ferry in just a matter of hours began to roll onto its side so quickly."" Coast guard and navy ships, as well as fishing boats, rushed into the area. The challenge ahead . For rescue divers, a combination of factors makes saving people especially difficult: very cold waters, strong currents and low visibility, made worse by nightfall. ""The underwater challenges are very, very significant and pose, I would think, tremendous risk for the people who I'm sure are doing their best to help,"" Boynton said. For the passengers, the most immediate danger is the cold. ""Pretty much everyone we saw was wearing a life jacket,"" journalist Andrew Salmon reported on CNN International. ""So the concern is hypothermia. If you're not picked up within two hours, you're in significant danger -- your body core goes cold."" Can they survive in air pockets?

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court ruled for a Pennsylvania woman accused of violating laws tied to a chemical-weapons treaty when she attacked the other woman in a love triangle. The justices by a unanimous vote on Monday concluded the government overstepped its authority when prosecuting Carol Anne Bond, as part of the country's obligations enforcing a chemical weapons agreement. At issue was whether Congress may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is otherwise the domain of the states. Bond was given a long prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of using potentially lethal chemicals against a romantic rival. She would have likely gotten a much shorter sentence under state law. The decision sends the case back to lower courts, which could vacate the conviction. The case of toxic love has soap-opera elements, but Bond's lawyers argued she was being treated like a foreign terrorist instead of someone caught up in an act of personal revenge against a friend. ""The global need to prevent chemical warfare does not require the federal government to reach into the kitchen cupboard,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his narrowly framed opinion, ""or to treat a local assault with a chemical irritant as the deployment of a chemical weapon."" Beyond this fact-specific dispute, the case touched on larger concerns about the strength and purpose of the Constitution's 10th Amendment, designed to preserve state power. It is also a question roiling the current political debate, especially among tea party conservatives in this post-9/11, security-conscious environment. The court majority largely avoided those questions in its ruling. Roberts said the facts of the case limited their scope. ""This exceptional convergence of factors gives us serious reason to doubt the government's expansive reading of the [law], and calls for us to interpret the statute more narrowly."" Bond, a native of Barbados, lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist. As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case: ""Bond was excited when her closest friend, Myrlinda Haynes, announced she was pregnant. Bond's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband, Clifford Bond, was the child's father. She vowed revenge."" The woman, known to her family as Betty, struck back by stealing dangerous a chemical -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine -- from her company. She also obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet. Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic, even lethal harm with very little physical contact. The 42-year-old then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months, secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob, car door handles, and a mailbox. While suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb, Haynes grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder. After getting little help from local police, in 2007 she called postal inspectors, who set up surveillance cameras. Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and a car muffler, court records show. She was soon arrested. Bond admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill Haynes, but only wanted to cause her ""an uncomfortable rash."" The defendant also said her friend's betrayal caused an ""emotional breakdown"" that made her respond in such a shocking fashion. Instead of being charged with simple assault, which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison, Bond was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and -- the bombshell -- two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty on the possession and use of ""chemical weapons."" When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court, Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed. She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $12,000 in fines and restitution. She was released in August 2012. There are about 1,000 treaties signed by the United States currently on the books. Many academics and lawmakers had hoped the majority right-leaning bench will use this opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th Amendment, which states, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."" In the broader political context, a bipartisan sphere of Americans worry the federal government and Congress have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states, especially in the criminal arena. And it is not just felonies. Areas like gun ownership, zoning laws, environmental regulations, taxation, health care, and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of this high court decision. While agreeing the prosecution of Bond was improper, three other members of the court-- Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito -- would have gone farther and said the court should decide whether the law was a proper exercise of federal power. ""We have here a supposedly 'narrow' opinion which, in order to be 'narrow,' sets forth interpretive principles never before imagined that will bedevil our jurisprudence (and proliferate litigation) for years to come. The immediate product of these interpretive novelties is a statute that should be the envy of every lawmaker bent on trapping the unwary with vague and uncertain criminal prohibitions,"" said Scalia. He added that the majority ""enables the fundamental constitutional principle of limited federal powers to be set aside by the President and Senate's exercise of the treaty power. We should not have shirked our duty and distorted the law to preserve that assertion; we should have welcomed and eagerly grasped the opportunity-- nay, the obligation-- to consider and repudiate it."" Some of Bond's supporters argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh, creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety. They see Bond as an unexpected hero in the fight to return ""the power back to the people."" ""The proposition that the Treaty Clause is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said when the case was argued in December. Bond had won an earlier Supreme Court appeal, with a unanimous ruling she had ""standing,"" or legal authority, to pursue her claims in the courts. That allowed her to continue trying to have her federal conviction tossed out, which was the current issue before the justices. Her lawyers say she had been trying in recent years to repair her shaken marriage, and has come to terms with her husband's betrayal. The case is Bond v. U.S. (12-158).","Carol Anne Bond challenged her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge .

"(CNN) -- If a blue-eyed, chisel-cheeked mugshot can make an Internet sensation of a criminal suspect, can the law be far behind? In this case, it's a lawman -- specifically, a San Francisco street cop whose in-uniform images are making him a cyber-celebrity with a badge. San Francisco Police Officer Chris Kohrs -- the ""Hot Cop of Castro"" to his fans and friends -- became a viral sensation after a stranger created a Facebook page in his honor, nicknaming him after Castro Street, where Kohrs was posted at the time. The Facebook page has received close to 19,000 likes in about three weeks. ""I was out there one day doing traffic control and some guys asked if they could have photos of me and I consented. It kind of went viral from there,"" the 36-year-old Kohrs said in a phone interview with CNN. Kohrs' Facebook page creator Nathan Tatterson told CNN it all started with his friend's photo of Kohrs sitting on his motorcycle. ""Other people in the neighborhood starting recognizing the 'Hot Cop of Castro' and started taking and posting their own photos,"" said Tatterson. ""Once people started recognizing Officer Kohrs, they started chatting with him and realized that he wasn't just a pretty face. He was funny, nice, respectful, with a huge dose of charm and humility. He also clearly loved his job."" User comments ranged from praise (""One of San Francisco's Police Finest!"") to a touch risquÃ© (""Crime has increased in the Castro with men of all stripes begging to be arrested and punished on the spot.""). Kohrs, who has been on the police force for six years, said it was ""all a shock"" to him. ""I've never met the person that created the Facebook page. I'm not even on Facebook,"" he said laughing. His new-found fame follows on the trail of convicted felon Jeremy Meeks, whose mugshot stirred a collective swoon nationwide after authorities in Stockton, California, posted it on social media in June. In his case, Kohrs sees an unintended, broader benefit of the online publicity for one cop on the street. ""It has strengthened the bond between the community and the police,"" he says. Kohrs laughs at the suggestion of becoming a model or an actor -- he is dedicated to his job of service as an officer, including responding to 911 calls, and he takes the work seriously. ""We are called upon to respond to some pretty bad situations and although we can't reverse what has been done, we can make a bad situation better. We can make the city a better place to live, and I think police officers have a big impact on the health and safety of the community,"" he said. ""I'm real happy here. If it's going to be this good I'm going to stay,"" he said. His Facebook fan base includes both women and men equally, with the most-repeated questions being whether he is straight or gay, single or married. Straight, single, no kids, he said. And for the record: Kohrs enjoys dining out, watching movies, snowboarding, riding motorcycles, traveling and water skiing.","A Facebook page featuring San Francisco police officer Chris Kohrs is a viral hit .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- More rain was forecast for flood-hit Beijing Wednesday, as residents continued clearing debris from the weekend deluge amid signs government censors were doing their own mop-up job on social media. On Saturday, the heaviest rain in 60 years overwhelmed Beijing's drainage system, submerging cars, houses and provoking online anger over the government's lack of preparation and response. Early Wednesday, it appeared that the disaster may have claimed the jobs of two of the city's most senior officials. However, neither resignation of the Beijing mayor or vice mayor were officially linked to the flood response. Torrential rain kills at least 28 in southern Japan . In fact, observers said the resignations could be part of routine leadership reshuffle. Media reports said the city's legislature is now in session and its agenda includes appointments and dismissals. However, soon after state media reported the resignation of Beijing mayor Guo Jinlong and vice mayor Ji Lin, comments about their departure on China's Sina Weibo were being blocked and deleted. Beijing flood victims fume at response . State media gave no reason for the resignation of vice mayor Ji Lin. However, it said mayor Guo Jinlong had stepped down following his election as secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 3. Wang Anshun, the vice Party chief of Beijing, has been appointed as vice mayor and acting mayor, Xinhua said. The departure of two of Beijing's most senior officials comes just four days after the heaviest rain in 60 years submerged large parts of the Chinese capital. Extreme weather: Get ready to see more of it, scientists say . On Sunday, state media put the official death toll in Beijing at 37. However, amid the barrage of online criticism about the government's response to the disaster, speculation swirled that the figure could be much higher. Across the country, 111 were declared dead and 47 missing. Nine million people had been affected, state media said. On Tuesday, spokeswoman Wang Hui told reporters that the government was not concealing the true death toll and that updated figures would be released as soon as they're known. ""I want to say I hope everyone will not speculate that the Beijing government is hiding the death toll,"" said Wang, according to the Associated Press. ""Doing the inspection work is not easy. Do believe us that we will speak the truth,"" she said. ""If there are new figures we will immediately tell you."" In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, comments on Weibo exposed the anger many Beijingers felt about the inability of their city's infrastructure to cope with the downpour. Devastating India floods leave 95 dead, millions homeless . The Beijing-based media group, Caixin wrote: ""Why is this happening once and again? Year after year Beijing faces the same challenge, not even hosting the Olympics can provide a solution. That's how vulnerable our capital city can be."" Another user, chuntiangushi, wrote: ""We can host the most luxurious Olympics and send satellites into space but can never seem to fix this drainage system. What a shame."" Others were angry that there were no emergency warnings, nor government shelters or special hotlines to offer flood advice. Their ire was further stirred by an announcement Tuesday that Beijing would launch a ""large"" fundraising campaign, to which local citizens would be encouraged to donate for disaster relief. ""Donation again? I won't give them a penny. I'm already paying tax. What did you do with my money?"" one user wrote. Another said: ""Chinese government is wealthy enough to help Africa, the Philippines and North Korea but they don't have the money to help its own people get over the disaster."" Mourning, search for answers as Russian flooding death toll climbs . More rain was forecast to hit Beijing late Wednesday to Thursday morning, Xinhua reported, adding that more than 50 millimeters of rain could fall on the eastern parts of the city. A yellow alert -- the third highest on a scale of five -- had been issued for the districts of Fangshan, Mentougou, Huairou, Pinggu and Shijingshan, as well as Miyun county, which are at risk of mudslides and cave-ins, Xinhua said. Saturday's downpour caused chaos across Beijing, submerging 84 cars along a 900-meter stretch of the Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau expressway. The road reopened to traffic around midday Tuesday after hundreds of rescuers spent two days pulling the cars out. A team of 10 divers worked for 10 hours straight to check the cars for occupants, Xinhua said, adding that they found three bodies. Disaster relief efforts were still underway in the worst hit district of Fangshan Wednesday, according to state media Xinhua, which published images of upturned cars and mud-soaked homes.

"London (CNN) -- Family, friends, colleagues and fans have been paying tribute to the author, archaeologist and former CNN journalist Paul Sussman, who has died suddenly. Sussman, who lived in London with his wife Alicky and their two children, Jude and Ezra, had just completed the fourth in a series of novels, based around the exploits of a gritty detective from Cairo, which had been translated into 33 languages and sold two million copies. On his Facebook page he described his feelings over its forthcoming publication: ""First proof copy of 'Labyrinth of Osiris' arrived with the postman this morning. Curiously I am more excited about this one than any of my previous novels!"" His wife, a documentary maker, on Sunday announced Sussman's death from a ruptured aneurysm, adding: ""He was a truly unique person - a brilliant Dad and adored husband. We will all miss him so, so much xxx."" Sussman, who was born in 1968, lived an extraordinary life, as he was the first to admit. ""With a father who sold ladies' underwear for a living, and an actress-turned-psychoanalyst for a mother, I suspect my life was never destined to follow a wholly conventional path."" On his website he described how after graduating with a history degree from Cambridge University which he represented at boxing, he almost entered Britain's MI6 spy service, then worked as a gravedigger in France, sold cigars in Harrod's and toured Europe acting as Aunt Sponge in a ""ground-breakingly execrable production of 'James and the Giant Peach.'"" On his return to London, Sussman worked in the advertising department of the Big Issue, a magazine and charity founded to help homeless people. Soon he was lobbying the magazine's founder and editor-in-chief John Bird to work as a writer. ""Paul wrote some stuff for us, and it was spell-binding,"" Bird told CNN. ""I don't remember anyone doing it like he did. He was just a born writer. ""The Big Issue was floundering during its first year, and it was only when people like Paul came along in 1992 that we got a reputation for good journalism. He could just do anything."" Bird recalled how Sussman's quick wit and warmth relieved the serious atmosphere at the magazine. ""My world was full of earnest people so to meet Paul was so refreshing,"" he said. ""He had an electric sense of humor and seemed to be here to tell funny stories. He also had a surprising calm: he seemed supremely confident of his abilities, but never bragged or boasted."" Sussman was always up for a challenge. When Big Issue colleagues pointed out his physical resemblance to Princess Diana's boyfriend Dodi Fayed, he agreed to be photographed for a feature in which he posed in character around London. Unfortunately, the magazine appeared on the streets the day after the death of Diana and Dodi in a car crash. Colleagues Simon Rogers and Xan Brooks remembered fondly that ""the Monday was taken up with staff frantically sticking apologies into every single copy of the magazine."" Sussman later worked for other publications including CNN.com, where he wrote features as well as vivid reportage. In 2001 he covered the chaotic funeral of Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini in Jerusalem's Old City when Israeli troops fired tear gas at a group of Palestinian youths. ""At one point I tried to take a picture of a young boy attacking a camera,"" Sussman wrote. ""Immediately I was surrounded by a crowd of teenagers shouting 'No Photo!' One raised his fist at me and shouted 'I Hamas! You understand!' ""As soon as I explained I was English, however, and not an Israeli, their anger dissipated. The one who had raised his fist at me apologized meekly."" CNN.com International's vice president, Nick Wrenn, described how Sussman's enthusiasm inspired his colleagues. ""Paul was a terrific person to work with. As well as being an outstanding journalist, he was always cheerful, always helpful. ""His natural enthusiasm lifted our spirits. He made us laugh, he made us think and he cared about people. Paul was also the master of playing down his own achievements, be it his boxing exploits, his archaeological knowledge or the fact that he became a very successful author. If you congratulated him, he'd say thanks, smile, shrug and ask about you instead."" Alongside his journalism, Sussman also worked extensively as a field archaeologist, particularly in Egypt where he took part in the first expedition to dig new ground in the Valley of the Kings since the discovery of Tutankhamun in 1922. Sussman described how he had ""the dubious honor of having discovered the only items of pharaonic jewellery to have been found in the Valley since Tut."" His archaeological knowledge, along with his unique way with words inevitably led to him writing his best-selling novels, and he was proud to be described by the Independent newspaper as ""the intelligent reader's answer to 'The Da Vinci Code.'"" Despite his success he remained down-to-earth and accessible though. Franki Popescu was just one of many fans who posted tributes on Sussman's Facebook page: ""Paul was an amazing author as everyone has already said. he always took time to respond to his fans often with a wicked sense of humour! he will be sorely missed both my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed his books and send our deepest condolences.""","Author, archaeologist and former CNN journalist Paul Sussman has died suddenly .

"(CNN) -- You can run, the saying goes. Joseph Lewis Miller spent more than 33 years hiding, ducking police for a murder charge out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to a statement from U.S. Marshal Martin Pane. Now 78, Miller was arrested Monday in Mineola, Texas, where he was living under the alias Roy Eugene Eubanks and serving as a deacon at a church, the statement said. A 1981 arrest warrant charges Miller with murder, committing crimes with a firearm, being a convict in possession of a firearm and carrying a firearm without a license. Harrisburg police accused Miller of killing Thomas Waller in a parking lot adjacent to a hotel in January 1981. ""The murder occurred more than three decades ago, and while this case presented us with a significant challenge it also exemplifies the dedication, thoroughness and diligence the fugitive task force has toward cold cases,"" Pane said. This wasn't the first time Miller was charged with murder. Miller pleaded guilty to killing John H. Lumpkins in Harrisburg in 1960, and throughout that decade, Pane said, Miller applied to have his sentence commuted, a request that was granted with lifetime state parole in 1971. Ten years later, Miller became a fugitive after Waller's death. Recently, the U.S. Marshals Service developed information on a Roy Eugene Eubanks in East Texas, the Marshals Service said. ""Working with photographs more than three decades old, Marshals believed the man named Roy Eugene Eubanks was indeed Joseph Lewis Miller,"" the statement said. Authorities put an East Texas home under surveillance Monday and soon saw a man believed to be Miller. They arrested him without incident and recovered a firearm from the home, the statement said. ""The individual admitted his true identity as Joseph Lewis Miller. He was married and a deacon in his local church,"" according to U.S. marshals. Using his alias, Miller had been receiving Social Security disability benefits for more than two decades, the statement said. He is now in custody in Wood County, Texas, where he awaits court proceedings. ""It is my sincere hope that the victims' family and the surviving victim can and will rest easier knowing the alleged perpetrator is now in custody,"" Pane said in the statement.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Obama administration will scrap the controversial missile defense shield program in Eastern Europe, a senior administration official confirmed to CNN Thursday. The U.S. has been testing the ability of ground-based interceptor missiles to hit long-range ballistic missiles. The comment followed similar statements from officials in Poland and the Czech Republic -- where key elements of the system were to be located -- but was the first confirmation from an American official. Vice President Joe Biden earlier refused to confirm to CNN that the George W. Bush-era plan was being shelved. But he did explain the logic of doing so, saying Iran -- a key concern for the United States -- was not a threat. ""I think we are fully capable and secure dealing with any present or future potential Iranian threat,"" he told CNN's Chris Lawrence in Baghdad, where he is on a brief trip. ""The whole purpose of this exercise we are undertaking is to diminish the prospect of the Iranians destabilizing that region in the world. I am less concerned -- much less concerned -- about the Iranian potential. They have no potential at this moment, they have no capacity to launch a missile at the United States of America,"" he said. Biden said he is ""deeply"" involved in the review of the missile defense program.  See how the system would work » |  See a map of the proposed sites » . The Bush administration had cited the perceived nuclear threat from Iran as one of the key reasons it wanted to install the missile shield in eastern Europe. The U.S. reversal is likely to please Russia, which had fiercely opposed the plans. Is the U.S. right to scrap plans for a missile defense shield in Europe? Sound Off below . A U.S. delegation held high-level meetings Thursday in both Poland and the Czech Republic to discuss the missile defense system. While the outcome of the meetings wasn't clear, officials in both countries confirmed the system would be scrapped. Czech Prime minister Jan Fischer said in a statement that U.S. President Barack Obama told him in a Wednesday phone call that the United States was shelving its plans. Fischer did not say what reason Obama gave him for reconsidering. A spokeswoman at the Polish Ministry of Defense also said the program had been suspended. ""This is catastrophic for Poland,"" said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named in line with ministry policy. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Gen. James E. Cartwright, who is vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday morning. The Defense Department has not announced what will be discussed, but Cartwright is the point man for the missile defense shield program. Poland  and the Czech Republic had based much of their future security policy on getting the missile defenses from the United States. The countries share deep concerns of a future military threat from the east -- namely, Russia -- and may now look for other defense assurances from their NATO allies. ""At the NATO summit in April, we adopted a resolution focusing on building a defense system against real, existing threats, i.e. short-range and medium-range missiles,"" Fischer said. ""We expect that the United States will continue cooperating with the Czech Republic on concluding the relevant agreements on our mutual (research and development) and military collaboration, including the financing of specific projects."" By contrast, Russia may view the move as a diplomatic victory after complaining about the program consistently for years. There was no comment Thursday morning from Russian officials. But the issue has been a sore point in relations between Washington and Moscow, with Russia believing the shield would ultimately erode its own strategic nuclear deterrent. With the program scrapped, it opens the way for Russia to join with the United States in taking a harder line on Iran, CNN Correspondent Matthew Chance reported from Moscow. The United States proposed the plans under then-President George W. Bush, but since taking over this year, the Obama administration has been reviewing whether to move ahead with them. The missile shield issue came up in July during a meeting between Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow. Obama maintained that Russia had nothing to fear from such a system, which would be designed to intercept a solitary missile from Iran or North Korea, as opposed to ""a mighty Russian arsenal."" CNN's Suzanne Malveaux in Washington and Per Nyberg in London, England, contributed to this report.","Senior U.S. administration official confirms U.S. has scrapped missile plan .

"(CNN) -- The death toll in India in two building collapses in different cities climbed to at least 11, with more victims trapped in the rubble, Indian officials confirmed Saturday. A crumbling and rundown four-story building in New Delhi toppled over Saturday morning. ""Ten people, including five children and three women, died,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Madhur Verma said. Two others were also injured, he added. The building was around 50 years old and housed several families. Rescue efforts were hampered by cranes in the area. Officials suspects construction work at an adjoining building could be to blame. A second building also collapsed Saturday in Tamil Nadu state. An 11-story structure under construction in the capital city of Chennai toppled over, killing at least one person. Eleven have been rescued from under the debris. ""Fifty workers were believed to be present at the construction site at the time of collapse. Rescue operations are still on,"" said Chennai Police Commissioner Sebastian George. The collapse in Chennai came amid heavy rains. Unfortunately, building collapses in India are an all too common occurrence. An official with the New Delhi Municipal Council told CNN many of the incidents are because of unauthorized construction. People build extra floors in structures without permits, creating hazardous conditions. The official also said there have been several buildings in Delhi designated as dangerous, yet people continue to live in them. Corruption is also a problem, which leads to the authorization of risky building permits. Other factors that contribute to the high number of building collapses in India include lack of oversight, poor quality building materials and even overpopulation. A building collapse in January in the tourist resort of Goa claimed at least 14 lives. Hundreds of people have died in building collapses in India over the past several years.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The source of a mysterious maple syrup-like smell that has periodically blanketed New York is not a particularly aromatic pancake house but a New Jersey factory involved in the processing of fenugreek seeds, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday. The source of New York's sweet aroma has been identified as the New Jersey food-flavoring company Frutarom. The sweet aroma first descended upon Manhattan and northern New Jersey in October 2005, initially triggering several building evacuations as well as concern the scent was physically harmful. Authorities from the Office of Emergency Management soon concluded it posed no danger to the public. The odor made several return appearances in subsequent years, each time confounding nostrils before vanishing as perplexingly as it arrived. Comparing information about local wind speed, wind direction and air humidity against the locations of citizen complaints about the smell, officials from the city's Department of Environmental Protection narrowed down the potential source to four factories in northern New Jersey that produce food additives and fragrances.  Watch how the mystery was solved » . Last week, when several dozen residents of Upper Manhattan called to complain about the smell, the environmental department, having developed a new evidence gathering procedure, gathered air samples from each suspected source in canisters. Tests revealed the pungent perpetrator of that incident was a Hudson County facility owned by Frutarom, a company that develops and manufactures flavors for the food, fragrance and pharmaceutical industries. The specific chemical agents responsible for the scent are esters, compounds ""created by the reaction between an alcohol and an acid"" during the processing of fenugreek seeds, according to Bloomberg. Toasted fenugreek seeds are often used in the production of artificial syrups and in the cuisines of a number of cultures. The mayor said New Jersey officials, who cooperated with New York in the investigation, had concluded that Frutorom had not violated any rules. He said New Yorkers will have to tolerate the syrup smell's occasional return, noting that it's a relatively benign odor. ""All things considered I can think of a lot of things worse than maple syrup,"" he said.","New York finally identifies mysterious maple syrup-like smell that first arose in 2005 .

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean authorities arrested three people Monday on suspicion of destroying evidence connected to the sinking of the ferry Sewol. Investigators also raided a Coast Guard office in a probe of how officials handled the first emergency call from a passenger. The director and two other people with the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon office were arrested and accused of destroying evidence related to the probe of Chonghaejin, the company that owns the ferry, prosecutor Song In-taek said. The Korea Shipping Association is a trade group that promotes the interests of the country's shipping industry. The site raided was the Coast Guard building in Mokpo, which includes the South Jeolla province emergency center -- a facility that provides 119 services, akin to the 911 emergency service in the United States. Investigators are looking into possible dereliction of duty, said Yang Joong-jin, the chief prosecutor in Mokpo. Police and prosecutors seized documents and recordings from the day of the ferry's sinking, state-run news agency Yonhap reported.c . The office received the first distress call from the ship when an 18-year-old boy dialed the 119 emergency number, the report said. ""According to a transcript of the recording, a Coast Guard official asked the student to provide the latitude and longitude of his location, sparking criticism that authorities wasted crucial minutes before starting a rescue operation. The investigation team said it will analyze the work journals and transcripts of the recording to see whether the authorities properly fulfilled their duties,"" Yonhap added. The arrests and raid follow a spate of detentions since the ferry disaster off the country's southwest coast on April 16. Nearly 200 bodies have been found, and more than 100 people are still missing. The ship's captain and 14 other crew members have also been arrested. Prosecutors in Mokpo said all 15 crew members in charge of sailing and the engine room face charges of ""causing death by abandoning (ship), and violation of the country's marine law, the Rescue and Aid at Sea and in the River Act."" Captain rescued in his underwear . Newly released video from the Coast Guard shows the captain of the ferry, Lee Joon-seok, being rescued in his shorts by Coast Guard members. At a press conference Monday, two Coast Guard members defended Lee's rescue. Capt. Kim Kyung-il said he didn't know he was helping the ferry's captain escape the ship. ""No, absolutely not. I didn't find out until later,"" Kim said. ""During the rescue, people were just dropping from the ferry ... falling into the sea."" Coast Guard member Kim Yong-ki said it was difficult to distinguish between crew members and passengers. ""Everyone was wearing life vests so we couldn't tell who was crew or who was a passenger,"" he said. ""The life vest covers the uniform. We could see the sleeves but in that situation we are not thinking about that."" Final words of passengers . ""Why can't they tell us what's going on?"" ""Wow, it's tilting a lot. We're tilting to this side. Can't move."" ""You think I'm really gonna die?"" A teenage boy who died on the sunken ferry captured these desperate moments on cell phone video, according to South Korean national TV network JTBC. After the boy's body was found, authorities gave his father his cell phone. Its memory card was still intact. But the father couldn't bear to watch the entire clip from the doomed ship. Instead, he gave the video to JTBC, which shared a roughly three-minute audio clip with CNN. In the video, some appeared to take comfort in the fact they were wearing life vests. ""I'm wearing the life vest,"" one passenger says. ""I'm wearing one, too. I really have to,"" another replies. But the life jackets didn't save everyone. Over the weekend, divers found the bodies of 48 girls -- wearing their life jackets -- pressed into a room too small for so many people. The video also captured orders carried over the ship's loudspeaker: . ""Once again, please do not move from your current location,"" a voice says. ""Absolutely do not move."" Prime Minister resigns . South Korea's Prime Minister announced his resignation Sunday, taking responsibility for the slow initial reaction to the ferry's sinking. Prime Minister Chung Hong-won explained his decision on national television. He apologized ""on behalf of the government for the many problems that arose during the first response and the subsequent rescue operation,"" in addition to ""problems that existed before the accident."" ""During the search process, the government took inadequate measures and disappointed the public,"" Chung said. ""I should take responsibility for everything as the prime minister, but the government can assume no more. So I will resign as prime minister."" Prosecutors have said that authorities have yet to determine what caused the sinking. But leading theories include changes made to increase the ferry's passenger capacity, and shifting cargo.

"(CNN) -- South Korea's Seung-Yul Noh recorded his maiden PGA Tour victory despite a sustained challenge from a clutch of Americans at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans. The 22-year-old Noh carded his first bogeys on the TPC Louisiana course during the final round as he carded a one-under-par 71 for a total of 19-under 269. That left him two shots clear of Andrew Svoboda and Robert Streb, with U.S. Ryder Cup player Jeff Overton a further shot back. All three threatened to prevent Noh's breakthrough triumph, but were unable to overhaul him on a tense final day. Noh, who played with a yellow insignia on his cap as a mark of respect to the ferry tragedy in his country, may have owed his victory to a fortunate pitch shot on the 13th. His effort from 81 feet away struck the flag full on and fell to just three feet away before he made a crucial birdie. But a three-putt bogey on the 15th saw his lead over Streb slip to a single shot after the home player birdied the 16th. Noh responded with a birdie of his own on the 16th and a clutch putt to save par on the 17th ultimately kept him two shots clear. Last day playing partner Keegan Bradley suffered a nightmare final round on the greens, lipping out several short putts to see his challenge fade with a 75. England's Justin Rose showed encouraging form ahead of his defense of the U.S. Open title in June with a final round 68 to finish in a tie for sixth on 13-under, the same mark as Bradley. Meanwhile on the European Tour, Frenchman Alexander Levy scored his maiden victory by taking the $3.2 million China Open. The 23-year-old was the overnight leader and carded a three-under 69 on Shenzhen's par-72 Genzon Golf Club for a score of 19-under-par and the $530,000 winner's check. He finished four shots clear of England's Tommy Fleetwood with Spain's Alvaro Quiros in third place. Levy held the lead since a superb second round 62 Friday and kept his nerve on the final day.","Seung-Yul Noh wins maiden PGA Tour event .

"(CNN) -- It was perhaps the most contentious moment during a House Armed Services Committee hearing filled with them. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, appeared to strike a nerve Wednesday when he pressed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on why it was taking the U.S. military so long to interview Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the soldier being treated in Germany after the Taliban released him May 31. Hagel already had fielded lawmakers' accusations that the White House overstepped presidential authority and negotiated with terrorists to gain Bergdahl's freedom. The defense chief started to explain that doctors treating Bergdahl will decide when he is ready to talk, but Miller cut him off. ""Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why hasn't he been returned to the United States?"" Miller asked, noting that wounded soldiers from battle zones get flown back for treatment within days. ""You're trying to tell me that he's being held at Landstuhl, Germany, because of his medical condition?"" Hagel responded, ""Congressman, I hope you're not implying anything other than that,"" as the two continued to talk over each other. ""I don't like the implication of the question,"" Hagel said at one point, and when Miller persisted about injured combat troops coming back to the United States quickly, Hagel raised his voice. ""This isn't just about a physical situation,"" he said. ""This guy was held for almost five years in God knows what kind of conditions. ... This is not just about can he get on his feet and walk and get to a plane."" Hagel: Bergdahl deal was 'imperfect' but right decision . The controversy . It was that sort of day. The Bergdahl swap at the end of last month has ignited a controversy in the partisan frenzy permeating Washington in an election year. Hagel often appeared frustrated and even angry at times but stayed on-message after an opening statement that laid out the legal and ideological foundation for the agreement that the Taliban claim as a victory. ""War, every part of war, like prisoner exchanges, is not some abstraction or theoretical exercise,"" Hagel said early on, presenting a theme he repeated throughout the hearing. ""The hard choices and options don't fit neatly into clearly defined instructions in 'how to' manuals. All of these decisions are part of the brutal, imperfect realities we all deal with in war."" 'We complied with the law' In defending the deal approved by President Barack Obama, Hagel declared that ""we complied with the law, and we did what we believed was in the best interests of our country, our military and Sgt. Bergdahl."" ""The President has constitutional responsibilities and constitutional authorities to protect American citizens and members of our armed forces. That's what he did,"" Hagel said. ""America does not leave its soldiers behind. We made the right decision, and we did it for the right reasons -- to bring home one of our own people."" Republican critics contended the cost was too high because it freed hardened terror suspects possibly to rejoin the fight against U.S. interests, especially in return for a soldier accused by some in his unit of deserting his post. Legislators from both parties also complained that the Obama administration failed to notify Congress ahead of time, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for transfers of Guantanamo detainees. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, the committee chairman, labeled as ""misleading and at times blatantly false"" White House officials' explanations at a classified briefing Monday for making the exchange and not notifying Congress beforehand. 'We could have done a better job' Hagel conceded the administration should have tried harder to let Congress know about what he called rapidly moving developments, saying he understood the frustration caused by the speed of the mission. ""We could have done a better job of keeping you informed,"" Hagel said, noting that only a few hours elapsed between making the final arrangements with the Taliban through the government of Qatar, which mediated the agreement. ""As the opportunity to obtain Sgt. Bergdahl's release became clearer, we grew increasingly concerned that any delay, or any leaks, could derail the deal and further endanger"" him, Hagel said. Under the swap, the released Taliban detainees were taken to Qatar and will remain there for a year, with the Qatari government saying it will keep an eye on them. McKeon said he worried the newly freed Taliban figures ""still pose a threat to Americans and Afghans alike"" because ""in a year, they will be free to return to Afghanistan."" Other GOP legislators accused the administration of acting on its own to evade opposition to the deal in Congress as well as trying to hide a shift in U.S. policy by negotiating with terrorists to secure Bergdahl's release. They seized on Hagel's confirmation that Bergdahl at times was held by the Haqqani network, a Taliban wing designated a terrorist group in 2012. Negotiating with terrorists? Hagel repeatedly said the on-off negotiations dating back to 2011 involved the broader Taliban that formerly governed Afghanistan, and that the government of Qatar was an intermediary in the final talks in April and May. ""We didn't negotiate with Haqqani,"" Hagel said, adding that Bergdahl was moved around during his five years of captivity. That brought accusations of deceptive reasoning, with Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, sharply challenging Hagel. ""How is it the United States could've been in negotiations with the Haqqani network, a listed terrorist organization, and it not conflict with our policy that we do not negotiate with terrorists?"" Turner asked, to which Hagel replied that ""we dealt directly with the government of Qatar."" Turner shot back: ""So now, the new policy of this administration is, 'we don't negotiate with terrorists directly.' "" The next legislator up, Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, criticized Turner for being ""prosecutorial"" and wondered aloud if his Republican colleague might be running for House GOP leader after Rep. Eric Cantor's primary defeat. Missing since 2009 . Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance said he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because doing so would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. Opinion: Why we leave no man behind . On Wednesday, The Washington Post -- citing close friends of Bergdahl's -- reported he had been discharged from the U.S. Coast Guard before his Army enlistment because of psychological issues. Bergdahl served for about a month in the Coast Guard before being released on an ""uncharacterized"" and ""administrative"" discharge, defense officials told CNN. But CNN has been unable to confirm the reason for the discharge. The Post reported Bergdahl had told longtime friend Kim Harrison that he had faked the problems but that she doubted his explanation. ""I said, 'You don't fake a psychological discharge, you have to become unfit.' I told him that,"" the Post quoted her as saying. ""The reality was it wasn't okay. I saw it in the letters, the way the writing was changing, the anger."" Some of those emotions are on display in excerpts of Bergdahl's writings the Post published. Harrison said she received the writings -- contained in a journal and on a laptop computer -- in a package from Bergdahl before he disappeared. She shared the writings to counter a growing perception of her friend as a deserter, the Post reported. ""These thoughts insist on trying to overwhelm my mind. ... I've spent a lot of my life thinking blackness was all I had in front of me, that it would be blackness to the very last instent (sic). I know this is not right. I know that there is light in this darkness, and that I can actuly (sic) reach it if I keep walking, keep moving to it,"" Bergdahl wrote, according to the Post. Bergdahl is ""continuing to improve every day"" as he recovers at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said this week, but the soldier hasn't spoken with his family yet. When he is ready, Bergdahl will be flown to the San Antonio Military Medical Center in Texas, where he may be able to reunite with his parents. The Bergdahl Files: A custom magazine .

The 23-year-old shot a three-under par final round of 69 taking him to 24-under par, two strokes clear of Welshman Jamie Donaldson and four clear of U.S. Open champion Rose and Woods, who tied for third on 20 under. Rose, who finished with a round of 65, was first to apply the pressure on Sunday picking up six shots in the opening nine to move to within a shot of Dubuisson at one stage. But two dropped shots in the closing holes saw the Englishman lose momentum just at the wrong time. Woods, on the other hand, saved his best for last, making a late surge which saw him pick up four shots in the final six holes to finish with a round of 67.

"(CNN) -- Rutgers quarterback Philip Nelson has been arrested and charged on suspicion of assault in southern Minnesota, authorities said Monday. He is suspected of attacking Isaac Kolstad, 24, a former linebacker at Minnesota State University. Kolstad is in critical condition, his family said. Nelson, 20, faces one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault, said Patrick McDermott, assistant Blue Earth County attorney. He was taken into custody early Sunday morning, according to a statement from Mankato, Minnesota, police. Officers found Kolstad near a downtown intersection. He was transported by ambulance to a local hospital. A Rutgers spokesman declined to comment on the case. ""We are in the process of gathering information on the situation and reserve comment until the legal process is complete,"" said Jason Baum. Nelson is a recent transfer to Rutgers. A native of Mankato, Minnesota, he played at the University of Minnesota, according to Rutgers' website. Kolstad graduated from Minnesota State University in December. He suffered a severe head injury, according to a statement from his family. ""He is currently in critical condition and fighting for his life. He is young and strong, but the battle he has in front of him is enormous,"" it read. ""We do know that his brain did sustain permanent damage. We do not yet know to what extent and won't for many days. He is very sick. Please pray for Isaac and all of those involved."" Kolstad was being treated at Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato. A spokesman from there read reporters another statement Monday, on behalf of the victim's family. ""Please keep in mind that behind the headlines, behind the police report and medical data, is a strong, caring man -- a man with an incredible faith in God, a loving husband, a father of two daughters, a son, a brother, a teammate and a friend,"" it read. Police have said they are looking for another person believed to have been involved in the assault. That suspect was identified as a white male in his early 20s. He was wearing jeans and a red T-shirt that was torn during the incident. Authorities released surveillance video and stills, showing a large number of people in the area of the assault, and are asking anyone with information to step forward.

"(CNN) -- A number of themes emerge from the regional reports included in the National Climate Assessment -- things like risks to infrastructure due to rising oceans both benefits and harm to agricultural production because of changing temperature, and new realities for cooling and heating costs. Find your geographic region below and see how these issues specifically affect where you live, according to the report. NORTHWEST . If you live in the Northwest, you can appreciate how vital the snow accumulation in the mountains is. It melts in spring to provide water for hydropower plants and irrigation for crops. But as seasonal water patterns change, caused in part by changes in snowmelt, the region's diverse ecology and geography can face challenges. The impacts of climate change will be strongly felt along the coast -- an area important for the region's economy. People's livelihoods, recreational areas and infrastructure could be affected by rising sea levels. At the same time, wildfires are expected to increase. White House: Climate change is here, action needed now . Examples from report: . -- ""Since around 1950, area-averaged snowpack on April 1 in the Cascade Mountains decreased about 20%, spring snowmelt occurred 0 to 30 days earlier depending on location, late winter/early spring streamflow increases ranged from 0% to greater than 20% as a fraction of annual flow, and summer flow decreased 0% to 15% as a fraction of annual flow, with exceptions in smaller areas and shorter time periods."" -- As sea levels rise, coastal areas of Washington and Oregon will flood more often. Beaches and habitats will probably decline in these areas. -- ""Climate change will alter Northwest forests by increasing wildfire risk and insect and tree disease outbreaks, and by forcing longer-term shifts in forest types and species."" -- Wildfires are a natural part of the forest ecosystem in the Northwest, but warmer and drier conditions have increased the number and extent of such fires. -- ""Projected warming will reduce the availability of irrigation water in snowmelt-fed basins and increase the probability of heat stress to field crops and tree fruit."" -- In the short term, some crops will benefit from a longer growing season, but the long-term consequences are uncertain. SOUTHWEST . Those in the Southwest, especially in California, have already seen what changes in sea levels and temperature can do. Wildfires have ravaged some communities, and there has been damage along the coast due to waves encroaching further and further inland. Residents in this region count on a reliable supply of water. Imagine if that supply becomes less reliable as snowpack and streamflow amounts decrease? Examples from the report: . -- ""Over the past 50 years across most of the Southwest, there has been less late-winter precipitation falling as snow, earlier snowmelt, and earlier arrival of most of the year's streamflow."" -- Between 1970 and 2003, warmer and drier conditions increased the burned area in the western U.S. mid-elevation conifer forests by 650%. -- The sea level along the California coast has risen anywhere between 6.7 to 7.9 inches over the past 100 years. --""If adaptive action is not taken, coastal highways, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure (such as the San Francisco and Oakland airports) are at increased risk of flooding with a 16-inch rise in sea level in the next 50 years."" -- ""The effects of heat stress are greatest during heat waves lasting several days or more, and heat waves are projected to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity,,,,, become more humid, and cause a greater number of deaths."" GREAT PLAINS . A large chunk of the middle United States, from Texas to Montana and the Dakotas, falls into this category in the report. What do Texans and Montanans have in common when it comes to climate? Well, the entire region will see increased demand for water and energy, and temperatures rise. Changes in how much you have to cool or warm your house has large impacts on the efficiency of energy use. Five things you can do . Climate change doesn't have just negative effects. For example, increased rainfall in the Northern Plains could increase agricultural productivity. But in the Central and Southern Plains, declines in rainfall means crop yields will be reduced. Examples from report: . -- In the Northern Plains, warmer winters mean that there may be a reduction in heating demand, but it might be outweighed by greater demand for air conditioning during warmer summers. -- In the Central and Southern Plains, ""the climate impacts of shifting from irrigated to dryland agriculture would reduce crop yields by about a factor of two."" -- Plants and animals adjust to rising temperatures by adjusting their ranges, but that is becoming more difficult. For example: ""The historic bison herds migrated to adapt to climate, disturbance, and associated habitat variability, but modern land-use patterns, roads, agriculture, and structures inhibit similar large-scale migration."" -- Native American communities face physical and political constraints as the climate changes: ""Tribal members have reported the decline or disappearance of culturally important animal species, changes in the timing of cultural ceremonies due to earlier onset of spring, and the inability to locate certain types of ceremonial wild plants."" MIDWEST . The Midwest is home to one of the country's treasures, the Great Lakes. Climate change, however, means that the ecosystem might see changes such as increased invasive species and harmful algae, and declining beach health. On the flipside, less ice on the lake could increase the shipping season. As in other regions, the growing season stands to be lengthened because of the climate change, but again, it risks being offset by extreme weather events such as freezes that ruin crops. Examples from report: . -- The Midwest growing season lengthened by almost two weeks since 1950. -- The longer growing season can be offset by extreme weather, such as freezes and springtime cold outbreaks. -- The frequency of major heat waves in the Midwest has increased over the past 60 years. -- ""One study projected an increase of between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths per year from heat wave-related mortality in Chicago alone by 2081-2100."" -- ""The Great Lakes, North America's largest freshwater feature, have recently recorded higher water temperatures and less ice cover as a result of changes in regional climate."" SOUTHEAST . The Southeast -- known for its beaches, its seafood and ports, and as home to two of the nation's major cities -- Atlanta and Miami -- could face risks due to climate change. Sea-level, rise, especially, can affect the region, as well as extreme weather such as hurricanes and heat spells. The risk is intensified in that so many cities, roads, energy facilities and water supplies are on the coast. Opinion: Wake up to the reality . The hot weather is only going to get hotter, though the increases for this region are smaller than for some others. Examples from report: . --North Carolina is raising the roadbed of U.S. Highway 64 across the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula on the coast by four feet, which includes 18 inches to allow for higher future sea levels. -- ""Louisiana State Highway 1, heavily used for delivering critical oil and gas resources from Port Fourchon, is literally sinking, resulting in more frequent and more severe flooding during high tides and storms."" -- Utilities will be under more pressure as rising seas means saltwater can contaminate freshwater supplies. -- The summer heat will continue to reduce crop productively and damage crops, as happened in Georgia in 2007, when a drought cost $339 million in losses. NORTHEAST . New York. Washington. Some of the country's most important cities are categorized together in the climate report under the Northeast region. The governmental and financial hubs of the United States will have to withstand heat waves, downpours, and a rising sea level. The Northeast is a highly-urbanized region, where the heat and other climate factors can take a toll on the population. Already, there are examples of cities in this region incorporating the risk into their planning. Industries such as agriculture and fishing will be tested, and farmers can choose to explore alternate crops, but this is not easy or cheap. Examples from report: . -- ""One recent study projected that temperature changes alone would lead to a 50% to 91% increase in heat-related deaths in Manhattan by the 2080s."" -- Don't forget about rural areas. Places where air conditioning is not prevalent because heat waves are rare suddenly become vulnerable when such heat events become more frequent. -- ""In New York State, two feet of sea level rise is estimated (absent adaptation investment) to flood or render unusable 212 miles of roads, 77 miles of rail, 3,647 acres of airport facilities, and 539 acres of runways."" -- Higher ocean temperatures mean that commercially important fish will be pushed northward. This means fisheries that depend on cod and lobster face significant declines.","The National Climate Assessment includes regional reports .

"(CNN) -- The referees walked onto the field at M&T Stadium in Baltimore Thursday night before the Ravens faced the Cleveland Browns and heard the strangest thing: Cheers. Not just a few of them, either. They heard a standing ovation, long and loud from the early arriving fans, enough so that head referee Gene Steratore tipped his cap to the appreciative crowd like a conquering hometown hero. If you hadn't followed the developments over the previous three weeks, you would've thought the world had gone mad. If you did follow them -- and, if you're a football fan, how could you not? -- you probably felt the urge to stand in your living room and cheer right along with them. The real referees are back. The long national nightmare with replacement officials -- the unqualified rejects from the Lingerie League or Division 3 college games -- ended this week, but not before creating an odd phenomena among sports fans from coast to coast. Refs were getting the love -- from football fans, from current and former players, and even from President Obama. When the president tweeted that he wanted the real referees back on the field, it was only a matter of time before it happened -- and one more sign that there was a real appreciation for the professionals. ""It is unfortunate that the NFL, America's game, has been reduced to what it is,"" Justin Tuck, the thoughtful defensive lineman for the New York Giants, said before the lockout was settled. ""I think a lot of people are looking at it as a joke, honestly. As a fan, you pay all this money and you go PSLs and ... games are just being tossed up like as if you were throwing dice on a craps table."" The lockout of the regular referees ended on Wednesday when their union agreed to an eight-year deal with the NFL, ending a dispute that centered mostly on retirement benefits and compensation. Before it ended, there were a few lessons for NFL fans: . 1. Their collective outrage can make a difference. And the outrage was from coast to coast. It started to build during the second week of the season, when it became clear that games had more borderline penalties and less flow with the replacement officials, but it reached a crescendo during the Monday night broadcast this week. An already choppy game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers came down to one final play. A Hail Mary pass from Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson heaved into the end zone that appeared to be intercepted by Packers safety M.D. Jennings. But Seahawks receiver Golden Tate grabbed it at the last second, and when the two players fell to the ground, the two referees watching looked at each other before making a ruling. One of them waved his arms to signify an interception. The other lifted his arms to signify a touchdown. And, when the refs eventually ruled that it was a touchdown (missing a blatant offensive pass interference call before the play), a national firestorm had begun. Twitter recorded 56,000 tweets per minute during the game -- or nearly the same as Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention -- and most of them angry. With one play, the Seahawks had stolen a 14-12 victory and as much as $250 million had moved from one side of the ledger to the other because of the betting line, according to Vegas experts. John Mara, the influential co-owner of the Giants, watched the replay of the ""Fail Mary,"" as it became known, on Tuesday morning and thought, ""How did this happen?"" He wasn't directly involved in the negotiations between the league and the referees' union, but he said the talks intensified. ""I felt like we were moving toward a contract even before Monday night, but I'm not sure we would have gotten it done this week,"" Mara said. ""I think the game sped up the process -- on both sides. ""For the owners, or at least from my point of view, it was the final straw because I started to see it would be very difficult for replacement refs to do their jobs the following weekend."" 2. Even the NFL isn't immune to criticism. The NFL has enjoyed an unprecedented run as the dominant sports league in this country, and that was never in doubt even during the lockout. Ratings were still sky high for the games, and the outrage over the replacement officials was such a dominant story that it confirmed the league's popularity more than it threatened it. The league thought there wouldn't be much sympathy for the referees -- they are, after all, an unpopular group. But the owners discovered that people cared too much about the sport to see it compromised -- especially the ones who are counting on a fair game when they bet on the outcome. Finally, when the lockout ended, Commissioner Roger Goodell had no choice but to apologize to the fans. ""Obviously, when you go through something like this, it is painful for everybody,"" Goodell said. ""Most importantly, it is painful for our fans. We are sorry to have to put our fans through that, but it is something that in the short term you sometimes have to do to make sure you get the right kind of deal for the long-term and make sure you continue to grow the game."" 3. Most of all: Refs aren't so bad after all. It was amazing, really. Referees, the most universally disliked group of people in America, became quite popular. Players all but begged for them to return. Fans railed against the NFL owners and Goodell for locking them out in the first place. Ed Hochuli, perhaps the most identifiable referee thanks to his impressive biceps, became a trending topic on Twitter. It was Hochuli who, in an attempt to keep he and his fellow refs fresh during the lockout, would hold conference calls every Tuesday night where they would discuss how hypothetical situations are enforced. One of those calls, of course, dealt with simultaneous possession. There likely will be some rust to shake off, but even a few mistakes won't change this: Finally, there seems to be a national acceptance that it takes a great deal of experience, knowledge and poise to officiate games in this complicated and brutal sport. ""The pressure on the replacement refs was becoming too much for them, and all of the missed and blown calls were messing with the integrity of the game,"" Giants linebacker Michael Boley said. ""I'm not saying the real refs will get every call right, but I think they will do a better job. Good to have them back."" Of course, nobody -- including the returning refs -- expected it to last very long. They might have gotten that standing ovation before the game, but less than three minutes into the game in Baltimore, fans booed when a call went against the hometown Ravens. Which, of course, was exactly how it should be.","NFL officials will work this weekend's games following the lockout .

"(CNN) -- When I was growing up, to open my parents' refrigerator was to take a magical journey deep into a strange land of Tupperware that ultimately ended in sadness, confusion and some sort of round, congealed blob of food that may or may not have dated to the Carter administration. ""Mom, what is this?"" ""Does it look like it might cause infection?"" ""Kinda."" ""It's soup."" Yes, we were a leftovers house. Be it chicken or rice, you were gettin' it twice! Though, in all fairness, mom has always been a great cook. So, it was definitely tolerable. Nevertheless, Day 7 of lasagna never quite had the same pizazz as Day 4. And opening that container on Day 60 risked introducing a newly formed, unknown invasive species into the ecosystem. ""What the hell was that?"" ""Might've been a raccoon ... might've been a casserole."" But, hey, you just can't let good food go to waste. And that's why developers at a trending new startup are working on an app called Leftover Swap that might just revolutionize what we do with our extra grub. But probably not. Essentially, they're creating Craigslist for your unfinished pizza. Yes, Casual Encounters just got even weirder. Here's how it works: When you have something remaining from your meal, you snap a photo, post it on your profile and then wait for someone nearby to claim it or offer a trade. ""Your chicken salad for my mac-and-cheese?"" ""Deal! Meet me in the park at 7. Come alone. I'll be the one with all the open sores."" ""Wait. What?"" Bryan Summersett and Dan Newman are the cofounders of Leftover Swap, and they came up with the idea three years ago while roommates at the University of Michigan. Naturally, at the time, even they thought it was a little crazy. Newman told NPR, ""It was an outrageous joke in 2010, but in 2013, it's very plausible and something that people would use today."" I swear I'm not trying to sound insensitive -- seriously -- but the only people I can actually see using this would be homeless dudes who happen to have cell phones. Otherwise, there's just too much risk. And for what? Tater tots? Actually, that sounds delicious. I'd travel a few blocks for tots. (Blocks for Tots also sounds like the world's laziest charity walk. Motto: We're here to help, but only for about 10 minutes.) Of course, Newman and his business partner are well aware that Leftover Swap is going to be a hard sell. He admits, ""It's obviously not for everybody. But for as many people who seemingly have a problem with it, there's people who love the idea."" And maybe there will even be an upscale vintage section so my mom can finally get rid of any petrified brisket lurking in the back of the fridge. You know, somewhere on the lower shelf next to the Thanksgiving turkey. From 1984. Yet, despite any eager users that may exist, Newman and Summersett also don't have delusions of grandeur. When they release the app at the end of August, it will be available for free download. They're less interested in making money and more concerned about doing something positive. Newman says, ""In the U.S., we produce so much more food than we consume, and so much is going to waste."" On the other hand, some of that food is also presently being enjoyed by an unbathed man who's just emptied his cat's litter box. Not with his hands, but still ... And now he can't wait to share his half-eaten burrito! Yes, Casual Encounters definitely just got even weirder.

"(CNN) -- South Dakota investigators have put to rest a 42-year-old cold case about two missing 17-year-old girls, declaring they died in a car accident that ended in a creek at night in 1971, with no signs of foul play. Cheryl Miller and Pamela Jackson were high school students when they disappeared May 29, 1971, while driving to a party at a gravel pit. It took 42 years for their car to be discovered -- last September -- just a half-mile from the girls' intended destination near Beresford, South Dakota. Last year's weather -- a wet spring followed by strong creek currents and then a drought -- caused the car to become visible and recovered, caked in mud, authorities said. Subsequent DNA, forensic and anthropological analyses confirmed the identities of the two sets of remains found in the car and also concluded that the girls' deaths were accidental, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley told reporters Tuesday. Their 1960 Studebaker Lark's ignition and headlights were turned on, and the transmission was in the top, or third, gear, Jackley said. Their clothing contained bones and remnants of shoes were found, and no evidence of alcohol was found in the car, he said. ""No evidence indicates that there was foul play. This would appear to indicate an accident,"" Jackley said. The announcement ""brings a closure"" and gives the families ""some answers,"" Jackley said. The families will now be able to collect the two girls' remains, he added. The attorney general said investigators don't know what caused the accident, but he noted that one car tire was damaged, though authorities don't know whether a blowout caused that. He also cited how the tread on the tires were low. Jackley showed reporters some of the personal belongings found in the car, including two classmate notes and Miller's purse. Kay Brock, Jackson's sister, told CNN affiliate KSFY that the DNA confirmation finally ended the long uncertainty. ""I'm relieved to have no foul play,"" Brock told the station. ""It's nice to have a permanent answer after 42 years."" Taken: The coldest case ever solved . Police get break in missing girls' cold case from 1975 . Arrest in 40-year-old murder case .

"(CNN) -- The million-dollar questions have been answered. What are the Powerball numbers, and have any winning tickets been sold? Lottery officials released the winning numbers for the largest multistate Powerball jackpot: 22, 10,13,14, 52, and the Powerball number is 11. One winning ticket was sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to David Bishop, deputy secretary of the Florida lottery. Saturday's jackpot is a record $590.5 million. It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a $587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. The jackpot has a cash value of $376.9 million. ""I buy mine here all the time. Yesterday, I was in Naples. I bought it in Naples, That's just my luck,"" Butch Gonzalez, a regular lottery player, told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 outside the Publix in Zephyrhills. ""I just hope whoever won really needs the money, and I hope they do right by it,"" he said. The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. If there had been no winner in Saturday's Powerball, the jackpot would have shot up to $925 million for Wednesday's drawing, according to Kelly Cripe, spokeswoman for the Texas Lottery, which is part of the Powerball game. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs $2, and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510. Why you keep playing the lottery . Hate to break it to you, but you stand a better chance of walking onto the golf course and hitting two consecutive holes in one than winning the jackpot. But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, where one of two winning tickets was sold in last year's $587 million Powerball drawing. About 100 people an hour were buying tickets at the store. At a convenience store in Riverside, Missouri, Jim Mansell said he was buying only one ticket. ""I figure if the good Lord intends you to win, you only need one ticket,"" he told CNN affiliate KCTV5. ""But I don't know if the good Lord believes in gambling or not."" In Florida, winners must claim prizes at a state lottery retailer or lottery district office on or before the 180th day after the drawing. Any Powerball retailer in the state can validate a winning ticket. CNN's Scott Thompson and Jake Carpenter contributed to the report.","Saturday's jackpot is a record $590.5 million .

"(CNN) -- Ten days after a radiation leak was reported at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside Carlsbad, New Mexico, tests on samples collected from numerous areas in the plant found ""slightly elevated"" levels of airborne radioactivity, the U.S. Department of Energy said. ""These concentrations remain well below a level of public or environmental hazard,"" the department said Monday in a news release. The leak was reported on February 14, and the samples were collected on February 17 and 18. Dose assessment modeling of the leak ""showed a potential dose of less than one millirem at each of the environmental sampling locations,"" about a tenth the amount a person would receive from a chest X-ray, the release said. ""The average person living in the United States receives an annual dose of about 620 millirem from exposure to naturally occurring and other sources of radiation,"" it said. According to its website, WIPP ""safely disposes"" of the nation's defense-related radioactive waste. Waste shipped to WIPP, which is 26 miles outside of Carlsbad, is ""permanently"" disposed of in rooms mined out of a salt formation 2,150 feet (0.4 miles) below the surface of the desert. The waste generally consists of clothing, tools, equipment, sludge, soil or other materials contaminated with man-made radioactive elements that are heavier than uranium. An alarm late on February 14 indicated higher than usual levels of airborne radiation and led to a first-of-its-kind response since the nuclear disposal facility began accepting waste in 1999. An air monitor at the plant detected the spike in an isolated area below ground, which prompted the shutoff of filtered air from the facility into the environment around it. ""This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside,"" Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN last week. The radiation was first detected at 11:30 p.m., according to Sahd. He said the facility's ventilation system, which monitors air quality, automatically switched to ""filtration mode"" when the leak was discovered. Because of the location of the incident, Sahd said, there was little risk to employees. Those who were inside the above-ground area of the facility were quarantined until radiological control technicians cleared them to go home. ""No one was underground when the alarm went off,"" Sahd said. ""And everyone that was in the facility (at the time), we know where they are and we've tested them.""

"Toyko, Japan (CNN) -- He may be diminutive in stature as he appears under the shadow of the Tokyo Skytree, Japan's tallest structure at 634 meters. But as he twists and screams ""I'm so pretty!"" onstage, it becomes clear that his star is rising. The crowd of thousands goes wild, screaming his name and snapping as many photos as they can. ""Funassyi"" is a superstar in a pear costume. In the world of cute, cuddly, and sometimes bizarre mascots, these ""yuru-kyara"" (meaning gentle or laid back characters), have been a ubiquitous presence in advertising in Japan for decades. But Funassyi is a hyperactive talking and dancing pear who has distinguished himself from the pack. In fact, Funassyi is a household name. Coming from the northwestern city of Funabashi, known for its delicious pears, Funassyi's origins lie in his YouTube channel created two years ago. The fact that he spoke, jumped, and had a distinctively flamboyant personality made him different from typically quiet and cuddly Japanese mascots. Since then, his popularity has exploded, boasting an impressive resume that includes television appearances, commercials and ad campaigns, and even his own novelty single released under Universal Music Japan. Funassyi's undeniable charisma . But what makes Funassyi so different from his countless cohorts of colorful characters? At first glance, one may think his bright yellow color, sparkling eyes and perpetual smile is nothing new for a country with an army of crazy characters like Sanomaru, a white puppy-like mascot from Sano city with an upside down ramen bowl on his head, or Okazaemon, a creepy ghost-like character from Okazaki prefecture. However, the moment Funassyi starts dancing widely and emphatically hyping up the crowd in his high-pitched voice, ending sentences with his catchphrase ""nashiiii!"" (Pear!) -- this mascot becomes an unforgettable presence. While even the most popular mascots in Japan like Kumamon, a rosy-cheeked black bear from Kumamoto prefecture, are silent and slow moving, Funassyi's unique costume design allows for rapid, energetic movements that he uses to jump up and down to excite and rile up his audience. In addition, his ability to speak makes him an interactive and electrifying crowd favorite. Funassyi and the iconic Japanese teddy bear Kumamon are the superstars of the 2014 Yuru-Kyara festival, which features mascots from all over Japan. People line up to meet and pose for pictures with their favorite mascots and more importantly, buy their exclusive merchandise that includes everything from handbags, towels, T-shirts, and much more. According to the Character Data Bank, a research firm that studies the character business, mascot-driven character sales amounted to nearly $16 billion in Japan in 2012. Replicating the Funassyi effect . Other prefectures are hoping to replicate Funassyi and Kumamon's enormous commercial success by releasing their own yuru-kyara's, in an effort to attract regional tourism and land national ad campaigns of their own. Kumamon's brand is already expanding overseas, with themed products soon to be appearing in 7-Eleven convenience stores in Taiwan. Although Funassyi's stardom currently remains limited to Japan, it's not unbelievable to imagine his following expanding worldwide, placing him among the ranks of other Japanese icons that became multi-billion-dollar icons. The creators of Kumamon and Funassyi are hoping for the kind of global fame as Japanese icons Hello Kitty and Pikachu.","Japanese pear mascot enjoys enduring popularity .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The head of Iran's nuclear energy agency announced Saturday that the country had launched a ""serious"" nuclear fusion research program, according to state-run Press TV. Ali-Akbar Salehi, the chief of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), said as many as 50 scientists were participating in the research to break into alternative energy, Press TV said. The process of nuclear fusion consists of forcing hydrogen nuclei to collide at high speed and fuse together, which releases energy, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) website. The goal is to eventually develop fusion plants to generate electricity, the IAEA said, but research worldwide is still in the early stages. The agency called nuclear fusion a ""long term, sustainable, economic and safe energy source."" Salehi acknowledged the project will take time. ""It takes 20 to 30 years before this process can be commercialized but we have to use all the capacity in the country to provide the necessary speed for fusion research,"" Salehi said, according to Press TV. Iran is under fire for other aspects of its nuclear program, which Tehran claims is for peaceful purposes. However, the United States and other Western nations fear Iran is attempting to develop a nuclear weapon. The United Nations has issued four rounds of sanctions against the country for not being more transparent about the goals and status of its nuclear program. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama signed into law new U.S. sanctions against Tehran that he called another step in demonstrating that ""the United States and the international community are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.""","A nuclear fusion research program was launched Saturday in Iran .

"(CNN) -- Just when we were getting used to the idea of restaurants as travel destinations, the restaurants themselves go traveling. First it was Fat Duck, the Michelin star-studded rural English venue created by scientific chef Heston Blumenthal, that announced it was upping sticks and heading to Melbourne for six months. Now, fresh from scooping top honors at this year's San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards, Denmark's Noma is preparing to tantalize the unsuspecting diners of Tokyo with its visceral version of fine dining. Both restaurants are planning to hit the road in 2015 -- taking their chefs, kitchen staff and cookery concepts with them. ""I have planned (the move) for two years,"" Noma's head chef and co-owner Rene Redzepi said after his Copenhagen venue was named top of the 2014 World's 50 Best Restaurants this week in London. So, come the beginning of 2015, diners already desperate to grab one of Noma's tables could face further frustration as the whole venue appears set to pack its famous foraging bags and head east. 'Awestruck' by Japanese food culture . Despite the prospect of using ingredients they've never cooked with before, such as tofu and sudachi, Redzepi says there are other worries on the horizon -- such as Japanese work permits. ""At the moment the most difficult thing is to make sure that my three people from Guatemala, two people from Mexico City and two people from Gambia, who are dishwashers, will get work visas for three months,"" said Redzepi. Announcing the move on his website a couple of months ago, the 36-year-old chef said his palate rather than his profit motive were to blame. ""We really want to go,"" he said, adding that he was ""awestruck by the richness of Japanese food culture"" during a trip to Japan five years ago hosted by Murata, a chef from Kyoto's Kikunoi restaurant. Don't expect a sudden switch to sushi in the Noma kitchen that gave us sea urchin toast, beef tartar with ants and other modern Nordic specialties. ""I have a plan with Noma Tokyo,"" said Redzepi. ""I'm not going to turn it into a Japanese restaurant, but I have a plan. In the next five years, Japan is very important in my big plan of restaurant Noma."" That said, the chef has in the past revealed to CNN that, despite his strict insistence on locally sourced produce, in his home larder lurks miso paste, sesame seeds and aged seaweed from Japan's Hokkaido island. It's not clear where in Tokyo Noma's pop-up restaurant will appear, nor is it clear what will become of the original venue when the current team are gone. Redzepi is keeping everyone waiting another few weeks before dishing up the full details. In the meantime, perhaps he should consider changing the name to Nomad.","Noma, winner of the 2014 ""world's best restaurant"" title, has announced a pop-up venture in Tokyo .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Hair driers blast air and racks of clothing clatter past as organizers make their final preparations for a fashion show. Some of the backstage bustle is downright comical. Short Turkish women, carefully wrapped up in trench-coats and brightly-colored Muslim headscarves, struggle to help towering, leggy models from Slavic and Latin countries change in and out of outfits. This is not your typical fashion show. The show is highlighting Islamic women's clothing -- even though very few of the models working here are Muslim. ""Listen, I'm coming from Venezuela [where] we are always walking in shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops. Not afraid to show it. But here it's totally different,"" said Cristina Buderacky, a model who stood more then six feet tall in a peach-colored lycra outfit that resembled a pair of long-sleeved pyjamas with blousy trousers. She later made a half-serious plea for help as a Turkish woman slipped a two-piece ""bonnet"" over her head. The headpiece tightly covered Buderacky's hair, leaving only her neck and face exposed. Nearby, a Russian-speaking model dressed in a sky-blue version of the same outfit whispered to a friend, ""I look like a clown."" Moments later, to the soundtrack of throbbing dance music, the women strutted across the stage dressed in an array of these pastel-colored costumes. The costumes are part of a swimsuit collection. Known as Hasema after the Turkish company that manufactures them, the full-body suits are designed to let conservative women swim and exercise at the beach or pool without being too revealing. Turan Kisa, an export marketer for Hasema, said the suits are exported to 35 countries. ""Muslim women are choosing these models,"" he said holding up a sequin-embroidered lilac-colored full-body bathing suit. ""Especially the last five years, Muslim women [are] really following fashion."" According to the manufacturers at this trade show, the Islamic women's fashion industry is growing and evolving. It also seems to be co-opting sales and marketing methods perfected in the secular fashion world. ""Ten years ago, most of the colors were black or grey,"" says Halim Ozahi of the Turkish manufacturer Buketex. ""Now you can see everywhere pink, yellow, blue."" Ozahi said during the same time period his company had gone from manufacturing 10 different dress designs to more then 150. The designs on display here are a far cry from the black robes and all-concealing burqas many Westerners associate with the Islamic world. ""The younger generation of Muslims coming up, they want something stylish,"" said Hamza Ali, a visiting American who works with the South Carolina-based company Muslimclothing.com. ""There's nothing wrong with being beautiful, there's nothing wrong with being classy, nothing wrong with being fashionable, nothing wrong with wearing the latest thing out there. As long as it's modest,"" Ali added. This relatively new industry may be growing, but it still appears to be dominated by men. Most of the sales representatives manning booths at the trade show are male. Nur Yamankaradeniz is one exception. She designs high-priced gowns studded with Swarovski crystals for conservative Muslim women as well as their secular counterparts. ""A covered person should not be scary, she should look nice,"" Yamankaradeniz said. ""We are trying very hard to get them to accept this."" Yamankaradeniz herself was dressed in a black trench-coat, with a lavender blouse, a brown paisley-patterned headscarf, and a gold watch studded with diamonds. One of the few Muslim models hired to stride the catwalk here is Alfina Nasyrova, a woman who wore a midriff revealing t-shirt as she did her make-up backstage. ""In these clothes, you are feeling so clean, so pure,"" she said, after changing into a blue-and-white striped full body Hasema swim suit. Asked whether she would wear a Hasema to the beach this summer, she answered, with a laugh, ""Normally, I wear a bikini.""","Islamic fashion shows off designs for fashion conscious, conservative Muslim women .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces erupted along Israel's borders and occupied territories Sunday, leaving at least 12 dead on a Palestinian mourning day marking the birth of the Jewish state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried what he called ""violent demonstrations"" aimed at undermining Israel's existence. ""We hope for the peace and restfulness to return quickly, but no one should be mistaken -- we are determined to defend our borders and our sovereignty,"" Netanyahu said. The conflicts broke out on ""Nakba Day."" Nakba -- Arabic for ""catastrophe"" -- marks the period when more than 700,000 Arabs were displaced from their homes during fighting that followed the creation of Israel in 1948. Two protesters were killed and 170 were wounded Sunday when fighting broke out in the Golan Heights area, the Syrian Arab News Agency said. And at least 10 were killed and 112 others were injured in clashes along the line of demarcation with Lebanon, Lebanon's state news agency reported. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators also clashed with Jordanian security forces near the border of Jordan and Israel, injuring 25 people including police officers and protesters, according to a Jordanian police spokesman. In the most violent confrontations Sunday, an Israeli military spokeswoman said, troops fired on demonstrators who were illegally crossing from Lebanon and Syria and damaging ""security infrastructure."" But Syrian and Lebanese officials criticized what they said were Israeli attacks, state media reported. Israel's military accused Syria of inciting a crisis to divert attention from its own clampdown on anti-government demonstrations. Ten Israeli soldiers and three officers were injured in the clashes, the Israel Defense Forces reported. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Ban had called on all sides to ""show restraint and refrain from provocations so as to prevent escalation of tensions and ensure civilians are not killed or injured."" ""He (Ban) reiterates the urgent need for a just, lasting and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, which ensures dignity and security for all, including an end to occupation, an end to conflict, and a just and agreed solution to the plight of Palestinian refugees,"" the spokesman said in a statement. The Israeli military also was attempting to push back demonstrators near the Erez crossing which connects Israel and Gaza, where medical sources said at least 70 people had been injured. Large clashes broke out between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians near a checkpoint that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem as well. Some protesters hurled rocks, while Israel's military met approaching protesters with volleys of tear gas and rubber-bullet fire. ""We tried as best as we could not to hit anyone innocent,"" said Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, an Israeli military spokeswoman. ""At the end of the day, we are protecting civilians here in Israel."" Israeli soldiers fired warning shots in the air after dozens of Syrians broke through the line of demarcation and entered the Golan Heights, she said. Israel captured the region from Syria in 1967 and has occupied it ever since. A statement from the military said forces ""fired selectively towards rioters who were targeting security infrastructure and some were injured as a result."" ""The Syrian regime (was) attempting to divert world attention from their brutal crackdown and to incite violence on the Israel-Syrian border,"" Leibovich said. Reports from non-government organizations suggest between 700 and 850 people have been killed since the start of anti-government protests in Syria and ""thousands of other people have reportedly been arrested,"" the United Nations said Friday. ""Syria condemns Israel's criminal practices against the people in Golan, Palestine and South Lebanon which resulted in a number of martyrs and injured people,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported, citing an official with the country's foreign ministry. Syrian state television Sunday showed protesters along the border using Palestinian flags to fan an injured victim lying on the ground. Different accounts were emerging Sunday of clashes along the UN line of demarcation that separates Israel and Lebanon , where ambulances stood by as the steady crackle of gunfire filled the air. Lebanon's state news agency said five people were killed and 56 others were injured. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots after protesters attempted to breach a fence and infiltrate into Israeli territory . It was unclear who fired the shots that killed and injured protesters. The Lebanese military was also deployed along the line of demarcation, Leibovich said, and they were using live fire to stop protesters as well. ""The IDF sees the governments of Syria and Lebanon as responsible for any violence or provocation towards Israel that emanates from their respective territories,"" the Israeli military said in a statement. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri issued a statement supporting the Palestinian cause and criticizing what he said was Israel's ""blatant and intolerable aggression"" toward peaceful demonstrators Sunday. ""On this day, we cannot but strongly condemn Israel's continuous violation of human rights, and the fact that it faces peaceful movements of the Arab citizens in Lebanon, Golan and Palestine with killing and murder,"" he said. The commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ""urged antagonists to exercise maximum self-restraint,"" Lebanese state media said. Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai told CNN affiliate Channel 2 that dozens of men had broken through a crossroad and entered the Erez crossing near Gaza. The Israeli military was trying to push back demonstrators using live ammunition and anti-demonstration weapons, he said. Medical sources reported that 70 people had been injured there, and 15 of them were in critical condition. ""The Nakba is the defining event in our history and collective struggle,"" Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said in a statement released Sunday. ""Once Israel recognizes the right of return, Palestinian refugees must be given options and allowed to choose how they want that right to be implemented. Those options must be meaningful and must include return to their original homes and villages,"" he added. ""For there to be a just and lasting peace, their choices must be respected."" New questions about the viability of the stalled peace process were raised this month in the wake of a formal reconciliation agreement between the two largest Palestinian factions: President Mahmoud Abbas' party, the West Bank-based Fatah, and the Islamist group Hamas, which rules Gaza. Both Israel and the United States consider Hamas a terrorist organization and have voiced strong opposition to the inclusion of the group in any unity government, demanding that it first renounce violence, recognize the state of Israel and abide by all previous agreements. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian lawmaker who helped negotiate the Fatah-Hamas agreement, said Sunday that the reconciliation signaled a ""golden opportunity to make peace"" between Israelis and Palestinians. An Israeli government spokesman said Sunday that the country would continue to push for peace, but he said the agreement with Hamas was a significant stumbling block. ""It's clear that there's really a problem here if the Palestinian leadership has chosen Hamas as a partner,"" he said. Barghouti criticized Israel's reaction to the news. ""I think this Israeli government unfortunately is working against the interests of its own people, against the interests of peace and against the interests of Palestinians,"" he said. Elsewhere in the region, pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with police outside the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday. ""We want to cut diplomatic relations between Egypt and Israel,"" said Islam Amin, a university student. ""Israel is our enemy. We know it's our enemy. But we don't want a war."" Egyptian police said they had arrested 30 people by late Sunday and state news reported that at least 24 people were injured. In the Jordan Valley, anti-riot forces fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse an estimated 800 demonstrators in the town of Shouneh, two kilometers from the closest land crossing to Jerusalem, after dozens of participants attempted to break through a military checkpoint. According to Jordanian police Lt. Col. Mohammed Khatib, clashes broke out shortly after 11 protesters -- including three children -- attempted to cross the Israeli border to ""free Palestine."" The ensuing clashes left 11 police officers and 14 protesters injured, all of whom have been treated and released, according to Khatib. Jordan, home to 1.8 million U.N.-registered Palestinians, is one of two Arab countries with normalized relations with Israel.

"(CNN) -- They spoke with the passion that only those who have lost so much can speak. Six weeks since the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting claimed the lives of 20 elementary school kids and six educators, hundreds filled the local high school auditorium, nearly all raising their voices for tougher gun control laws before a state task force. For six hours, they poured out their hearts, their losses and their tears. ""We all recognize December 14 as the day hell came to Newtown,"" said Nicole Hockley, mother of 6-year-old Dylan, who was one of the children killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Dave Wheeler, who also lost his son Benjamin that day, calmly told the legislative panel that the government's priorities need to be set straight. Read more: Loaded language poisons gun debate . ""The liberty of any person to own a military-style assault weapon and a high-capacity magazine and keep them in their home is second to the right of my son to his life,"" he said, noting that the Constitution says Americans are endowed with the inalienable rights of ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" ""Let's honor the founding documents and get our priorities straight,"" he concluded, to a standing ovation. Other parents called for the community to rally before the hearing, which focused on gun violence, mental health and school safety. ""Together we can turn this tragedy into the event that turned the tide. That empowered us, as individuals, a society and the world, to choose love,"" said Scarlet Lewis, mother of Jesse. While calls for tougher gun laws far outnumbered those arguing against them, several speakers said the weapons are not the problem. Read more: How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . ""Neither the size of the magazine nor the style of the rifle will affect the actions of evil,"" Brian Shimer said. ""Those wishing to do harm to those wishing to do good will never be swayed by the laws of men."" And Michael Collin said he didn't want to be in a situation where he could be outgunned. ""I don't want to have to wait for someone to come to defend me. I want to be able to defend myself,"" he said, concerned about speaking his mind in a town still grieving so deeply. But the hearing was not contentious. ""Even if Mike Collins and I disagree, I respect him immensely,"" said Dr. William Begg, one of the physicians who tried to save lives after the shooting. ""What I'm asking is you consider a stronger assault weapons ban, elimination of the sale of semiautomatic weapons, restriction in the size of magazine clips."" This month, President Barack Obama unveiled a two-pronged approach to gun violence that included legislation and a set of executive actions. He called on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, institute universal background checks on gun purchases and outlaw gun magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. But the residents of Newtown didn't appear to be content to wait for Washington to move, calling their home state to take action. ""Connecticut, the U.S. is at a crossroads and the nation's eyes are on us and you,"" said Newtown resident Georgia Monaghan. ""Show America the way.""

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court Thursday reinstated a key part of a new Texas abortion law, considered to be among the most restrictive in the country. The decision came three days after a federal judge struck down the provision, which requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. A day before parts of the law were scheduled to take effect, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel on Monday issued an injunction blocking the law's admitting privileges requirement, arguing that it ""places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her."" Thursday's decision means the requirement will remain in place while a lawsuit moves forward. The lawsuit -- filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas -- alleged the state's new abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions. In a statement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America said the requirement that doctors have admitting privileges is expected to cause at least one-third of the state's licensed health centers that provide abortion services to stop. ""While we acknowledge that Planned Parenthood has also made a strong showing that their interests would be harmed by staying the injunction, given the State's likely success on the merits, this is not enough, standing alone, to outweigh the other factors,"" read a part of Thursday's 20-page ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Gov. Rick Perry then called the Legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill. ""This fight is far from over. This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide,"" said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. ""If Texans showed America one thing during the historic protests against this law this summer, we demonstrated that Texans value women's health â€” and that is why we will take every step we can to protect the health of Texas women in the wake of this ruling,"" she said. Perry cheered the ruling. ""Today's decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of Texas. We will continue doing everything we can to protect a culture of life in our state,"" he said in a statement. CNN's Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.","NEW: Gov.

"(CNN) -- The FBI has begun a preliminary inquiry into allegations by the CIA that Senate staffers obtained unauthorized access to classified documents related to the agency's now-defunct post-9/11 interrogation program, according to people familiar with the matter. The CIA's charges, made in criminal referrals to the Justice Department, are in contrast to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein's accusations last week that the agency spied on computers used by committee staffers at a CIA facility to investigate the Bush-era interrogation program. The committee staff has produced a 6,300-page report on the program, which critics say violated prohibitions on torture and exceeded legal guidance from the Justice Department. But the report remains in limbo, awaiting a declassification review by the CIA, which has disputed some of Senate findings. The unusual dispute has raised tensions between the agency and lawmakers charged with overseeing the agency's activities. Feinstein is usually one of the intelligence community's staunchest allies in Congress. Justice Department officials have tried to avoid getting drawn into the fight, and some lawmakers have questioned whether it is appropriate for Justice, as an agency in the executive branch, to probe a dispute between legislators and another agency. The FBI's preliminary inquiry is intended to determine whether a full-fledged investigation is warranted, people familiar with the matter said. McClatchy Newspapers first reported the FBI inquiry. CIA Director John Brennan has disputed Feinstein's accusations. Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations last week, he said ""when the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong."" Documents that prompted the dispute relate to an internal review by former CIA Director Leon Panetta and, according to the agency, were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee. The documents were plainly labeled as for internal use and were not supposed to be reviewed by the committee. Feinstein said Senate staffers found the documents in the course of their work that were put in the computer system either on purpose by a whistleblower or perhaps in error, and that they corroborated some of the committee's findings that the agency now says it disagrees with. She said committee staff routinely sees such documents and didn't violate any classified restrictions. Dean Boyd, a CIA spokesman, said in an op-ed published in USA Today that the agency acted properly after it discovered Senate staffers may have accessed and retained sensitive documents stored in a CIA computer network. ""These documents were privileged, deliberative, pre-decisional executive branch material that implicated separation of powers concerns,"" Boyd wrote. ""Because we were concerned that there may have been a breach or vulnerability in the CIA local area network on which CIA stored these documents, CIA information technology specialists were asked to conduct a limited review to determine whether these files were located on the side of the CIA network the committee was authorized to use. That review appeared to confirm the committee's unauthorized access to the documents.""","Preliminary inquiry over CIA allegations Senate staffers obtained unauthorized access to documents .

"(EW) -- There's a good chance you never knew you needed to witness the sight of an angry ape charging on horseback, double-fisting a pair of machine guns. But trust me, you do. Although Jane Goodall might disagree, that showstopping sequence of lead-spraying primate mayhem is just one of the many giddy pleasures in Matt Reeves' surprisingly rollicking and resonant ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" â€” a sequel that easily tops its 2011 predecessor. Picking up 10 incident-stuffed years after the James Franco-led first film left off, ""Dawn"" sets the stage as most post-apocalyptic movies do nowadays: with a helter-skelter montage of dire news reports informing us that humanity has been nearly decimated by a virulent strain of simian flu, and that cities such as San Francisco, where the film is set, have been reduced to overgrown piles of rubble and ruin. Critical Mass: Hail, Caesar and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' But while Earth's human population isn't doing so hot, the apes are thriving. Caesar, the cute chimp raised by Franco in the franchise opener, is now the wise and benevolent leader of his species. He and his gang all live in Muir Woods just north of the city, where they've not only learned to read, write, and speak (English, naturally), they've also nurtured a healthy distrust of humankind. That's probably smart, considering that the humans have crowned a Caesar of their own (actually, more like a Nero) in Gary Oldman's Dreyfus, a tin-badge fascist whose mantra seems to be ""the only good ape is a dead ape."" Needing electricity to power their shantytown, Oldman dispatches a group of outdoorsy human ambassadors (including the chimp-athetic Jason Clarke and Keri Russell) to strike a deal with Caesar to let them repair a hydroelectric dam on ape turf. Andy Serkis: Hollywood's most bankable invisible actor . Wariness on both sides leads to betrayal and war, and the movie's off to the Uzi-toting-ape-on-horseback races. Reeves, whose previous films ""Cloverfield"" and ""Let Me In"" were stronger on promise than payoff, stages these battles with amazing technical skill and a real painter's eye. His images, as undeniably silly as they are, are so striking they stick with you â€” especially a beaut in which a ticked-off ape mans the rat-a-tat turret of a tank. If only as much care were put into the film's human characters. Oldman nearly pops a hernia from hamming it up so hard, and Clarke's melancholy eyes are so perpetually moist in his admiration of the apes, you want to offer a tissue. The one truly great performance belongs to Andy Serkis, whose Caesar is his most soulful motion-capture creation yet. Despite all the obscuring layers of digital trickery, the actor manages to convey an impressive physicality and array of emotions, from hope to grief to rage. I won't spoil which side wins the interspecies showdown, but when it comes to who does the better acting, the apes carry the day, (hairy) hands down. Grade: B+ . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Imagine the size of the box this one came in -- a Lego tower stretching 36 meters into the sky above the Hungarian capital Budapest. The 34.76- meter (114 feet) tower, which was completed on Sunday, has been certified as the world's tallest toy brick structure by Guinness World Records. It beat the previous record holder, a 34.4-meter structure constructed last year with the help of U.S. students from a school in Delaware. A spokesman for Guinness World Records confirmed that the tower qualified as the ""tallest structure built with interlocking plastic bricks."" He said the record was officially registered to Lego Store Budapest on May 25. The Budapest tower, topped by a Rubik's cube -- a Hungarian invention -- was also built with the help of Hungarian primary school children, according to local news websites. The structure, built in front of the city's St. Stephen's Basilica, used hundreds of thousands of blocks.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hackers based in Iran used social networks to spy on high-ranking U.S. and Israeli officials, a new report by a cybersecurity firm claims. Posing as journalists and government officials, the hackers have been working for about three years to get close to their targets, connecting with at least 2,000 people in the process, according to the report from iSight Partners. ""While it's low sophistication technically, it's actually one of the most elaborate social media, or socially engineered, espionage campaigns we've ever seen,"" Tiffany Jones, a senior vice president at iSight, told CNN. The firm says that it doesn't have hard evidence tying Iran to the hacking but that ""the targeting, operational schedule, and infrastructure used in this campaign is consistent with Iranian origins."" Fake identities . How does the scheme work? According to iSight, the hackers create fake accounts on social networks masquerading as journalists, government officials and defense contractor employees. They have even set up a bogus online news website, newsonair.org, to bolster their credentials, and have sometimes used real reporters' names, photographs and biographies. The hackers endeavor to build social network connections with friends, relatives and colleagues of their targets, who included senior American military and diplomatic officials, congressional staffers and defense contractors in the United States and Israel. Once they make contact with a target individual, the hackers try to establish their credibility, by initially sending messages with links to real news stories, for example. But over time, they lure the target to a fake website, where they steal their passwords and other credentials, or get them to download malicious software. U.S. admiral among connections . The investigators at iSight said it isn't clear at the moment how many credentials the campaign has harvested so far. But among the more than 2,000 people with whom the hackers made connections are a four-star U.S. admiral, British and Saudi officials, journalists and lawmakers. None of the people were named. The hackers appeared to be after national security information, but what exactly they got their hands on remains unclear. ""The actors have intimated their interest in specific defense technology as well as military and diplomatic information by their targeting,"" iSight said. ""This type of targeting is inconsistent with cybercriminal behavior."" There's no smoking gun pointing to official Iranian involvement in the scheme. The report cites circumstantial evidence that suggests the hackers operated from Iran. ""What we can say is -- based on who was targeted, the types of information they were going after, the infrastructure that was used and where it's registered in Tehran and a number of other indicators -- that we believe there are links to Iranian actors here,"" Jones said. The hackers kept up a regular schedule that fits with working hours in Tehran, including the lunch break, according to iSight. Networks respond . Facebook says it became aware of the scheme while investigating suspicious activity and has removed the fake profiles associated with the hackers. LinkedIn says it's looking into the claims. The FBI and State Department say they received copies of the report but aren't commenting on it directly. The State Department says it has been aware in the past of hackers from Iran using social media websites to investigate targets, including U.S. officials. As far as the general public is concerned, iSight advises vigilance when using social networks. ""Do not create trusted connections with unknown organizations and/or individuals,"" it says. ""Never provide login credentials with any site or person who contacts to you (rather than you contacting it)."" CNN's Elise Labott reported from Washington, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Hackers posed as journalists and government officials, a cybersecurity report says .

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger underwent heart surgery to replace an aortic valve at a New York hospital Tuesday, according to a hospital statement. Kissinger, 91, served as national security adviser and secretary of state during the Nixon administration. He remained secretary of state through the short Ford presidency and held the adviser position for part of that administration. ""He is resting comfortably,"" a New York-Presbyterian Hospital statement said. Kissinger has a history of heart trouble, including undergoing a triple coronary bypass in 1982 and an angioplasty procedure in 2005. Born in Germany, he came to the United States with his family to escape Hitler's Nazi regime in 1938. Kissinger became a U.S. citizen and joined the U.S. Army in 1943. He joined the Harvard University faculty in 1954, but he soon began consulting with the U.S. State Department and Pentagon on national security matters. Nixon took Kissinger with him to the White House in 1969 to serve as his national security adviser, a job that included the initiation of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) with the Soviet Union. Time magazine named Nixon and Kissinger as the magazine's Men of the Year for 1972. Kissinger shared the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with Vietnamese revolutionary Le Duc Tho for helping establish a cease-fire in Vietnam.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy's topsy-turvy form continued at the Scottish Open as the former World No. 1 prepares for the British Open next week. McIlroy hit a three-under-par 68 Saturday, a big improvement on Friday's seven-over-par 78, but not quite as good as Thursday's course record 64. ""It's important for me going now into Sunday's last round thinking to myself that I have shot 64 and 68 on this golf course, which are two really good scores,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""Friday was just one of those days where nothing really went right. I couldn't get any momentum.

"(Mashable) -- Despite previous statements that he had no plans to see ""The Social Network,"" Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg did, in fact, watch the film on the company's field trip to the movies last Friday. I just wrapped up an interview with Facebook's iconic founder and Groups Product Manager Justin Schaffer at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, California. We discussed the new Groups feature and data portability, but I did also manage to sneak in a question or two about the film, specifically about Zuckerberg's take on it. While Zuckerberg skirted questions about his opinion of Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of his early years, the 26-year-old CEO did say he's interested to see what effect ""The Social Network"" has on entrepreneurship. He told me that he gets ""lots of messages"" from people who claim that they have been very much inspired by what he's done; some say he's inspired them to go into computer science, others to start their own company. I couldn't get him to rate the film for me, but I did get him to talk about what effect he thought it would have on the company he's built. He's been asked a lot of questions about what exactly happened during Facebook's early years, he said in our interview. However, he added, ""We build products that 500 million people see... If 5 million people see a movie, it doesn't really matter that much."" In other words, the movie is a drop in the bucket compared to Facebook's bigger ambitions to make the entire world more social. It seems like he's stopped worrying about the potential impact of the movie on Facebook's image and is focused on building and launching new products. We've said all along that Zuckerberg should like the Facebook movie. I don't think you'll see him promoting it for an Oscar anytime soon, but it doesn't seem like he fears it anymore, either. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Steve Jobs and Microsoft's Bill Gates have done it. So have Al Gore, George Lucas and John McCain. Those heavyweights and many more were all speakers at the annual D: All Things Digital conference, which begins Tuesday in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, near Los Angeles. Created in 2003 by tech columnists Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal, the conference is a yearly showcase for tech industry leaders along with bold-face names from business, entertainment and politics. Over the years, the conference has become known for both its consistent roster of influential Web and tech figures and its relatively exclusive nature: It's held at a luxury resort. Attendance is limited, with past events being held to 500 attendees. (CNN.com will be attending the conference, dubbed D9 because it's in its ninth year, and reporting whenever its speakers make news). Scheduled speakers include Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Walt Disney Co. President and CEO Robert A. Iger and Groupon founder Andrew Mason. Tech, Web and social-networking companies have been known to roll out new features and gadgets at the conference. Much of the speculation this year is centered on whether Microsoft will leap into the tablet computer field, aiming to compete with the Apple iPad, RIM's PlayBook and various Android devices. Steve Sinofsky, president of Microsoft Windows, is scheduled to speak at the conference, and Bloomberg cites anonymous sources saying he'll be exhibiting new tablet software. The emerging mobile-payment space might also get some attention. Google's Eric Schmidt and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, now CEO of Square, are both scheduled to speak. Both of those companies made announcements last week about apps designed to let people make and receive payments using their mobile phones. Past D: All Things Digital conferences have produced some buzz-creating moments. In 2007, Jobs and Gates sat down for a joint interview. In a particularly amusing segment (in retrospect), Gates expounded on his ownership of a tablet computer and how such handheld slates could emerge in the future. Jobs, who would roll out the iPad just over two years later, just listened and smiled before vaguely predicting more ""post-PC devices."" Last year, Zuckerberg's appearance at D8 brought him attention for all the wrong reasons.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration said Friday its officers at a Texas  airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the procedures should be changed. The woman involved -- Mandi Hamlin -- told reporters earlier Friday she was humiliated by last month's incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male TSA officers nearby. The incident occurred at the Lubbock, Texas, airport. The officers ""rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved,"" the TSA said in a statement posted on its Web site Friday afternoon. ""TSA supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing Lubbock that day."" However, ""TSA has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed,"" the statement said. ""In the future, TSA will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question."" Hamlin and her lawyer, celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, said they want a public apology from the agency, as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect. Allred pointed out that TSA's Web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said Hamlin was never offered. ""The conduct of TSA was cruel and unnecessary,"" Allred told reporters at a news conference. ""Last time that I checked, a nipple was not a dangerous weapon."" She said if an apology was not forthcoming, ""Mandi is going to have to consider her legal options."" Attempts by CNN to reach Allred for a response to the TSA statement Friday afternoon were unsuccessful. TSA said in its statement it acknowledges ""that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets (the) situation in which she found herself. We appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again."" The incident occurred February 24 as Hamlin, 37, was preparing to fly to Dallas-Fort Worth from Lubbock, where she had been visiting her elderly great-uncle. Hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport. She did not set off the metal detector at Lubbock International Airport, but was pulled to the side for additional screening, Allred said. A hand wand used by a TSA officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts. Hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them. ""Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,"" Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA. ""After nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove. In addition, once removed, the pierced skin may close up almost immediately, making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing."" More officers were called over, and the group grew to four male and two female TSA officers, according to Hamlin. Also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather. The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said. ""She felt humiliated by the scene that the TSA officers were making,"" Allred said. ""With tears streaming down her face, she again asked to show the piercings to a TSA officer instead of having to remove them. She was told, however, she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them. Had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down, she would have chosen that option."" She eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings, Allred said. One came out easily, but the other would not, and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers. She was handed a large pair, Allred said. ""As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male TSA officers snickering in the background,"" Allred said in the letter. ""Mandi Hamlin was publicly humiliated. ... Clearly, this is not how passengers should be treated.""  Watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry » . Afterward, Hamlin underwent another scan, but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring. She offered to remove it, Allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it. Hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed, Allred said. ""I wouldn't wish this experience upon anyone,"" Hamlin told reporters. ""I felt surprised, embarrassed, humiliated and scared. No one deserves to go through this."" In a statement earlier Friday, the TSA said it ""is well aware of terrorists' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body. Therefore, we have a duty to the American public to resolve any alarm that we discover."" TSA included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a ""bra bomb"" in training and testing its officers. Hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted, and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed. ""People who are pierced should not be snickered at, should not become the object of ridicule, should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment,"" Allred said. ""They should be respected just like everybody else."" She said she had received a call from TSA's public affairs office Friday morning. ""We hope that means they're going to jump on this and do something about it,"" she said. ""We want TSA to do the right thing now. We're going to give them the opportunity."" Hamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the Lubbock airport. The next time she visits her great-uncle, she said, ""I will be driving."" E-mail to a friend .

"Vernon, Connecticut (CNN) -- A Connecticut judge ruled Wednesday that he does not have the authority to grant bail for Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel, who awaits a new trial in the 1975 slaying of neighbor Martha Moxley. Appellate Court Judge Thomas Bishop has said any bail should be determined by the criminal court where Skakel's new trial would be held. Bishop, who two weeks ago ruled Skakel's conviction should be overturned, on Wednesday lifted an automatic stay on that ruling, clearing the way for a new trial. In overturning the conviction, Bishop said Skakel, 53, had been poorly represented at his murder trial. As part of the proceedings for a new trial, Skakel could be allowed to leave jail on bail, but Bishop said he wants the criminal court to decide on the conditions of any possible release. The state has 10 days to ask an appellate court to review Bishop's decision to lift the stay. A state attorney told reporters the government is yet to decide whether it will ask for that review and declined to comment further. The state has said it will appeal the ruling that overturns the conviction, a process the judge said could take several years. But that does not preclude Skakel from seeking bail. Skakel's attorney, Hubert Santos, when asked about his client's state of mind, told reporters Skakel ""understands this is a long process,"" but declined further comment. Last month, Bishop ruled that defense attorney Michael ""Mickey"" Sherman's representation of Skakel at his 2002 trial was ""constitutionally deficient"" and overturned the conviction. Moxley's body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Authorities said she was bludgeoned and stabbed to death; a broken golf club was found near her body. The case languished for more than two decades. A series of books on the high-profile crime renewed interest, leading to new tips and a new suspect in January 2000: Skakel, who was 15 at the time of the killing. Skakel, the nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, has always proclaimed his innocence. Fast Facts - Michael Skakel .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Thousands of defiant protesters swept again Saturday into the streets of the Iranian capital, where they clashed with police armed with batons, tear gas and water cannons. Demonstrators run past a burning barricade Saturday on a street in Tehran, Iran. A stream of videos posted on social networking Web sites depicted scenes of chaos -- the sound of gunshots and helicopters whirring overhead and graphic images of wounded men and women being carried away. Unconfirmed reports put the death toll as high as 150 on the seventh day of post-election protests. Sources at one Tehran hospital confirmed 19 deaths Saturday. The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said numerous protesters who had been beaten and injured by security forces were arrested and detained when they sought medical treatment in hospitals. It said fear of arrest had reportedly driven injured protesters, some in serious condition, to seek care at foreign embassies. One woman, Shahnaz, said riot police used batons and water hoses to keep her and about 300 other people from reaching Revolution Square in central Tehran. She said she saw helicopters hovering and then she saw tear gas. Shahnaz is being identified only by her first name for safety reasons. Verifiable information was hard to come by. The Ministry of Culture on Saturday banned international media from reporting on the demonstrations unless they receive permission from Iranian authorities. A freelance journalist said it was ""very dangerous"" to take pictures.  Watch police and protesters clash » . At midnight, a stretch of a main avenue near Revolution Square was littered with rocks, street signs and burned tires and trash, witnesses said. Windows were shattered and hundreds of uniformed riot police lined the streets. In wealthy neighborhoods, reports surfaced late Saturday of raids by the Basiji militia, a paramilitary security force loyal to the government. The demonstrations unfolded as opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi reportedly declared he was ready for ""martyrdom."" That was the message posted on Moussavi's page on Facebook, the social networking Web site that has proved to be a key source of information in the absence of international media coverage. iReport.com: Share images from Iran . The message urged Moussavi's supporters to ""protest"" and ""not go to work."" ""Today you are the media,"" said one message. ""It is your duty to report and keep the hope alive."" Iran's ruling system is ""going to the slaughterhouse,"" a post on the site said. The post, attributed to Moussavi, reasserted his call for a new election to be overseen by an independent council. The authenticity of the information could not immediately be established, but its posting coincided with growing unrest by demonstrators, who complain that hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election victory was rigged. The protests were held in open defiance of warnings issued Friday by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the country's Security Council. Those authorities had said that protest organizers -- specifically Moussavi -- would be held accountable if the protests led to bloodshed.  See images of the clashes Saturday » . One video showed a woman trying to protect a man being beaten and kicked by protesters near a motorcycle in flames. Another showed that the unrest had spread beyond the capital -- police clad in riot gear dispersing a crowd at a university in the southern city of Shiraz, beating screaming women with their batons. Witnesses in Tehran said crowd members were chanting ""Death to Khamenei!"" and ""I will kill whoever killed my brother!"" The latter phrase dates to Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power.  Watch how protesters' tone has changed » . The chants from rooftops of ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great) grew longer and louder. In a story posted Saturday on the Web site of the government-run Press TV, Iran's deputy police commander said 400 police personnel had been wounded since the opposition rallies began last weekend. ""Families of those killed or injured in the events since June 12 have filed 2,000 complaints so far,"" acting Police Chief Brigadier Gen. Ahmad-Reza Radan told Iran's Fars news agency. Radan said 10,000 complaints had been filed by people asserting that their daily lives had been disrupted, adding, ""They have called on the police to deal with rallies firmly."" Demonstrators gathered in major cities in France, the United States and Germany to condemn the crackdown.  Watch demonstrators in New York demand change » . In Washington, President Obama urged the Iranian government to stop the violence. ""The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people."" ""If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent, not coercion,"" the statement said. On Saturday night, the Iranian state-run news agency IRINN said an attacker had been killed earlier in the day outside Tehran at the entrance to the mausoleum that holds the body of Ayatollah Khomeini. The agency said the man ""carrying the bomb"" was killed, and there were no other casualties. Press TV was reporting that the bomber was the sole fatality, and that three other people were wounded at the shrine to Khomeini, the father of the Islamic Revolution that swept the shah of Iran from power in 1979. Khomeini is regarded as the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. With international journalists restricted from covering events in the capital, Iranians were again using cell phones and social networking sites to get news out. CNN was told that many protesters removed the SIM card, or memory chip, from their cell phones to prevent the government from tracing their calls.  Watch a protest at Shiraz University » . Witnesses reported that cell phone service was cut off in the area after 5:30 p.m. Meanwhile, the Iranian government said Saturday it is ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of ""ballot boxes.""

"(CNN) -- Two sailors have died after the Navy helicopter they were in crashed Wednesday off the southern Virginia coast, the Navy said. The Coast Guard, Virginia Beach Fire Department and Navy continued Wednesday night to search for another sailor who'd been aboard the fallen aircraft. Two sailors who had been rescued were in stable condition at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, the Navy said in a statement. ""Today has been a tough day for all of us,"" said Capt. Todd Flannery, commander of the Navy's Helicopter Sea Combat Wing Atlantic, based in Norfolk, Virginia. Flannery made that comment late Wednesday afternoon, hours before the Navy announced the second fatality in the crash in ice-cold waters about 18 nautical miles (21 miles) east of Cape Henry. At the time, he said two injured sailors were stable, while another was preparing to undergo surgery at the Norfolk hospital. Authorities offered no indication that they knew the missing sailor's whereabouts, with Flannery saying it was possible he or she sunk to the Atlantic Ocean floor inside the crashed MH-53E Sea Dragon. Speaking then about those aboard two Coast Guard boats among those participating in the search,"" Coast Guard Capt. John Little said, ""They could not see the helicopter, but they are continuing to search."" The Navy helicopter and its five-person crew set off Wednesday morning from Norfolk on what Flannery described as a ""routine mine countermeasure operations."" The first apparent sign of trouble came around 10:45 a.m., when the aircraft's crew issued a distress call. It went down soon thereafter, with a second MH-53E Sea Dragon operating in the same area providing ""immediate support,"" according to Flannery. Two Navy helicopters assigned to the same 600- to 700-sailor squadron quickly rushed to the scene, spotting four of the sailors ""close to the wreckage floating in the water"" around 11:15 a.m., Flannery said. The air temperature was 28 degrees and the water temperature was 41 degrees, with 1- to 2-foot seas, Coast Guard spokesman Nyx Cangemi said. The sailors were hoisted up two-apiece in two rounds -- the first pair 10 minutes after the rescuers' arrival, and the other set at 11:38 a.m., said the Navy captain. They were quickly transported to the Norfolk hospital. Flannery said he was not sure whether the first confirmed fatality died en route to or at the hospital. ""I saw a big Navy helicopter land here and it landed really quick and fast,"" Chris Goetz told CNN affiliate WAVY at the hospital. ""They took two guys in on the stretchers and immediately took back off and came back maybe five minutes later and had two more guys all on stretchers."" The 87-foot Coast Guard Cutter Shearwater happened to be in the area at the time. ""They did not see the crash -- they were that far away -- but heard it and heard our call for assistance and immediately responded,"" said Little of the Coast Guard. That ship is one of four now surveying the scene from water level, along with another Coast Guard and two fire boats from the Virginia Beach Fire Department. The helicopter was assigned to Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron Fourteen (HM-14), which is based at Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field. The MH-53E Sea Dragon carries no weapons. It has two pilots and a crew of one to six, depending on its mission, according to the Navy. There were 31 of the aircraft in operation, it said. Its role includes anti-mine operations. Flannery didn't detail the information communicated in Wednesday's distress call or what may have caused the helicopter to go down, saying that an investigation board will be looking into that. But he didn't hesitate when asked whether he had any concerns, generally, about the safety of MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters in the wake of Wednesday's crash. ""I do not,"" Flannery said.

"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (CNN) -- Four men behind a Swedish file-sharing Web site used by millions to exchange movies and music have been found guilty of collaborating to violate copyright law in a landmark court verdict in Stockholm. A Pirate Bay server, confiscated by police last year, on display in Stockholm's Technical Museum. The four defendants -- Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi and Carl Lundstrom, three founders and one patron of The Pirate Bay -- were sentenced to one year in jail and also ordered to pay 30 million kronor ($3.6 million) in damages to several major media companies including Warner Brothers, Columbia, Twentieth Century Fox, Sony BMG and EMI.  The defendants are free without restrictions while they appeal the judgment. The Pirate Bay allows users to exchange files including movies, music, games and software, but does not host the files itself. It claims more than 3.5 million registered users. The court case, which involved both a criminal case and a civil claim brought by the media companies, marks a key victory for anti-piracy campaigners, who had long targeted the Web site. Should the perpetrators of Internet piracy be punished? Have your say . The year-long prison terms are for violating Swedish law, while the damages are compensation to the media giants in the civil case -- though the court ordered the men to pay just one-third of the 110 million kronor ($13 million) which the companies had asked for. Friday's verdict did not include an order to shut down The Pirate Bay site. Its owners have consistently shrugged off legal threats and police raids, posting letters from entertainment industry lawyers on their Web site with mocking responses. When Dreamworks studio demanded that the site act over file-sharing of Dreamworks' movie ""Shrek 2,"" The Pirate Bay threatened to sue for harassment and lodge a formal complaint ""for sending frivolous legal threats."" ""It is the opinion of us and our lawyers that you are ... morons,"" the response continued, suggesting that studio representatives perform a sexual act. The response closed with an obscenity. Site owners dismissed the effects of a police raid in 2006, saying the site had been down longer on other occasions due to illness or drunkenness than when ""the U.S. and Swedish government forces the police to steal our servers ... yawn."" But Magnus Eriksson, who in 2003 co-founded the ""loosely formed group of theorists, artists and programmers"" that spawned The Pirate Bay, says there are serious issues at stake. He does not think copyrighted material should be free for everyone, ""but that it already is."" ""The control over what people communicate is lost and we have to adapt to this new state of things,"" he said via e-mail. ""To monitor all communications, fight all new digital technologies and spread a culture of fear in what should be a free and open communication network is not a desirable option."" Entertainment companies claim The Pirate Bay has hurt their box office profits, part of an annual loss the Motion Picture Association of America claims to be about $6 billion a year worldwide. ""Hollywood studios are businesses. They're there to make money,"" said association lawyer Thomas Dillon. ""It costs $100 million to make a feature film, so of course they're quite keen to get some back. So I don't accept this argument that there's some benefit to culture in allowing people to make copies of commercial films and getting them for free."" Monique Wadsted, a Swedish lawyer for the MPAA, said The Pirate Bay was also harming individual artists. A victory for the entertainment companies ""will, of course, be for all authors all around the world, some kind of redress... because what is going on now is actually a plundering of the author's works,"" she said via e-mail. ""If some authors find it good to market their products using file-sharing or whatever, they are free to do that,"" she added. ""But that is not what is happening at the moment. What's happening at the moment is that authors' and rights holders' works are file-shared against their will and that is not acceptable."" She argued that The Pirate Bay ""is specifically tailored for copyright infringement."" The prosecution claims the site provides a search engine that helps people find and download copyrighted material including movies, music and games -- in effect, enabling copyright theft. The site's supporters say they're doing nothing wrong under Swedish law because the site doesn't actually put the copyrighted material on the Web site. Internet piracy and illegal downloading from peer-to-peer systems are some of the biggest piracy problems in Europe, the MPAA argues. Internet piracy is growing at a faster rate in Europe than anywhere else in the world, the MPAA says, because of increased broadband use, weak laws, and lenient public perceptions. Sweden's official efforts to battle online piracy have been weak, the MPAA says. Eriksson, the co-founder of the group that led to The Pirate Bay, says the MPAA's argument that file-sharing hurts movie studio revenues is ""nonsense."" ""Cinema is doing better than ever,"" he said by e-mail. ""They only claim this because they calculate losses by looking at the number of downloads and imagining that all of them would have been a purchase if they hadn't been downloaded first."" Eriksson said what was at stake in the Swedish courtroom was the future of the Internet itself. ""The Internet revolution meant that we created a global network where any digital entity could connect and exchange information with any other,"" he said. ""Anti-piracy efforts must be seen in the light of a counter-revolution against this that goes all the way to the very infrastructure of the net."" He suggested that even if The Pirate Bay is convicted of facilitating making works public through its indexing service, which he does not expect, Internet piracy will not stop. ""The prosecution can't understand that The Pirate Bay is just one stratification of a social and technological change that is decentralized,"" he said. ""Piracy does not have a head that you can cut off, and The Pirate Bay is just a technology allowing communication, a part of the Internet infrastructure.""

"San Diego (CNN) -- This Christmas, enjoy the turkey and roast beef. But do yourself a favor, and skip the duck. This whole controversy over A&E's hit show ""Duck Dynasty"" is whacked. Better make that ""quacked."" First, the network puts Phil Robertson, the family patriarch, on indefinite suspension for making insensitive remarks in a magazine interview. Then, the rest of the family rallies around their leader and suggests that the hit show will not go on without him. As you probably know unless you've spent the last couple of weeks crouching in a duck blind, Robertson -- in paraphrasing a Bible verse -- appeared to liken homosexuality to bestiality and used crude language to describe his own sexual preference. In speaking to GQ magazine, he also seemed to minimize the discrimination that African-Americans suffered in the South before the civil rights movement. Criticism of Robertson poured in, but so did support for one's right to express oneself. The patriarch responded: ""I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different than me."" In fact, Robertson claims he and his family are the ones who have been treated disrespectfully -- by the producers of the show, and the entertainment industry in general. In an interview two months ago with the Christian Post, Robertson said that television editors in Los Angeles ""with no moral compass"" have routinely manipulated the show's footage to intensify the language and make the family appear more profane and unruly than they really are. ""They inserted fake beeps like somebody had used profanity, but no one had used profanity. If you want that, you can get all of that you want,"" Robertson continued. ""Just turn the station. There's plenty of that! And if we're not using profanity, why make it look like we're using profanity? What is the point? Why don't you just run it and say what we say?"" Eventually, he said, producers gave in and ""quit doing that."" According to Robertson, the editors also took out the phrase ""in Jesus' name"" when the family prayed. It makes you wonder exactly how much reality is behind some of these reality shows. And now, it looks like the whole spectacle of Robertson being taken to the woodshed by the network could be part of the show. According to Entertainment Weekly, A&E will -- starting January 15 -- air new episodes of the show that will include scenes featuring Robertson. These new episodes were already in the can. Still, if A&E is sincere in its outrage over what Robertson said, then it should stop trying to profit from the show he helped make successful. Michael Feeney, senior vice president of corporate communications for A&E, told me that since filming isn't set to resume until the spring, the network has not yet had to make a decision on Robertson's role. He said he couldn't comment on the Christian Post interview. Despite the fact that an average of 14.6 million Americans tune in each week to track the adventures of the Robertson family when you count DVR recordings, I've never understood the appeal. For me, the question isn't why Phil Robertson was suspended. The real mystery is why he and his family -- who run a successful business making supplies for duck hunters -- have a television show in the first place. I have a theory. Here is what you need to keep in mind as you waddle through this controversy: The reason that ""Duck Dynasty"" is on television is to make liberal studio executives at A&E, and parent company Disney feel superior, while making big profits for the studio. The Robertsons are on television so that people in New York and Los Angeles -- the kind of folks who refer to anyplace in between as ""flyover country"" -- can feel progressive and enlightened by comparing themselves to simple country folks in Louisiana who, according to the elites, are neither. (And can make lots of money doing so.) ""Duck Dynasty' is this era's ode to ""Amos 'n' Andy."" In that show -- which aired on radio and television from the 1920s through the 1960s and which was created, written and produced by white people -- Americans were given the opportunity to laugh at African-Americans, adding insult to the injury that this group of citizens was already sustaining before the civil rights movement. Now, Americans have a new group to laugh at -- a self-described ""bunch of rednecks from Louisiana."" Here's the irony. This show is successful at least in part because the characters say things that many Americans consider colorful and crude. It makes them interesting. That's the schtick of the Robertson clan. Now Phil Robertson is in hot water for staying in character and saying something colorful and crude. That is, Robertson was suspended for doing in print what he has, for the last four years, been paid to do on television. That's awfully hypocritical of A&E. The network is embarrassed and would surely like to distance itself from the Robertson family. However, it seems, it would like to stay acquainted with the millions of dollars the show generates each year. The network should be embarrassed. Not by what Robertson said; it couldn't control that. It should be embarrassed about what it could control: the way it responded and the mess it made of this situation. In discussing this story, commentators have been talking a lot about rights. Robertson had the right to express his opinion. The network that has chosen to co-mingle its brand with the Robertson brand had the right to suspend him. Viewers who support the family have the right to boycott the network. But with rights come responsibilities, and -- as far as A&E executives are concerned -- they include the responsibility to avoid the hypocrisy of continuing to profit from a persona they created that they now claim to find offensive. Now if you'll excuse me, I think the ""Duck Dynasty"" holiday marathon is well under way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Phil Robertson's role in future ""Duck Dynasty"" shows unclear .

"(CNN) -- A potential terror plot may have involved synchronized attacks in several countries with ""at least a dozen"" people taking part, a law enforcement official said Wednesday. Earlier, a German counterterrorism source said that a man captured in Afghanistan had tipped off investigators to a potential ""Mumbai-style"" plot in Europe. Mumbai, the financial hub of India, was the site of a three-day terror attack two years ago that left more than 160 people dead. Ten men launched the carefully planned assault, targeting prominent sites such as the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel, the Oberoi-Trident hotels, the historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center. The intelligence gathered so far, the law enforcement official said, indicated that sites in the United Kingdom, France and Germany as well as Italy and Belgium may have been targets in the potential plot. Investigators believe al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden signed off on a European attack plan, a separate law enforcement source said. But U.S. and international officials say they have seen no sign of an imminent attack. U.S. officials said the alleged plot has no U.S. component -- at least none that has been found. One official stressed that the plot is serious and credible but that the intelligence available lacked specificity: no who, where or how. Some names of ""known operational planners"" are possibly connected with the plot, but there is ""no precise insight"" into who may be planning an attack, the official said. Soft targets such as hotels and economic targets are of particular concern, but there is ""no precise"" intelligence on the mode of attack, said the official. Another official said there are different threads coming from different places, and it's not clear how or even if they will come together. The European countries involved -- primarily Germany, France and Britain -- are tackling the perceived threats as they see fit, the official said. The ""threat has certainly caught our attention"" and that of our allies, the official said. Although no ""U.S. dimension"" to the plot has been uncovered, the official said, the ""U.S. is only a seven-hour plane ride away"" from Europe. The potential plot is one reason for a dramatic increase in the number of missile strikes by unmanned drones against terrorist targets in Pakistan, according to a U.S. official. The number of suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan jumped to 20 this month -- more than in any previous month and twice the monthly average, according to a CNN estimate based on information from Pakistani officials. A federal law enforcement official in the United States, meanwhile, said ""the volume seems to be turned up"" on the threat information coming out of Europe. The intelligence indicates there is interest in using people with Western passports in an attack, that official said. The official said the potential operatives may be a mix of Europeans and others, possibly including North Africans, Pakistanis, Turks, Uzbeks and Tajiks. There is concern about an ""active shooter"" scenario that would create as many casualties and as much chaos as possible in a short period of time. The Mumbai attacks showed how effective this kind of an attack can be in drawing attention. Eiffel Tower evacuated after bomb threat . Economic institutions in Europe, including banks and stock exchanges, could be possible targets, according to the federal law enforcement source. The man who described a potential attack, Ahmed Sidiqi, was detained in Kabul, Afghanistan, in July and transferred to U.S. custody, the German official said. Sidiqi, a German of Afghan descent, attended the same Hamburg mosque as Mohammad Atta -- a leader of the September 11 attacks on the United States -- and was part of Atta's circle, the official said. The man in custody has ""revealed details about the terror plot,"" said the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media. Germany's Interior Ministry said Wednesday that authorities are aware of recent published reports about planned terror attacks in Europe and are analyzing the intelligence information. ""Presently this has produced no concrete indications of directly imminent attacks in Germany. The current accounts do not lead to a change in [our] assessment of danger,"" the ministry said. Janet Napolitano, the U.S. secretary of homeland security, declined to say Wednesday whether there was concrete information about a plan to attack the United States. ""There are constantly threats of all types that we need to be able to be proactive against, and be proactive even when there aren't specific threats,"" she told CNN's ""American Morning."" Sidiqi, the man who was captured, traveled with several other Germans from Hamburg, Germany, to the Afghan-Pakistan border area in 2009, where he joined the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an extremist group allied with al Qaeda, German intelligence officials said. One he was captured, Sidiqi ""started to talk a lot"" and detailed a ""Mumbai-style"" attack in Europe, the German official said. Sidiqi is from Hamburg, where he worked for a cleaning company at the Hamburg international airport, the German official said. He attended the Masjid Taiba mosque, formerly known as the Al-Quds mosque, in Hamburg, which became known as the meeting place of those behind the September 11 attacks. Hamburg shut down the mosque this year, not long after Sidiqi's capture. U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper would not talk about a plot Tuesday evening. ""We are not going to comment on specific intelligence, as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical to protecting the U.S. and our allies,"" he said. ""As we have repeatedly said, we know al Qaeda wants to attack Europe and the United States."" The German government is increasingly concerned about the number of Germans becoming jihadists. According to a senior German counterterrorism source, about 200 individuals have traveled to train with jihadist groups in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region since the September 11 attacks. The potential plot against Europe is apparently one reason for the increase in attacks by unmanned aerial drones in Pakistan. ""We would be remiss not to try to take action to thwart what might be underway in Europe,"" the official said, though the official emphasized it was not the sole factor. U.S. officials say they are taking advantage of what they call ""precise intelligence."" Most of the drone attacks this year have been focused on North Waziristan, a mountainous area bordering Afghanistan where Pakistani security forces have little control. That has continued to be the pattern this month. Napolitano declined to comment on the increase in drone attacks. But acknowledging the spike, one U.S. official said: ""Our operational tempo has been up for a while now, we have good information driving it, and given the stakes involved, we hope to keep the pressure on as long as we can."" According to the official, the mix of threats remains the same. It comes from groups like the Haqqani network, al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistan Taliban. The threats they pose are ""all deadly,"" said the official. Pakistani officials say many recent strikes have been aimed at compounds in or around the town of Miramshah, a stronghold of the Haqqani network. Western intelligence officials have long regarded the Haqqanis as one of the most dangerous terror groups and have linked them to several attacks in Kabul. Intelligence analysts point to other reasons for the escalated drone attacks. Those include better information from sources in the border area and better surveillance technology, including the growing use of spy balloons fitted with high-powered cameras. In addition, the rising number of drone strikes is designed to deprive the Afghan Taliban of ""strategic depth,"" as the Obama administration's campaign to defeat the insurgency enters a crucial phase, and to tighten the noose on the senior al Qaeda leadership. Pakistani officials say one strike last weekend killed Sheikh Mohammad Fateh al Masri, described as the group's senior operational commander.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Texas lawmakers returned for a second special session on Monday to reconsider anti-abortion legislation derailed initially by a one-woman filibuster and a raucous crowd at the state Capitol that drowned out a final effort to push it through. In calling the Legislature back into session, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, described last week's events in the state Capitol as ""unprecedented anarchy"" and said ""mob rule"" would not be tolerated this time around. State Sen. Wendy Davis, a Democrat who led last week's dramatic political charge and became a newly minted heroine of abortion rights in the process, energized a rally in Austin before the Legislature reconvened. Wendy Davis: From teen mom to Harvard Law to famous filibuster . ""Together we can do what they won't. We can stand. We can stand up together. We can stand up for what's right. We can stand up for Texas,"" Davis said to cheers. ""Texans need someone who will stand up for their values."" Davis talked for more than 10 hours last Tuesday in helping to run out out the clock on the legislation that would be one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the country, if approved. The last ditch attempt by Senate Republicans to pass it before a midnight deadline was thwarted by spectators in the Captiol chanting ""shame! shame! shame!"" Perry said on Monday that dramatic tactics would not work this time. ""We will not allow the breakdown of decorum and decency to prevent us from doing what the people of this state hired us to do,"" Perry said in a statement. In a series of radio interviews, Perry also said the lieutenant governor and the speaker are not going to allow ""turmoil"" and ""mob rule"" in their chambers. Republicans confident of passage . Republicans are confident the legislation will pass this time, considering they have a month to consider it. But Davis told CNN that she and Democratic allies had ""a few tricks up their sleeves."" She declined to offer details, but noted that it would be challenged immediately in court if it passes. Davis' pink sneakers: When fashion statements become social symbols . The bill would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and would tighten regulations on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them. Critics said the measure would have shut most of the abortion clinics in Texas. In a series of radio interviews on Monday, Perry said the lieutenant governor and the speaker are not going to allow ""turmoil"" and ""mob rule"" in their chambers. The shouting, which Perry described as ""unprecedented anarchy"" marked an unprecedented moment in the Capitol, but the governor insisted it won't derail the bill. ""Regardless of whether there is a vocal opposition ...Texans and their views will prevail,"" he said. Bitter debate . The virtual debate over the legislation has been less than civic at times, with supporters coalescing around the Twitter hashtag #stand4life and opponents using #standwithwendy, in honor of Davis, as their rallying point. ""WE ALL know all abortions are NOT for mother's health, but simply bc they don't want a baby then. Farce to protect baby murder. #Stand4Life,"" said a post from Rhonda Nelson. A tweet from Boise Blue Convert said, ""Fight the American Taliban, #standwithwendy."" Perry and Davis have continued to spar. Perry claimed Davis ignored her own past as the daughter of a single mother in her bid to prevent abortion rights from being restricted in the Lone Star state. ""I'm all about honest, open debate,"" Perry said at a national ""Right to Life"" convention in Dallas last week. ""Parliamentary tactics are certainly nothing new. But what we witnessed Tuesday was nothing more than the hijacking of the Democratic process. And this is simply too important a cause to allow the unruly actions of a few to stand in its way."" Perry argued Thursday that biography should instead have provided Davis guidance in her personal views on abortion. ""The fact is, who are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances can't grow to live successful lives?"" Perry said. ""In fact, even the woman who filibustered in the Senate the other day was born into difficult circumstances. She was the daughter of a single woman. She was a teenage mother herself. She managed eventually to graduate from Harvard Law School and serve in the Texas Senate. It's just unfortunate that she hasn't learned from her own example, that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential and that every life matters."" Texas parents agree not to pressure teen to have abortion . On Monday, Davis pointed to her daughter, now 30, and said she doesn't ""regret for one moment"" the decisions she's made in life. ""We're fighting for a Texas where every woman is able to overcome her unique challenges because she had the same choices and same chances I had,"" Davis said, adding Republicans in the state were ""bullying women who need help with their healthcare."" The state senator told NBC News she hasn't ""ruled out"" the idea of running for governor next year but is focused on preventing the abortion bill from passing in the special session. In her slew of recent media interviews, Davis has argued that Perry is simply trying to boost his political aspirations by being a big voice in the abortion battle. Asked about Davis on Monday, Perry, who hasn't announced whether he'll run in 2014, told KFYO the issue is about a debate over life and women's health, not ""someone's political future.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- It's been described as the closest thing to being buried alive -- complete paralysis of the body, except for controlled movement of the eyes. Erik Ramsey shortly before a car crash left him ""locked-in,"" able to think and reason but paralyzed except for his eyes . That's how 24-year-old Erik Ramsey has spent the last eight years of his life. He suffered a brain stem stroke after a car accident when he was 16, leaving him with ""locked-in"" syndrome. This condition is not the same as other forms of paralysis where you feel nothing in the affected areas. Ramsey has 100 percent sensation all over his body. An itch can become excruciating with no way to communicate that he needs it scratched. He has frequent muscle spasms as well, which can be painful. ""Even sweat rolling down his skin or something, there's nothing he can do about it,"" said Eddie Ramsey, 57, Erik's father. ""So he feels everything in the environment, but there is really just nothing he could do about it."" Doctors told the Ramseys that their son has no chance of getting better. ""There's always hope, but a large portion of it is in the category of miracles,"" said Eddie Ramsey. But new research may give Erik Ramsey the miracle he has been waiting for. Dr. Phil Kennedy, chief scientist at Neural Signals Inc., a company he founded to conduct research on the brain and communication. He came up with a revolutionary idea that he believed could turn Ramsey's thoughts into speech. He invented an electrode that detects the neural signals in the speech motor area of Ramsey's brain. In December 2004, the electrode was implanted, and Kennedy, along with four independent labs, began decoding the signals in Ramsey's brain. The researchers asked him to think of specific vowel sounds, then mapped his brain activity. By knowing what his brain looked like when he thought each specific sound, scientists could translate the activity into a language that a voice synthesizer could read. Dr. Frank Guenther, associate professor of cognitive and neural systems at Boston University, said his lab, one of three others pursuing neural signal translation, had a breakthrough recently: They were able to hear the sounds Ramsey was trying to say using the decoder they built. ""That was a very exciting moment, where we knew this process of taking neural signals and driving a synthesizer was going to work,"" Guenther said. In the next two months, researchers will hook up the synthesizer. Ramsey will produce his first vowel sounds then. The next phase is getting him to produce consonants, which are much harder to synthesize. Conversations, they say, are still about two years away. For Ramsey, this will mean expressing himself beyond just one word answers. The only way he can indicate what he wants is by moving his eyes up for ""yes"" and down for ""no."" But even this method only goes so far. He gets so tired that he can answer only about six questions before he has to stop. Former Elle magazine editor Jean-Dominque Bauby suffered from the same syndrome and was also able to communicate using only one eye. He wrote about the horror of having locked-in syndrome in his book ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" which was made into a film released November 30. Bauby's writing was an exceedingly slow process. He dictated the book by blinking his left eye when the correct letter was presented to him. He described his mind as a butterfly flying freely inside a diving bell -- a chamber that is placed underwater, trapping the air inside. His descriptions of life as a man who is paralyzed and mute gave Eddie Ramsey the first detailed account of what it must be for his son to live with locked-in syndrome. ""He had to blink that book with one eye,"" Eddie Ramsey said tearfully. ""Had he never done that, no one would ever understand what locked-in means."" Asked if ever wanted to end his life, Erik Ramsey looked up, his way of saying yes. Asked if he still felt that way, he looked up again. But he hasn't lost all hope. Asked if he believes Kennedy's research will allow him to communicate again, he answered ""yes."" Eddie Ramsey thinks so too. ""Dr. Kennedy said he believes Erik will be able to speak again either through a voice synthesizer or through some other means. I believe him and I agree with him,"" he said. It may do the same for tens of thousands of people living with Lou Gehrig's disease, muscular dystrophy or even Alzheimer's who have lost their ability to speak.

"(CNN) -- The organizers of the 2016 Olympics in Rio selected a U.S-based company Wednesday to design the golf course where the leading players in the world will battle for gold in four years time. Hanse Golf Course Design beat off seven other challengers, including golf legends Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Greg Norman, to land the honor as the sport returns to the Olympic program for the first time in 112 years. The golf course will be built at Reserva de Marapendi in Barra da Tijuca, the district that will contain the largest number of Olympic venues. It is about five kilometres from the Athletes' Village. The Olympic golf competition will see medals awarded for men and women and the sport will also feature in the Paralympic Games in Rio. After the Games, the course will become a public facility to promote golf in Brazil. Gil Hanse, 48, is the president of the company he founded in 1993 and has its headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Blog: Why golf must get it right for 2016 Olympics . He will team up with LPGA star Amy Alcott, a five-time major winner, on the project and has also promised to relocate to the Brazilian city while the course is under construction. ""As it marks the return of golf to the Olympic Games after over a century of absence, this course represents the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the sport,"" said Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the president of the Rio organizing committee. ""It will enable Rio to host important events in the international calendar and it will be an example of sustainability and preservation of an environmentally protected area,"" he added. Hanse was named ""Architect of the Year"" by Golf Magazine in 2009 and has been associated with a number of leading golf courses in the world, including Castle Stuart in Scotland. Hanse has also been commissioned by American tycoon Donald Trump to re-work the famous 'Blue Monster' course at Doral, the venue for this week's WGC-Cadillac Championships. Trump purchased the resort out of bankruptcy for $150 million last week. The design company of Martin Hawtree, the architect for Trump's much-vaunted championship course at Menie in northern Scotland, was also among the disappointed bidders.","Golf legends ignored in choice for designer of 2016 Olympic golf course in Rio .

"(EW.com) -- Perhaps the greatest enemy of Chris Brown's poorly received last album was time. Released in December 2009, just six months after the multiplatinum crooner pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna, ""Graffiti"" -- frankly, not a bad collection at all -- was widely panned. Everything from the title of his new disc, ""F.A.M.E."" (an acronym for the off-putting title ''Forgiving All My Enemies''), to his recent nude photos and ill-advised tweets suggests that Brown has not yet mastered the art of image rehabilitation. Musically, though, he's in top form. ""F.A.M.E."" (out March 22) shines brighter than anything he produced before that now-infamous incident. Melodic raps on tracks like ''Say It With Me'' and ''Oh My Love'' lead to intoxicating hooks, as do bedroom knockers ''Wet the Bed'' and ''No Bs,'' which for better (or worse) rival the bump-'n'-grind heights of '90s Casanova crew Jodeci. The uncertainty of love is a recurring theme on the album: On the thumping midtempo cut ''Next to You,'' Brown and guest Justin Bieber trade verses assuring their ladies of their dedication. The more relevant question is whether Brown can count on his old fans to be just as devoted. The fact that several singles have already crept into Billboard's top 20 is a good indication that he's winning them back. ""Graffiti"" clearly came too soon. And some still think Brown should go -- and stay -- away. But on its own merits, ""F.A.M.E."" deserves to be heard. B+ . See full article at EW.com.

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- In the midst of a bloody and protracted civil war, the Syrian government is set to hold a presidential election Tuesday. The outcome is hardly in doubt: President Bashar al-Assad is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many Western countries say will be rigged from the start. Syria isn't renowned for holding free and fair elections. When he came to power 14 years ago, al-Assad ran unopposed, securing more than 99% of votes, according to state media. Seven years later, he won again with a similarly mountainous share of the vote. His father, Hafez al-Assad, ruled Syria with an iron fist for 29 years before he died in 2000. Some analysts say the purpose of this week's vote, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged the Syrian government not to hold, is to send a message to al-Assad's opponents, both in Syria and abroad. Syria's presidential election: How fair can a vote be in a war zone? 'A coronation' ""It's a coronation of Assad, it's a celebration of his ability to survive the violent storm and basically go on the offensive,"" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. The election is being held against the backdrop of a grinding three-year conflict that has killed around 150,000 people, displaced about 6.5 million people within Syria and prompted almost 3 million people to flee outside its borders. Voting will only take place in areas controlled by the regime. Rebels hold significant areas of the north and east of the country. The British Foreign Office has said the vote ""will be a grotesque parody of democracy."" The U.S. State Department says the Assad regime has taken steps ""to make it difficult if not impossible to have a fair and free election in Syria."" Little known challengers . One aspect of this year's election distinguishes it from the previous foregone conclusions, though: al-Assad actually has people running against him -- although it's questionable how much of a challenge they present. The two other candidates are relative unknowns: Hassan al-Nouri, a businessman and former government minister; and Maher Hajjar, a lawmaker. Critics say they are just pawns or window dressing to give the election a veneer of democracy. But the Syrian government has dismissed any criticism of the process. Hajjar has kept a low profile, but al-Nouri says he's serious about challenging al-Assad and is ""trying to attack his weaknesses."" He claimed he would be ""more aggressive and more effective"" than al-Assad on economic, administrative and social issues. But on the overarching question of the war, al-Nouri offers no dissent. ""Politically, I think he's doing what he has to do,"" he said. Rebels divided . What al-Assad is doing is continuing the brutal offensive against those opposed to his regime, raining down barrel bombs on rebel-controlled parts of cities such as Aleppo and Daraa. The opposition groups fighting against him are divided, with squabbling between factions and jihadis who have flocked from around the world to try to establish an Islamic state. The rebels have lost ground around Damascus and Homs, and are under pressure in Aleppo and the south of the country. Talks earlier this year mediated by the United Nations did little to change the situation, ending with the regime and the opposition firmly opposed. Ban's office has warned that the elections are likely to worsen the situation, saying they ""will damage the political process and hamper the prospects for political solution that the country so urgently needs."" CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","President Bashar al-Assad is expected to win Tuesday's presidential vote .

"Washington (CNN) -- In one ill-fated fundraiser, Mitt Romney managed to offend Palestinians, Latinos and some of the same people he's counting on for support if he wants to unseat President Barack Obama. It isn't the first time Romney's oratory fumbles have put his campaign on its heels, handed opponents material to push the stereotype of him as an out-of-touch businessman and provoked members of the party's conservative base to question his worthiness as their standard-bearer. ""Everybody has the same reaction: 'dumb, dumb, dumb,'"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, adding that Romney's gaffes reinforce a sitcom-like caricature of the candidate. Opinion: What's wrong with Romney . After the tape, recorded during a May 17 private fundraiser at the home of Sun Capital executive Marc Leder, made the rounds on Monday, Romney convened a hastily scheduled news conference Monday night in which he said his comments were ""off the cuff"" and ""not elegantly stated."" However, he defended the main message of his remarks, saying he that while he could have made them ""more clearly,"" he said he was trying to point out the differences between his and Obama's campaigns. Democratic pundits gloated and were content to let Romney's words speak for themselves. ""I mean, I don't think Democrats had much to say at all. I mean, there wasn't much left to say,"" Democratic strategist Richard Socarides said on CNN's ""Early Start."" ""Look, I mean, I think that, you know, big picture, this is a -- was a devastating moment for Governor Romney, potentially fatal, as people start to focus on this campaign."" Narratives at work . Another Democratic strategist said that Romney's comments played into the two narratives that they have pushed: ""First, that he doesn't care about the middle class. Well, thanks for the help, Mitt,"" Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and a senior adviser in the leading pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, said on CNN's ""AC360."" ""On the second front ... in order to give big tax cuts for the rich, Mitt Romney is going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. Well, when you're claiming to wealthy people that 47 percent of Americans don't pay federal income tax, I think a lot of those people, retirees, working class folks are going to listen to that and think, 'Gee, I guess the Democrats are right. I guess he does want to raise the taxes on the middle class in order to help the rich.'"" Republican strategist Margaret Hoover, who served in the Bush White House, said the comments would wound Romney but it wouldn't be a fatal one. Video threatens Romney campaign . ""You can understand while he tripped over his words, it probably wasn't characterized the best way. I think we can all agree with that,"" she said on ""Early Start."" ""You can understand what he was trying to say. Do we have a systemic problem in this country when you have almost 50 percent of people not paying any federal income taxes? And he's running on a platform that would fundamentally change the tax code so that you lower the base, broaden the base and lower tax rates across the board."" Reaction from other conservatives was mixed. While some some applauded Romney's comments, others saw them as reinforcing why they questioned his legitimacy. CNN contributor and conservative blogger Erick Erickson tweeted: ""Dammit! I'm just now seeing these Romney secret videos. We need that guy on the campaign trail!"" Others, such as New York Times columnist, David Brooks, wrote ""Romney's comment is a country-club fantasy. It's what self-satisfied millionaires say to each other. It reinforces every negative view people have about Romney."" And conservative commentator Bill Kristol, a frequent critic of Romney, called the remarks ""stupid and arrogant."" ""It's worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent who don't pay income taxes are Romney supporters â€” especially of course seniors (who might well ""believe they are entitled to heath care,"" a position Romney agrees with), as well as many lower-income Americans (including men and women serving in the military) who think conservative policies are better for the country even if they're not getting a tax cut under the Romney plan. So Romney seems to have contempt not just for the Democrats who oppose him, but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him,"" Kristol posted on The Weekly Standard on Tuesday. Romney campaign responds . A Romney adviser tried to put the comments in context: . ""What he's saying is there are people out there who don't pay taxes, unfortunately,"" Bay Buchanan, a senior adviser, said on CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Tuesday. ""They're in a position where they're dependent on government, and those individuals are -- those Americans are voting for Barack Obama. They're in his backyard. And so those are people that I'm not going to be able to reach with my 20 percent tax cut or my cuts in spending because they would be concerned. It's not going to impact them getting a 20 percent tax cut. They don't pay taxes."" Romney's comments were recorded by a hidden camera and posted Monday afternoon on the left-leaning news websites Mother Jones and The Huffington Post. Romney argued nearly half of Americans will vote for Obama because they rely on government support. Adding to his argument about entitlement, Romney said his ""job is not to worry about those people."" He also joked about wishing he had Latino heritage and talks about a Chinese factory his former firm purchased. A clip released Tuesday morning showed Romney questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between Israelis and Palestinians, calling a path to a solution in the region ""almost unthinkable to accomplish."" ""I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard,"" Romney is shown saying in a clip that only shows only the candidate speaking and does not include any questions that may have prompted his remarks. ""One is the one which I've had for some time, which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace, and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish."" Opinion: How Romney really feels about the GOP . With two weeks until the first presidential debate and less than two months before the election, the timing couldn't be worse, political experts say. The Romney campaign had banked on its convention last month to make a favorable introduction of Romney to the electorate, a large part of it just beginning to pay attention to the election. But a CNN/ORC International poll conducted after the convention showed Romney gained only a 1% rise in the polls while Obama gained three to four times that much following the Democrats' convention. Romney's acceptance speech was largely overshadowed by a rambling, off-the-cuff monologue by actor Clint Eastwood, which preceded it. Last week, Romney was criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for an aggressive and politically charged response to violent attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya. After the attacks, Romney in a statement said, ""It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks."" Series of gaffes . Over the weekend, Politico posted a story that detailed tensions within Romney's campaign and on Monday the campaign launched a new effort to inject energy and fresh policy details with a series of speeches and advertising. ""There's been a bit of bad luck involved in some of it,"" said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. ""It's not a surprise that these blunt remarks are going to be made in front of this type of audience. Here's a guy who's trying to work on his image about caring and this doesn't help him at all."" Romney has been plagued by a series of gaffes during his presidential run. He joked with unemployed workers in Florida in June 2011 that he, too, was also unemployed. In January of this year, he told a crowd of supporters that he likes ""being able to fire people"" in a talk about insurance companies. He went on to say that if someone didn't provide adequate services, he liked to be able to find someone else who would. But critics took the first part of the quote used it to paint him as a venture capitalist focused only on a company's bottom line. Controversial video shows candid Romney . In a February interview, Romney told CNN that he is ""not concerned about the very poor,"" citing the safety net in place by the American government and said that his primary focus is the middle class. But it was the first part of the sentence that critics pounced on as evidence of Romney's elitism, while conservatives said the safety net he talked about only encouraged a welfare state. Later that month, at a campaign stop at the Daytona 500 NASCAR race, Romney told a reporter that while he might not follow the sport as closely as the most ardent fans, ""I have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners."" And at an event in Detroit, he tried to prove he was behind the American automotive industry by saying that he drove a Ford Mustang and a Chevrolet pickup and that his wife, Ann, ""drives a couple of Cadillacs.""
