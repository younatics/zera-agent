"(CNN) -- Barcelona's money problems are worse than expected, according to the Spanish champions' financial vice-president Javier Faus. A new audit by accounting firm Deloitte revealed that the Catalan giants actually made a loss of €77.1 million ($100 million) for the 2009-10 season, Faus said in a statement on the Barca website on Tuesday. The previous board had announced the club was €11 million ($14 million) in profit up to the end of last month, when president Joan Laporta stood down to be replaced by Sandro Rosell. ""The accounts submitted on June 30 do not reflect the true picture of the club,"" Faus said. Deloitte's audit showed that income had been overstated by $47 million and expenses understated by $61 million. With an $89 million operating loss, Deloitte also found $14 million in further financial expenses to be countered by $3.9 million after-tax profits. Net debt has risen to $573 million from $427 million a year ago, while gross debt is now $716 million. Barcelona had to take a loan of $200 million after struggling to pay player wages last month, and -- after signing Spain striker David Villa for $50 million -- sold defender Dymtro Chygrynskiy to Shakhtar Donetsk and let high earner Thierry Henry join New York Red Bulls. ""There is a structural problem. The sporting excellence in the last few years has not been reflected in economic excellence. The new board's goal is to bring economic excellence alongside sporting excellence,"" Faus said. Part of the problems lay in the bankruptcy of broadcaster Mediapro, with Barca claiming the club is owed $49 million by new rights-holder Sogecable. Meanwhile, Spanish rivals Real Madrid have allowed highly-rated young fullback Marcos Alonso to join English club Bolton. The left-back, 19, has agreed a three-year contract, having made only one first-team appearance as a substitute in April after coming through the youth ranks. He follows veteran stars Raul and Guti in departing the Bernabeu this week.","Spanish champions Barcvelona lost $100 million last season according to new audit .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has continued rebuilding his Real Madrid squad, with the Spanish club agreeing to sign Germany World Cup star Mesut Ozil on Tuesday. The 21-year-old is expected to undergo a medical on Wednesday, missing his German team Werder Bremen's Champions League qualifying clash with Italy's Sampdoria that night. He will join fellow Germany midfielder Sami Khedira as one of Real's pre-season signings, though the fee has yet to be disclosed. Spanish sports paper Marca reported that it was worth €15 million ($19 million) to Bremen and more than $30 million to the player spread over six years. ""Mesut Ozil lands at Real Madrid after a standout performance at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa,"" said a statement on Real's website. Time for 'want-away' players to show some respect? ""The midfielder earned a permanent spot on Germany's senior side by the age of 21 after winning the 2009 Under-21 European Championship. His unique touch, unmatched individual technique, excellent ball control and deadly last pass make him one of the brightest up-and-coming stars in European football."" Ozil made a big impact at this year's World Cup in South Africa in a midfield revamped in the absence of injured captain Michael Ballack, helping the 2006 finalists to finish third. Born in Gelsenkirchen of Turkish descent, he made his senior debut for local club Schalke in 2006 before moving to Bremen two years after that. He had been linked with several clubs, including England's Manchester United, with just a year left on his Werder contract. ""When you have such an opportunity like this, then you want to take it. It is any footballer's dream to play for the biggest teams in Europe,"" Ozil said on Saturday after first learning of Madrid's interest. The Real squad is in Belgium for the next leg of their pre-season tour, having already beaten Champions League runners-up Bayern Munich 4-2 following victories over L.A. Galaxy and Club America in the United States. Mourinho has already signed Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho, Argentina winger Angel Di Maria and Racing Santander midfielder Sergio Canales. Meanwhile, English club Manchester City have unveiled Italy striker Mario Balotelli following his long-expected move from Inter Milan, and allowed Wales forward Craig Bellamy to join his hometown club Cardiff on a season-long loan in the second division after failing to make Roberto Mancini's 25-man Premier League squad. The Italian coach said he would also consider letting Shay Given leave if the Republic of Ireland international was unhappy with being made second-choice goalkeeper behind young England player Joe Hart. Mancini said he was close to signing England midfielder James Milner from Aston Villa, with City's Stephen Ireland to move in the other direction. ""I hope we can close it between today and tomorrow. I think Milner is a good player, an English player -- which is important. I think he can play in different positions,"" Mancini told the UK Press Association on Tuesday. Marseille striker Mamadou Niang has completed his move from the French champions to Turkish club Fenerbahce, signing a three-year deal as he joins fellow Senegal international Issiar Dia at the Istanbul side. Marseille's Burkina Faso international Charles Kabore has signed a new two-year contract until June 2015, having recently received dual French nationality, while Ghana World Cup star Andre Ayew has extended his deal until 2014.","Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil poised to join Real Madrid after deal is agreed .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A verbal altercation between four U.S. soldiers in Iraq preceded the fatal shooting of two and wounding of a third, a U.S. military official said Wednesday. Spc. Neftaly Platero is in pre-trial confinement, suspected in the deaths of Spc. John Carrillo Jr. and Pfc. Gebrah P. Noonan, the military said Tuesday. Carrillo, 20, of Stockton, California, and Noonan, 26, of Watertown, Connecticut, died Friday of injuries sustained in a ""non-combat"" incident that occurred a day earlier, the U.S. Department of Defense said. They were assigned to 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, out of Fort Stewart, Georgia. ""The next of kin of the victims were notified that it appears a verbal altercation broke out involving four soldiers, after which the suspect allegedly took his weapon and began shooting the other soldiers,"" a military official said Wednesday. ""The Army is conducting an investigation into the deaths."" Carrillo's mother, Desiree Carrillo, said Tuesday that her son was a good son and a good father to a 3-year-old and a 3-month-old. ""He was a very young father, and he was in school, but he joined the military to provide more for his family,"" she said. Desiree Carrillo said the military notified them of Carrillo's death on Friday after family members learned through the media their son may have been killed by another soldier. Dane Street, Noonan's former track coach, told WFSB that Noonan was loved by nearly everyone. ""His big hair matched his big personality,"" Street said. ""He loved experiencing life, and it was great."" Several people posted rest-in-peace messages on what appears to be Noonan's Facebook page. The page of ""Gebrah Noonan"" also lists ""Neftaly Platero"" -- the same name as the suspect -- as a Facebook friend.

"London, England (CNN) -- The new Italian Serie A season kicks off this weekend -- Fanzone details what to expect from the forthcoming campaign where reigning Italian and European champions Inter Milan will be gunning for their sixth consecutive title: . So what's new?  The cast may have changed but the script is expected to remain the same. Inter Milan may have swapped coach Jose Mourinho for Spain's Rafa Benitez but the club is still expected to win its sixth straight title. Inter's 3-1 win over nearest rivals Roma in the Super Cup only served to underline the club's superiority over its Serie A rivals. The season's curtain raiser is usually played between the Serie A and Italian Cup winners but with Inter winning both, Roma took part simply because they were runners-up in both competitions. The fact that Ranieri's charges were dispatched again meant that Nerazzurri picked up their fourth trophy of 2010. Number five could well be a formality. It's been a relatively quiet close season for the Serie A and European Champions League holders with the $35 million sale of Mario Balotelli to Manchester City being the biggest news. Replacing him, however, is the exciting 18-year-old attacker Brazilian Philippe Coutinho who Inter bought in 2008 and have had parked at Vasco de Gama ever since. If Inter do find themselves short of a striker, Benitez will have to resist casting envious glances at rivals Roma who have secured the signature of old boy Adriano to replace the Genoa bound Luca Toni. Known as ""The Emperor"" during his pomp, the Brazilian scored 48 goals in 123 games for Inter and has been brought in by Claudio Ranieri to play in an attacking trident with Francesco Totti and Mirko Vucinic. In a bid to revive their fortunes, the two other giants of Italian football AC Milan and Juventus have installed new coaches. Il Rossoneri may have been placed third last year but 10 points behind second-placed Roma was nothing to crow about. Leonardo has since been ejected in favor of Massimiliano Allegri. Allegri has won coach of the year for the last two terms -- a magnificent achievement considering he has been at the helm of lowly Cagliari. In a further bid to revive their fortunes, the club are looking to bring in former Inter striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic from Barcelona. Meanwhile, seventh placed Juventus have drafted in Luigi Delneri who is fresh from securing a spot in the Champions League qualifiers with Sampdoria. The Old Lady has also boosted its chances by signing attacking midfielder Alberto Aquilani from Liverpool and Milos Krasic of CSKA Moscow. Of the new boys, Lecce are the only club with any real top-flight experience having bounced between Serie A and B for the last 25 years. Promoted as champions they are expected to stand a better chance of retaining their place among Italy's elite than Cesena and Brescia who achieved promotion by finishing second and via the playoffs respectively. Key players:  There are few players who enjoyed a better time last year than Inter Milan's Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder. The 15 million euro signing from Real Madrid won the Champions League and domestic double with Inter last season and was awarded the silver ball and bronze shoe in South Africa where Holland came runners up at the World Cup finals. As long as fatigue doesn't get the better of him, the 26-year-old should continue to dominate Serie A. Milan's young Brazilian Pato showed flashes of brilliance last season including a brace against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu but a succession of injuries meant it wasn't to be his season. This year the 2009 Serie A Young Footballer of the Year will be looking to improve on last term's 14 goal haul. If the 20-year-old star, nicknamed the Duck, can stay fit, then he and fellow Brazilian Ronaldinho could fire Milan back into contention for the title in 2011. October will mark the anticipated return of one of Serie A's most talented players. Banned for nine months following a failed doping test after a match against Bari in 2009, Adrian Mutu will resume the striking career that has seen him score an impressive 100 goals in 221 matches for Fiorentina. Should the troubled Romanian be able to pick up where he left off then La Viola have every chance of finishing in the top four. Key clubs:  Once again, the title will be Inter's to lose. The strength of their squad and experience of their new boss Benitez will make it extremely difficult for the likes of Roma and Milan -- their only genuine rivals for the championship. Having slipped to seventh place last season, Juventus will be desperate to secure a top four spot and Champions League football again. The likes of Sampdoria, Palermo and Napoli who did so well to secure fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively last term will need to keep hold of their best players during the last days of the transfer window if they stand a chance of repeating their success. Expert's view: Gazzetta dello Sport's Tancredi Palmeri - ""After a clean sweep of trophies in 2010, what can Inter do for an encore? In recent seasons, the Nerazzurri have changed the game of prediction: it was just impossible to see past them retaining their title. Not much has changed either. ""However, there are a couple of shadows over the San Siro. The first is the exit of the Jose the ""Special One"" and the arrival of Rafa Benitez. The Spaniard will hear whispers of ""would Mourinho have done this?""  follow every decision or substitution he makes. ""The second shadow is the possible return of the long-haired Swede, Zlatan Ibrahimovic. At the moment is not known if he will end up at AC Milan -- Inter's bitter, city rivals -- but the forecast for the coming season is clear: without Ibra playing alongside Pato and Ronaldinho, Inter are odds-on to set the new Italian record by winning their sixth title in a row. ""As for the others, Juventus have been building a completely new squad. La Vecchia Signora have imported a sports director and coach from Sampdoria and changed much of their playing staff. ""Cannavaro, Poulsen and Diego have left; Aquilani, Krasic, Quagliarella have moved in. The transfers lack big-name muscle but the Bianconeri are working for the future. This season they will be satisfied with Champions League qualification. ""Roma are still too dependant on Totti's performances. The old Capitano is still good for 15 goals a season, but injuries are hampering his potency. Adriano will also take a long time to settle and find his way through Italian defenses. ""Genoa had an impressive close season, signing Toni, Rafinha and the Portugal goalkeeper Eduardo. They could be the surprise of the season with their entertaining football (the coach Gasperini has been renamed ""Gasperson"" in honor of his shared love of attacking tactics with Alex Ferguson). ""Finally, Napoli and Palermo have exciting line-ups but a shortage of replacements on the bench, and with the rough-and-tumble of the Italian league this weakness will be exposed. ""My final Serie A prediction in order of their final positions: Inter, AC Milan (without Ibra), Juventus and Roma in Champions League. Top scorers: Samuel Eto'o (he should play as pure forward this season) or Giampaolo Pazzini (the Sampdoria number 9 who is due an international call up).""","New Inter boss Benitez under pressure to win clubs fifth straight title.

"(CNN) -- Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee and Korean Kim Do-hoon both carded eight-under-par rounds of 64 to lead the way after the opening 18 holes of the China Open at Jinji Lakes. Asian No.1 Jaidee, who was forced to withdraw from last week's Masters due to an elbow problem, posted a bogey-free round after receiving an injection for his injury prior to leaving Augusta. The 40-year-old told the official European Tour Web site: ""I played very solid after a week off last week. I had a good game plan. ""I was unable to practice on the course before, I only played two holes in the pro-am because the weather was terrible. ""But I hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens and I made a lot of putts.

"(CNN) -- Police in Jackson, Mississippi, have prepared an arrest warrant for former television host Gary Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, police spokesman Colendula Green told CNN. Officers were called to the scene Monday afternoon but when police arrived, only one of the parties involved was there. The victim ""had been stopped at a red light and was rear-ended by a white Jeep, driven by Gary Collins,"" Green said. Collins' lawyer, Tom Royals, said his client had gotten out of his vehicle, examined the accident, and exchanged information with the driver of the other car. After calling the police, Collins left because he had been waiting for some time and he thought he had done all that was required, Royals said. ""The other party knew his information,"" Royals said. ""And in fact Collins knew someone in the car. They talked a while and then he left."" Green agreed that the ex-actor had provided his contact information but said Jackson Police have cited Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, a misdemeanor. Police are waiting to execute the arrest warrant once a judge signs off on it. The other driver is pressing charges, Green said. ""It was not a serious accident,"" Royals said. ""It was really just a minor fender-bender."" Collins is known for being a TV and radio personality, and is married to former Miss America Mary Anne Mobley. As an actor, he is known his role in the television series ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""The Wackiest Ship in the Army.""","Gary Collins is a former television host and actor .

"(CNN) -- Golf's original bad boy John Daly has welcomed Tiger Woods back to the fray for this week's Masters tournament, insisting that the troubled world No. 1 ""didn't kill anybody."" On Monday, Woods gave his first open news conference since the scandal about his marital infidelities broke at the end of last November, fielding questions from the media for 40 minutes. The 43-year-old Daly, who has been married four times and has admitted his own problems with alcohol, gambling and his weight, said he was happy to see his fellow American ready to return to golf. ""He handled it very professionally. I just wish he'd handled it a lot earlier then he wouldn't have had to put up with all the crap he's had to put up with,"" Daly told CNN. ""I wish him all the best. I've always said the toughest major he's got is keeping his family together, but it looks like they're doing it."" Woods confirmed on Monday that his wife Elin would not be attending the tournament, which is the first of the season's four major events. Two-time major winner Daly will not be playing at Augusta after losing his PGA Tour card and slipping down to 641st in the world rankings, but was selling merchandise and signing autographs outside the front gates of Augusta while Woods was holding court inside. ""I was in the 12 Steps [for recovery from addiction], the eighth one is making amends to everyone you've hurt,"" Daly said. ""He didn't have to do it with the media, but God bless him. It's tough what he's done, but the ones he needs to apologize to are the ones he has -- but he didn't have to do it to the media. ""Everyone makes mistakes, I've made them, we're not the only ones who've made them. The true fans are going to come out and watch Tiger, they're used to seeing him win. That's what he's known for, is winning at golf, it's really none of our business what he does off the course. ""The thing is, he didn't kill anybody, he didn't kill himself, there were no arrests or anything. Yeah he did some bad stuff, but that's between him and Elin, so I just wish him the best.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: CNN Student News is ubiquitous! It's an old Word to the Wise meaning we're all over the place: on HLN, online, on iTunes as a free, downloadable podcast. Wherever you are watching us, we thank you for checking out this Tuesday edition of our show. I'm Carl Azuz; this is your news for the classroom! First Up: Nuclear Summit . AZUZ: First up, how do you stop terrorists from getting hold of materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons? Representatives from dozens of countries are trying to answer that very question at a meeting in Washington. The nuclear security summit being hosted by President Obama kicked off yesterday. It got going with some meetings between the president and other world leaders. Some critics have argued that President Obama's position on nuclear weapons makes the U.S. look weak. But the president says this concern -- terrorists ending up with nuclear materials -- is the biggest threat to U.S. security. The goal of this summit is for all of the nations that are participating -- there are 47 of them -- to outline how they will each help control nuclear materials and keep them from being spread around the world. One of those countries, Ukraine, offered an answer for itself yesterday. It said it'll get rid of its stock of enriched uranium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons, in the next two years. Congress Returns . AZUZ: Over on Capitol Hill, Congress is back in session after a two-week spring break. The House starts back to work today. The Senate got going on Monday. One of the first things the Senate wants to look at is a bill that would extend unemployment benefits. You might remember that this bill was supposed to be voted on before the break. That didn't happen because of debate over how the legislation would be paid for. Recession Over? AZUZ: ""It ain't over 'til it's over."" Words that could be applied to the recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research -- that is the only group that can officially announce when a recession begins and ends -- says it's just too early to tell about this one. It doesn't know if it's over yet, or at least, it won't say. Yesterday, the group acknowledged that some economic indicators have started turning in the right direction. Experts point out that the wait-and-see strategy isn't unusual. The NBER hasn't announced the end date of other recent recessions until more than a year after they were over. Fast Facts . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for some Fast Facts. The word ""holocaust"" describes a destruction that involves a massive loss of life. In history, the Holocaust refers to the systematic killings that were carried out by Nazi Germany. It took place during World War II. Six million Jews and millions of other people were killed during the Holocaust. Holocaust Remembrance Day . AZUZ: Those victims on the minds of people all over the world as the start of this week marked Holocaust Remembrance Day. In Hebrew, it's called Yom Hashoah. And in Israel, which is home to more than 200,000 Holocaust survivors, it involves ceremonies and memorials like this one, where people stand up and read the names of family members who were killed by the Nazis. You hear sirens; you see cars stopping on the street, people getting out. It's because of those sirens. Those are announcing a two-minute moment of silence to remember the victims of the holocaust. One American teen is doing that in his own way through this Web site. It's called ""Each Of Us Has a Name,"" and it was started by Zak Kolar, who's 14 years old. The site is a collection of the names of Jewish Holocaust victims. Zak's goal is to remember and honor them not just as a group of six million people, but as individuals. Thailand Protests . AZUZ: In Thailand, the government has canceled any activities planned around the country's New Year's celebration because of ongoing protests. Demonstrators have been facing off with police forces for days. And over the weekend, those clashes turned violent. 21 people were killed, including civilians and members of the military. More than 850 other people were injured. The protesters are called Red Shirts. They want Thailand's prime minister to break up parliament, call for new elections, and leave the country. They support the country's former prime minister, who was removed from power in 2006 and fled from Thailand in 2008 while facing corruption charges. The government declared a state of emergency last week; that allowed security forces to break up large gatherings. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Vigil's class at Euclid Middle School in Littleton, Colorado! What color collar is associated with jobs that involve manual labor? You know what to do! Is it: A) Red, B) Yellow, C) White or D) Blue? You've got three seconds -- GO! Blue-collar jobs often involve manual labor and a type of uniform. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! The New Blue-Collar . AZUZ: Factory workers, construction workers, repairmen: These are all examples of blue-collar jobs. Many of these workers have faced some struggles recently, including being hit hard by the recession. But one South Carolina company is trying to overcome that by combining old and new ideas and changing what it means to be a blue-collar worker. Tony Harris shows us how. (BEGIN VIDEO) TONY HARRIS, CNN NEWSROOM ANCHOR: Snapshots in time of manufacturing's past in the deep South, when cotton was king. The textile industry employed hundreds of thousands of workers over the last century. Today, most of those textile jobs are gone. This is all that's left of that dying industry: empty, decaying factories. Jobs gone overseas where they can be done cheaper. Even jobs that stayed were fewer than before. Automation meant companies could do more with less labor. The recession saw South Carolina's unemployment rate more than double in just two years to 12.6 percent, the highest in two decades. Now, South Carolina is fighting back, turning things around with a different approach to manufacturing. Welcome to the new, high-tech factory operated by Adex Machining Company, owned by a couple of Georgia Tech grads, Sean Witty and Jason Premo. The shop makes parts for the aerospace and energy industries. Employees spend as much time in the office as in the plant. They get their hands dirty, but their brains are stimulated. You might call these guys the new blue-collar worker. They don't just operate machines, they program the machine, telling it where to drill. Then they head to the factory floor and make it happen. RONNIE SADDLER, CNC PROGRAMMER: You get to see the finished work, is what I really love about it. We take what's on paper and we bring it to life. HARRIS: They make mathematical computations on the fly if adjustments are needed. STEVE MARKS, CNC PROGRAMMER: C point 038. HARRIS: Each worker is a computer programmer, machinist and quality control engineer; what typically was three different jobs now wrapped up in one. It's called lean manufacturing, and the workers love it. SEAN WITTY, CO-OWNER, ADEX MACHINING: In the assembly line method, you might just have a single person who does a single task all day long and that's all they do. It's repetitive. It doesn't tax the mind. It's simple work. And really, what you're seeing is that the world has changed. HARRIS: And it pays like a white-collar job does, from $50,000 to as much as $80,000 a year, depending on experience and job training. Unlike in an assembly line factory, the employees say they feel empowered. MARKS: It's hands-on. You get to actually make something, but you still have to think about what you're doing. HARRIS: Sean is hoping to change the negative stereotype of manufacturing in hopes of drawing more young people into the industry and help American industry get back on top again. WITTY: I think a lot of people associate manufacturing with 20 and 30 years ago, when Detroit was big. It was very dirty. It was very long hours. Your boss beat up on you all day. But that's changed. We work with our employees. It's not a boss-man mentality. Very much, we're asking them, what are your ideas? How is the best way to produce this? HARRIS: Tony Harris, CNN, Atlanta.

You'll find them in the Spotlight section, along with videos. We've got articles, online resources. All of it's free; all of it's at CNNStudentNews.com. Check it out. Before We Go . AZUZ: And before we go, your parents might have told you not to play with your food. They didn't say anything about your cups! All right! This is the World Sport Stacking Championships, where everyone pretty much follows the same pattern: You stack it up, flip it, knock it down. More than 700 stacking stars took part in the competition, representing every continent except Antarctica. The competition was fierce. Hundreds of personal bests; two world records. Goodbye . AZUZ: The contest was the perfect example of pure speed cup-led with skill. That's gonna put a lid on today's show. We hope you have an awesome day. Now, we know you're coming back from Spring Break.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A former employee who had recently been fired from Palm Bay Hospital returned there Thursday afternoon carrying a gun, holed himself up in an office, then apparently killed himself, officials said. The incident began about 2:20 p.m., when Palm Bay police got a call from people in the hospital cafeteria who said a man was pointing the gun at anyone who tried to talk to him, said police spokeswoman Yvonne Martinez. ""Initially, when he came into the hospital waving the gun, anybody that attempted to make contact with him or communicate with him he just dismissed and pointed the gun at them,"" she said. ""Clearly, he appeared to be on a mission."" Earlier she had said that, during the police response, ""we were told that shots had been fired,"" but ""nobody was injured."" But she later told reporters that those shots may have been the gunman taking his own life. As police officers and SWAT personnel from Palm Bay and nearby agencies assembled outside the hospital, the hospital was locked down and emergency vehicles were diverted to other hospitals. A few hours later, a robot found the man's body inside an administrative office near the cafeteria's food-preparation area. Martinez said the man had had ""issues"" with the property manager, was distraught and ""had made some threats as to suicide."" Hospital spokesman Elliot Cohen told CNN that the man, who has not been identified publicly, ""was terminated about a month ago for having a poor attendance record"" after having worked at the hospital for about two years. He would not divulge the man's position. Palm Bay Hospital resumed normal operations as soon as the body was discovered, he said. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this story.","NEW: A robot found the body .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has invited congressional leaders from both parties to join him in a meeting to discuss what to do in the waning days of the current Congress, vowing Thursday that it will ""not be just a photo-op."" ""I want us to talk substantively about how to move the American people's agenda forward,"" Obama said. The meeting is set for November 18, Obama said, following elections Tuesday in which his Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives and saw its Senate majority reduced. Current members of Congress keep their jobs until the end of the year in what's known as the ""lame-duck"" session. Obama said he wants the meeting to discuss the future of the Bush-era tax cuts that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Republicans and Democrats disagree about how to extend them. The president calls for extending the lower tax rates for income up to $200,000 a year for individuals or $250,000 a year for families. Income above those levels would be taxed at rates from the 1990s, before the tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003. Most Republicans oppose letting anyone's tax rates go up, including the 2 percent of the population that earns income greater than the thresholds proposed by Obama. ""We have to act in order to assure that middle-class families don't see a big tax spike because of how the Bush tax cuts have been structured,"" Obama said. ""It is very important that we extend those middle-class tax cuts."" The president said businesses also needed ""certainty"" about the future concerning tax rates. Republicans argue that the income levels in Obama's proposal would hit too many small business owners and harm job creation. Potential compromises under discussion would raise the income level for the tax cut extensions to $1 million, or temporarily extend all the tax cuts with time limits for higher income levels. Obama conceded Wednesday that his party had taken a ""shellacking"" from the voters the day before, and the Republican leader in the Senate has signaled that he wants to roll back what Obama's administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress have done instead of working with them to seek compromises on major issues. ""For the past two years, Democrat lawmakers chose to ignore the American people, so on Tuesday the American people chose new lawmakers,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a speech Thursday to the Heritage Foundation. ""The White House has a choice: They can change course, or they can double down on a vision of government that the American people have roundly rejected,"" McConnell said. In response, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday that any consensus reached in talks between Obama the congressional Republicans would not give everyone what they wanted. Gibbs also said he expected the November 18 meeting to be just the start of discussions, saying: ""I anticipate that this is the first of many."" Obama used his brief statement after a Cabinet meeting to highlight his legislative priorities. He urged the upcoming lame-duck Congress to approve an arms control agreement with Russia, saying it is neither a Republican nor a Democratic issue. The Senate must approve international treaties for them to take effect. ""We have negotiated with the Russians significant reductions in our nuclear arms"" in the new START treaty, Obama said. That has given the United States leverage in seeking increased pressure against Iran's controversial nuclear program, Obama argued, because ""people have seen that we are serious about taking our responsibilities when it comes to non-proliferation."" Obama is also planning to meet newly elected governors from both parties, he said. He's invited them to the White House on December 2. The meeting will be a ""terrific opportunity to hear from them ... about what they're seeing, what ideas they think Washington needs to be paying attention to,"" Obama said. ""They've got very practical problems that they've got to solve,"" he said, praising their ""common-sense approach that the American people are looking for right now."" CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: White House spokesman says he expects multiple meetings to occur .

"(CNN) -- American officials have condemned plans by the Ethiopian prime minister to block U.S.-funded Voice of America broadcasts in Amharic, the main local language. Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi accused the media organization of ""engaging in destabilizing propaganda,"" according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Zenawi said Thursday that he would allow efforts to jam the network's broadcasts, according to the press freedom advocacy group. He compared the VOA to a Rwandan radio station accused of stoking the 1994 genocide that killed about 800,000 people. A U.S. State Department spokesman condemned the accusation. ""Comparing a respected and professional news service to a group that called for genocide in Rwanda is a baseless and inflammatory accusation that seeks only to deflect attention away from the core issue,"" spokesman Gordon Duguid said. The Ethiopian government may disagree with VOA news, but interfering with its broadcasts undermines the nation's constitutional commitment to censorship and freedom of expression, he added. ""This right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers,"" Duguid said. VOA said its Amharic language listeners have experienced interference since February. Its other broadcasts in the Horn of Africa nation have not been affected. The U.S. government funds the media service, which broadcasts news and other programming in different languages worldwide. Press freedom advocacy groups have said Ethiopia is trying to limit media coverage leading up to the May elections, an accusation the government denies.","Ethiopia wants to jam VOA broadcasts for service's ""destabilizing propaganda""

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods faces two challengers as he bids to retain the world's No. 1 golf ranking for a 271st week at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational starting in Ohio on Thursday. The 34-year-old has been at the summit for an unprecedented 612 weeks in total, but once again faces the prospect of losing top spot to fellow American Phil Mickelson -- and a new contender, world No. 3 Lee Westwood. While second-ranked Mickelson has failed to take advantage of Woods' struggles in recent weeks, finishing only tied for 48th at the British Open, Westwood has racked up the points after placing second at his home major last month. The Englishman can go to No. 1 if he wins at Firestone and Woods is outside the top two -- or if he is second, the defending champion is 10th or lower and Mickelson does not win. Mickelson can finally surpass Woods if he wins, or if he finishes in the top four and his compatriot is outside the top 37. ""Am I conscious of the pack closing in? Yes, because every tournament you guys remind me,"" Woods told reporters on Wednesday ahead of his bid for an eighth title in the event. ""You play. How I got here was playing golf tournaments and winning golf tournaments."" Woods will partner Westwood for the first two rounds in Akron, knowing that his rival has finished second in two majors this year and was runner-up at Firestone behind Vijay Singh in 2008. ""I've always enjoyed playing with Westy, he's a great guy. We've been going at it for a long time,"" he said of the 37-year-old, who he also played with at the U.S. Open in June. ""What he's done over the last couple of years -- I always knew he had that talent and level of play, now he is showing it. Almost every big event we always seem to get paired together. We're going to have a good time."" Woods has dropped out of the U.S. team's automatic qualification positions for October's Ryder Cup after a run of poor results, tying for 23rd at the British Open at St. Andrews last month as he struggled with his putting. ""It has been off all year. I've three-putted quite a few times, which I don't do normally, so I've had to go back to basics and practice a bit more,"" he said. ""I haven't worked on it as much as I should have the last couple of years, so I've had to go back to that."" Masters champion Mickelson, whose only victory at Firestone came at the World Series of Golf in 1996, will partner young Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy in the first two rounds. U.S..Open champion Graeme McDowell will play with three-time major winner Padraig Harrington, who returned to form with second place at last weekend's Irish Open.","Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood hoping to take Tiger Woods' No. 1 ranking .

"Washington (CNN) -- Noisy protests at military funerals, immigration reform and violent video games were among the issues on the Supreme Court's docket as the high court began its new term Monday. The term also marks the debut of Justice Elena Kagan on the Supreme Court and the first time three women are serving on the nine-justice panel. Roughly 52 appeals are currently on the high court's schedule. About another two dozen are expected to be added in coming months. But Kagan, 50, will recuse herself from at least 24 cases already on the docket. That means she will not sit in oral arguments or vote on the outcomes. As the former Solicitor General in the Justice Department, it was Kagan's job to supervise all pending appeals at the high court, and she has withdrawn from those cases in which she was involved or which might present a conflict of interest. The caseload for the term is usually settled by February. Other controversial appeals that might get added to the high court's docket cover issues related to same-sex marriage, terrorism and health care reform, among other things. Here are some key cases the Supreme Court is scheduled to tackle in its 2010-2011 term: . MILITARY FUNERALS - Snyder v. Phelps (arguments on Wednesday, October 6) AT ISSUE: A balancing test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech/assembly rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. THE CASE: A small Kansas church has gained national attention for protesting loudly at funerals of U.S. service members, promoting their anti-homosexual message. Albert Snyder, the father of a U.S. Marine killed in Iraq sued after members of the Topeka-based Westboro Baptist Church conducted an angry demonstration at his son's burial service. The family of the Marine won a $5 million judgment from the protesters. The ruling, however, was later overturned by a federal appeals court, which said the protest did not directly refer to the lance corporal, and therefore was protected speech on an issue of national debate. THE ARGUMENTS: The church, led by pastor Fred Phelps, believes God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality"" through events including soldiers' deaths. The marchers say they obey local rules over where they can gather to protest. The Snyder family says their son was not gay, and the emotional wounds from the protest have yet to heal. They have the support of a number of members of Congress, 48 states and the District of Columbia. THE IMPACT: The court's ruling could set new guidelines on a broad range of speech-related events, including protests. Several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church can protest. The justices may be asked to address how far states and private entities like cemeteries and churches can go to justify policies meant to silence or restrict demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting. DEATH PENALTY- Skinner v. Switzer (09-9000) (arguments Wednesday, October 13) AT ISSUE: A Texas death row inmate claiming innocence is demanding authorities conduct more thorough DNA testing of evidence gathered at the crime scene. THE CASE: Henry ""Hank"" Skinner, 47, was convicted of the New Year's Eve 1993 killings of his live-in girlfriend and her two adult sons. The justices issued a stay less than 30 minutes before his scheduled March 24 execution. THE ARGUMENTS: In a recent death row interview, Skinner told CNN that if he loses this appeal, an innocent man will be put to death. He claims that new analysis of certain untested DNA samples would clear him and determine the real killer. The state says he is not entitled to testing of evidence that was not analyzed before his 1995 trial. It also claims the wealth of forensic evidence available -- evidence reviewed repeatedly by various state and federal courts -- points to his undeniable guilt. IMPACT: What if an executed prisoner is later found to be innocent? Other inmates have recently pushed ""actual innocence claims,"" prompted by growing use of DNA testing on old evidence. A court ruling could make such claims easier or harder to pursue in the future. VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES - Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants (08-1448) (arguments on Tuesday, November 2) AT ISSUE: A free speech dispute over a California law banning the sale of violent video games to children. THE CASE: A 2005 state law -- designed to strengthen the current industry-controlled rating system -- would have placed an outright ban on the sale or rental of games deemed excessively ""violent"" to those under 18. As defined by California, such interactive games are those in which the player is given the choice of ""killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being"" in offensive ways. Retailers could be fined up to $1,000 for any violation. The law is in limbo pending the high court's ruling. THE ARGUMENTS: Video game makers said the ban goes too far against their free speech rights, and the existing industry-imposed, nationwide voluntary ratings system is an adequate screen for parents to judge the appropriateness of computer games. The state says it has a legal obligation to protect children when the industry has failed to do so. THE IMPACT: The motion picture industry has its own self-monitoring ratings system, imposed decades ago after complaints that some films were too explicit for the general audience in what was seen and heard. A high court ruling allowing greater government control over the evaluation of expressive content could be applied to other media. The Supreme Court in recent years has thwarted repeated congressional attempts to protect children from pornography, saying such legislation went too far in limiting adult access to lawful but explicit sexual content on the internet. The court has also said in various contexts that minors enjoy a variety of free-expression rights. SCHOOLS-RELIGION- Arizona Christian School Tuition Org. v. Winn (09-987); Garriott v. Winn (09-991) (arguments Wednesday, November 3) AT ISSUE: A lawsuit challenging Arizona's tax breaks for donations to private school scholarships. THE CASE: The 13-year-old program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax writeoffs for donations to organizations providing aid covering school tuition. Some Arizona taxpayers have challenged the program as unconstitutional, because religious organizations award most of the scholarships and require children to enroll in religious schools. THE ARGUMENTS: The suit says the program amounts to an unconstitutional state endorsement of religion. But in 2002, the Supreme Court upheld school voucher programs, and supporters of the Arizona measure say it is no different from a Cleveland, Ohio, program permitted eight years ago. In both cases, the government does not direct any money to religious schools. THE IMPACT: Taken separately, disputes over education and religion are among the most contentious issues the high court faces. This case has become a hotly contested political and legal fight. The program's supporters call it ""private charity,"" saying it has been a boon to school choice; contributions have risen to the tens of millions of dollars. Opponents call it a government spending program, and claim that private schools serve as willing state surrogates. IMMIGRATION REFORM - Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting (09-115) (arguments Wednesday, December 8) AT ISSUE: Do federal immigration laws trump state efforts to crack down on businesses that hire illegal aliens? THE CASE: In 2007, Arizona passed the Legal Arizona Workers Act, allowing the state to suspend the licenses of businesses that ""intentionally or knowingly"" violate work-eligibility verification requirements. Companies would be required under that law to use E-Verify, a federal database to check the documentation of current and prospective employees. THE ARGUMENTS: In its lawsuit, the Chamber of Commerce argues federal law prohibits Arizona and other states from making E-Verify use mandatory. The state argues its broad licensing authority gives it the right to monitor businesses within its jurisdiction. The Obama administration recommended review. IMPACT: This case could serve as a bellwether to a larger, more controversial state immigration law from Arizona. That statute was tossed out by a federal judge in August and is currently pending at a federal appeals court. It would, among other things, give police authority to check a person's immigration status if officers have a ""reasonable suspicion"" that individual is in the country illegally. Kagan has withdrawn from the E-Verify case after her earlier involvement in the appeal process while serving as the solicitor general in the Obama administration. Last week, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) proposed legislation that would allow a retired Supreme Court justice to sit on the high court if an existing justice recuses himself or herself from a case. ""Under the proposed bill, the active justices of the Supreme Court would be permitted to vote to designate a retired Supreme Court justice,"" a statement on Leahy's website says. ""The proposed legislation would also allow the Court to preempt potential 4-4 split decisions, in which the decision of a lower court stands."" CNN's Kate Bolduan contributed to this report.","About 52 appeals are on the Supreme Court's schedule for the 2010-2011 term .

"London, England (CNN) -- TV talent show star Susan Boyle will sing for Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Scotland next month, the Catholic Church in Scotland said Wednesday. A church spokesman said in June they were negotiating with the singing phenomenon to perform. Benedict is due to visit England and Scotland from September 16-19. Boyle will perform three times at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow on Thursday, Sept. 16, the Scottish Catholic Media Office said. She will also sing with the 800-strong choir at the open-air Mass there. In the pre-Mass program, Boyle plans to sing the hymn ""How Great Thou Art"" as well as her signature song, ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" the tune from the musical ""Les Miserables"" that shot her to fame in April 2009. ""To be able to sing for the pope is a great honor and something I've always dreamed of -- it's indescribable,"" Boyle, a Catholic, said in a statement. ""I think the 16th of September will stand out in my memory as something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to sing for His Holiness and I can't really put into words my happiness that this wish has come true at last."" Boyle said her late mother was at the same Glasgow park when Pope John Paul II visited in 1982. After the final hymn at the end of the Mass, Boyle will sing a farewell song to the pope as he leaves to go to the airport for his flight to London, the church said. The pope's visit will be the first state visit to the United Kingdom by a pontiff, according to the British Foreign Office. John Paul's trip in 1982 was officially a pastoral visit, while Benedict's is considered a papal visit. Highlights of Benedict's trip include a visit with Queen Elizabeth II at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, a major speech at Parliament in London, and a Mass in Coventry, England, to beatify the 19th-century theologian and educationalist Cardinal John Henry Newman. Boyle wowed audiences and judges on the TV show ""Britain's Got Talent"" last year when she unexpectedly belted out the ""Les Miserables"" classic. The jaw-dropping performance earned her a string of global TV appearances, legions of fans, and a record deal. Though she was runner-up in the show's final, her debut album, ""I Dreamed a Dream,"" was a blockbuster, becoming the most pre-ordered CD in history on Amazon.com.","NEW: Boyle plans to sing her signature tune, ""I Dreamed a Dream""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The Obama administration's planned drawdown of U.S. troops from Iraq is proceeding ""as promised"" and should lead to an end of America's combat mission there by the end of August, President Barack Obama said Monday. Plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops in Iraq to 50,000 by the end of this month are on schedule, Obama told the national convention of Disabled American Veterans. At that point, the U.S. mission will shift to the training and support of Iraqi security forces. A full withdrawal of American troops from Iraq is scheduled to occur by the end of next year. The war in Iraq ""is nearing an end,"" he said. ""As a candidate for president, I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end. And that is exactly what we are doing."" While the U.S. military commitment in Iraq is now nearing a conclusion, the president warned, there is still danger there for U.S. troops on the ground. ""The hard truth is we have not seen the end of American sacrifice in Iraq,"" Obama said. ""But make no mistake, our commitment in Iraq is changing -- from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats."" Obama's update on the conflict in Iraq came in the context of a wide-ranging speech addressing several issues tied to national security and veterans' benefits. Obama defended his decision to increase U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan -- a decision criticized by some of the more liberal members of his own party. He said the military has now gone on the offensive against extremist elements, and took issue with critics who claim the U.S. end game in Afghanistan remains poorly defined. ""We face huge challenges in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""But it's important that the American people know that we are making progress and we're focused on goals that are clear and achievable."" ""If Afghanistan were to be engulfed by an even wider insurgency, al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates would have even more space to plan their next attack."" ""As president of the United States, I refuse to let that happen,"" he said. The Pakistan government has begun to ""take the fight to violent extremists within its borders. Major blows have been struck against al Qaeda and its leadership,"" Obama said. On Iraq, the president provided a largely optimistic assessment of the U.S. effort, saying violence there is currently ""near the lowest it's been in years."" But Iraqi officials released data Saturday that they said shows July was the deadliest month for civilians since May 2008, reporting that 396 civilians, 50 Iraqi soldiers and 89 police officers were killed. Iraqi officials also said 100 so-called ""terrorists"" were killed, and 955 others were detained. The U.S. military has disputed the Iraqi figures, saying the actual numbers are less than half what Iraq's government reported. The U.S. command in Baghdad, Iraq, ""refutes that 535 people were killed in Iraq during the month of July,"" the military said in a statement Sunday. It put the total number of people killed by ""enemy action"" at 222, including 161 civilians, 55 Iraqi troops and six Americans -- the ninth-lowest civilian casualty count since January 2008, according to the U.S. military. The U.S. military has said it believes Iraqi security forces can maintain current levels of relative stability, but that sentiment is not shared by many Iraqis. Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi said in a recent interview with CNN that he is concerned that ""the security is declining ... [and] that's why we need really good resolutions, we need to expedite the formation of a government and we need to create an understanding in the region, and we need the help of the United States to facilitate all of these issues through its good offices in Iraq and elsewhere in the region."" Starting in September, the number of U.S. troops in Iraq -- 50,000 -- will be almost a third of the total number there when Obama took office in January 2009, the White House has said. There will be 96,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan -- more than three times the number there at the beginning of Obama's term. In July, there were 81,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 87,000 in Afghanistan. While there is sharp public division over the U.S. effort in Afghanistan, Americans largely support the removal of U.S. forces from Iraq. Nearly two-thirds of all Americans back the administration's plan to remove most troops by the end of August, according to a May 21-23 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll. Only 36 percent of Americans favor the war in Iraq, the survey indicated. Obama offered praise Monday for all the veterans of major U.S. military conflicts since World War II. ""In the life of our nation, not every generation has been summoned to defend our country in its hour of need. But every generation to answer that call has done so with honor and courage,"" he told the enthusiastic crowd. The president ran through a litany of administration initiatives for military veterans, including ""dramatically increased funding for veterans health care across the board."" Among the initiatives he highlighted: an increased use of electronic record-keeping that will allow veterans, for the first time, to go to the VA's website and download or print personal health records ""so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors outside the VA."" The new measure will take effect this fall, he said. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama claims progress has been made in Afghanistan and Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- Check-in applications for your smartphone are all the rage; even Facebook has gotten into the game with its new ""places"" feature. But not all location-based apps are created equal -- or even with the same goal in mind. Enter CauseWorld, a location-based platform that allows you to turn your shopping into charity. Made possible in part by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers' iFund, which funded 14 business plans out of the thousands it received, the company that created CauseWorld has capitalized on the check-in craze to turn marketing dollars into charitable donations -- donations that reached an impressive milestone. CNN talked with Cyriac Roeding, the co-founder and CEO of Shopkick, which created CauseWorld. The following is a transcript that has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: Describe CauseWorld. ROEDING: It is the first app that lets you do good deeds simply for checking into a store. Every time you check in, you earn what we call Karma Points. These karmas turn into real money contributions to charities. There are 30 different charities on CauseWorld. The 30 charities range from feeding a family in America, behind that is the Feeding America charity; or helping to fight cancer, that's Lance Armstrong's LiveStrong organization; or helping an earthquake victim in Haiti that goes through the Red Cross; all the way to feeding a chimp in Africa, or if you're more on the green side of things, you can plant a tree in a rainforest with American Forest. So there's a whole range of different causes on the application. The simple way to earn these karmas is to check in to stores and restaurants as you go about your shopping day. CNN: How does the check-in process work? ROEDING: So you open the app, and by GPS, it pulls a list of stores that are closest to you, and then you can click on them, tap on them and check in, and you earn like FIVE karmas, 10 karmas. Then you can go to the ""Cause Mall"" and select the cause you are most passionate about, and then your karmas turn into actual money contributions to one of these charities that you selected. And the coolest part is, you don't have to pay for this. The money comes from big brands like Citibank, Procter & Gamble, Kraft Foods and Sears, who have together provided more than a million dollars in marketing money that consumers turn into charity donations. That's kind of the interesting piece from a business perspective. This money would have never gone into charity. This is marketing money; this is not philanthropy money. The reason the big brands provided the money was because they reach consumers in a really passionate moment. If you were the chief marketing officer of a big corporation, would you rather put your money into billboards or into feeding a family in America or helping an earthquake victim and at the same time reaching consumers in really positive special moment when they make that contribution? CNN: How did CauseWorld originate? ROEDING: CauseWorld is the result of us wanting to get into the market of mobile location-based shopping applications. We were trying to figure out the answer to a simple question: Are consumers really interested in doing something besides texting and talking on their cell phones while they are out shopping? We were working on our flagship product [Shopkick] in the background, but what we wanted to do was make sure we put something in front of consumers really quickly and understand what they like to do. And we thought of the notion of CauseWorld as the perfect way to do that. CNN: How did you come up with the idea? ROEDING: We came up with it by saying: How can we give meaning to the check-in? Because honestly, what does the check-in mean today? There are only so many places I want to let my friends know where I am. The question is not what happens at the check-in, but what happens after the check-in? What is the check-in standing for? We're saying: What if you could actually change the world by going shopping? That's CauseWorld. The result was that CauseWorld became the fastest-growing location-based retail application in the entire app store. 550,000 downloads in five months. And 40,000 consumer ratings -- people love this app. We have donated close to a million dollars. (Shortly after the interview Shopkick notified CNN that it had reached the million dollar milestone.) CNN: Who decides where the money goes? ROEDING: You decide it. Big brands provide the money; consumers decide where the money goes. The money can go anywhere. CNN: What do the brands get out of this? ROEDING: The brands get multiple things. First, they reach the consumer in a really passionate moment, because the consumer does something they care deeply about. You're planting a tree, for example, or you're feeding a family -- and then it says on your phone, ""Made possible by Kraft Foods"" or ""Made possible by Citi."" And then you can let your friends know about it, and it goes all the way into the Facebook feed, and the average number of friends on Facebook per person is 130. Now, do the math; that leads to a CPM rate [the cost to show the ad to 1,000 viewers] of less than $6. If you do advertising on a billboard or a magazine you pay $10 to $50 CPM, and you have not fed a family, you have just paid for a billboard. CNN: What are the brands' reactions to this? ROEDING: They like it so much, they have doubled down. Citibank has already put more money into the whole operation. Kraft Foods is excited about it. CNN: What is Shopkick? ROEDING: Shopkick is basically the selfish version of CauseWorld. The points go to yourself, they're called kickbucks, and you can spend them on anything you want. You can donate them to charity if you like, or you can rack them up for yourself. CNN: So what are some of the achievements that CauseWorld has reached? ROEDING: We've provided clean water for 80,000 people for a month in Sudan. 41 million liters of clean water in developing countries for children. Offset 5 million pounds of carbon. 315,000 meals to people in the U.S. Helped plant 88,000 trees. Donated 36,000 books to children. Provided 42,000 pounds of food to hungry chimps. Rescued 190 animals that were victims of animal cruelty. Provided netbooks to a sixth-grade classroom in Chicago, a second-grade class in Southern California and one in Virginia. The American Red Cross has received more than $100,000 for Haiti. So this is actually serious impact. It was just a trial -- we thought we'd just have a few thousand users -- turns out more than half a million in just a few months. It's just amazing really, because the check-in actually means something. As long we get donation money, we will keep donating.","With the CauseWorld app, users check in at stores and get points .

"(CNN) -- Japan Airlines on Tuesday submitted its bankruptcy plans for approval, a proposal that includes slashing roughly one-third of its workforce. The plan includes the loss of roughly 16,000 jobs; a 521.5 billion yen ($ 6.2 billion) debt waiver, mainly from financial institutions; and a 350 billion yen ($ 4.2 billion) investment in the airline by the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. of Japan. The airline submitted the plan to the Japanese government and Tokyo district court for approval. The airline -- one of Japan's largest-ever corporate failures -- proposes cutting 45 money-losing domestic and international routes from the end of September through the end of March 2011. The company also will tackle drastic cost-cutting and retire aging planes. The airline collapsed under a mountain of debt, accumulated by ballooning pensions and unprofitable flights. It has chosen American Airlines as a U.S. partner and is focusing on trans-Pacific routes to boost revenue. After overhauling itself and improving its balance sheet, the airline aims to go public again by the end of 2012. It hopes to return to profitability by the end of fiscal 2010, or March 2011. Under the proposal, all current Japan Airlines shares would be reduced to zero values and new airline shares would be owned by the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp. The airline filed for bankruptcy on January 19 and delisted in February.","Japan Airlines submits its bankruptcy plan .

You can read the text as a class or assign portions of the document to different groups of students and have them briefly summarize each section that they were assigned. Divide the class into groups. Direct each group to find a current news story that is an illustration of some aspect of the U.S. Constitution. For example, a story about a protest demonstrates the First Amendment. A story about upcoming congressional elections is an illustration of Article I. Have groups determine the connections between their chosen stories and the Constitution, and then share their findings with the class. Once all groups have presented their information, point out to students that, although it was created in 1787, the Constitution is more than an historic document: It is the basis of the laws and civil liberties that affect all of us today. Conclude with a discussion about the Constitution in modern times. Ask students: What elements of the Constitution do you think have allowed it to survive the test of time and become the oldest written constitution still in effect?

"(CNN) -- Emilio Massera, a former admiral who was part of a military junta that ruled Argentina in the 1970s, died Monday in the hospital where he had been for some time, the state-run Telam news agency reported. The ex-dictator carried a legacy of being one of the most brutal enforcers during the country's ""Dirty War,"" in which the military government sought to purge leftist factions in the country. At the time of his death he was not convicted of any charges, though previously he had been sentenced to life for human rights violations. That sentence was dropped as part of an amnesty declared in the 1990s. The amnesty was later repealed, but Massera's health had deteriorated to the point that he was found unfit to stand trial. He died of a respiratory failure, said doctors at the Naval Hospital where Massera was being treated said. He was 85. Massera was infamous for running the Navy Mechanics' School, one of the most notorious detention centers during the dictatorship. Known as ""Admiral Zero,"" victims at the mechanics' school were reportedly tortured and killed, and babies were stolen from some victims. Some of the victims reportedly were thrown from planes into the ocean. Massera took part in the overthrow of President Isabel Eva Peron in 1976. Together with Jorge Videla and Orlando Agosti, Massera formed the junta that ruled Argentina.","Emilio Massera was part of the military junta that ruled Argentina .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just five days before the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina's devastating assault on the Gulf coast, millions of dollars are heading to public and private projects for Louisianans still trying to recover, two top Obama administration officials said at a news conference Tuesday. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Janet Napolitano and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate detailed how, courtesy of the federal disaster recovery fund established under the Stafford Act, seven projects in Louisiana will receive more than $26.8 million to contribute to the rebuilding process. In a statement released later Tuesday by the DHS, a grant of more than $1.6 million to a Mississippi project was added to the list. The latest projects are in addition to about $2.5 billion in funds the Obama administration has given to the region for renewal since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, Napolitano said. ""Over the past 20 months, this administration has cut bureaucratic red tape that had slowed recovery and expedited assistance across the Gulf Coast,"" Napolitano said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with our federal, state and local, private sector, faith-based and nonprofit partners, as well as Gulf Coast residents, to ensure local communities have the assistance they need to rebuild the region stronger than ever."" According to the statement, the new projects include: . In Orleans Parish, Louisiana: . -- more than $11 million to rebuild the Xavier University student center . -- more than $2.7 million for the Archdiocese of New Orleans St. Martin Manor Yellow Masonry Assisted Living Complex . -- more than $2.5 million to help the archdiocese fix damaged classrooms at the Our Lady of Lourdes School . In St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana: . -- more than $1.4 million to rebuild the Salmen High School athletic department facilities . In St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana: . -- more than $5.1 million for sewer repairs . In Cameron Parish, Louisiana: . -- $3 million for a recreational center and gymnasium . In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana: . -- roughly $1.1 million to reconstruct 12 properties so they meet building codes regarding base elevation and flood safety . In Hancock County, Mississippi: . -- More than $1.6 million to upgrade Hancock North Central Elementary . Fugate said the Jefferson Parish funding was related to damage from Hurricane Rita, rather than Katrina. Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Louisiana coast on August 29, 2005. It was the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes to ever strike the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center. ""Considering the scope of its impacts, Katrina was one of the most devastating natural disasters in United States history,"" the hurricane center says. Hurricane Rita made landfall less than a month later, on September 24, in extreme southwestern Louisiana near the Texas border, producing significant storm surge that devastated coastal communities in southwestern Louisiana, according to the hurricane center.","NEW: The federal government is sending more than $26.8 million to Louisiana to help with rebuilding projects .

"(CNN) -- Telling a dirty joke or spouting political slogans: Which can get you in trouble faster at the office? Election Day can get heated when your co-workers pick political sides at the office and try to argue others into the ground. ""Work is not the place to discuss controversial topics, because you don't know where everyone in the group stands,"" says Jacqueline Whitmore, author of ""Business Class: Etiquette Essentials for Success at Work."" ""When you talk about it, you can make some people uncomfortable and not everyone is as passionate as other people might be."" Political talk can upset co-workers and create barriers in the office. Giving your opinion on controversial topics can quickly taint the atmosphere. People who don't agree with you might avoid you. While most employers don't prohibit talk of politics, says Bryon Peterson, principle of Human Resources Group International Inc., companies tend to differ in policies and regulations regarding political discussion. ""In hard times, people become passionate. My recommendation: While we as a company cannot prohibit political discussion, the company can provide recommendations and expectations,"" says Peterson. When Sam from accounting comes around spouting his opinion about the gubernatorial election, you can do a couple of things: avoid him completely, argue or say something to end the conversation. Saying ""I'm not well versed in that subject,"" or ""We can agree to disagree"" are nonconfrontational ways to avoid the discussion,  Whitmore says. But sometimes just listening is better than engaging -- especially if you work in the service industry. Whitmore gives the example of voicing political views at a beauty salon where tips make up a part of your income. ""Your client might bring it up, and as a hairdresser of that person, you sit and listen, that's one thing. But if your co-worker brings it up, you don't necessarily have to take part,"" says Whitmore. Certain jobs do include a clash of opinions. Political blogger Richie Essenburg is not afraid to hurt your feelings, stating on his website, ""If you like Ronald Reagan, chances are you won't like this entry, possibly this whole blog site."" Essenburg has argued with lawyers, peers, Republicans and Democrats about anything from the health care bill to racism to the state of the economy. His advice? ""Be honest and sincere, but keep it civil. Be open to someone's viewpoint, you might actually learn something from them,"" Essenburg says. Peterson also says a political discussion can be a learning experience for both the supervisor and employees. ""I kind of like to divide and conquer, and discussion with employees is a pretty impactful way to address potential conflict,"" says Peterson. ""That's a teaching moment."" He suggests that supervisors should address employees' political conversation by joining in, ""I just hope and expect that you are using the opportunity to have this discussion, refraining from conflict, and using this to listen to each other."" Acting as a fundraiser for your political party or candidate may not be acceptable at your company. So you might want to check before e-mailing or posting solicitations on the break room bulletin board. ""It really depends on if the company has a no soliciting policy. If they do, then they can ask the person to tear it [poster] down,"" Peterson says. It also depends on if a person is creating conflict. ""Address the fact if the person is offending anyone or making an uncomfortable work environment,"" says Peterson. If you are unsure about your company's policy on political conversation, contact your human resources department.","Companies tend to differ on policies regarding political discussion .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Health and hospital officials in Haiti braced for the worse Monday, fearing the hurricane that battered the Caribbean nation over the weekend could worsen the cholera outbreak that has killed hundreds of people and hospitalized thousands since it began last month. The official death toll attributed to the outbreak was 544, with more than 8,000 confirmed cases, Health Minister Alex Larsen told CNN. On Monday, Dr. Toni Eyssallenne of Hospital Bernard Mevs confirmed the first case of cholera -- in a 3-year-old boy -- to originate and manifest entirely in Port-au-Prince. Previous cases had been centered in Haiti's Artibonite and Central Plateau regions, including the city of St. Marc, north of the nation's capital. Until now, health officials said that those being treated for cholera in Port-au-Prince all contracted the disease elsewhere. The young Port-au-Prince boy lived in a tent city across the street from a place that sells macaroni, and he had not traveled in over a year nor had he had contact with people from St. Marc or the Artibonite region, Dr. Eyssallenne said. After suffering from nausea and diarrhea, the boy was treated and released from the hospital after his condition improved. This was one of scores of tests being carried out on 91 residents of the capital -- all of whom live in or near the city's densely populated Cite Soleil slum, Larsen said. Except for one person who died over the weekend, all the others have recovered, he said. Hurricane Tomas' trek past Haiti killed 20 people and injured another 36, a Communications Ministry official said Monday. Seven people were missing and 5,954 were homeless, the official said. Health officials fear that the water dumped by the storm will worsen the outbreak. The concern is that overflow from latrines and septic tanks could contaminate the supply of fresh drinking water and contribute to the spread of the bacteria. In the capital, the canals were not overflowing, said American Red Cross spokeswoman Andrea Koppel. But that was not the case in cities west of the capital, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Tomas, she said. Still, even Port-au-Prince looks and smells like a dump -- a caldron of water, garbage and human waste. ""We get used to it,"" said one resident. Ten months after a magnitude-7 earthquake laid waste to much of the nation, people compete with animals scavenging through the ubiquitous dumps for scraps of food. ""The quick solution is management,"" said Environment Minister Jean Marie Claude Germain. ""Management meaning that you have a structure in place, but the structure was not conceived with the slums in mind."" But most of the residents of Port-au-Prince live in slums. ""We're working on it,"" Germain said. ""We will work with the private sector.""

"London, England (CNN) -- British Airways on Friday announced a pre-tax loss of 164 million pounds ($256.5 million) for the three months ending June 30. The airline's chief executive, Willie Walsh, cited strikes by BA cabin crews and closures from the Icelandic volcano as reasons for the loss. In April, the eruption of a volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in Iceland grounded flights to and from the United Kingdom for several days amid concerns over safety. Cabin crew staff walked off the job in series of strikes during the quarter in a dispute over pay and working conditions -- a dispute that is yet to be resolved. In the trading statement Friday, BA said the combined disruptions cost the airline 250 million pounds ($390 million), in line with previous estimates. The airline said its operating loss had shrunk to 72 million pounds ($112 million) compared with the same quarter last year, as it reined in costs and increased passenger and cargo yields. Fuel costs were also lower. The airline said passenger revenue fell during the period, although yields improved ""driven by a change in mix especially within cabin."" Without the disruption to flights during the period, passenger revenue would have increased by 11 percent compared with the previous year, the company said. Looking ahead, the airline said it was maintaining its forecast to break even in the full year, despite bleak predictions from some analysts about a return to recession. ""While some economic experts are flagging the risk of a 'double-dip' recession, the steady recovery continues and, on that basis, we continue to target to break even at a profit before tax level for the full year as we move forward on our strategic objectives and continue to build on our excellent customer service,"" Walsh said.

"(CNN) -- Jordan's Queen Rania was recuperating in a New York hospital Monday after she underwent a medical procedure to correct an irregular heart rhythm. ""The procedure went very smoothly and Her Majesty is well and in good spirits,"" the Royal Court in Amman said in a statement Monday. She will remain hospitalized for two nights while she recovers before returning home later in the week, the palace said. Rania was in New York with her husband, who is attending the United Nations General Assembly. Rania's procedure involved placing a catheter through a vein to the heart. An electric current was then used to stop the disturbance of electrical flow through the heart, the palace said. As a result, the heart's normal rhythm was restored, it said. The procedure is used to treat premature ventricular contractions -- extra, abnormal heartbeats that begin in the heart's two lower pumping chambers. These extra beats disrupt the regular heart rhythm, sometimes causing patients to feel a flip-flop or skipped beat in their chests, a definition on the Mayo Clinic's website says. The site says premature ventricular contractions are common and occur in most people at some point. Most people with premature ventricular contractions and an otherwise normal heart don't need treatment. CNN's Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","Rania will rest for two nights before heading back to Jordan .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- One month ago, the San Jose copper and gold mine in Chile caved in, trapping 33 miners far underground. For the next 17 days, their families had no idea whether they were alive or dead. Here in their words, some of the wives, fathers and daughters think back to the first moments after learning of the accident and their efforts to keep hope alive. Lila Ramirez, wife of Mario Gomez: ""I felt a lot of rage and pain and I felt powerless. I knew this was an accident waiting to happen. ""Mario asked the bosses to take measures so the miners didn't run the risk of getting buried. But they never listened. A lot of the miners said they had heard the mountain groaning. One said he didn't want to go down the mine that day, he was afraid. But the boss said to him either you go down or I have five other people who will go down. ""I never doubted that I had a lot of faith they were all alive and that they were all together and that's how they found them. All together!"" Jessica Yanez, partner of Esteban Rojas: ""Those first days were unforgettable it was huge uncertainty, just waiting and waiting. ""Those were very bitter moments. I was crying day and night. I didn't want to sleep. I didn't want to go home, because my loved one wasn't with me, and when I ate I got angry with myself because I thought of him going hungry. ""I held out hope Esteban had been outside the mine. When I was crying I hoped he was going to come out and hug me and say, 'Darling, I'm here.' But the hours went by and they reported the names of the missing miners and Esteban never came."" Scarlett Sepulveda, daughter of Mario Sepulveda: ""I felt rage and pain and frustration. I thought how can they be trapped like that. They're not animals. But here in Chile they've always treated our miners like animals. ""It's horrible. I miss him so much. My dad always cheered us up and made us laugh. I just feel so so bad. ""I was sad and disillusioned. I didn't want to hear anything more about the accident. It's not exactly that I lost hope.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, no stranger to verbal gaffes, has come under fire again for a remark that critics say makes light of rape. In 2008 Berlusconi claimed right-wing female politicians were better looking than their left-wing counterparts. While campaigning for local elections in Sardinia Sunday, Berlusconi was asked by reporters to comment about an interior ministry proposal to deploy troops on city streets after a series of sexual assaults on women. ""We can't think of deploying a large force,"" Berlusconi said. ""We would have to send as many soldiers as there are beautiful girls. And I don't think we would manage."" The comment drew widespread criticism, including from his political opponents. Opposition leader Walter Veltroni accused the prime minister of ""ignoring the seriousness of sexual violence."" Later, Berlusconi said he meant his remarks as a ""a compliment."" ""Women have to be defended,"" he said. (Sexual violence) ""is a trauma that remains for life."" A series of violent attacks prompted the proposal to deploy troops. On New Year's Eve, a woman was raped in Rome. And on Friday, a group of men attacked a couple, tying up the man and repeatedly raping his girlfriend. The conservative leader has a long record of questionable comments. He was criticized in November after he told President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia that President Barack Obama ""has all the qualities to get along well with you: he's young, handsome and suntanned."" And in run up to the 2008 Italian general election, Berlusconi claimed that right-wing female politicians were better looking than their left-wing counterparts.","PM commenting on proposal to use troops in cities after attacks on women .

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- Elizabeth Smart will continue her testimony Tuesday in the federal kidnapping trial of Brian David Mitchell. Mitchell told Smart he wanted her from the moment he first saw her, Smart told a captivated jury Monday. He said he planned for months how he would snatch her so she could join him and his wife in a ""celestial"" plural marriage, Smart testified. ""He said they had been preparing for me since he saw me,"" she said. It was the fall of 2001, and he was panhandling outside a mall in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. Smart said she was with her mother and five brothers and sisters, shopping for school clothes. ""My mother gave gave him five bucks,"" Smart told told the jury. Mitchell was hired by her mother to fix a leaky skylight and rake leaves. Smart saw him around the house that fall but never spoke to him, she said. Before dawn on June 2, 2002, she awoke to the sound of a man's voice and a cold sharp blade against her throat. ""I remember him saying, 'I have a knife to your neck. Don't make a sound. Get out of bed and come with me or I will kill you and your family,'"" Smart testified. He led her in her red silk pajamas up a trail into the rugged back country and over a ridge, hiking what she estimated to be three to five hours to a crude campsite. There, she said, he ""sealed"" her to him as his wife and raped her. She said she begged him to stop, pleading, ""I'm just a little girl."" She struggled, but she said at age 14 she was no match for a grown man. Afterward, she cried herself to sleep. The next day, as she cried again, he told her she was ""lucky,"" Smart testified. He said he was a prophet and that God had chosen her to be by his side as he prepared for the second coming of Jesus Christ. She said she didn't feel lucky at all. ""I felt like I had a burden the size of a mountain to carry around with me the rest of my life,"" Smart said. Now 23 and living in Paris, France, Smart spent much of the day on the witness stand Monday, beginning a detailed description of her nine months of captivity with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. She spoke of being raped ""daily at the very least,"" tethered between two trees ""like an animal,"" and forced to watch and participate in sex acts she found repugnant. She said she was forced to smoke cigarettes and drink wine and ""hard liquor."" She did not have to face her alleged abductor on Monday. Mitchell, 57, loudly sings hymns whenever he is in court. He had been ejected, as usual, from the courtroom and was watching the trial from another room. He is charged with kidnapping and taking a minor across state lines for sex. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Mitchell's attorneys do not dispute what happened but say their client was insane at the time of the alleged abduction, and therefore not responsible for his actions. ""You'll have to ferret out not only what happened, but why it happened,"" attorney Parker Douglas told jurors earlier Monday. ""We're asking you to determine what was in someone's mind. This is made difficult with a crazy mind. The easy explanation is not always the correct one."" He described his client as ""a crazy person who comes in the middle of the night"" -- exactly what we are taught to fear as children, he said. Smart told the jury she thought about running away that first morning, despite the threats against her life and her family. ""I didn't want to spend another day with him. I never wanted to see him again,"" she said. ""I'd seen what he had done to me. I'd seen how he had come in and taken me from my the bed, the place I thought was the safest place in the world, in my home, with my sister beside me."" She continued, ""I felt that because of what he had done to me, I was marked. I wasn't the same. My personal value had dropped. I was nothing. Another person could never love me and and I felt, yeah, I could take the risk of trying to escape and being killed."" Later, after the shock began to wear off, she said she thought about her parents and the life she had before. ""I decided my parents would always love me despite what he did to me,"" she told the jury. ""I hadn't changed. I was still a person of worth ... I decided to live."" After that, she began to go along with what Mitchell told her to do. She was compliant. She listened, and even began to mimic his speech and his ways. As she stepped off the witness stand, Smart walked over to her parents, Ed and Lois, who embraced her. Earlier Monday, Smart testified about the night of her abduction. ""I thought I was having a nightmare,"" she said of being led away by a bearded man in dark clothing and a stocking cap. ""It was indescribable fear."" Smart's younger sister Mary Katherine, who witnessed the abduction, testified about awakening her parents with the words: ""Elizabeth is gone."" Also testifying Monday was the Smarts' mother, Lois. She spent less than an hour on the witness stand, recalling how the family hired Mitchell -- who then called himself Immanuel -- to do odd jobs. But most of her testimony focused on hearing the news that her daughter had been taken. ""(Mary Katherine) said that a man had taken Elizabeth with a gun and we wouldn't find her,"" Lois Smart testified. ""He took her either for ransom or for a hostage."" As her husband, Ed, searched the house, Lois Smart said, she ran downstairs, turned on the lights, and saw that the kitchen window was open, its screen cut. She testified she had opened the window the previous evening when she burned some potatoes while making dinner. ""My heart sank and I called out to Ed, 'Call 9-1-1,'"" she testified. ""It was utter terror. It was the worst feeling, knowing that I didn't know where my child was. I was helpless."" As her family frantically searched the house, Elizabeth testified, she was being led at knife point on the strenuous hours-long hike to a hillside encampment. ""I remember asking him if he realized what he was doing, and he said he did,"" she said. ""And I remember saying that if he let me go right now, we wouldn't press charges on him. And he said he knew exactly what he was doing and he understood the consequences of his actions."" Suddenly, she recognized his face, she testified, and the name Immanuel came to her. She said she asked why he would do this. ""My parents had only tried to help him,"" she said. ""He told me he was going to hold me for ransom, and I told him my parents would pay any amount to have me back."" Smart was found nine months after her abduction, walking on a street in the suburb of Sandy, Utah, in the company of Mitchell and Barzee. Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in federal court and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison. She also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap Smart's cousin a month after Smart was kidnapped. She was given a sentence of one to 15 years, to be served concurrently with the federal sentence, and given credit for the seven years she had spent in custody. As part of her plea agreement, Barzee agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's cricket team have donated half their win bonuses to help the relief victims of a flood in their home nation. Having beaten England by four wickets in the third Test at the Oval last week -- leaving Pakistan 2-1 behind in the series with one Test left to play -- the nation's top cricketers offered $54,400 in a bid to help their stricken countrymen. The contribution to the flood relief effort, which was announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board, is the latest in a number of fund-raising efforts aimed at helping those who have been affected by the disaster in recent weeks. ""The PCB chairman has announced a winning bonus ... and all the players and officials have donated half of the bonus in flood-relief funds,"" the PCB said in a statement. This latest act of charity by the national cricket team comes just one week after it was announced that PCB officials, staff and national team players had donated $137,590 to the same cause. Shahid Afridi, Pakistan's one-day captain, and the country's leading umpire Aleem Dar have also run separate campaigns for flood relief, raising millions of rupees. The PCB have also revealed that they are planning a game against Zimbabwe to raise further funds for the flood victims. This would be the first international cricket that has taken place in Pakistan since March 2009, following the terror attacks on the touring Sri Lanka side. In recent weeks, the worst floods in the country's history have killed 1600 people and left 20 million without homes in the north-west and southern regions of Pakistan. The U.N. says it still needs $200 million more in aid.

"(Health.com) -- Young children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are roughly four times more likely than their peers to become depressed or attempt suicide in later childhood, a new study suggests. Researchers followed 125 children with ADHD for up to 14 years beginning at ages 4 to 6, and compared them with a similar group of children without ADHD. Thirty-nine percent of the children with ADHD were also found to have depression during the study period, versus 8 percent in the control group. The risk for depression increased if the child demonstrated symptoms and behaviors that are distinct from -- but often occur alongside -- ADHD, such as anxiety, defiance, hostility, bullying, and fighting. The risk for depression was also more pronounced if the child's mother had a history of depression. Health.com: How to recognize the symptoms of depression . ""The only children with ADHD who were not at increased risk for depression were those without a depressed mother and who exhibited very few symptoms of other types of mental health problems,"" says the senior author of the study, Benjamin Lahey, Ph.D., a psychologist and professor of epidemiology at the University of Chicago. ""That is only a small proportion of children with ADHD."" ADHD also increased the risk of suicide attempts. Roughly 18 percent of the kids with ADHD attempted suicide at least once during the study, compared with 6 percent of the kids in the control group. (None were successful, fortunately.) Children who were primarily hyperactive and impulsive appeared to be at greatest risk, which suggests that impulsivity may play a role in suicidal behavior, the researchers say. Girls were at greater risk than boys for both depression and suicide attempts, but there weren't enough girls in the study to draw firm conclusions about gender, according to the authors. Health.com: How to spot the warning signs of suicide . The study appears in the Archives of General Psychiatry. ADHD is estimated to affect 4.4 million children in the U.S. and has been shown to raise the risk for academic and social difficulties, employment problems, and even brushes with the law later in life. However, this study is the first to examine the risk factors for depression in very young children with ADHD, and the first to follow children for an extended period of time. Experts have long suspected an ADHD-depression link in childhood, but the research to date has been inconclusive. ""This study adds more data to the notion that early manifestations of hyperactivity and impulsivity...are not necessarily benign,"" says Dr. Benedetto Vitiello, M.D., chief of the research branch dedicated to child and adolescent treatment and prevention at the National Institute of Mental Health, which funded the study. Health.com: Quiz: Do you have adult ADHD? But the children in the study aren't necessarily typical of all children with ADHD, says Rafael Klorman, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, in New York. It's relatively uncommon for ADHD to be identified in children as young as 4, he explains, and kids who get a diagnosis at that age tend to have more severe symptoms. ""These kids were diagnosed earlier, which means that the researchers have a sample with especially higher severity,"" Klorman says. ""They may be getting the high end of the spectrum."" Parents should not ""panic and think their children with ADHD are destined for depression or suicide,"" Lahey says. However, he adds, if parents are concerned that their child is showing symptoms of ADHD or depression, they should consult a mental health professional and consider family therapy. Health.com: What if my child begins to exhibit symptoms of ADHD? More research is needed to identify effective interventions that can lower the chances of depression in high-risk kids with ADHD, Vitiello says, echoing Lahey and his colleagues. Early intervention and treatment are important, as the risk of depression and other health problems associated with ADHD can last well into adulthood. Previous studies have estimated that anywhere from 16 percent to 37 percent of adults with ADHD have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder or dysthymia, a milder form of depression. And in another new study, which appears in the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine, researchers at New York University report that teenagers with ADHD are about twice as likely to have problems with alcohol and drugs in their 30s than those without the disorder. Health.com: Adult ADHD and substance use . However, the risk seems mainly due to the overlap between ADHD and conduct disorder, a related condition that's characterized by physical aggression and delinquent behavior, such as stealing and vandalism. The teens who did not show signs of conduct disorder did not appear to be at increased risk for substance abuse, the study found. Both ADHD and conduct disorder may be an early warning sign for alcohol and drug problems, the researchers suggest. Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(CNN) -- Over 1.8 million gallons of dispersant chemicals have been added to the Gulf of Mexico to break up oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon's ruptured well. And in the 100 days since the rig's explosion, little more has become known about the effects of those chemicals. In May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Coast Guard directed BP to use a less toxic dispersant than the one it was putting into the Gulf, Corexit 9500. When the company did not comply, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced that the EPA would run its own toxicity tests, the first round of which focused on Corexit 9500 and seven other common, readily available dispersants from the agency's approved list. The tests showed Corexit to be slightly less toxic than the manufacturer's data had indicated, so no new orders were issued. ""We need more data before we decide whether to change dispersants,"" said Paul T. Anastas, the EPA's assistant administrator for research and development. ""Our ultimate goal in all of this is to reach a point where dispersants are no longer necessary."" Scientists say questions remain about the effects of dispersants, in particular the more subtle consequences. ""The only effect that's being looked [in acute toxicity tests] at is death, lethality. That is a place that testing often starts because you want to know what concentration of the chemical will kill fish or other organisms,"" said Richard Denison, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. ""But what's much more relevant in predicting the full effects of the use of dispersants and dispersed oil are the more subtle effects -- that are sublethal, that may affect growth and reproduction."" Those sublethal effects may cause a population to diminish without necessarily killing organisms. Larvae and eggs are most at risk because they are more sensitive and less mobile. As for human health, scientists say much more needs to be learned about dispersants -- their behavior with oil, chemical ingredients, chronic and delayed effects -- to understand the risks. There are two types of potential exposures for humans, according to scientists: direct (by inhalation, ingestion or absorption through the skin) and indirect (by eating seafood). According to toxicologist Dr. LuAnn White of Tulane University, the risk to most humans is very low because the oil-dispersant mixture dilutes quickly and does not build up in the food chain. Some scientists disagree over dispersants' ability to break down the oil faster than it would naturally decompose. ""The conventional wisdom is that by breaking up oil into small droplets, it may be more easily biodegraded. That is not firmly established. In fact, there are conflicting data,"" said Denison. ""Some studies suggest that the rate of degradation of PAHs [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a breakdown product of oil] is actually impeded by dispersants."" Another unknown is whether the chemical constituents of oil are more or less likely to persist in the food chain. ""The problem has been that we have simply not required the answers to those questions. The fact that they are being asked now, and we don't have answers, is of particular concern given the magnitude and scale of use of dispersant."" According to Denison, more information is needed in order ""to be able to intelligently answer questions of whether we should still be using the dispersants."" ""I am not of the view that [dispersant] should or should not be used. I don't think we have enough data to answer those questions very well, and I'm hoping that this tragedy will spur us to answer those questions so we'll have enough information next time.""","EPA tested toxicity levels of eight common, readily available dispersants .

"(CNN) -- Germany captain Michael Ballack enjoyed a dream return to the Bundesliga as his Bayer Leverkusen side claimed an impressive 2-0 victory at Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. Ballack, who rejoined first club Leverkusen during the summer after four years at Chelsea, played his part in a superb team performance as Leverkusen showed they will be one of the teams to watch this season. Swiss midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta opened the scoring for the visitors in the 19th minute and Brazilian Renato Augusto added a second goal just three minutes later to ensure the three points. In Sunday's other match, Mainz secured a surprise 2-0 home defeat over Stuttgart thanks to goals from debutant strikers Sami Allagui and Morten Rasmussen. Tunisian Allagui opened the scoring in the 26th-minute and Danish international Rasmussen -- who joined on loan from Celtic this week -- added the second two minutes after the interval. With the first round of matches now complete, Hoffenheim lead the table courtesy of Saturday's stunning 4-1 win over Werder Bremen. Three goals in a bizarre six-minute spell in the first half proved the difference between the sides after Torsten Frings had put Werder ahead from the penalty spot.

"(CNN) -- Thomas Mueller celebrated signing a new contract with Bayern Munich by helping the Bundesliga champions to win the pre-season German Supercup clash with runners-up Schalke on Saturday. The 20-year-old, a revelation for Germany at the 2010 World Cup after scoring five goals, broke the deadlock in the second half in Augsburg before Miroslav Klose sealed a 2-0 win. Before the match, he agreed a two-year extension to his previous deal, which was due to expire in 2013. ""A dream has come true for me, and not just in the course of last season,"" Mueller, who was joint top scorer in South Africa and also named best young player, told the Bayern website. ""I come from Bavaria, and FC Bayern is my club. I'm delighted that I'll continue to wear a Bayern shirt for the next five years."" Bayern lost 3-1 to Schalke last week in the Liga Total Cup friendly event, as coach Louis Van Gaal fielded several reserve players.

Bayern angry as Dutch star Robben is ruled out . Schalke coach Felix Magath fielded his marquee signing, former Real Madrid striker Raul. Bayern, who also won the German Cup last season as well as reaching the final of the UEFA Champions League, took the lead in the 75th minute. Mueller slotted into the empty net when veteran striker Klose put the ball past onrushing goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Klose, who scored four goals at the World Cup to move second in the all-time scorers list with Gerd Mueller, doubled the lead from close range six minutes later after Ivica Olic beat Schalke's new Spanish defender Sergio Escudero and provided the assist.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Benitez made a winning start to his career as Inter Milan coach as the European champions beat last season's domestic rivals Roma 3-1 in the Italian Super Cup at the San Siro on Saturday. Benitez, who replace treble winner Jose Mourinho after leaving English club Liverpool, saw his new team maintain their dominance over the capital outfit, who finished second in both Serie A and the Italian Cup in 2009-10. It was Inter's fourth trophy of the year, with Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o netting two goals to join Alessandro Del Piero and Andrei Shevchenko at the top of the all-time list of Super Cup scorers with three goals following last year's effort against Lazio in Beijing. ""I am very happy because we showed character after going behind,"" Benitez told the Inter website after his side equaled city rivals AC Milan's record of five Super Cup wins. ""It's a title won by the players -- a title for them, the club and the fans. It was our first competitive match. It wasn't easy but we did it. The players did well. My boys weren't fresh, but they worked hard. We're hoping to be a bit fresher for the European Super Cup next week."" Inter take on Europa League winners Atletico Madrid of Spain in the European Super Cup next Friday, and kick off their Serie A season away to Bologna three days later. Claudio Ranieri's Roma took the lead in the 21st minute in front of the 65,000 crowd through Norwegian defender John-Arne Riise, whose first-time finish from the edge of the penalty area was set up by captain Francesco Totti. Goran Pandev equalized three minutes before halftime after a bad pass by Roma striker Mirko Vucinic left his teammate Juan exposed, allowing the Macedonian to score. Eto'o put Inter ahead with 20 minutes to go from Champions League final Diego Milito's cross, and sealed it 10 minutes later as he dispossessed substitute Rodrigo Taddei, exchanged passes with Wesley Sneijder and beat goalkeeper Bogdan Lobont. Meanwhile, Inter's Italian rivals Juventus boosted their squad with the signing of Serbia international winger Milos Krasic from Russian club CSKA Moscow. Krasic, 25, agreed a four-year contract and joins for a fee of $19 million. ""I received some proposals by Manchester City, Fenerbahce and other teams, but when I knew about the opportunity to join Juventus, I preferred to wait,"" he told the Juventus website on Saturday. Juventus will also add Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani to their squad on Monday if the Italy international passes a medical, having agreed a season-long loan for the 26-year-old. Aquilani has struggled since leaving Roma while still recovering from injury, and new Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson said he hoped the player could restore his previous form. Hodgson also ruled out any move for Netherlands World Cup star Dirk Kuyt, who has been linked with a move to Inter. ""I spoke to [Inter president] Massimo Moratti on Wednesday about the fact that they are not going to buy any Liverpool players, and Kuyt comes into that category,"" Hodgson told Liverpool's official website on Saturday. ""I believe Inter were only interested in two of our players and they are not going to buy them. Moratti said they are not going to do that. Kuyt is not for sale."" Liverpool's future is still uncertain after Chinese businessman Kenny Huang confirmed on Friday that he had pulled out of the race to buy the club from American co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett.","Inter Milan win fourth trophy this year with 3-1 win over Roma in Italian Super Cup .

"(CNN) -- An Iraqi official condemned Friday the decision by a U.S. jury not to sentence a U.S. soldier to death. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green faces life in prison after being convicted of murdering an Iraqi family. ""He raped a girl and killed an entire family, and he got only life in prison. ... This is an unjust trial,"" said Mustafa Kamel Shabib al-Jabouri, leader of the Awakening Council in Yusufiya. ""We demand a new trial."" Steven Green was found guilty earlier this month of raping a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and of murdering her, her parents and her 6-year-old sister. He was the last of five soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division convicted in the crimes and the cover-up that followed. During Green's trial, relatives of the murder victims gave gripping testimony about how the crimes still haunt them. Some family members said their lives have been ruined and it would have been better if they'd also been killed. Thursday, Green avoided the death penalty when a Kentucky jury could not reach a unanimous decision. Green was tried in civilian court because he had been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes came to light. The three others were tried by a military court and imprisoned. Spc. James Barker, Sgt. Paul Cortez, Pfc. Jesse Spielman and Pfc. Bryan Howard received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years, with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases. After the trial, defense attorneys called for the military to ""take a hard look at the resources they provide our service members dealing with combat stress issues. If they do not, we [are] certain a tragedy like this will occur again in the future."" Doug Green, Steven's brother, said he was grateful his brother's life was spared. ""I was incredibly relieved,"" he said. ""This is as good as it gets."" He also offered an apology. ""Our hearts and prayers are with you. We're sorry. We're sorry,"" he said. ""This has been hard for everybody involved. Not just my family, but the Iraqis. Everybody is going to need some healing."" ""I think it is hard for any one of us to put on those shoes,"" he said. ""Unless you have been to Iraq and fought in that war, or fought in any war, it is impossible to know what they are going through and impossible to judge them.""

"(CNN) -- On a bad day at work, during an I-can't-take-it-any-more moment, we've probably fantasized about outlandish ways to quit our jobs.   This week, Steven Slater, a flight attendant for JetBlue Airways, made a dramatic job exit: cursing and sliding down the plane's emergency chute with beer in his hand.   Slater's job-quitting performance has been hailed as heroic by some people. CNN asked readers and iReporters to share their stories about quitting in a dramatic, and oftentimes unprofessional, way. Kathi Cordsen, a 58-year-old in Fullerton, California, who shared her story on CNN's iReport, says she understood Slater's agony. She thought about walking out of the pharmacy where her hours had been cut after she worked there for three years. In her imaginary world, she would have told her ""disorganized"" boss to ""shove it."" In reality, she left a note on the back of a receipt that read, ""Saturday is my last day."" She politely said goodbye but was satisfied that the store had only about five days to scramble to find her replacement. ""After I wrote the note, I felt relieved,"" Cordsen said. ""There is an end to this, and I don't have to stress out anymore."" Share your fantasy ""I quit"" story . Another iReporter, dg56789, shared a story about quitting a bus driving job after getting into an argument with a teacher who demanded that a child be seated contrary to the rules. The driver handed the teacher the keys before walking off and telling the teacher to drive it herself. CNN commenter ""Becca"" told a story that involved things flying through the air at the Brooklyn shoe store where she had been working. She said she and another employee had an argument, and he threw at ladder at her. She threw a pair of stilettos at him and then knocked down a display of sandals as she left the building, cursing at everyone. Career experts usually advise that quitting a job be done with consideration and professionalism. Supervisors should be notified in advance, typically at least two weeks before the last day. Employees attempting to leave should stay on top of responsibilities and avoid insulting co-workers. ""Don't let your emotions overtake your logic, because the business world is a logical world,"" said Meg Montford, a career coach of based in Kansas City, Missouri. ""Emotions can get the best of us. Sometimes, if we express them inappropriately, we may regret it later.""  Careermag.com, a publication offering career information, advised impatient quitters to avoid burning bridges. The employee should think about the future, such as how former managers and co-workers may be contacted when you apply for other jobs. Make a graceful online exit from a job . But employers should still be honest about their problems with the company and the workplace when they leave, the site said. Sometimes -- as seen in Slater's case -- frustrations with work can spiral out of control before an employee can carefully plot his or her exit. CNN commenter ""Vicki"" could relate to the flight attendant's work troubles. She recalled working as a customer service manager at Wal-Mart during Christmas and dealing with an angry customer. She finally yelled at the customer while walking out of the job. ""Well, I wasn't real proud that I handled that situation that way but I can relate on how things can build up to a point where you just can't handle it,"" she said. How not to enrage your flight attendant . Another CNN commenter, ""Doug H,"" shared his own last straw. While working as a sexton at a local cemetery, he was asked to dig a plot for a child. He had dug graves for adults without any hesitation, but the idea of digging for a child made him uneasy. He refused to do it, which caused the cemetery manager to yell. Doug says he simply ""turned around and walked away."" A CNN commenter called ""Spongebob"" worked at a company that trains military pilots. After six years, sick of the department's supervisors, he detailed his frustrations to them and walked out. Luckily, he received a promotion to another site within the company. CNN commenter ""Charlie,"" who was a waiter in New York, gave a theatrical exit. While working a double shift, he became engaged in a fight with a host, who was assigning too many tables for him to handle. ""Charlie"" erupted, slamming plates against the wall, throwing his apron on the floor and cursing at the host before heading out the door. ""Needless to say, I'm not welcome in that place anymore,"" he wrote. ""But good riddance.""","A JetBlue flight attendant quit his job by yelling profanities and sliding down the plane's emergency chute .

"(CNN) -- The Greek prime minister may call for early general elections in December if his ruling party loses local elections Sunday, the nation's official news agency said. In an interview published Saturday, Prime Minister George Papandreou said the election is a high-stakes test for his ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), according to ANA, the official news agency. The ruling party will compete with the conservative opposition party New Democracy. On Saturday, the prime minister criticized Antonis Samaras, the leader of the opposition party. ""All they care about is to be able to say on the night of the elections that PASOK was defeated and that, therefore, the effort we are making to extricate the country from the great impasse has been defeated. That the government has lost the legitimacy to continue its policies,"" Papandreou said. New Democracy ruled Greece from 2005 to 2009. If it defeats the ruling party in the local elections, it may undermine the economic reforms spearheaded by Papandreou and his government. The policies aimed at reducing rampant deficit in Greece are carried out under the aegis of the financial bailout package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Greece was allotted about $150 billion to help restore investors' confidence and prevent bankruptcy. The economic crisis and the recently-unveiled austerity budget are expected to dominate the voters' agenda for the local elections.","Prime Minister says the election is a high-stakes test for his ruling party .

"(CNN) -- The good news is that you'll still be allowed to look out the window. The melancholy news is that you probably won't want to. Both Amtrak and Greyhound are in the midst of aggressive programs to install and expand free Wi-Fi service on their trains and buses. According to figures provided by officials of both companies, Amtrak and Greyhound, between them, carry around 50 million passengers a year on intercity routes. ""Our passengers tell us that they love to be able to use their computers for free as they travel,"" said Amtrak spokeswoman Barbara Petito. ""Our passengers enjoy it a lot,"" said Greyhound spokesman Timothy Stokes. Petito and Stokes undoubtedly are being truthful. For generations, it was taken as an article of faith that baseball was the national pastime. But several decades ago a wise social observer noted that baseball wasn't the national pastime at all; watching television had become the national pastime. And now -- it's difficult to argue with this -- gazing at computer (or mobile telephone) screens has become the national pastime, whether we want it to be or not. It's how we pass the time. ""All of our new coaches have Wi-Fi, and it's our plan to make it systemwide,"" said Greyhound's Stokes. (Various discount-priced bus lines have featured Wi-Fi for some time.) Amtrak's Petito said the Acela Express trains on the East Coast already have free Wi-Fi, as do the Downeaster trains (between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine), the Coast Starlight (between Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California) and the Pacific Surfliner (between San Luis Obispo, California, and San Diego, California). ""It is Amtrak's vision to outfit all of its services with Wi-Fi over the next few years as funding becomes available,"" she said. There is an undeniable logic to that. Jet airliners are a much faster way to get from one part of the United States to another; trains and buses take considerably longer, and passengers can grow weary and bored. Allowing them to connect to the internet, especially when it's free, would seem to be a way to make the miles zip by. So what will be lost? Journeys on Amtrak and Greyhound have, by default, been the last, best way to really look at America block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, mile by mile. If you were driving your own car on a long trip, you mostly had your eyes on the highway ahead; if you were flying, you were above the clouds. But on the train or on the bus you had little choice but to look out the window and take in the country as it rolled by. You could read a magazine or work on a crossword puzzle or knit, but those were things you could just as easily do at home. Moving from state to state at ground level felt different. On Amtrak especially, if you booked a compartment in one of the sleeper cars, your window had the approximate relative dimensions of a television screen: You could lean back and let the nation unfurl in front of you. It was like a visual novel, a freeform silent movie; it was like passing through America's endless backyard. It was the United States in a way you had allowed yourself to almost forget about. The one-of-a-kind storefronts, the people talking on small-town corners, the meticulously tended gardens, the lights in the windows waiting for someone to come home at the end of an evening -- they have always been there, but in our hurried daily lives we sometimes cease to pay attention. On the train or on the bus, paying attention was often the ideal option, the best way to deal with the tedium, and the whole thing could be unexpectedly lovely. It was the nicest traveler's perk of all. It still can be, of course; as Greyhound's Stokes said, ""You always have the choice."" But if recent social history has taught us anything, it's that the actual world around us is frequently no match for the seductiveness of a screen. If you need proof of that, it's right in front of you on any city street, as people stroll along oblivious to their immediate surroundings, their eyes locked on the information being delivered to them on their phones and handheld devices. We seem to have become hopelessly addicted. So you can bet that, as the trains and interstate buses eventually are all fitted for complimentary Wi-Fi, and as the technical kinks are worked out and the connectivity becomes close to seamless, passengers will become accustomed to logging on to the internet from before they even pull out of the station until the moment they arrive at their destination. There's no disputing that, in a fundamental way, this is progress; it will make the miles and hours seem to go by more quickly, it will allow passengers to feel they have not really left the world from which they have just departed, it will keep them tethered and productive. It will give the welcome illusion of shortening the journey. And maybe once in a while, as they look up from the computer for a moment and glance out the window -- at a Friday night football game in a town they've never passed through before and will never pass through again, at a diner whose owner is unlocking and opening the front door as the first tentative rays of one more dawn have just begun to glow, at the tired expression on the face of a motorist alone in his car at a railroad crossing, waiting patiently for the Amtrak train to speed by so he can get to wherever he needs to be. ... Maybe, once in a while, the people on the train or on the bus will gratefully take in the greatest free show of all, the one that isn't delivered out of the ether and onto a screen, the one that once was referred to as life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says Amtrak and Greyhound are bringing Wi-FI to their 50 million passengers .

"LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN)  -- Bolivian President Evo Morales nationalized the Chaco petroleum company Friday, taking over the BP subsidiary with the military on standby. Bolivian leader Evo Morales speaks before parliament Thursday in the capital, La Paz. ""With this decree,"" Morales said in a nationally televised address from an oil field in Cochabamba, ""we nationalize all the petroleum business in Chaco for all Bolivians."" Chaco is jointly owned by Pan American Energy and the Bolivian Pension Fund, each with a 50 percent stake, BP spokesman David Nicholas said from Great Britain. BP owns 60 percent of Pan American Energy, and Bridas Corp. owns the other 40 percent, Nicholas said . Nicholas declined comment on the nationalization. ""We are aware of the presidential decree but cannot comment,"" he said. ""We support Pan America's energies with any discussions they have with the Bolivian government."" Morales wore a white safety helmet with the words ""Chaco nationalized"" printed on the front when he made his announcement. The Bolivian president guaranteed the petroleum workers that their jobs will be safe. Formed in 1997, Chaco employs about 90 Bolivians, the company says on its Web site. Chaco is dedicated to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, BP says. Morales decreed in 2007 and 2008 that the government should nationalize various petroleum companies. His actions Friday came less than 48 hours before Bolivians vote Sunday on a new constitution that would give the central government more power and control.","Bolivian President Evo Morales nationalizes Chaco petroleum company .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso says the reaction of his fellow drivers to Formula One's controversial new rule changes after the opening Grand Prix of the season was ""hot-headed."" The Spaniard claimed victory in Bahrain on his debut for Ferrari but fellow drivers Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button were critical of 2010's new laws. They include a ban on refuelling during the race and that the grid's top ten drivers must start the race on the tires they used to complete the final qualifying session. But Alonso says it is too early to consider changing the rules and has pleaded for patience. He said on Ferrari's official Web site: ""I think that many of us have given some hot-headed comments immediately after the race in Bahrain. ""It's true that the race in Sakhir wasn't especially spectacular -- although for us Ferraristi it was great and exciting -- but it's too early to talk about changing the rules. ""We have to see how the tyres behave with different fuel loads and temperatures, which will be different from the ones we had during testing and in Bahrain. ""We have to wait and see different races and check the situation, without being emotional. Something that confuses the fans is changing the rules all the time."" Alonso and teammate Felipe Massa gave Ferrari the perfect start to the season with a one-two in Bahrain, but the Spaniard says no-one is getting carried away. He added: ""The one-two win in Sakhir gave us confidence and was a great result for the hard work during the winter on the track and at the works, but we can't take anything for granted. ""We have to stay with our feet on the ground, keeping calm and staying concentrated -- in Melbourne we're starting from square one. ""Nothing has changed for me -- there are four teams and eight drivers who can fight for victory and we have to give it our all to stay ahead of everybody else. ""I like the Albert Park track. It's quite a technical circuit with some pretty interesting corners. Overtaking has never been easy and what is even more important now, like on all city circuits, is the result in the qualifying.""","Fernando Alonso says drivers must be patient about Formula One rule changes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Its boss the butt of late-night jokes and its conduct the target of President Barack Obama's ire, BP went into a June meeting at the White House with its future at stake. ""The confidence of the markets had been rattled,"" former BP CEO Tony Hayward said in his first interview since he resigned, indicating how close the company was to collapse. Oil was still flowing from its well in the Gulf of Mexico and the company was being hit financially on all sides, with its stock price down and demands increasing for it to suspend dividend payments. Eleven lives had been lost on the Deepwater Horizon rig and Gulf Coast residents were feeling the punch of the disaster. ""These were frightening days,"" current boss Bob Dudley told the BBC, which aired ""BP: $30 Billion Blowout"" on Tuesday. ""It was a very, very tense period."" BP emerged from the White House with an agreement to spend $20 billion in reparations over four years and for politicians to tone down the anti-BP rhetoric. Hayward told the BBC the company was ""not prepared"" for the fallout from the spill and that he understood why he was ""demonized and vilified"" by the American public. ""It is very difficult to hate a company,"" said Hayward, conceding BP contingency plans were inadequate. ""It's much easier to hate an individual."" Hayward made a series of ill-advised remarks during the crisis, including, ""I would like my life back."" U.S. politicians and officials castigated him and occasionally referred to the company as ""British Petroleum"" rather than as ""BP,"" underscoring that a foreign-based company was at fault for the disaster. ""I don't feel like I've been made a scapegoat, I recognized the realities of the world we live in,"" Hayward told the BBC. ""In some senses it comes with the patch and you simply have to take the rough with the smooth."" Hayward said the company can restore the environment and jobs, but not the lives of those who died on the Deepwater Horizon. ""I was and remain devastated, he said. ""I feel a real accountability for that."" The BBC program was aired on the second day of U.S. hearings about the Gulf oil spill. One bad decision after another, failed tests and other shortfalls show that the three companies involved in the disaster need to be overhauled, the co-chairman of the presidential commission investigating the incident said. ""BP, Halliburton, and Transocean are major respected companies operating throughout the Gulf,"" said William Reilly, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, ""and the evidence is that they are in need of top-to-bottom reform."" Referencing his own earlier remarks about ""culture of complacency,"" Reilly said, ""all three companies we heard from displayed it,"" Reilly said. On Monday, the commission reported that workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon were pushing to complete the well, but no ""conscious decision"" to cut corners on safety had been discovered. ""Presentations and examinations yesterday uncovered a suite of bad decisions,"" Reilly said. Commission co-chairman Bob Graham, a former U.S. senator from Florida, cited a culture that failed to ensure safety. ""Leaders did not take serious risk seriously enough, did not identify risk that proved to be fatal,"" Graham said Tuesday. Tuesday's hearing focused on regulations and well-drilling protocols. The disaster began April 20 with an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, which was completing the well for BP at the time of the blast. The 11 killed all died in the blast and fire, which raged for two days before the rig sank, rupturing the well a mile below. Transocean, the rig's owner, Halliburton, the cement contractor, and BP have pointed fingers at each other since the rig sank. BP was responsible for capping the ruptured well it owned and cleaning up the more than 200 million gallons of oil that spilled. The well was sealed temporarily in mid-July and capped permanently on September 19. ""There seemed to be a compulsion to get this rig completed in that April 19, April 20 time period,"" Graham said Monday. Reilly also cited a ""rush to completion"" and called BP and its partners ""laggards"" in following best practices for drilling. Tuesday's testimony included discussion on BP's plan to temporarily cap the well before another rig would move in to start collecting oil. Charlie Williams, well engineering scientist, said his company uses at least three plugs during such a process, as compared to BP's one. The director of a petroleum research laboratory at Louisiana State University testified that better training and drills could prepare rig workers for disasters. ""I definitely think an increase in training should be considered, particularly with a set of disaster scenarios, if you will,"" said Darryl Bourgoyne. ""I think it would probably be much more effective if [training] drills were regularly conducted along these lines on the rigs that were doing the operations with the crews."" The commission also heard from ExxonMobil about its safety programs. Its executive said the company learned some lessons from the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska and other situations. ""ExxonMobil's goal is not simply to have employees comply with safety procedures. A culture of compliance alone can lead to complacency,"" said Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer. ""We seek to go beyond compliance, to create a culture in which employees are not only meeting the safety procedures, but they are challenging them so they can be improved where needed."" BP and Halliburton have drawn criticism about flaws in cement that was poured to reinforce the well. The companies involved each had data,"" commission chief engineer Richard Sears testified Tuesday. ""And if data had been shared differently and if operations had been carried out differently, I believe this disaster could have been prevented.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Army must transform how it protects its soldiers, collects information about internal threats and communicates with the FBI and terrorism experts in an effort to prevent another incident like last year's shootings at Fort Hood in Texas, a report by the Army and the Department of Defense says. The report, released Tuesday, says a remedy will be more Army participation in the Joint Terrorism Task Force, teams of experts drawn from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. It also recommends that Army agents within the FBI headquarters work as part of the threat management unit. The report highlights a failure to share information inside the Army and to encourage anyone, without fear of punishment, to voice suspicions about others in the military. ""The focus of the findings and recommendations in the Information Sharing area was the lack of policy, procedures and systems for the sharing of threat related information between the Services, Combatant Commands, DoD and other federal agencies such as the FBI,"" the report said. The Army report is 118 pages and titled ""Army Internal Review Team: Final Report."" The Air Force, Navy and Marines released separate reports. Maj. Nidal Hasan, a Army psychiatrist and U.S.-born Muslim, is accused of the November 5, 2009, shootings, in which 13 people were killed and dozens wounded. An evidentiary hearing is set to resume on Monday, a step toward the military decision on whether Hasan will face a court-martial and a possible death penalty. After the shootings there were numerous reports of Hasan's outspoken opposition to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to Muslims killing Muslims. Hasan was days away from shipping out to Afghanistan at the time of the shootings. Also, Hasan reportedly had communicated by e-mail with radical Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, something U.S. government agencies apparently knew about but did not tell the military. Army Secretary John McHugh and Gen. George Casey, chief of staff of the Army, were at Fort Hood on Friday to mark the first anniversary of the shootings. McHugh was asked whether the Army had done enough to respond to warning signals about Hasan. He said the Army is ""looking at the final parts of assessing exactly what was known, what officers and soldiers knew about that particular individual and what was done, if anything, to react to it."" The Army report says no single action would have prevented Fort Hood. ""However, in the aggregate, the initiatives outlined by the Army's internal review team will significantly improve the Army's ability to mitigate internal threats, ensure FP [force protection], enable emergency response and provide care for the victims and families."" The report says the Army needs to create a kind of ""neighborhood watch"" program that will teach members of the Army community to recognize and report suspicious behavior. The report acknowledges that members of Congress continue to press the Defense Department and U.S. intelligence agencies for what they knew about Hasan. ""Much of the information requested has not been released because it would compromise the trial of the alleged perpetrator,"" the report says. The Army says it already has implemented changes, including having first responders move in quickly to respond to a shooting rather than cordoning it off and awaiting special teams. Some of the recommendations were general and some were very specific. The Army is still working on ways to identify what it calls ""observable indicators for espionage, terrorism and extremism,"" according to the report. Another recommendation says, ""[Military Police] are now authorized to use jacketed hollow point ammunition to reduce the risk of injury to innocent bystanders.""","Army report: Methods for protecting soldiers, collecting intelligence need overhaul .

"(CNN) -- Don't tell Brad Pitt who or how to love. Brad Pitt talks about ""soul mate"" Angelina Jolie, life, and fatherhood in Parade magazine. The actor and star of the new film ""Inglourious Basterds"" opened up to Parade magazine about his thoughts on love, marriage and fatherhood. During the candid interview, Pitt showed off a secret area in one of his homes which he said ""is a great place for sex"" and reflected on his early days in Hollywood, which included superstardom and some marijuana. ""I liked to smoke a bit of grass at the time, and I became very sheltered,"" Pitt told Parade. ""Then I got bored. I was turning into a damn doughnut, really."" These days, Pitt said he's happy with his decision to become a parent with partner Angelina Jolie. The two have six children, all younger than 10: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh and twins Vivienne Marcheline and Knox, the latter born last year. ""This family is full of life,"" Pitt said. ""There are laughs, aggravations, irritations, but at the end of the day, it's fun. When life is really good, it's messy."" Pitt said his life is very different now that he is a dad. ""When I go down a path, I take it to the end,"" he said. ""Then I take another one. I took the path of not having kids, now it's time for family. Children are a dominant value in my life now, and they weren't before."" He's found a ""soul mate"" in Jolie, Pitt said, but he insisted he meant what he has said in the past about not marrying her. ""When someone asked me why Angie and I don't get married, I replied, 'Maybe we'll get married when it's legal for everyone else,' "" he said. ""I stand by that, although I took a lot of flak for saying it, hate mail from religious groups. I believe everyone should have the same rights."" Pitt told Parade he takes exception to anyone trying to dictate how someone should live and who they should love. ""Just the other night, I heard this TV reverend say that Angie and I were setting a bad example because we were living out of wedlock, and people should not be duped by us,"" Pitt told the magazine. ""It made me laugh. ""What damn right does anyone have to tell someone else how to live if they're not hurting anyone? How many times do you think real love comes to someone in a lifetime? If you're lucky, maybe two or three."" People should be able to be happy, Pitt said, and that includes his children. ""Would it bother me if a child of mine turns out to be gay? No, not one bit,"" he said. ""Listen, I want my kids to live the lives they want to live. I want them to be fulfilled. I hope I teach my kids to be who they really are.""","Brad Pitt gave a candid interview to Parade magazine .

"(Mental Floss) -- It's a lot more difficult than you might think to find good parents in fiction: Perhaps unsurprisingly, a lot of fiction deals either with the lack of a parent -- being a cardinal rule of children's fiction to ditch the parents -- or a parent's complete unsuitability for the role. But there are a few out there, parents who make you think, ""Gee, I wish my parents were like that."" Here's our totally comprehensive, really scientific overview of good parenting in fiction: . 1. Atticus Finch -- ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee . The widowed father of Jem and Scout, Atticus Finch is one of the great heroes of American literature. Steering his young children along the path of moral rectitude is hard in the Jim Crow South, and when Atticus, a lawyer, unsuccessfully defends an innocent black man from charges that he raped a white woman, it becomes even more difficult. But his own belief in rightness, morality, and good, even in the face of an unfair world, is communicated to his kids -- and to the world. His impact on the legal profession, especially in the South, was also profound: The Atticus Finch Society, part of the Alabama Law Foundation, was founded to serve the legal needs of the poor and named after a fictional lawyer who ""epitomizes the type of professional, and person, lawyers strive to be."" 2. Alex and Kate Murry -- ""A Wrinkle in Time"" by Madeleine L'Engle . Tesseracts are real and Meg and Charles Murry's scientist father has disappeared into one -- it's up to these two brilliant but socially awkward children to save him. When it was published in 1962, ""A Wrinkle in Time"" was a sci-fi gift to all those nerdy kids out there for whom ""Star Trek"" hadn't been invented yet. And the Murry parents -- beautiful and smart microbiologist Kate and tesseract physicist Alex -- made being scientists seem so cool. Who wouldn't want parents like that? 3. The Weasleys -- ""Harry Potter"" series by JK Rowling . Harry Potter wanted them to adopt him -- and we wouldn't mind either. Though Harry was already remarkably well-adjusted for a child who'd been forced to sleep in the spider-filled cupboard under the stairs, his friendship with Ron Weasley and his family showed him what a loving family really looked like. Mom Molly Weasley was kind, fiercely protective of her children -- her battle with Bellatrix Lestrange in the final book was immensely satisfying -- and knits a mean jumper. Dad Arthur Weasley was slightly bumbling, loves Muggle stuff, and still a kid at heart. Best of all, they loved each other as much as they loved their children. Mental Floss: 10 things you might not know about Harry Potter . 4. Marmee -- ""Little Women"" by Louisa May Alcott . Marmee is the glue that holds the ""Little Women"" together through the Civil War and their father's long absence. Kind and charitable, she's their moral compass, their comfort in troubled times. Without her, the four girls, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth, are lost. 5. Mr. and Mrs. Little -- ""Stuart Little"" by EB White . Interspecies procreation is typically cause for concern, but not for Mr. and Mrs. Little. When their son, Stuart, was born a mouse, the kind, though perhaps a bit dense, Littles treated him just like any other member of the family. A member of the family who had a long tail, whiskers, slept in a cigarette box and could climb up lamp cords. 6. Ma and Pa Ingalls -- ""Little House on the Prairie"" by Laura Ingalls Wilder . Though Laura Ingalls Wilder's stories of growing up in the Indian Territory, now Kansas, in the mid to late 19th century are actually autobiographical, the books tend to be found in the children's fiction part of the bookstore, so they make the list. Pa was a true pioneer with a serious case of wanderlust: He could build a house by hand and skin a rabbit, but still remained a gentleman, kind, courteous and upstanding. Ma Ingalls, a true pioneer's wife, instructed her children to treat others with care. 7. Mr. and Mrs. Quimby -- ""Ramona"" series by Beverly Cleary . Ramona Quimby, age 8, is a bit of a handful. Her imagination -- and she's got lots of it -- often gets her into situations, like the time she went to school with her pajamas under her clothes because she was pretending to be a fireman. Or the time she put her doll in the oven. Or the time she squeezed an entire tube of toothpaste into the sink. Her parents, Bob and Dorothy, meanwhile, are real parents, who have to deal with real things like quitting smoking, having children young, getting laid off, and 8-year-olds who accidentally dye themselves blue. And they even get in fights, like real parents do. But throughout it all, they manage to remain patient and affectionate with their children; they're not perfect, but they're pretty good. 8. Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert -- ""Anne of Green Gables"" by Lucy Maud Montgomery . When brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert of the Green Gables farm decide to adopt a boy from a Nova Scotia orphanage to help out around the farm, they weren't expecting Anne. Anne (with an 'e', of course, since it's ever so much more distinguished) was a redheaded 11-year-old, covered in freckles and though extremely clever, sometimes a bit too imaginative, definitely melodramatic and possessing an almost magnetic attraction to getting into scrapes. Shy Matthew immediately loves Anne, enchanted by her incessant chatter and her creativity, while Marilla, strict and somewhat prim, takes awhile to warm up. But when she does, her devotion to Anne is unparalleled and she keeps the sometimes flighty redhead on firm ground. Mental Floss: All about Anne (of Green Gables) 9. Baloo the Bear, Bagheera the Blank Panther, and the wolves -- ""The Jungle Book"" by Rudyard Kipling . After they save him from becoming tiger Shere Khan's meal, Father Wolf and Mother Wolf raise the hairless man-cub Mowgli as one of their own. But it's up to Baloo the sleepy bear and Bagheera the panther to teach the boy the Law of the Jungle -- thereby becoming the coolest godparents in the world. 10. The Gilbreths -- ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" by Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr., and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey . So, the Gilbreths were actual people, not fiction, and this charming book, published in 1948, is a biography written by their children. But -- and we mean this as a compliment -- the parents are so lovely as to almost seem made up. Frank Gilbreth and his wife, Lillian, are world-famous efficiency experts whose studies in time and motion changed the way people worked. If Frank had his way, it would have also changed the way people raised children, especially after their incredible fecundity produced 12 children. Having an even dozen children meant that the Gilbreths could apply some of their expertise in their Montclair, New Jersey, home. Hilarity ensues, as does an overwhelming sense of warmth and happiness. The two children wrote a follow up book, ""Belles on Their Toes,"" recounting what happened after Frank's death in 1924, which left Lillian with house full of children, the youngest just 2 years old, and a business to run. Mother Lillian manages to keep it all together, with good humor and warmth, and the book manages to stay away from the maudlin. Mental Floss: 22 fictional characters whose names you don't know .

Biopsies are recent inventions, but negotiating with God must be among man's most ancient ones. Of course, my prebiopsy bargaining was just pleading in disguise: faux brokering between the entirely powerless -- a supine woman, clinging to the paper strip down the middle of a doctor's examining table -- and the all-powerful, whether one calls it God, the Fates, or ""the luck of the draw."" To cut a real deal, both parties need some power. Gangsters and parents both know this well. When Marlon Brando, as Don Corleone, promises to make someone ""an offer he can't refuse,"" it's a bargain struck at gunpoint, another deal-that's-not-one. As a mother, I've used this thuggish tactic more than I'd like to admit. ""That's the deal"" is a common slogan in our home. When my husband or I use it, our daughters know they've reached a red line, not to be crossed. It is bedtime. That gerbil cage needs cleaning. Time was, women cut far fewer deals than they do today. In the past, when they remained dependent on their fathers or husbands, their lives were less about striking deals than hoping for the best. Fairy princesses -- those perfect models of traditional passivity -- don't cut deals. Whether they're sweeping floors while their sisters swan off to the ball or marrying the prince, both drudgery and love fall on them from great heights. Deals don't happen in dictatorships, where, let's face it, most of those princesses live. Oprah.com: Master the art of making a deal . Real live women negotiate. Over the past century, we got the vote, the Pill, washer-dryers, and antidiscrimination laws, giving us choices, freedoms -- and the ability to strike any number of deals. Nowhere is this more true than in the arena of relationships: .

To be sure, the traditional blueprint for ""marrying well"" -- her beauty, his paycheck -- still proves popular. In my leafy London neighborhood, I know women who have made such deals. They often seem calmer than I am, and they're inevitably sleeker, with taut skin and trainer-honed bodies. Many of their husbands leave the house before dawn to catch the Hong Kong markets when they open, returning home late, ruffling their kids' hair while they sleep. These women vacation on small and exquisite islands, but they're never sure when they'll reach them, as they are tethered to their husbands' timetables. That's the deal. Oprah.com: Confessions of a semi-happy wife . When I met the man I was to marry, he certainly didn't seem like a deal. Lacking height, a hearty handshake, and career ambitions, he didn't conform to the traditional notions of a catch. Antony was a slight, suburban-born Englishman, a dead ringer for Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh. When we met, he was languidly pursuing a history doctorate, but his keenest aspiration was really to reread Proust -- for the umpteenth time -- and see as many movies as possible. His vast stores of warmth took time to find, guarded as they were by those twin emotional weapons favored by the British male, irony and reserve. I spent a weekend parsing a document that turned out to be a love letter but which I'd thought was some sort of philosophy essay laced with liner notes from a Prince album. He was low-key, this Antony. While I suggested we move -- to New York, New Delhi, anywhere, really, for an adventure -- he was happy to stay in his hometown, London, and to abandon his doctorate for a quiet job in the British civil service. Once I fell for him, I knew I'd have to plan on a life outside the United States. It wasn't just his job that was strictly British. His character was, too. I knew that it wouldn't be easy to make the switch from his calm, structured life to the cut-and-thrust of the American job marketplace. In the land of Let's Make a Deal, nobody would have the patience to wait for Ant's brilliance to shine through his self-effacing manner. Sometimes I'm stupid enough to think we should make a more conventional deal. During the boom, with millions making millions, my husband remained content with his modest take-home pay. ""You're smart,"" I'd occasionally nag. ""Why not be a banker and make us rich?"" His reply was succinct: ""Nine weeks of vacation, and job security."" In my heart, I knew they were both key to my own treasured freedoms: to travel, and to freelance. And when the financial market crashed, and FOR SALE signs blossomed in London's bankers' neighborhoods, I was reminded once again of his wisdom and my foolishness. Oprah.com: 7 deals you should never make . His ambitions were tame -- except those he had for me. When I got a chance to leave London to study in New York, he said, ""Go.""

Even now, 15 years on, married, with two children, he still wants me to keep going. The other week, as I planned a few days in Pakistan for a story, he was busy arguing that I should tack on a short hop to Kabul. ""Go,"" he urged. ""Go."" ""Are you trying to get me killed?"" I teased him. No, he just knew a few days there would help me with a book I'm writing. I didn't go, fretting I'd miss home too much. That panicked him, for he worries I'll get so enmeshed in our family that I won't do the two other things I love to do: write and report. ""I want you to stay the woman I married,"" he'll murmur. ""You need to hit the road again. Go."" These urgings, of course, only make me want to stay. That said, I know that even if love lasts, deals don't.

"(CNN) -- English golfer Ross Fisher boosted his Ryder Cup hopes by claiming his fourth European Tour title with a two-shot victory from home hope Padraig Harrington at the Irish Open on Sunday. The 29-year-old jumped up to sixth place in the European team standings ahead of October's clash with the United States as he equaled the tournament record score of 18-under-par 266 in Killarney. Europe captain Colin Montgomerie set that mark nine years ago, but the 47-year-old has not played since finishing 68th at the British Open last month. Fisher had led by three shots at halfway after a 10-under 61 on Friday, but saw that cut to one stroke by compatriot Chris Wood and Italy's Francesco Molinari after a 71 on Saturday. The world No. 36 started his final round badly with a bogey at the third hole, but bounced back with five birdies and an eagle at the par-five seventh to card 65. That proved enough to deny three-time major champion Harrington his second title in four years at his home event, despite a flawless 64 including an eagle at the par-five 16th. ""It just feels great to come out on top against such a world-class field,"" Fisher told the European Tour website after claiming the $650,000 first prize. ""I could hear the roars and knew Padraig was making a charge. I just tried to stay patient and this is what we play for -- we want to give ourselves a chance and I am no different."" Wood held on for a tie for third after a closing 68 which featured six birdies and three bogeys, joining Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano on 270 after the Spaniard shot a flawless 67. England's Richard Bland (65) was tied with Australian Richard Green (67)another shot back, while Molinari was eighth on 274 after an erratic 72 containing four birdies, four bogeys and a double. Meanwhile, American Jeff Overton took a three-shot lead into Sunday's final round of the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia as he seeks his first PGA Tour title following two runner-up finishes this year. He had been four ahead at the halfway stage, but two early bogeys saw that cut before he bounced back with five birdies in six holes from the 12th for a four-under 66. His compatriot D.A. Points moved up to second place on 15 under with a superb 61, while U.S. Ryder Cup player J.B. Holmes went one shot better to be in a four-way tie for fourth on 12 under -- one behind Boo Weekley (67).","Ross Fisher moves up to sixth in Europe's Ryder Cup standings with Irish Open victory .

"(Mental Floss) -- For a serious distance runner, 7 hours, 48 minutes is not a great marathon time. But cut Brian Fugere some slack. He'd been diagnosed with synovial sarcoma -- a rare soft-tissue cancer -- in his lung. He was in his fourth cycle of chemotherapy. And he was dragging an IV pole for all 26.2 miles. Oh, and this marathon was taking place in a hospital hallway. When Brian Fugere started coughing up blood in February 2005, he was an active 47-year-old who jogged regularly and once finished the Boston Marathon in a respectable 3 hours, 19 minutes.

He had recently gained a small but devout following after co-authoring ""Why Business People Speak Like Idiots"" with Chelsea Hardaway and Jon Warshawsky, a book that espoused the benefits of straight talk. He appeared on cable news shows and wrote op-ed pieces, and his work was the subject of a clue on ""Jeopardy!"" Then came the news nobody is prepared to hear. ""I have been diagnosed with a form of cancer called synovial sarcoma,"" Fugere wrote friends and colleagues in 2005. ""Although this usually shows up in and around the joints, mine appears to be in my lung. I am having surgery to remove my lower left lobe, where the tumor has hunkered down. We're going in for a full assault."" The assault began at UCSF Medical Center, where doctors removed Fugere's lung-lobe as planned. Next up: chemotherapy at Kaiser Walnut Creek Hospital. The Box of Chocolates Marathon . When he first drifted into the oncology floor hallway, he didn't set out to complete a marathon. Originally he was just trying to keep himself from going stir crazy during chemo, which came with a few complications, including a blood clot, pneumonia and anemia. Fugere had been reading Lance Armstrong's ""It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life,"" which stressed how important it was to ""keep moving."" ""So, I started moving,"" Fugere said. ""I did one, then two, then three, then four, then five laps. Then I started measuring the distance of a lap around the cancer ward and figured out it would take 144 laps to do a marathon. ""So then I figured, why not?"" Fugere called his hallway odyssey the ""Box of Chocolates Marathon,"" borrowing a line from Forrest Gump. (""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."") ""I want to show other chemo patients that you don't have to accept the notion of lying in bed all day getting liquid Drano pumped into you,"" Fugere said the week of the marathon. ""Well, you do need to get the liquid Drano -- you just don't need to take it lying down."" When friends, colleagues and hospital staff members learned of the marathon, they wanted to help. Many wrote or called to offer their support. Some walked alongside Fugere, and lots of people opened their wallets. Those 144 laps raised $42,000 for the Sarcoma Foundation of America. His feat even landed him in Sports Illustrated's ""Faces in the Crowd"" that October. Keep moving, indeed . Five years later, Fugere is cancer free. But he's continued to heed Lance Armstrong's advice. In April 2009, Fugere and a friend ran the American River 50 Mile Endurance Run in Sacramento, California. They dubbed their performance ""The Running of the Fools"" and raised $31,600 for sarcoma research. And earlier this month, he entered the Vermont 100 Mile Endurance Race. ""I am attempting to win the 'Over 50, Missing One Lung Lobe' category,"" he joked before the event. It took him 23 hours, 45 minutes, but he finished. After the race, Fugere was too tired to talk about the future. But there's little doubt whatever he has planned will make the rest of us exhausted when he does tell us.

"Washington (CNN) -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee requested documents and information Monday from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa related to the recent salmonella outbreak and egg recalls, according to a news release from the office of the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California. Waxman and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, sent letters to the two Iowa-based egg producers asking for details on the contamination of their egg products, including when government officials and customers of the affected egg products were first notified of the contamination. The committee also asked for the inspection records for the companies' facilities, the companies' internal protocols and standards for monitoring and analyzing their products, and documents related to allegations of health, safety, environmental, or animal cruelty violations for the companies or any related companies, the news release said. Responses from each egg company are expected by Tuesday, September 7, according to the letters. Hillandale Farms said it shared ""a number of common suppliers"" with Wright County Egg, including a company called Quality Egg, which provided feed and young birds. ""We are devastated that our eggs have been implicated in making people sick,"" Hillandale farms said in a statement Sunday. ""We have never had a product recall in our 45-year history, and it flies in the face of our mission to provide wholesome, nutritious food for the American public. We regret that anyone might have become ill, and the concern and disruption this has caused our customers."" Both Wright County and Quality Egg are owned by the DeCoster family, which has a string of agribusiness interests in the Midwest and Northeast. Those companies' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month. In June, company owner Austin ""Jack"" DeCoster admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in Maine after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to Maine animal welfare officials. In a statement issued Monday morning, Wright County Egg said it was working with the Food and Drug Administration on the current recalls and defended its record. ""Wright County Egg strives to operate our farms in the most responsible manner, and our management team has worked closely with FDA through their review of our farms. We have reviewed [FDA] Commissioner [Margaret] Hamburg's comments to the media, but because we have not received any written reports from FDA to date, it would be inappropriate to respond to her remarks. It is important to note that any concerns raised verbally during FDA's on-farm visit were immediately addressed or are in the process of being addressed,"" the statement said. ""When issues have been raised about our farms, our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively, working with recognized outside experts to identify and implement corrective measures for our operations,"" it said. ""We are approaching our work with FDA in the same forthright manner."" The Energy and Commerce Committee isn't the only group on Capitol Hill looking for answers. The chairwoman of the House FDA and Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Rep.Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, sent a letter Monday to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Hamburg, asking questions about the recent egg recall. In the letter, DeLauro asked the United States Department of Agriculture and the FDA, which share jurisdiction in this area, about the investigation into the DeCoster farm's safety record and the oversight of its operations. She also inquired about the possibility of the tainted eggs being used by federal nutrition programs.","NEW: House agriculture subcommittee chairwoman is also inquiring about the egg recall .

"(CNET) -- AT&T is offering free public Wi-Fi hot spots to help it deal with increasing congestion on its wireless network. On Tuesday, the company launched a free outdoor wireless hot spot in New York's Times Square. The pilot program will offer free Wi-Fi access to AT&T wireless and broadband customers using smartphones, laptops, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices. AT&T's Wi-Fi network is set up on the north side of Times Square on Seventh Avenue between 45th and 47th Streets. The program is designed to see how Wi-Fi can help relieve wireless data congestion on AT&T's network. Customers with Wi-Fi-enabled devices will connect to the Wi-Fi network instead of AT&T's 3G network to access the Internet or Web-based applications. If all goes well, AT&T said it may expand the offering to other cities. AT&T, the exclusive carrier in the U.S. for the iPhone, has been struggling to keep up with demand for data services on its network. The company has reported that due to new devices like the iPhone it's seen mobile data traffic grow on its network 5,000 percent in three years. The extra traffic, particularly in densely populated locales such as New York City and San Francisco, has caused problems for consumers in the way of dropped calls and slow Net access. The telephone company has been investing in its network to improve capacity and network coverage. It's upgraded its backhaul networks, which connect the cell sites to its Internet backbone. It's added new Microcell devices that expand in-home coverage. And it's bulked up coverage in sports stadiums, convention halls and other areas where people congregate. AT&T has also been using its more than 20,000 Wi-Fi hot spots throughout the country to offload some of the traffic. The company has offered free Wi-Fi access to its smartphone subscribers in the hopes that customers will use the Wi-Fi network when it's available rather than the slower 3G network. So far, the company has seen some success. In 2009, AT&T consumers connected to an AT&T Wi-Fi hot spot four times more often than they did in 2008, the company has said. And in the first quarter, AT&T handled 53.1 million Wi-Fi connections on its network, which is nearly five times higher than the same quarter last year. One of the biggest advantages of Wi-Fi is that it's already in most devices. Laptops come with Wi-Fi pre-installed, and most new smartphones also come with Wi-Fi built in. It's also faster than a 3G network, so it offers subscribers a better experience. Advancements in the technology, especially new features found in the latest version of Wi-Fi 802.11n, increase the range and speed of the networks. In urban areas, Wi-Fi hot spots now extend almost 2,000 feet, which is nearly as far as some cellular cell sites, according to Jeff Thompson, CEO of fixed wireless provider Towerstream. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Grilled Cactus anyone? I am standing in a Mexican kitchen on a picturesque Ranch outside of Oaxaca city kneading dough that will become mini tortillas. I've already grilled the cactus that will be a part of the topping for these mini tortillas called Memelas. The rest of my gang is working equally hard -- my son Matt and husband Andy volunteered for the rice, my two daughters Reggie and Mel (chocoholics!) for the chocolate pudding dessert made with the famous chocolate from this region and I work on the little tortillas that we will cook outside on a special tortilla grill called a Comal. Welcome to Seasons of My Heart Cooking School run by well-known chef Susana Trilling, an American from Philadelphia, who fell in love with Mexico on vacation more than 20 years ago and has lived here most of the time since, raising her two kids here, offering cooking lessons and culinary tours. ""Mexico is so wonderful for kids,"" she tells me. ""They love children."" We had spent the morning touring the ancient ruin of Monte Alban, where Zapotecs lived from 500 BC until 1500 AD. The place is huge -- some 12 square miles with 21 buildings in various stages of excavation. The views of the surrounding mountains and valleys are stupendous. We climb down into an ancient tomb to the museum and marvel at the artifacts that have been found here -- skulls, pottery, jugs, beads and even tiny children's toys. Oaxaca is in the southeastern part of Mexico or and we've come here for a few days of cultural immersion after a week lazing on the beach. Mexico beaches are terrific, of course, but there is so much more to see and do in this country, including learning about the cuisine. To make the most of our time, we've arranged for Austin-Lehman Adventures to guide us -- including our day at cooking school -- so that I don't have to fret the details. While we were touring the ruin, the other people in Susana Trilling's class, including a family of eight whose members ranged in age from seven months to 88 years, shopped with Trilling for the ingredients for the feast we would cook. ""We all love to cook and be in the kitchen together,"" said Annie Hooker of Lake Forest Ill. She'd gathered her family -- mother-in-law, children and grandson -- from around the country for a trip to Oaxaca and a day here. As kids become more sophisticated eaters there are more opportunities to learn about cooking and local cuisine on vacation, whether visiting local restaurants or farmer's markets. (I especially love San Francisco's Ferry Plaza Marketplace where kids can talk to local farmers. or taking cooking lessons. Even museums are getting into the act. This month the Greensboro Children's Museum will become the first museum in the country to have an Edible Schoolyard featuring gardens, a greenhouse, teaching kitchens and even a chicken coop -- all designed as a national model to teach kids where food comes from and how to prepare it. Kids can even learn to cook while cruising the high seas! Aboard the Holland America Line, for example, there's the kids and teens Culinary Arts Center where kids learn to create dishes on board ship as part of Club Hal. Disney Cruise Line's Med cruises offer adults-only cooking lessons at a farm in Tuscany while the kids are entertained and supervised on board. Disney also offers family shore excursions where you can all cook together. ""Family cooking classes in Italy are a big hit and can be the most memorable part of an itinerary,"" says Amie O'Shaughnessy of Ciao Bambino!, which arranges such excursions. ""The best classes are hands-on where kids are engaged and interacting with the instructor, and then everyone sits down for a yummy meal as the grand finale."" Resorts are incorporating cooking lessons and demonstrations in their kids programs too -- from major all-inclusives like Beaches in the Caribbean to the Grand Velas in Puerto Vallarta, offering great summer kids-free deals along with deals for single parents. The Ritz-Carlton Golf & Spa Resort, Rose Hall, Jamaica offers a Jerk Center class every Saturday that is open to the entire family. This class focuses on the origins of ""Jerk,"" the ingredients used in making it and how to prepare it. The mega-resort Atlantis in the Bahamas has even built a Culinary Room for budding chefs, as part of its expansive new Kids Club, while Loews hotels in Miami Beach and Lake Las Vegas invite kids to Sushi Skool. There are plenty of options too at small hotels like The Coppertoppe Inn and Retreat Center in Hebron, N.H., or the Essex Resort & Spa in Vermont, which offers summer culinary camps for kids, as well as special private family classes. They're also pet friendly. (For more information on cooking classes at small inns, check out www.bedandbreakfast.com.) Trilling, meanwhile, herself the mom of two teens, couldn't have been more welcoming to the baby in our group, even providing a port-a-crib and a young local girl more than happy to play with him while his parents and grandparents cooked. She explained the day's recipes: Memelas, basic Oaxacan snacks that are small tortillas smeared with bean paste, cheese and various toppings; grilled Nopaeles Salad (Cactus with avocado, tomatoes, cilantro and more to put on palm-sized tortillas; Tortilla Soup; Green salad with pears and Roquefort; a savory chicken stew with capers and olives; rice flavored with Chepil, a pre-Hispanic herb; and the piece de resistance -- a Oaxacan chocolate pudding with a strawberry tangerine sauce. Soon the big kitchen was noisy as the 30 people chopped and stirred and kneaded and sipped Mexican beer. I spent a lot of time grinding spices with an old-fashioned mortar and pestle. ""This is right up my alley,"" says 22-year-old Tracy Gifford, a college senior from North Carolina, who opted for cooking school with her aunt and uncle while her parents, younger sister and cousin spent the day in Oaxaca. Some work harder on their dishes than others. Some wander outside to the Comal; others to the garden. Thankfully, Trilling's staff whisks away the dirty pans, bowls and measuring spoons. When everything is ready, they invite us to the big wooden tables and serve us our creations course by course. We applaud after each one. We're proud of ourselves and eat until we can't manage another bite. Trilling presents us with the Mexican wooden tool called a Molinillo that's used to stir and froth the famous Oaxacan chocolate. She gives us some chocolate too. I leave clutching my recipes, my chocolate and my new mortar and pestle. I use it all the time -- and smile.

"(CNN) -- Former Masters winner Raymond Floyd has decided not to compete in this year's event, the first time the 67-year-old will not be playing at Augusta National since he made his debut in 1965. Floyd, who won the tournament in 1976 and lost a play-off to Nick Faldo in 1990, has also decided not to do a lap of honor, unlike both Gary Player and Fuzzy Zoeller who both made their final appearances last year. The American has not made the halfway cut since 1999 and recent surgery on a back problem also helped make his decision. ""Last year was my last Masters. I'm not competing this year,"" Floyd told reporters. ""It was something I toyed with pretty much all year as to whether I would play or not. I just feel that I've had so many fond, special memories here and I didn't feel like I embarrassed myself out there. ""I'm not competitive now and I didn't want to go out and embarrass myself. I have a good feeling that I've made the right decision."" Floyd's 1976 victory tied the then record score of 271 set by Jack Nicklaus in 1965. His 65 was the best start of any champion, his 131 set a record for the first 36 holes and 201 for the first 54 holes.","Former Masters champion Raymond Floyd has opted out of playing this year .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday announced additional, private funding for cash-strapped community colleges in an effort to bridge the growing degree gap between the United States and other nations. At the first-ever White House Summit on Community Colleges, Obama said the the United States' decade-long decline from first to ninth in the world in the percentage of young people holding college degrees ""not only represents a huge waste of potential; in the global marketplace it represents a threat to our position as the world's leading economy."" The aim of the summit is to explore ways to reach Obama's goal of an additional 5 million community college degrees by 2020, and to discuss community colleges' role in developing the U.S. work force, according to the White House. Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, is host of the summit. She has a doctorate and is a full-time English professor at a community college. One private funding initiative comes from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which plans to invest $34.8 million over the next five years for a program called Completion by Design. The money will come in the form of grants to groups of community colleges that come up with new ways to make the college experience more responsive to the needs of today's students, according to a statement on the foundation's website. ""Most students today who are pursuing an education beyond high school are also balancing the demands of work and family,"" Melinda Gates said in the statement, ""yet colleges haven't adapted to this new reality."" Also announced was the creation of the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence, a $1 million award for community colleges that have outstanding academic and work force outcomes. Attending the summit are some 150 people, including community college leaders, students, philanthropists and businesspeople, as well as state and federal policy leaders. Community colleges across the United States have seen enrollment figures jump by 24 percent over the past few years, as unemployed workers look to retrain at those institutions, which offer lower tuition compared to their four-year counterparts. But the recession has forced some of those colleges to cut back on course offerings and put limits on enrollment. Recent figures from the Department of Education show that only about 30 percent of students who begin a two-year associates degree program actually finish up in three years. The need for more educated workers was highlighted in a recent study by the Center for Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University.  The study projects that by the year 2018, the United States will need around 22 million workers with new post-secondary degrees, associate degrees or better. The actual number of such workers is expected to fall short by about 3 million. The community colleges summit also includes a session on the Skills for America's Future initiative, the launching of which the president announced Monday at a meeting with his Economic Recovery Advisory Board. The initiative will make available more than $2 billion in competitive funds to community colleges over the next four years, the White House said in a statement. Examples of programs in the new initiative include Pacific Gas and Electric's work with community colleges to develop courses and training for energy jobs, professional literacy courses provided by McDonald's for managers across the country, and a pilot job training program in seven cities by Gap Inc., the statement said. A White House statement said the initiative is based on the same concept as the Educate to Innovate campaign, in which corporations develop specific programs to boost the performance of U.S. students in math, science, technology and engineering. Obama said a Skills for America's Future task force will coordinate federal efforts with corporate partners in the initiative. ""The goal is to ensure there are strong partnerships between growing industries and community college or training programs in every state in the country,"" Obama said in remarks at the White House Monday. CNN Senior Producer Sally Holland and CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Decline in U.S. college degrees is ""a huge waste"" and a ""threat,"" Obama says .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a missing 7-year-old Oregon boy pleaded for her son's safe return Tuesday, imploring him to ""never give up hope."" ""Our goals are to expand the search for Kyron and to bring him home as quickly as possible,"" said Desiree Young, the mother of missing Kyron Horman, who was last seen June 4. Young, standing alongside Kyron's father, Kaine Horman, gave the statement during a press conference intended to provide an update on the investigation. However, few details were given by Multnomah County Sheriff's Office authorities, who declined to elaborate on what they called ""significant progress"" in the case. ""Authorities remain determined to reach a successful solution,"" Capt. Monte Reiser said. ""We believe that Kyron's disappearance involved criminal behavior because his parents have been deprived of their son for 53 days,"" he added. Young expressed confidence in the investigation saying it ""continues to be on track and is progressing toward finding Kyron."" She concluded her statement by speaking directly to her son. ""We love you Kyron,"" she said, her voice breaking with emotion. ""Never give up hope. We are all coming to get you to bring you home."" Neither authorities nor Young took questions from reporters. Meanwhile, Multnomah County Chief Deputy Tim Moore announced that a $25,000 reward for information leading to Kyron has been increased to $50,000, courtesy of an anonymous donor. Police have not named a suspect in the case, but intense scrutiny has been placed on Kyron's stepmother, Terri Horman. Terri Horman told investigators that she last saw Kyron the morning of June 4 as he walked down the hall toward his second-grade classroom at Skyline Elementary School. On Monday, a woman who has been in close contact with Terri Horman was subpoenaed to meet with the grand jury investigating the disappearance. DeDe Spicher is a friend of Terri Horman's who stayed with her after Kaine Horman filed for divorce shortly after his son's disappearance and moved out of the family home. In divorce filings, Kaine Horman has said he believes that Terri Horman ""is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron."" Court documents also allege that Terri Horman hired a man to kill her husband. Spicher appeared before an investigative grand jury in Portland on Monday, according to her attorney, Chad Stavley. Stavley, who told HLN that he was retained Friday, said Spicher was not asked any questions by the prosecutor but was ordered to return at a future date. A statement released Friday by Kaine Horman and Young described Spicher as someone who ""has been in close communication with Terri [and] has been providing Terri with support and advice that is not in the best interests of our son."" The statement also described Spicher as uncooperative in the investigation and ""going as far as to suggest to others that may have information regarding Kyron's disappearance not to cooperate as well."" Stavley disputed those comments Monday, saying Spicher has been ""extremely cooperative"" with police as they executed search warrants on her home and car. He said she also met with the lead investigator in the case last week for more than three hours. He added that Spicher is not speaking to Terri Horman. The Oregonian reported that detectives have asked Spicher about her whereabouts June 4. According to the newspaper, Spicher was doing gardening work for a Portland homeowner when she ""abruptly left about 11:30 a.m."" The homeowner tried reaching Spicher on her cell phone, the newspaper reported, but got no answer. Spicher returned to the house about 90 minutes later, the newspaper reported, citing detectives. Stavley declined to comment Monday on what Spicher was doing during those 90 minutes. HLN's Natisha Lance and CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","""Never give up hope,"" mother tells missing son .

"Washington (CNN)  -- As you turn on your HDTV and watch the endless controversy over embryonic stem cell research, ask yourself: Should the government spend taxpayer dollars to develop that bulky old cathode-ray television you once owned? As you install your $79 Blu-ray player, what if Uncle Sam was paying millions to develop Betamax videotapes? This kind of government waste is what embryonic stem cell researchers are demanding even when science itself, according to scientists such as former NIH Director Bernadine Healy, has made embryonic stem cell research obsolete. Yet the Obama Justice Department is appealing a recent federal court ruling that stopped funding of embryonic stem cell research because it was contrary to Congress' 1995 law that decided to spend tax dollars on projects that produce treatments instead of destroyed embryos. This is a far-from-baseless ethical concern, as it is tied to the fact that an embryo is a genetically distinct human being from the moment of conception. In denying the administration's request for a stay, the court rightly found, ""Defendants are incorrect about much of their 'parade of horribles' that will supposedly result from this court's preliminary injunction. Congress has mandated that the public interest is served by preventing taxpayer funding of research that entails the destruction of human embryos."" Nonetheless, upon being given a short temporary stay by the appeals court while it receives briefs in the case, the National Institutes of Health immediately began spending American taxpayer dollars like a drunken sailor on 24-hour shore leave. Another view: Court ruling a blow to U.S. science . Human embryonic stem cell research is the $10,000 toilet seat of the 21st century. Years ago, science created a cell that appears to be, in the words of an MIT study published last month, ""virtually identical"" to an embryonic stem cell but is cheaper, promises better compatibility to patients and kills no embryos. These new induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) ""do all the things embryonic stem cells do,"" explains the father of human embryonic stem cells James Thomson. Harvard's David Scadden agrees that iPSC technology ""is absolutely changing the field."" IPSCs ""perhaps even eliminate the need for human embryos as a source of stem cells,"" says Keisuke Kaji of the University of Edinburgh. IPSCs even caused the man who cloned Dolly the sheep to abandon cloning three years ago because ""changing cells from a patient directly into stem cells has got so much more potential."" ""The world has changed,"" Thomson told The Boston Globe in 2007. ""Human embryo stem cell research will be abandoned by more and more labs."" But not by people who put politics over science. For some, ""virtually identical"" is just not enough. Although all researchers agree or admit iPSCs are a promising development worthy of ongoing research, embryonic stem cell research advocates still want to take millions of taxpayer dollars away from that more promising research to fuel their less promising research. With the help of Washington politicians, they're holding taxpayer dollars hostage to the tune of $300 million spent and pledged in just over a year. Perhaps that's one reason why, during these times of intense economic strain, a new Rasmussen poll shows that only 33 percent of U.S. voters believe that taxpayer money should be spent on embryonic stem cell research. Talking heads promote embryonic cells by alleging a ""potential"" for cures, but money is much better spent on iPSCs. Stem cell research that destroys human embryos is also taking money away from successful adult stem cell work, in which no embryos are destroyed. Found in people already born, adult stem cells are the only cells with a track record of actually and successfully treating patients. Adult stem cells have grown new corneas and tracheas, restoring sight and speech. Adult stem cells placed into children have repaired damage from fatal genetic skin diseases. As CBS News reported on August 2, adult stem cells appear to have the ability to stimulate tissue repair and to suppress the immune system. ""That gives adult stem cells really a very interesting and potent quality that embryonic stem cells don't have,"" said Rocky Tuan, director of a cellular engineering institute at the University of Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, embryonic stem cell researchers have produced no treatments at all. Their own technology dates back to the Stone Age in today's pace of science, whereas this year's prestigious Balzan Prize for biology recently went to iPSC pioneer Shinya Yamanaka. So, like many failed industries, embryo researchers demand a taxpayer bailout. They claim that they're too big to fail, when in fact they've never succeeded. NIH Director Francis Collins melodramatically announced that the district court's injunction against his funding of embryonic stem cell research, in spite of the 1995 law against such funding, ""poured sand into the engine of discovery."" The problem is that Collins is wasting taxpayer money on ""discovering"" the equivalent of the riverboat steam engine. Advocates for embryo-destructive research respond that the government should fund all research -- if any money is left over after they get theirs. But American taxpayers are not a bottomless grab-bag of cash. They should not be forced to waste precious dollars on partisan science, especially when economic ruin fueled by government waste is a looming specter. Embryonic stem cell research should go into the dinosaur museum where it belongs. Any funding should be focused on the real, clean promise of iPSCs and on the miracles that are being produced today by adult stem cell treatments. Embryo destruction has sidetracked good stem cell research long enough. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Matt Bowman.","Bowman: iPSC cell is similar to embryonic stem cell but cheaper, kills no embryos .

"(CNN) -- Ernie Els survived some nervy moments to secure his second successive Arnold Palmer Invitational title in Orlando on Monday. The South African's charge for the trophy was halted by bad weather on Sunday night, forcing play to be abandoned when he was leading by two shots with four holes left. Els recorded four pars to end his round on a total of 277 (-11) but had to rely on his powers of recovery to avoid dropping shots on the sodden course. He sank an important putt on 15 to save his par before putting his drive on the following hole into the trees. He regained control to prevent dropping a shot before chipping out of a difficult lie on 17 to make another par. American Kevin Na cut Els' lead to just one stroke on the 16th hole but his hopes ended when he left his par putt short on 18. ""It was a tough finish for me,"" Els told reporters. ""I've been thinking about these last four holes for 22 hours so it was nice to finally get on the golf course. ""I kind of limped home but the work I have put in has started paying off, and obviously my short game is good. I got it up and down the last two holes.""

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- We thought that since you were feeling absolutely dejected watching BP's underwater gusher spoiling the ecology and economy of the Gulf of Mexico, well, we would try to cheer you up by reminding you how the otherwise environmentally conscious Canadians are degrading their own natural splendor and national soul with oil spillage and seepage on purpose. Bitumen -- A.K.A. tar sand -- is barely oil. It's oil-soaked dirt, but in a world that is constantly scraping the bottom of the fossil fuel barrel, tar sand is oil enough to warrant a mad frenzy to extract. And that's exactly what is happening in the Canadian northwest. Northern Alberta is rich -- very rich -- in bitumen. Fort McMurray is the small town at the epicenter of a boom in tar sand extraction, and it's a messy, ecologically unsound adventure. Traditionally, the only way to get oil from the dirt has been to cook it. So, every day, massive excavators rip apart the Boreal forest (also known as the lungs of Canada) to get at the soggy oil sand below, and then millions of gallons of pristine Athabascan water are intentionally spoiled in order to boil the oil out of the dirt (or is it the dirt out of the oil?). It's a very messy, destructive process, which has contaminated rivers and lakes for miles in every direction. See the rest of ""Toxic: Alberta"" at VBS.TV . There is a newer method of extraction, called SAGD, in which steam is injected deep underground, cooking the oil out of the dirt and then siphoning the oil out of the boiling mess. We spent two weeks in and around Fort McMurray, A.K.A. Fort McMoney, documenting what the recent boom has done to the fragile ecology and the local economy. It's a classic boom town, with classic boom town problems: expensive housing, high food prices, overcrowding, traffic and congestion, and charming little additions like alcoholism, cocaine and meth addiction, and prostitution. What we learned is that we desperately need a clean energy policy. The Alberta tar sands must be the dirtiest ""last chapter"" of our century-long fascination with oil. We shouldn't want to live in a world which tolerates boiling dirt for every last drop of tar.","Canadian northwest rich in what is essentially oil-soaked dirt .

"(CNN) -- Fred Couples led a crowded field after the opening round of the Masters, but all eyes were on Tiger Woods, who trailed by just two strokes. Woods finished Thursday 4-under par, his best opening round score at the Masters, according to the Press Association. The 50-year-old Couples sat atop a crowded and veteran field; 11 players were within two strokes of each other at the top, including 60-year-old Tom Watson, who was just a stroke behind Couples. But almost all attention was cast on world No. 1 Woods, who returned to the game after taking a break last November, when revelations of extramarital affairs were made public. He spent 45 days at a rehabilitation center for what the golfer called ""personal"" issues before announcing he was ending his self-enforced exile from the game ahead of the year's opening major tournament. Woods was welcomed on to the first tee by a crowd of thousands and was greeted with cheers, and a few jeers, as his name was announced. He showed few signs of nerves as he thumped his drive 300 yards down the middle of the fairway to signal his return to golf. Woods made a solid start, making par on the first two holes, before a birdie at the third. He dropped a shot at seven before an eagle on eight moved him to -2. He shot a 33 on the front nine and a 35 on the back nine, according to the Masters Web site. How did he assess his return? ""It meant I'm two shots off the lead,"" Woods said in reports from the Press Association. ""I'm here to play golf."" Joining Watson one shot off the lead on Thursday was Phil Mickelson, Lee Westwood, KJ Choi and YE Yang. Joining Woods at 4-under was Anthony Kim, Ian Poulter, Nick Watney and Rickey Barnes.","Tiger Woods two strokes off lead after first round at Masters .

"(CNN) -- A former CIA officer already serving a 23-year sentence for spying for the Russians is facing more time in prison after pleading guilty to continuing his espionage activities from behind bars. Harold James ""Jim"" Nicholson, 59, changed his plea to guilty Monday at a federal court hearing in Portland, Oregon, the Justice Department said in a statement. Nicholson pleaded guilty in 1997 to spying for Russia and is the highest-ranking CIA officer ever to be sentenced for espionage. While serving his prison sentence in Oregon, prosecutors allege, Nicholson restarted his career as a double agent and enlisted his son Nathan in his efforts to collect money owed to him by the Russian spy services and to sell more secrets. Both father and son were charged in January 2009 with acting as agents of a foreign government, money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Under terms of Nicholson's plea agreement, prosecutors will ask that Nicholson be sentenced to eight years in prison, to be served consecutively to his current sentence, authorities said. Sentencing is scheduled for January 18. According to an indictment, Nicholson passed his son notes in prison and instructed him how to reinitiate contact with his old spymasters. Nicholson admitted providing his son with information meant for Russia, prosecutors said Monday. Nathan Nicholson made trips to California, Mexico, Peru and Cyprus, where he met with Russian government representatives who gave him payments totaling more than $35,000 in cash, according to the indictment. At his father's request, Nathan Nicholson allegedly shared the money with his sister and grandparents. Nathan Nicholson had complained to his father that he and his sister were short of money to pay for college, prosecutors said. Jim Nicholson told his son that his alleged spying activities ""were 'risky' but not 'illegal,' "" the indictment said. ""Harold Nicholson has admitted not only betraying his country -- again -- but also betraying his family by involving his son Nathaniel in his corrupt scheme to get more money for his past espionage activities,"" Dwight C. Holton, U.S. attorney for Oregon, said in the statement. An attorney for Jim Nicholson did not return CNN's calls Friday. According to court testimony, Nathan Nicholson, who is a former U.S. Army paratrooper, initially told authorities that he had traveled overseas to visit ""a battle buddy."" FBI agents informed Nicholson that lying to them was a federal crime and offered him a ""mulligan,"" or a chance to change his story, according to an agent's testimony. At that point, FBI Special Agent John Cooney testified, Nicholson became more ""forthcoming"" about his meetings with Russians. Nathan Nicholson pleaded guilty to his role in the intrigue last year but has not been sentenced. He was expected to have testified against his father at trial. Prosecutors claimed some of the intelligence Nicholson was selling to the Russians was information on how he was captured. But Nicholson's defense team countered that the Russians were already provided that information by Robert Hanssen, the FBI special agent convicted in 2001 of also spying for the Russians. Nicholson's defense team was seeking access to government debriefings of Hanssen following his arrest. In court filings, the elder Nicholson appeared ready to fight the new charges and threatened to use his knowledge of the inner workings of U.S. intelligence against the government. ""At my trial, I will possibly have to give some insight in my defense that could make things get a bit hot in D.C.,"" Nicholson wrote to his daughter in a September 2010 letter that is part of the court record. ""Some organizations may get burned,"" he wrote. ""I don't understand why they would want to bring that upon themselves just to exact petty vengeance on me.""

"URUMQI, China (CNN) -- Chinese police had detained at least 1,434 people by Tuesday morning following weekend demonstrations by ethnic Uyghur residents in Xinjiang province, Xinhua reported, citing government officials, as protests spread to more cities. Chinese riot police patrol a street in Urumqi in Xinjiang province on July 6. Streets had reverted to calm and curfews were in force in major districts of Urumqi as the death toll mounted from rioting. Police halted people who had gathered in nearby Yili Kazak Prefecture and Aksu City and dispersed more than 200 people who had tried to gather in nearby Kashgar at the Id Kah Mosque, the largest mosque in China, the news agency said. Along the road into Kashgar from the airport, many areas were deserted; residents said police had set up blockades in some areas and were rerouting traffic. The regional public security department put the toll from riots at 156 deaths and more than 800 injuries, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency.  Watch more on violence in Xinjiang » . That was an increase from the 140 deaths reported at noon Monday. ""Among the 16 newly reported dead, some died in hospitals and others were recovered from street corners, the police said,"" according to Xinhua. With a massive presence of soldiers and anti-riot squads, the government said Tuesday, the unrest in this capital of China's far-west Xinjiang region had been brought under control.  See a map of Xinjiang » . In a rare public display of dissatisfaction, thousands of Uyghurs -- many of whom feel they are treated as second-class citizens and complain of being discriminated against by the majority Han Chinese -- took to the streets Sunday chanting and screaming, which prompted a police lockdown of the city. ""Traffic control was partially lifted Monday morning in parts of Urumqi ... but tension still exists in the city,"" Xinhua said. ""Debris has been cleared from the roads and normal traffic has resumed. Workers are still pulling away damaged vehicles from the worst-affected roads in the city.""  Watch victims describe the riots in Urumqi » . Most businesses in the area where the violence took place remained closed Monday, Xinhua said. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video, commentary . State-run media reported that protesters attacked passersby, burned public buses and blocked traffic Sunday. The report did not say how many people took part in the protest or what their grievances were. But a witness in Urumqi told CNN that soon after the protest started about 5 p.m., hundreds of protesters ""grew into easily over 1,000 -- men, women and children, all ethnic Uyghurs -- screaming and chanting."" Police arrived quickly and tried to control the swelling crowd by erecting barriers in the street, but ""people pushed them over,"" the witness said. ""They were throwing rocks at passing cars and buses."" As the violence escalated, hundreds of riot police arrived, the witness said. ""They used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse the crowd. I saw fire trucks, ambulances, armed personnel carriers and what looked like tanks. I heard random gunshots."" Late Sunday, the witness said, Urumqi was in a lockdown, with hundreds of People's Liberation Army soldiers in the streets. He reported seeing riot police chasing protesters into alleys and rounding up many of them. The witness speculated that the protest, which took place in the predominantly Uyghur-populated Bazaar district, may have been a reaction to racial violence in southern China. The violence reportedly happened at a toy factory in Guangdong province, where many migrants, including Uyghurs, have moved in search of work. A massive brawl reportedly broke out between workers of Uyghur and Han nationalities. Two Uyghurs reportedly died. Xinjiang is home to many Uyghurs. China's constitution guarantees ethnic minorities equal rights and limited autonomy. However, ethnic tensions run deep. Minority groups such as the Uyghurs complain that they are subjected to discrimination by the majority Han nationality. The World Uyghur Congress, a dissident Uyghur group based in Munich, Germany, condemned the crackdown on what it described in a written statement as Sunday's ""peaceful protest"" by Uyghurs. ""The Chinese authorities should acknowledge that the peaceful protest was sparked by the unlawful mob beating and killing of Uyghur workers at a Guangdong toy factory more than a week ago,"" it said. ""The authorities should also acknowledge that their failure to take any meaningful action to punish the Chinese mob for the brutal murder of Uyghurs is the real cause of this protest."" It accused Chinese authorities of having ""used tear gas, automatic rifles and armored vehicles to disperse the Uyghur protesters. During the crackdown, some were shot to death, and some were beaten to death by Chinese police. Some demonstrators were even crushed by armored vehicles near Xinjiang University, according to eyewitnesses."" The government in Xinjiang blamed ""foreign forces"" for Sunday's rioting. ""The violence is premeditated, organized violent crime,"" said Nur Bekri, chairman of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the equivalent of a governor. ""It was instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country."" Bekri accused the World Uyghur Congress of spreading rumors and inciting anger that led to the rioting, in a speech carried by Xinjiang television. The World Uyghur Congress denied the charge. It is led by Rebuya Kadeer, a businesswoman of Uyghur ethnicity who was detained in 1999 and accused of harming China's national security. She was freed on bail in 2005 and was allowed to leave for the United States for medical care. Bekri accused Kadeer of instigating the unrest via the Internet and said the fight at the Guangdong toy factory was exploited to incite ethnic strife. ""We should bear in mind that stability is to the greatest interest of all people in China, including the 21 million-plus people from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang,"" he said.","NEW: Chinese police detain at least 1,434 suspects .

"(RollingStone.com) -- When assessing the lowest moments of George W. Bush's presidency, outside observers might have gone with, oh, Abu Ghraib, or that time when he realized he was going to have to bail out the US financial system, or when his approval rating dropped to 22 percent on his way out the door. But in his new memoir, ""Decision Points,"" George W. Bush himself writes that the ""worst moment"" of his presidency -- his ""all-time low"" -- was when Kanye West declared during a Hurricane Katrina celebrity telethon that ""George Bush does not like black people."" Now West has responded to that verdict. On the one hand, he seems uncertain his line deserves the place in history that Bush has just given him. But he also sees where Bush is coming from. The whole back-and-forth started when Bush's claim drew the attention of Matt Lauer, who sat down with Bush for an interview that will air the day before the book's November 9 debut. And that in turn led to the following exchange, as relayed by Ken Tucker on EW.com: . Lauer quotes from Bush's new book: ""Five years later I can barely write those words without feeling disgust."" Lauer adds, ""You go on: 'I faced a lot of criticism as president. I didn't like hearing people claim that I lied about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction or cut taxes to benefit the rich. But the suggestion that I was racist because of the response to Katrina represented an all-time low.' President Bush responds: ""Yeah. I still feel that way as you read those words. I felt 'em when I heard 'em, felt 'em when I wrote 'em, and I felt 'em when I'm listening to 'em. Lauer: ""You say you told Laura at the time it was the worst moment of your presidency?"" Bush: ""Yes. My record was strong, I felt, when it came to race relations and giving people a chance. And it was a disgusting moment."" Lauer: ""I wonder if some people are going to read that, now that you've written it, and they might give you some heat for that. And the reason is this  "" Bush [interrupting]: ""Don't care."" Lauer: ""Well, here's the reason. You're not saying that the worst moment in your presidency was watching the misery in Louisiana. You're saying it was when someone insulted you because of that."" Bush: ""No, and I also make it clear that the misery in Louisiana affected me deeply as well. There's a lot of tough moments in the book. And it was a disgusting moment, pure and simple."" For his part, West does not view his diss of then-president as the worst insult he's ever dealt, ranking it below his more gratuitous put down of Taylor Swift at last year's VMAs. During an appearance on Funkmaster Flex's show on New York's Hot 97 on Tuesday night, he said of the Swift incident, ""It's an amazing, compelling situation. The situation is bigger to me than the Bush moment. It's bigger than a lot of things."" But in a separate interview today -- this one with Houston's 97.9 The Box -- West expressed a sympathetic view of Bush's reaction.""Well I definitely can understand the way he feels to be accused of being a racist in any way. Because the same thing happened to me,"" West told host Devi Dev. ""With both situations, it was strictly a lack of compassion that America saw. You know, with him not rushing, not taking the time to rush down to New Orleans. With me, it was the lack of compassion in cutting someone off in their moment. Nonetheless, I think we're all quick to pull a race card in America. And now I'm more open, and the poetic justice that I went through the same thing that he went through, and now I really more connect with him on a humanitarian level, because that next morning, when he felt that, I felt that same thing too."" Like Bush, West is coming out of self-imposed exile to mount a comeback effort, with his built around the release of his next album, ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,"" slated for release on November 22. ""I do think I changed a lot"" in the months since the Swift incident, he told Dev. ""I do think I'm more compassionate, I'm more sensitive to people's emotions. ""I needed that time off ... Respect is something hard to earn and easy to lose, and I feel like I'm on that path to getting that all back right now."" Bush, no doubt, would like to feel the same way, though it's not clear he sees it necessary to express the same kind of contrition.

"MANAMA, Bahrain (CNN) -- Suryavathi Rao entered her 40th year in what can be called no man's land. A protestor locked in a suitcase reading ""Stop Human Trafficking"" in Germany last year. A domestic worker from India, she arrived at a shelter in the Gulf state of Bahrain one morning with only a nightgown, slippers, and a prayer for a better life. ""I had to leave because it was getting too difficult for me,"" she said. ""I have not brought any clothes, I have not brought personal belongings, all I brought with me is a Bible."" Rao says her employer -- a family with eight children who sponsored her journey here -- did not pay her the monthly salary of just over $100 for six months. Having fled her employer's home, she is now considered an illegal resident on the island. Marietta Dias, who runs the Migrant Workers Society, says the mind-set regarding immigrant workers here has got to change. Some employers treat their help as ""not a person but a machine (that) starts in the morning: Put on a switch (and) work consistently right through the day. Take care of the children, washing, cleaning, cooking, right down to cleaning (the) car."" The exploitation of workers is a huge business worldwide. People forced to work without pay collectively lose more than $20 billion a year in earnings, according to a report from the United Nations International Labour Organization released Tuesday. Global profits from human trafficking and forced labor have reached $36 billion, according to the United Nations, and that sum is climbing. ""Forced labor is the antithesis of decent work,"" ILO Director-General Juan Somavia said in a statement as the report became public. ""It causes untold human suffering and steals from its victims."" ""It is the vulnerable who suffer the most"" in times of economic crisis like the present, the report says. It took years for governments to acknowledge the problem. Now the biggest challenges, officials say, are the implementation and enforcement of laws. ""Eighty percent of forced labor is in the private economy, but this is very, very rarely been prosecuted, if at all in most countries,"" said Roger Plant, one of the authors of the ILO report. Part of the problem is that the law is often hazy. ""There's a whole lot of gray areas where intermediate agents, sub-brokers, are taking advantage of loopholes in the law in order to extract large amounts of money from vulnerable people, uninformed (people) who are going off to work in a country where they don't speak the language,"" Plant said. But for him, the bottom line is clear. ""There is some absolutely flagrant forced labor where the offenders must be put behind bars. Forced labor is a serious criminal offense and must be treated as such,"" he said. Labor markets need a regulatory overhaul like the one financial markets are now facing, he argued. ""Because labor markets are too deregulated there are too many options for people to act in an unethical way,"" he said. ""After the havoc in the financial markets, people are realizing they need some monitoring, licensing, regulation. You've got to do the same on the labor markets,"" he said. The ILO tried to set standards for private agencies that place workers, he said. ""But we're finding is that there is a number of totally unknown, unlicensed and unregulated labor workers at the bottom end of the market, and there is broker after broker, intermediate after intermediate getting cash -- getting some money from the worker,"" he said. ""Usually it is in the very much down the bottom in the informal sector, in the developing countries, but we are finding that sometimes this is pervading even larger recruitment agencies."" Bahrain, where Suryavathi Rao fled her employer, is considered a reformer on labor issues. The Gulf state has introduced the Labour Market Regulatory Authority to register and track workers of all types. ""People were not familiar with the definition of human trafficking and most of the time they weren't accepting that is phenomena is actually here in our region,"" Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa of the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. A top priority is to reduce the role of middlemen who take sizable fees -- sometimes a year's salary plus interest, he said. But worldwide, prosecutions are comparatively rare, said Antonio Maria Costa, under secretary-general of the United Nations. ""Only a few thousand people were criminalized in the underworld in the past 2-3 years -- a fraction of the criminals who actually prey upon victims."" The average, according to labor officials, is one prosecution for every 800 cases -- a rate that keeps workers like Suryavathi Rao, and millions more, vulnerable to exploitation.","Global profits from human trafficking, forced labor reach $36 billion, U.N. says .

"(CNN) -- Flavio Briatore is free to return to Formula One in 2013 after reaching an out of court settlement with the sport's governing body, FIA. Briatore, former team principal at Renault, was originally banned for life by the FIA after allegations he was involved in a conspiracy in which Nelson Piquet Jnr deliberately crashed at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix in order to help team-mate Fernando Alonso win. In January, Briatore succeeded in getting his ban overturned in a French court, saying the ruling had restored his ""dignity and freedom."" The court also overturned the lifetime ban imposed on former Renault engineering director Pat Symonds for the same incident. But the FIA launched an appeal against the decision, before an announcement that they had settled their case with Briatore out of court. Briatore agreed to recognize ""his share of responsibility for the deliberate crash,"" according to FIA but insisted he accepted no personal guilt for the incident. An FIA statement read: ""After discussions between their lawyers and those of the FIA, Mr Flavio Briatore and Mr Pat Symonds have each made a settlement offer to the FIA President with a view to putting an immediate end to the legal proceedings. ""Each of them recognizing his share of responsibility for the deliberate crash involving the driver Nelson Piquet Junior at the 2008 Grand Prix of Singapore, as ""Team Principal"" of Renault F1 where Mr Flavio Briatore is concerned, they have expressed their regrets and presented their apologies to the FIA. ""They have undertaken to abstain from having any operational role in Formula One until 31 December 2012, as well as in all the other competitions registered on the FIA calendars until the end of the 2011 sporting season. ""They have also abandoned all publicity and financial measures resulting from the judgment of 5 January 2010, as well as any further action against the FIA on the subject of this affair. ""The FIA President has considered that it is in the best interests of the FIA not to allow the perpetuation of these legal disputes, which have received a great deal of media coverage and which, regardless of the outcome, are very prejudicial to the image of the FIA and of motor sport, and thus to accept this settlement solution, thereby putting an end to this affair."" The Singapore incident came to light after Piquet Jr. was sacked and then went public with his admission of involvement. Briatore issued his own statement to the official Formula One Web site stating that he recognized his share of responsibility ""without any admission of a personal guilt in these events and without any recognition of the fact that the decision of the World Council rendered against him would have been well-founded.""","Flavio Briatore free to return to Formula One in 2013 after settling legal case with FIA .

"(CNN) -- Zulqarnain Haider has touched down in London after going AWOL before Pakistan's series deciding one-day international with South Africa in Dubai. The wicketkeeper disappeared from the Pakistan team hotel on Monday morning and was pictured arriving at Heathrow airport later in the day. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed he had requested his passport on Sunday night and was then nowhere to be found the following morning. Reports claimed he had received threatening messages after he scored the winning runs to help Pakistan beat South Africa in the fourth ODI on November 5. He was later fined $140 for breaking a team curfew, along with teammates Shahzaib Hasan and Abdur Rehman. As the mystery of his whereabouts deepened, the PCB released a statement confirming Haider had gone missing. ""This morning Pakistan wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider left the team hotel without informing any member of the Pakistan team management,"" it read. ""Zulqarnain was in possession of his passport at the time he left the hotel which he had taken from Pakistan team management the previous evening for personal use.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The surprise announcement that the third son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il had been made a general has dashed hopes in South Korea that the junior Kim might prove more economically focused than his father, should he succeed him. The announcement by North Korean state media in advance of Tuesday's Korean Workers Party Conference -- the biggest ruling party meeting there in three decades -- that Kim Jong Un was being promoted to four-star general was the first-ever formal mention of his name in official state communications. While many pundits had anticipated Kim Jong Un being raised to prominence as the country's future leader in the high-profile party conference, most had also expected him to be less military-centric. ""I had been hearing a lot of talk that he would be more focused on economic matters than his father,"" said Brian Myers, author of ""The Cleanest Race"" and an expert on North Korean propaganda. He cited statements by recent defectors who had heard that the upcoming leader had been constructing apartments and accelerating productivity. ""The fact that he is being formally introduced as a general indicates that he will be another 'military first' ruler like his father."" Kim Jong Un rising in leadership circles . In what was then the first-ever handover of dynastic power in a communist state, Kim Jong Il took power in 1994 following the death of his father and ""eternal president"" Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Il adopted ""songeun,"" or ""military first"" as his key slogan, superceding his father's ""juch,"" or ""self-reliance."" What is life like inside North Korea? North Korea's military has 1.2 million service members and an arsenal that includes nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. It's considered particularly worrisome, not simply due to the regime's unpredictability and history of aggression -- it launched the devastating Korean War in 1950, and has unleashed a number of military and terrorist provocations in the decades since -- but also because any significant armed clash affecting the heavyweight economies of China, Japan and South Korea would hammer global financial markets. CNN's special coverage of North Korea . Following a suspected stroke in the summer of 2008, Kim Jong Il has appeared to be in frail health, fuelling heated speculation in South Korea and elsewhere about when he will name his successor, and who it will be. Since early 2009, a range of signs has pointed at Kim Jong Un as that man. With the youthful Kim being either 27 or 28 years old, experts expect him to require a mentor to guide him along the path to power in a society in which age is greatly respected. Kim Jong Il's brother-in-law, Jang Song-thaek, widely seen as his right-hand man since 2009, is expected to act as regent to the young Kim as he takes on increasing responsibilities. Opinion: Political change in the wind? Jang's wife, Kim Kyong Hui, was promoted to general in the same announcement that mentioned Kim Jong Un, a move seen as solidifying the power of herself, Jang, and thereby, the young Kim in what many now consider to be less a Stalinist state and more a royal dynasty. ""Kim Kyong Hui will be his 'caretaker' to nominate him if Kim Jong Il dies,"" said Ha Taekeung, president of Open Radio for North Korea, a Seoul-based non-governmental organization. He noted that for Kim Jong Un to formally assume power, he would need to be nominated chairman of the National Defense Committee and general secretary of the Workers Party of Korea. ""The principle of the bloodline means that only a direct descendant of Kim Il Sung can be part of the succession, and Jang is not a descendant of Kim Il Sung."" Also on Tuesday, the Korean Central News Agency stated that the party conference, ""... solemnly declared internally and externally that Kim Jong Il was reelected as general secretary of the Workers Party of Korea with the unanimous will and wishes of all the party members."" Although Kim has always held that title, he is usually referred to as chairman of the National Defense Committee. The re-designation at the start of the party conference could simply be a tactic to remind the public that Kim is party head as well as military head, said Myers. Vice guide to North Korea . While state media has been unusually active in announcing protocol details about the highest-placed members of North Korea's elite, no news footage has yet emerged of the conference, fuelling speculation in South Korea that its key figure, Kim Jong Il, may be suffering particularly frail health at present.","The announcement came right before the biggest ruling party meeting in decades .

"(CNN)  -- Fernando Torres rediscovered his scoring touch as Liverpool continued their revival under new owners with a 2-0 win over English Premier League leaders Chelsea at Anfield on Sunday. The Spanish star scored two magnificent first half goals to seal three points for Roy Hodgson's men. The first came after 11 minutes as he instantly controlled a Dirk Kuyt through ball before beating Petr Cech with a low shot. He doubled the advantage just before the interval as he cut inside before curling home a superb shot. Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti introduced striker Didier Drogba, who had an overnight illness, after the break and it sparked an improvement by his side after a lifeless first half. Home keeper Pepe Reina blocked a close range shot from Florent Malouda after a cross by Droga. Cech prevented his team from going three down when he stretched out a leg to deny Dirk Kuyt before Chelsea nearly cut the deficit only for Nicolas Anelka's strike to hit the crossbar. Jamie Carragher summed up the spirit in the Liverpool side as he made a last-ditch tackle to deny Drogba scoring from the rebound. The defeat leaves Chelsea just two points clear of Manchester United, who beat Wolves 2-1 on Saturday. Hodgson, who was under pressure before his side's improvement since New England Sports Ventures took control of the club, was delighted to see Torres back to his best. ""He is a vital player for us and would be any club. You can't have success if you don't have front players who do a good job for you,"" he told Sky Sports. Third-placed Arsenal were also beaten in Sunday's early game as they slid to a 1-0 home defeat to promoted Newcastle at the Emirates. Arsenal were hoping to regain second spot in the standings ahead of Manchester United, but a goal from in-form striker Andy Carroll just before halftime sealed victory for Chris Hughton's men. Carroll, who was watched by England manager Fabio Capello, rose high to head home a well-flighted free kick from Joey Barton past Lucasz Fabianski. It was the third straight win for improving Newcastle, who were rarely troubled by a labored Arsenal side. Cesc Fabregas rattled the crossbar with a first half free kick and Theo Walcott hit the woodwork after the break, but a miserable afternoon for the Gunners was complete when Laurent Koscielny was sent off in added time. He pulled back Nile Ranger as Newcastle broke upfield in a quick counter attack. In Sunday's other fixture, Manchester City ended a run of three straight defeats with a 2-0 win at West Bromwich Albion. Italian striker Mario Balotelli scored both City's goals in the first half, but blotted his copybook by being sent off after the break. He was shown red for kicking out at Youssuf Mulumbu minutes after being booked. Mulumbu was then sent off for a strong challenge on the returning Carlos Tevez, who had a hand in both goals. The win takes Roberto Mancini's men level on points with Arsenal as they stay in the Champions League places after 11 rounds.","Brilliant Fernando Torres double inspires Liverpool win over Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's Park Ji-Sung scored twice including an injury-time winner as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 on Saturday to cut Chelsea's lead at the top of the English Premier League to two points. It was a scarcely convincing performance from United at Old Trafford and the visitors looked to be heading to a deserved point until the South Korean international burst into their penalty area to beat Marcus Hahnemann with a convincing finish. Park had put United ahead in first half injury time only for Sylvan Ebanks-Blake to equalize for Wolves just after the hour mark with a neat turn and shot. The result leaves United with 23 points from 11 games, with leaders Chelsea on 25 from 10. The reigning champions can re-open a five-point gap with victory over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Third-placed Arsenal will join United on 23 points if they beat promoted Newcastle in another Sunday fixture at the Emirates Stadium. A sour note for Manchester United was the truncated return of England international midfielder Owen Hargreaves, the long-term injury absentee lasting just a few minutes in his first start for two years before he limped off with a hamstring strain. ""It was a long struggle,"" manager Alex Ferguson told MUTV. ""Given the changes I had to make, trying to get the continuity of performance was difficult. ""Some players played with touches of flu and others with diarrhoea, so we've done really well to get a result."" Earlier, Tottenham Hotspur suffered an hangover from their midweek Champions League triumph over Inter Milan as they went down 4-2 at Bolton in the lunchtime kick off. Two goals from Kevin Davies, who would have impressed watching England manager Fabio Capello, including a second half penalty, put them 3-0 up at the Reebok with Greta Steinsson crashing home the second. It was the cue for a belated Tottenham comeback as an Alan Hutton curler and superb volley from Roman Pavlyuchenko cut the deficit to a single goal, only for Martin Petrov to kill the game off in injury time. They move above Tottenham on goal difference into fifth place, with Sunderland, who beat Stoke City 2-0, also on 15 points. Meanwhile Fulham's Brete Hangeland headed a 94th-minute equalizer to salvage a 1-1 draw at home to Aston Villa, who are still searching for their first Premier League win since September. Marc Albrighton had put Villa ahead just before halftime. In the Scottish Premier League, Celtic have gone to the top with an amazing 9-0 thrashing of Aberdeen at Parkhead. Anthony Stokes and Gary Hooper both scored hat-tricks in the rout which sees Celtic move two points clear of Rangers in the title race.","Park Ji-Sung scores twice in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Wolves .

"Washington (CNN) -- A jury was seated Friday in the trial of a man charged with the 2001 murder of Chandra Levy. Prosecutors, defense attorneys and the judge picked 12 women and four men -- four of the 16 are alternates -- to serve on the panel. The trial is expected to start Monday. Levy's disappearance nine years ago received widespread publicity because of her relationship with a congressman. The revelation contributed to the political downfall of California Democrat Gary Condit, who now may be called to the witness stand. Police said Condit was never a suspect in the case, although he was questioned intensively as investigators tried to find Levy, who vanished at the end of her federal internship at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Blog: Retracing Chandra Levy's steps . The man accused of her murder, Ingmar Guandique, is a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha. Authorities believe that he attacked Levy, 24, as she jogged in a park, killing her when she began to scream. Her remains were found more than a year later in a wooded area of D.C.'s Rock Creek Park. Guandique was sentenced in 2002 for attacking two other women in the same park. Years later, officials say, he admitted to fellow inmates that he had killed Levy. Defense attorneys have questioned the police investigation and, this week, wondered about a second man named in a FBI fingerprint memo prosecutors had just disclosed to Guandique's counsel. In that memo, both Guandique and the other man were cleared of any match in fingerprints lifted from a vehicle parked near the crime scene. Guandique denies that he committed the crime, and there is no physical evidence linking him to it, leaving prosecutors to base their case largely on his alleged jailhouse admission that he killed the young intern. The judge in the case struck a number of potential jurors this week without further questioning. They provided unacceptable answers on a 55-question survey the pool filled out Monday. Others were called in to further explain certain responses that could affect their ability to render a fair verdict. The judge's instructions and opening presentations in the trial are expected to begin Monday.","The trial is expected to start Monday .

"(CNN) -- He has one eye, a thick beard streaked with henna and has lost a finger. He wears thick aviator-style dark glasses. At least we think so. There are very few photographs of 40-something Ilyas Kashmiri. But to counterterrorism officials on three continents, he is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Kashmiri is a veteran jihadist who in his early years fought the Indians in the disputed territory of Kashmir and the Russians in Afghanistan -- which is where he lost his eye. He famously escaped from an Indian jail and then fought with a unit of Pakistan's special forces. And he is ruthless. Ten years ago, Indian troops carried out a raid into Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Pakistani officials said 14 civilians, including several children, were slaughtered. The next day, Kashmiri led a retaliatory raid. He and his fighters kidnapped and beheaded an Indian army officer -- and later paraded his head through the bazaars of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. But then, Kashmiri fell out with his sponsors in the Pakistani military. At one point, he was arrested in connection with an attempt to assassinate Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, in 2003. For reasons unknown, Kashmiri was released a short time later. And that was where the trouble really started, when a local jihadist went viral, moving his base of operations from Pakistani Kashmir to North Waziristan. As commander of ""Brigade 313,"" part of Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami (Movement for an Islamic Holy War), Kashmiri formed a close relationship with al Qaeda in the wild frontier territory of Pakistan. Kashmiri's No. 1 enemy is still India. His group was thought responsible for the bombing of a bakery popular with foreigners in Pune in 2009. But there is plenty of evidence that he has ambitions beyond South Asia. David Coleman Headley, the U.S. citizen who confessed to helping scout targets for the Mumbai attack in November 2008, said after his arrest that he had twice met Kashmiri. During questioning by India's National Intelligence Agency, which was given access to him in Chicago, Illinois, in June,  Headley said he'd been taken to Pakistan's tribal territories to meet Kashmiri early in 2009. A copy of the interrogation obtained by CNN reveals that Kashmiri sent Headley on another trip to survey targets in India.  One place he said he videotaped was the bakery that was later attacked in Pune. He also said Kashmiri had encouraged him to attack the offices of the Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. According to the indictment of Headley, Kashmiri told him he could ""provide manpower, weaponry and funding for the Denmark operations."" Headley says Kashmiri gave him $1,500 and told him to ""concentrate on the Denmark attack at the earliest."" Headley travelled to England, Sweden and Denmark to refine his plans, before being arrested at Chicago's O'Hare International airport in October 2009 as he tried to leave for Pakistan. In a plea deal this year, Headley confessed to his involvement in both the Mumbai and Danish plots. Now intelligence sources on both sides of the Atlantic believe Kashmiri is trying to get teams into Europe that would launch coordinated Mumbai-style attacks in several cities.   In those attacks, gunmen raided several buildings, including hotels, simultaneously, leaving 164 people dead.  The British Home Secretary, Theresa May, said last week that police were receiving special training to handle such an attack. In a rare interview with Asia Times Online last year, Kashmiri boasted of those plans. The newspaper's Islamabad reporter, Syed Saleem Shahzad, says he was taken to a secret location in North Waziristan in October 2009 for the interview. Kashmiri apparently wanted to use the occasion to refute claims that he'd been killed in a drone strike near the town of Mir Ali the previous month. Shahzad describes meeting a tall, well-built man with a firm handshake. He asked him whether the world could expect more ""Mumbai-style"" attacks. ""That was nothing compared to what has already been planned for the future,"" Kashmiri replied. European intelligence officials are now anxious that ""the future"" may be imminent, with al Qaeda looking to use people with Western passports in attacks -- Europeans and North Africans, for example. There are plenty of foreign fighters in Pakistan's tribal regions -- as many as 10,000, according to a Pakistani military commander. One of those fighters, Ahmed Sidiqi, was detained in Kabul, Afghanistan, last July and interrogated by U.S. forces at the Bagram Airfield. According to European counterterrorism sources, Sidiqi said he had met Kashmiri, though there is no confirmation that he did. Another man alleged to have sought out Kashmiri is Chicago taxi driver Raja Lahrasib Khan, who travelled to Pakistan in 2008 and 2009. He was arrested this year in the United States and charged with attempting to provide support to al Qaeda. Court documents say Khan met Kashmiri, who had told him that he ""wanted to train operatives to conduct attacks in the United States."" The documents include a conversation Khan is alleged to have had with an unidentified conspirator about Kashmiri's relationship with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Khan told the unidentified conspirator that bin Laden gives orders to Kashmiri, and then Kashmiri transmits the orders to the mujahedeen. Khan has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Intelligence officials say that besides being an experienced operator, Kashmiri has also managed to navigate the often perilous waters of jihadist rivalries, attracting members of other Pakistani groups to his ""313 Brigade"" and retaining a measure of autonomy despite pledging allegiance to al Qaeda. That's probably in part because of his operational prowess. If bin Laden is al Qaeda's ""spiritual"" leader and Egyptian cleric Ayman al Zawahiri its philosopher, Kashmiri is the organization's military brain. As one U.S. official puts it, Kashmiri is ""the key ingredient in the bad stew of senior terrorists who are planning operations in the region and beyond.""","Few photographs exist of Ilyas Kashmiri .

"(CNN)  -- Pop heartthrob Justin Bieber may be the perfect Trojan horse for a meme. Teeny-bopper singers are usually viewed as empty vessels meant to fill the marketing needs of cynical record executives. But as a child growing famous in the digital-remix age, Biebz seems more than that: The 16-year-old is like a white screen on which our trends can be projected. For a case in point, listen to the enigmatic ""U Smile 800% Slower,"" which has become a sensation on the web. ""U Smile,"" the second single from Bieber's new album, was slowed down 800 percent and uploaded to the web by Nick Pittsinger, a 20-year-old aspiring music producer in Florida. The song's trippy atmospherics have attracted more than 1.6 million plays online. Assuming you don't have 35 minutes to spare -- remember, it's eight times as long as the original four-minute pop song -- ""U Smile 800% Slower"" turns the high-pitched bleats of the pubescent signer into primal howls and cries that seem to linger forever. Imagine the mating calls of killer whales being vibrated through a Roman cathedral. The song is reminiscent of late '90s work from Icelandic artists Sigur Ros and Bjork, as Bieber's voice is both heavily deconstructed and eerily intimate. Compare this with the original ""U Smile,"" which sounds much less memorable. However, there is a twist. MTV News suggests the Justin Bieber ""remix"" may not be a slowed-down version of ""U Smile,"" but an untitled song from the Milwaukee collective Photon Wave Orchestra's 2010 EP ""Echoes Across the Astral Wasteland."" That said, MTV isn't sure if Photon Wave Orchestra really even exists since the EP was released on April 1, 2010 -- April Fool's Day. The question is, does it really matter? Whether it's the latest malware or sexually ambiguous haircut, Justin Bieber's blank-slate pop image is the perfect selling tool for anything. ""U Smile 800% Slowed"" wouldn't have all those listeners without its connection -- real or not -- to Bieber fever. His album, ""My World 2.0,"" couldn't be more appropriately titled. The opinions expressed in this blog post are solely those of Damon Brown.","Remix of Justin Bieber's ""U Smile"" has more than 1.6 million plays on Soundcloud.com .

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Polls opened Sunday in Myanmar as the nation holds its first election in 20 years -- an electoral contest critics say is aimed at creating a facade of democracy. Riot police could be seen earlier on some streets in the city of Yangon, the former national capital that is also known as Rangoon. In the countryside, teams of election workers for the Union for Solidarity and Development (USD) had campaigned. The party is supported by the governing junta of mostly of ex-military members. ""These are our candidates for this region,"" a USD election worker told one resident. ""It is not important to put down the name of the party, but the people have to know our symbol and make their mark right here."" Because many citizens in rural areas know so little about the political process, election workers said they also had to show people how to vote. ""I am not just campaigning for our party,"" the election worker said. ""I am educating the people on how to vote. Many people don't know how to vote."" Their word is very influential -- especially in rural areas, where most people in the nation live. ""I don't know anything about the election,"" one woman said. ""If someone tells me what to vote, I will follow that guideline."" Opposition parties like the National Democratic Force (NDF) are complaining that a lack of money is keeping them from running and campaigning in most areas of the country. An NDF representative said the party will only contest in about 15 percent of constituencies. Several residents told CNN they did not expect any change as a result of the election. ""Nothing will change after the election,"" a farmer said. ""The government is not trying to convince us. We don't matter to them because we are poor."" Not that it seems to matter to him. ""I don't care who will be elected,"" he said. ""I don't know whom I will vote for because I have no knowledge of politics."" Government critics say the election is a sham. The country's ruling military junta has refused to allow international monitors to oversee the elections and recently overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. In October, the military regime rejected international monitoring of Sunday's elections. ""Since we have many experiences in election, we don't need experts on this issue,"" said Thein Soe, chairman of the election commission. ""And since we have all ambassadors who are representing their countries, we don't think we need to invite any special group to observe the election since all the ambassadors are here and can watch it on election day,"" he added. Leading democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has rejected voting in the elections, her lawyer said. The National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, announced in March that it would not participate. A new law forced the NLD to choose between honoring Suu Kyi as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections. ""Since NLD is not participating in this coming election, she doesn't want to vote,"" her lawyer Nyan Win said in October. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide election victory in 1990, but the military junta rejected the results. The regime recently passed a law that made Suu Kyi ineligible to run because of a court conviction. The Nobel laureate has called the law unjust. Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest. A Myanmar court convicted Suu Kyi in August 2009 for breaching the terms of her house arrest after American John Yettaw swam uninvited to her lakeside house in Yangon and briefly stayed there. In February, a court rejected her appeal for release. Suu Kyi's current house arrest is due to end in mid-November, but her lawyers are skeptical that the military junta will actually release her. Her supporters have said her latest conviction was a way to remove her from the election campaign.","Riot police were seen stationed in some urban areas .

"(CNN) -- Three children allegedly abducted from Southern California by their fathers, who are two brothers, were recovered in the Netherlands and the men arrested, the FBI said. Brothers John and George Silah were sought for abducting their three sons in July 2008 from their homes in Los Angeles, California, according to the FBI. John Silah allegedly kidnapped his son Greg, now 12, and George Silah is accused of kidnapping his sons Alexander, now 14, and Zaven, 11. State arrest warrants were issued for the Silahs on July 31, 2008, and federal arrest warrants were issued the following month, authorities said. ""After following domestic and international leads in this investigation, agents with the FBI and detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department directed their focus overseas,"" the FBI said in a statement Friday. After the investigation led to Athens, Greece, Greek police conducted ""an exhaustive investigation"" that led them to the Netherlands, the FBI said. ""The investigative efforts of law enforcement in Greece and the Netherlands resulted in the identification of the Silah brothers and the victim children."" Authorities in Los Angeles obtained a provisional arrest warrant allowing authorities in the Netherlands to arrest the brothers and recover the children Tuesday, the FBI said. The children were being held by Dutch protective services, and FBI agents will travel with the children's mothers to the Netherlands, the statement said. The Silah brothers were in Dutch police custody. The mothers of the three boys have issued tearful public pleas for the return of their sons, believing the men may have fled for their native Syria. ""Alex, Zaven, I miss you guys so much,"" mother Zanni Kalayejian said in August 2008 at a press conference, according to CNN affiliate KABC. Greg's mother, Christine Stackhouse, promised at the same press conference, ""I'm going to come and find you. I'm going to bring you back home."" Greg's grandmother, Araxie Jeambart, told KABC after the children were recovered that she wants to see her grandson with her own eyes. ""We have spent so much money, so much time, so much crying, so much suffering,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The Washington state Liquor Control Board on Wednesday banned the sale of alcoholic energy drinks after a group of college students got sick from consuming a drink nicknamed ""blackout in a can."" The ban, which takes effect November 18, follows the October hospitalization of nine underage Central Washington University students who said they got sick after drinking ""Four Loko,"" a caffeinated malt liquor. Some of the students also mixed the canned drinks with other alcohol, including vodka, police reported. Washington state Attorney General Rob McKenna has called for federal food regulators to ban the beverages, which he said ""have such high levels of stimulants that people have no idea how inebriated they really are."" But Four Loko's manufacturer, Phusion Projects of Chicago, Illinois, said the drink is ""just as safe as any other alcoholic beverage"" when used responsibly. The company said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the ban, which it said was ""based on misguided information and does not address the issue at hand."" ""If the true concern was to preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare, this ban would also address caffeinated liquor products, which contain three to four times as much alcohol as our products,"" Phusion said in a written statement. ""Instead, under this ban, these products will remain legal and accessible to the same subset of the population that chose not to consume our products responsibly, sold in stores where existing alcohol laws can continue to be ignored, and abused alongside the same types of alcohols and other illicit substances that contributed to the incident at Central Washington University earlier this year."" The company called the Central Washington University incident ""disturbing and unacceptable,"" but said the liquor board's move does nothing to address the ""ongoing challenge"" of underage drinking among college students. And it said the board ignored its normal procedures, depriving affected businesses ""any opportunity to be heard."" In an earlier statement, Phusion said Four Loko has about the same amount of alcohol as wine or some craft beers and roughly the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee from the Starbucks chain. The incident that led to the ban took place in Roslyn, Washington, in early October. Police concluded that none of the students was drugged or given alcohol without their knowledge, according to a school statement, but the findings convinced university President James Gaudino to ban ""alcohol energy drinks"" from his campus. ""We need to make sure that we're sending a strong message to students about the dangers of alcohol energy drinks and we need to know more about the way it affects health and behavior,"" Gaudino said. The drinks are ""a binge-drinkers dream because the caffeine and other stimulants allow a drinker to ingest larger volumes of alcohol without passing out,"" the chairman of the school's physical education department said. ""Being able to feel the effects of tiredness, loss of coordination and even passing out or vomiting are the body's defenses against consuming doses of alcohol that will kill you,"" professor Ken Briggs said last month. ""Regardless, once the blood alcohol level reaches a certain level you can drop like a box of rocks.""

"(CNN)  -- A former golf professional from Indiana in the United States played an incredible 612 holes in just 16 hours as part of a charity fundraising bid. Ben Berger accomplished the feat at the Juday Creek Golf Club, beginning his day at 5.29 am local and finishing at sunset at 9.30 pm. He averaged more than two 18-hole rounds of golf every hour, using a golf cart to speed between his shots. He was completing a par-four in an average of one minute 30 seconds, only slowing towards the end as pains in his hips started to take a toll. Berger's play was not too shabby either, picking up 95 birdies and five eagles, the last of which came of his final hole as he chipped in. Of his 33 rounds, 12 of them were par of better and despite his haste, his worst score was an 82. Berger was helping to raise money for an autism charity, the ""Par for the Cause"" event having raised more than $200,000 in its five-year existence. Impressive though Berger's marathon performance is, according to Guinness World Records the record for the most golf holes in 24 hours with use of a cart is 851, set by Robb James, who achieved his feat at a nine-hole course in Canada. Berger was a professional at a neighboring club until taking a regular job in a family business. His wife Stephanie, who is eight months pregnant, was on hand to watch at the end as he finished in superb style to the delight of his gallery of supporters. ""That's the way you finish,"" he screamed and then hugged his wife who had been standing by him with his putter.","Ex golf professional plays 612 holes in 16 hours to raise money for charity .

"(CNN) -- Accused ""barefoot bandit"" Colton Harris-Moore was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in connection with a series of airplane and boat thefts in the Pacific northwest, federal prosecutors in Washington state said. The 19-year-old gained notoriety for allegedly stealing planes and flying without a pilot's certificate -- sometimes without shoes. The teen had been on the run since he walked away from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008, according to court records. He was captured on July 11 in the Bahamas after flying 1,000 miles in a stolen plane from Indiana, authorities said. On Wednesday, Harris-Moore was indicted on five counts, including interstate transportation of a stolen aircraft for allegedly flying a Cessna aircraft from Bonners Ferry, Idaho, to near Granite Falls, Washington on September 29, 2009, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Seattle said. He is also charged with interstate and foreign transportation of a stolen firearm for allegedly stealing a .32 caliber pistol in Canada and carrying it into Idaho and on the stolen plane he flew to the Granite Falls area, according to the indictment. In addition, Harris-Moore is accused of piloting an aircraft without an airman's certificate for a flight he allegedly made in a stolen plane from Anacortes to Eastsound, Washington, on February 10, 2010. Another charge relates to allegations that he stole a 34-foot boat in Ilwaco, Washington, and sailed to Oregon on May 31, 2010, the indictment says. He faces a weapons possession charge for allegedly carrying a Jennings .22 caliber pistol while he was a fugitive between October 1, 2009, and May 6, 2010. Four of the counts in the indictment are punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the U.S. attorney's office said. Piloting an aircraft without an airman's certificate is punishable by up to three years in prison. At a court appearance in July shortly after Harris-Moore's capture, his lawyer said his client does not want to be considered a role model, despite Facebook sites dedicated to him with thousands of fans. ""He was scared,"" John Henry Browne said at the time. ""He's very bright,"" the lawyer said, describing his client. ""But probably not very mature.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Wednesday, where the leaders of top global economies will convene at the G-20 summit to try to stabilize the world's financial markets. Obama left Indonesia hours early, because volcanic ash from Mount Merapi could have grounded Air Force One, administration officials said. The president's visit to Seoul will include a meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Obama is also scheduled to deliver a speech to U.S. troops in South Korea on Thursday, the Veterans Day holiday in the United States. Tensions about currency and trade are likely to run high at the G-20 meeting, which will be held Thursday and Friday in Seoul, the South Korean capital. Officials in China and the United States have accused the other of manipulating its currency at the expense of other economies. And the G-20 has acknowledged that the global economic recovery is advancing in ""a fragile and uneven way."" Widespread protests are expected at the summit, for which South Korea has mobilized its largest security force ever, according to the Yonhap news agency. A total of 50,000 police and riot police are being deployed, authorities told Yonhap. A number of South Korean union and civic groups are gearing up for large protests against the G-20, while other groups are planning unrelated rallies in hopes of drawing international media attention. Protests by Muslims in Indonesia also preceded Obama's visit there. But the president focused on the two countries' shared principles of unity and tolerance when he delivered a highly anticipated speech at the University of Indonesia right before he left for South Korea. In his speech, Obama reflected on the four years he spent in Indonesia as a child, referring to how he and his family were warmly accepted. He drew cheers when he sprinkled sayings from the local Malay language, such as ""Selamat Datang"" -- a greeting of welcome -- and the national motto ""Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,"" which means ""unity in diversity."" Noting that Malay is one of hundreds of languages of the archipelago nation, Obama lauded Indonesia for its spirit of inclusiveness despite its diverse population and history of dictatorship. ""But even as this land of my youth has changed in so many ways, those things that I learned to love about Indonesia -- that spirit of tolerance that is written into your constitution, symbolized in your mosques and churches and temples standing alongside each other; that spirit that is embodied in your people -- that still lives on,"" he said. Obama said he returned as president of the United States seeking ""a deep and enduring partnership"" with Indonesia. ""America has a stake in an Indonesia that is growing, with prosperity that is broadly shared among the Indonesian people, because a rising middle class here means new markets for our goods, just as America is a market for yours,"" he said. Grappling with a troubled U.S. economy, the Obama administration has highlighted the strengthening of economic and military ties during the president's 10-day Asia tour. Obama started his trip with a three-day stay in India, before heading to Indonesia. In Mumbai on Saturday, the president unveiled about $10 billion in contracts for U.S. exports to India. It is Asia's third-largest economy and one of the world's few growth markets. Speaking in New Delhi on Monday, Obama said, ""We make some of the best products in the world and we want to sell them to a growing Indian market."" At the Seoul summit, G-20 leaders are expected to focus on the global economic recovery and mechanisms to ensure balance and sustainable growth. ""We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip. Collectively, the Group of 20 accounts for about 85 percent of global economic output. The 1997 Asian financial crisis prompted the creation of the group. The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. ""If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time,"" Rhodes said. ""We see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we're an Asian and a Pacific power,"" Rhodes added. After South Korea, Obama will head to Japan for the APEC summit, which will be held in Yokohama on Saturday and Sunday. Twenty-one countries form the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which focuses on economic coordination in the Asia Pacific region. ""Further economic integration [and] trade liberalization in Asia Pacific is vital to our own interests and our ability to export more and grow our economy here at home,"" National Security Advisor Mike Froman said ahead of Obama's Asia trip. The president is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday.","He'll attend the G-20 summit, which is aimed at stabilizing the world's financial markets .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A family court judge refused Mel Gibson's request to prohibit the actor-director's ex-girlfriend and her lawyers from talking to reporters about their child custody battle Wednesday. The judge also withheld a decision on Oksana Grigorieva's petition to change the temporary custody order to prevent Gibson from having overnight visits with their 1-year-old daughter. Gibson and Grigorieva, who split up months after Lucia was born, sat on opposite sides of a courtroom Wednesday for a daylong hearing Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon. The hearing was closed to the public and lawyers on each side would not reveal if either of the parents testified Wednesday. They are scheduled to return to court on November 22 for a continuation of the hearing, Grigorieva lawyer Daniel Horowitz said. While Judge Gordon refused to grant the gag order, which Grigorieva opposed, Horowitz said he was reluctant to discuss details of the hearing because it involved a child. Still, the child custody battle has been publicly bitter and could evolve into a criminal case.  Prosecutors are considering whether to bring charges against Gibson in connection with a domestic violence investigation related to the custody dispute, a Los Angeles district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said. A decision on charges against Gibson will not be made until sheriff's investigators conclude a probe of extortion allegations Gibson made Grigorieva, Gibbons said. Police in Malibu Hills, California, opened the investigation in July into an alleged domestic violence incident in which Grigorieva accused Gibson of striking her in the face. He alleged that she attempted to extort him to keep controversial recordings of their arguments secret. Phone calls recorded by Grigorieva are ""part of the investigation"" into the alleged domestic violence,"" sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Several explosive audio recordings, purportedly between Grigorieva and Gibson, were released online. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","NEW: The judge rejected Gibson's request for a gag order .

"New York (CNN) -- A picture may be worth a thousand words, but for foster children in New York City and across the country, a picture is worth improved self-esteem, and potentially, a new home and family. As part of National Adoption Month, Heart Gallery NYC along with more than 100 other Heart Gallery locations in the United States and Canada have teamed up renowned celebrity portrait and fashion photographers. The photographers will take pictures of children in the foster care system in need of permanent adoptive families -- in hopes the kids will be seen in a different light. On Wednesday evening at New York's Times Square Information Center, some foster kids found themselves staring back at their larger-than-life-sized pictures among the lights of Broadway at a grand opening exhibit held in their honor. For celebrity photographers such as Robert Ascroft, whose clients include Brad Pitt, Penelope Cruz, and Mariah Carey; Howard Schatz, whose shutters have exposed the likes of Michael Douglas, Whoopi Goldberg and Brooke Shields; and Barbara Bordnick, whose works are in the permanent collections of the International Center of Photography as well as innumerable magazines, volunteering their time and studios made for a change and reward, but came with challenges. ""I was hoping I could make them feel comfortable and make them feel special -- I wondered if I'd be able to do that,"" Bordnick said, voicing concern that she ""... wanted to get 'them' on film, not make them into anything."" Paul Lange, a celebrity photographer who counts Halle Berry, Tyra Banks and Oprah among his clients said, ""My whole career was fashion and beauty. The nice thing about it is, instead of selling a product, we're campaigning for a person's future. It spoke to me to give these kids an opportunity to get a foot up on the ladder."" Lange said his biggest surprise was the ""genuineness"" in the children's expression. ""It's like they're saying, 'I'm a good person inside. Give me a chance.' They're dying for an opportunity for someone to step forward and take a chance on them,"" he said. Jasmine, 14, who posed next to her portrait at the exhibit, said she loved it. ""I was shocked at first to see it, but I like it. ... I feel like a star."" Laurie Sherman Graff, founder of Heart Gallery NYC, says one picture can make all the difference. ""Some of the pictures prospective families typically see of these children -- it's like looking at a driver's license photo compared to these photos."" An average shoot for the project takes several hours. For some of the kids, the shoot provides a mini-family reunion. Lange said he's photographed siblings who are living in the system, but not necessarily together. ""I've had grandparents, aunts, uncles, show up at my studio so they can have an afternoon together,"" he said. Once the final photographs have been chosen for each kid, giant posters are created to be exhibited for four to six weeks at high-trafficked spots including Times Square, Grand Central Station, malls and airports -- places where their curators hope to get many eyes on them. Along with the exhibit, recruitment and information tables are set up for when people stop and ask, ""What are these pictures about?"" Graff said. Jean, 18, is close to being too old for the foster-care system, but says his poster inspires him. ""Spontaneous, handsome, intelligent,"" were words he used to describe his chosen shot. ""I'd like to be a star for eternity. But for now, I hope to get a family and live my life,"" Jean said.","Celebrity photographers join the effort to help children in need of a home .

"(WIRED)  -- When Microsoft and Facebook announced that they were partnering to integrate Facebook and Bing for social network-powered search, it confirmed something I thought Monday: Windows Phone 7 is the real Facebook phone. I don't know whether Facebook has a secret team working on a phone where they control the OS. But the company don't need one. It's already deeply integrated into Android and iOS. Now with the Microsoft partnership, it's tied to the most socially optimized smartphone ever brought to the market. ""This is, I think, one of the most exciting partnerships we've done on the platform so far,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the Bing announcement Wednesday. ""Our view is that over the next five years we expect that almost every industry is going to be disrupted by someone building a great product that's deep in whatever area that industry is, plus is extremely socially integrated."" The first Windows Phone 7 handsets are due in stores November. The OS is Microsoft's complete do-over on mobile, after its predecessor Windows Mobile tanked in popularity and market share in the wake of more consumer-savvy handsets such as Apple's iPhone and Google's Android-powered smartphones. Every aspect of Windows Phone 7 is geared to social networks: phone, contacts, gaming, photos, even Office. Focusing the phone around Hubs doesn't just mean that local client apps and cloud apps are grouped next to each other. It means that the local client and cloud work together. Microsoft tried to explicitly build a social networking phone featuring Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and MySpace with the Kin. The Kin failed and was killed by Microsoft, mostly because it wasn't a full-featured smartphone (it was a fork of Windows Phone 7), but required a smartphone's data plan. The Kin's cloud-backed social and sharing components lived on in Windows Phone 7. They were always there. Only now, Flickr and MySpace are nowhere to be found. Even before the Bing announcement, Facebook was a conspicuous part of the WP7 presentation. Microsoft's Joe Belfiore outlined a scenario where users could take a photo on their phone that's then uploaded to Facebook automatically, without even opening the Facebook app. In the press release for WP7, Microsoft notes that ""the customizable Start screen with Live Tiles provides real-time updates so you can keep tabs on the latest weather forecast, your favorite band, a friend's Facebook page and more, all with just one glimpse"" [emphasis added]. That wasn't an accident. The Facebook-Bing partnership was already happening. It's the exact strategy that Zuckerberg outlined in his interview with Michael Arrington, where he explained why Facebook wasn't building its own phone. Zuckerberg only made an offhand reference to WP7 in that interview: ""If Windows Phone 7 takes off, then I'm sure we'll put resources on that."" But he added, with reference to their efforts with the iPhone and Android, ""The question is, what could we do if we also started hacking at a deeper level, and that is a lot of the stuff that we're thinking about."" In order to do that, Zuckerberg explained, you need to find a company that was willing to incorporate social networking from the operating system up -- not just adding a layer on top of it was already doing, but making that the focus of the device and its services. At least one of those companies is Microsoft. ""We started thinking what would social search look like, and we started looking around for partners,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Microsoft really is the underdog here and they really are incentivized to try new things."" He was talking about search, but he may as well have been talking about phones. Microsoft may be the underdog in search and phones, but it's actually been ahead of the curve in terms of incorporating social layers into its products. The Zune had song and photo sharing between devices over Wi-Fi before the iPhone was even announced. But that was a closed network, limited to just Zune-to-Zune, and later Zune-to-Xbox. In order to get outside of itself, Microsoft partnered with Facebook early on -- it still owns part of the company -- and Facebook helped shape Microsoft's social strategy. Microsoft has been quietly building a social network without anyone actually noticing. Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live are all social networks where users work, share files and talk about media together. You use the same identity across all of those services on every Microsoft device. Facebook is already embedded in all of them: It's built into Messenger, Hotmail and Outlook, and it's what powers part of the social dimension of Xbox Live. And Bing is already embedded in Facebook, in the form of maps and search results. Now Facebook's information is embedded in Bing search. And search is one of just three buttons on every WP7 phone. Consequently, Facebook's partnership with Bing isn't just about Google> It isn't just about ""Like"" results showing up when you search in a web browser on your PC. It's about incorporating a social layer into media on every device in your household, from your phone to your set-top box. It's about making those devices smarter in how they communicate with each other and from one platform to another. That's what stood out to me most at the Windows Phone 7 launch event. The Office people demonstrated how to use Windows Live to stream a PowerPoint presentation from a Windows PC to a Mac. The Xbox people were showing how to chat about a Netflix movie with your Facebook friends on Xbox live. The hardware people were showing off a wide-angle HD webcam that will let families chat with families from their living rooms. Deep integration of devices, media and services -- using the cloud to power person-to-person interaction through voice, images and text. If we think about Apple's attempt with Ping to bring a social layer to iTunes (which has been criticized, in part, because Apple didn't partner up with Facebook), Sony's idea of a multitasking television set or Twitter's plays to get on the television screen with Google TV, it's clear that that's where we're heading. The only places where Microsoft and Facebook are ""underdogs"" are search and smartphones. When it comes to social networking and smart partnering with other companies -- including each other -- the two giants are way ahead of the field.

"(CNN)  -- There is little argument that America's respect in the Muslim world has lessened as we enter our 10th year of war against a deadly shadow enemy of religious extremists who wear no uniform, wave no flag and who use their holy book as sword and shield against fellow Muslims as well as all things American. So what does Terry Jones, pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, hope to accomplish by calling for a ""Burn a Quran Day"" this Saturday, September 11, the ninth anniversary of the worst sneak attack on American soil in our 234-year history? The answers are as obvious as they are ominous: He will bring total contempt from the world's fastest-growing religion against the world's oldest democracy. He will destroy the goodwill generations of Americans have worked to create in almost every nation.  He will -- in just a few seconds of self-proclaimed glory and protest -- paint a target on the backs of U.S. troops, diplomats, foreign service employees, humanitarian relief workers and American tourists. Worse, still, Jones and his followers will provide our enemies with a propaganda tool that will outlast our lives and those of our children and their children. Burning a Quran will instantly undo everything good that America has done in the world. America's top general in Afghanistan, David H. Petraeus, recognizes the consequences of such an act. ""Images of the burning of a Quran would undoubtedly be used by extremists in Afghanistan -- and around the world -- to inflame public opinion and incite violence,"" he said in a statement released from his headquarters in Kabul. No one will remember when a half-dozen Muslim nations joined a multinational coalition that included the U.S. to free Kuwait back in 1991. No one will remember America's huge humanitarian response in Indonesia after the devastating 2004 tsunami or in Pakistan after this year's disastrous flooding. No one will remember countless other projects to build schools and roadways and efforts to bring clean drinking water to people. No one outside the United States will recognize or even care that burning a Quran was the act of a single or small group of individuals. The only thing the Muslim world will remember and our enemies will exploit is that the U.S. government allowed Americans to burn the Islamic holy book in protest without consequence. The First Amendment may protect the pastor's right to protest, but nothing is to be gained and everything is to lose from this self-serving act. Our nation was founded on religious freedom and tolerance, yet a man of the cloth wants to invoke memories of a not-so-proud history when a developing America didn't want Catholics or Jews but did want slaves. If the good pastor wants to protest something on the side of the righteous, I would suggest he divert his energies against the Rev. Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas. For the better part of this decade, Phelps and his followers have been protesting around the country at the funerals of fallen military members, carrying signs that say ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers."" He is now the subject of a First Amendment case scheduled before the U.S. Supreme Court next month.  [Snyder v. Phelps] . Religion has been the rallying cry of almost every war in recorded history, and there are those in our country as well as in Muslim countries who truly believe that this is the start of a war between Islam and nonbelievers. ""America is not at war with Islam"" is a statement that has been repeated publicly and repeated often by presidents and members of Congress from all political persuasions, not because it is politically correct but because it is true. America is at war, however, against a small number of religious extremists who hide behind women and children and kill indiscriminately without remorse. We must not allow an equally small number of religious extremists in America to widen the war by burning the Quran ... or Torah or Bible. America is far better than that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard L. Eubank.","Richard Eubank: Pastor's plan to burn Qurans on 9-11 endangers U.S. soldiers, tourists, diplomats .

"(CNN) -- An undocumented student from Mexico who was arrested and held in a deportation facility after she was stopped for a minor traffic violation in Georgia was found guilty on Thursday of driving without a license. A jury in Cobb County, Georgia also found 22-year-old Jessica Colotl not guilty of impeding traffic, the reason police gave for pulling her over on the campus of Kennesaw State University. Conviction on the misdemeanor charge of driving without a license is punishable by up to a year in jail, said her lawyer, Jerome Lee. The conviction includes a mandatory minimum of 48 hours in jail, of which Colotl has already served around 45 1/2, Lee said. Lee said that Colotl plans to appeal the verdict. Colotl became a lightning rod in the immigration debate last spring, when advocates for immigration reform said her case was a symbol of a broken system. On Thursday, Lee said that she had recently obtained a learner's permit, which he said was grounds to dismiss the misdemeanor charge under Georgia law. ""The jury essentially refused to properly read the statute, as juries often do,"" he said. Colotl's legal problems started in late March when her car was stopped on the campus of Kennesaw State. Born in Mexico but living in the United States since she was 11, she could not produce a driver's license, so she handed over as identification an expired passport from Mexico. She was arrested the next day and turned over to immigration officials. She spent more than a month in the Etowah Detention Center in Alabama. Friends came out in force and marched on campus in her defense. In May, she was released, and her deportation was deferred for a year, which will allow her to finish her studies. But she was quickly arrested on a warrant for the Cobb County Sheriff's Office and released on $2,500 bail. ""I'm just trying to live the American dream and finish my education,"" she said at the time. On Thursday, Lee said that other than completing college, his client's plans for the future are unclear. ""There are so many variables in terms of what's going to happen,"" he said, ""that it's a little too early to say.""","22-year-old Jessica Colotl became a lighting rod in immigration debate this year .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a foreign policy talk to weigh in on hot button political issues Wednesday, slamming a Florida pastor for his ""disgraceful"" plan to burn the Quran and strongly criticizing George W. Bush's fiscal record. Clinton warned about the long-term consequences of rising federal budget deficits, arguing that they will eventually diminish U.S. power and impair America's ability to act effectively in the global arena. Her remarks came during an appearance before the non-partisan Council on Foreign Relations. It was her second major foreign policy speech there as secretary of state. Clinton noted that Terry Jones, the Florida pastor, is the head of a small congregation, and said she wished his plans to burn the Quran on the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks hadn't attracted so much media attention.  But sadly, ""that's the world we live in right now,"" she said. Jones's plans could potentially harm U.S. troops, she asserted, echoing a recent warning from Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. The pastor's plan doesn't represent broader American views on Islam, Clinton declared.  ""It's not who we are,"" she said. Clinton also slammed Jones's plans on Tuesday night at a State Department dinner in honor of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Jones has so far rebuffed pleas to call off the event, saying radical Islamists are the target of his message. On fiscal matters, Clinton had harsh words for Bush.  Cutting taxes while fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq without paying for them was a ""deadly combination"" in terms of ""fiscal sanity,"" she said. She said that rising debt poses a national security threat in many ways, and warned that ""responsible"" authorities on fiscal matters ""are not being heard right now."" ""There is no free lunch and we can't pretend that there is ... without doing great harm"" to the country, she said. Republicans have tried to turn the tables on Democrats in recent months on the issue of fiscal responsibility, arguing that the administration's fiscal stimulus plans have significantly added to the national debt while failing to effectively restore economic growth. Clinton also expressed frustration with the treatment of sensitive foreign policy issues in domestic politics, urging a partisan ""détente"" that cuts ""across the partisan divide."" Among other things, she cited the START nuclear arms reduction treaty, which is slated to be taken up by the Senate in September but faces significant opposition among key Republicans. The treaty has become a  ""political issue,"" she said, but ""I wish it weren't.""  The accord is seen in Europe as an important symbol of America's commitment to work with Russia, she said. Turning to the Middle East, Clinton said she thinks we ""have a real shot"" at a successful conclusion to the new Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Clinton will travel to Egypt and Jerusalem next week for the second round of negotiations. Last week, she formally reopened the peace talks at the State Department, where, among other meetings, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas huddled alone behind closed doors for an hour and a half. On efforts to block Iran's nuclear program, Clinton said the United States believes Tehran ""is beginning to feel the full impact"" of recently imposed sanctions. ""International financial and commercial sectors are ... starting to recognize the risks of doing business with Iran,"" she told the Council on Foreign Relations. Sanctions ""are the building blocks of leverage for a negotiated solution,"" she said.  ""We will see how Iran decides."" The United States has repeatedly lobbied other nations to step up sanctions against Iran.  The European Union, Canada, Japan and South Korea are among those that have done so. Iran, however, is continuing its uranium enrichment activities in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a report released Monday by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran has rebuffed international demands to halt its uranium enrichment program, saying it wants the nuclear fuel for peaceful uses.  IAEA officials, however, have not been convinced. Clinton said the United States is continuing to support freedom and human rights inside Iran by speaking out against the regime, and by equipping Iranians with the technological tools they need to communicate with each other and spread their views. ""We want to be helpful, but we don't want to get in the way of it,"" she said. ""So that's the balance that we try to strike."" Clinton's speech at the Council on Foreign Relations -- which was followed by a question-and-answer session -- touted what she characterized as the multiple successes of President Barack Obama's foreign policy agenda. It also detailed a multi-pronged process of how the administration is putting the president's agenda into practice. Clinton said the president's approach includes strengthening the U.S. economy, ""ensuring we have the resources we need,"" and helping other countries obtain the tools and support they need ""to solve their own problems and help solve our common problems.""

"(CNN) -- In some post-election hardball between the Obama administration and newly-elected Republicans, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood is threatening to take back stimulus funds from states if they do not follow through on proposed rail projects. CNN obtained copies of letters LaHood sent to incoming Republican governors in Ohio and Wisconsin who have stated their opposition to rail projects already underway in their states. In the letters, LaHood said a rail link between Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati in Ohio, and a high-speed rail connection between Chicago, Illinois, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, are vital to economic growth in both regions. Lahood wrote that he respects the power of governors to make decisions for their states, but, ""There seems to be some confusion about how these high-speed rail dollars can be spent."" To Wisconsin's Gov.-elect Scott Walker, LaHood said that none of the funds can be used for roads or any other projects. He went on to say, ""Consequently, unless you change your position, we plan to engage in an orderly transition to wind down Wisconsin's project so that we do not waste taxpayer's money."" That letter was delivered on Monday. A similar letter was sent to Gov.-elect John Kasich in Ohio on Tuesday. In that letter, LaHood mentions the thousands of jobs that would be created with the construction of a rail link between the state's largest cities. LaHood said he was aware that Kasich had asked President Barack Obama if $400 million dollars from the federal government intended to fund the passenger rail project could instead be used for road construction and freight lines. LaHood wrote, ""I wanted to let you know that none of those funds can be used for anything other than our High-Speed Rail Program,"" and he signaled his intention to take the money back if the project doesn't move forward. The Transportation Department has committed a total of $823 million to a 441-mile-long high-speed rail connection from Chicago to Minneapolis. But if Wisconsin balks on the section that would run between Milwaukee and Madison, the project can not be completed. Similarly, the DOT committed $400 million to a 250-mile-long intercity passenger rail line that would run from Cincinnati, through Dayton and Columbus, and on to Cleveland. The Transportation Secretary is in a fight to keep several proposed high-speed rail projects alive after New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie abruptly killed the nation's largest infrastructure project last month. The ARC Tunnel would have involved the construction of a second rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York and an expansion of Penn Station in New York City. It was expected to double commuter rail capacity on the Northeast Corridor, the nation's busiest rail line, and ease congestion on New Jersey's highways. Now the feds want their money back from New Jersey. On Monday, a letter was sent from the Federal Transit Administration to New Jersey Transit, the state's public transportation authority, requesting an immediate repayment of $271 million in federal funds already spent on the project. The letter stated the funds were obligated for the ARC tunnel and because the project was terminated, the money most be returned. New Jersey Transit officials responded by saying they are reviewing the request and they do not agree that the issue is as clear-cut as portrayed in the FTA letter. Christie put an end to the tunnel, claiming that potential cost overruns could range from $2 billion to $5 billion, something the cash-strapped state can not afford. But USDOT officials believe any cost overruns on ARC wouldn't have exceeded $800 million.","Governors-elect in Ohio and Wisconsin got letters from the transportation secretary .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio death row inmate who has repeatedly claimed his innocence was spared execution, after the state's governor Thursday noted ""legitimate questions"" about evidence used to convict the man. Kevin Keith for now will spend the rest of his life in prison without parole. His legal appeals will continue, with lawyers claiming newly discovered evidence and discredited eyewitness testimony will ultimately exonerate him. Keith was convicted of the 1994 killings of three females, including a child, in an apartment in Bucyrus, 60 miles north of Columbus. He was scheduled to die by lethal injection September 15, and had exhausted most of his federal and state court appeals. Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat, issued his commutation this week after a number of civil liberties and innocence groups urged he step in to prevent a possibly innocent man from being executed by the state. ""Clearly, the careful exercise of a governor's executive clemency authority is appropriate in a case like this one, given the real and unanswered questions surrounding the murders for which Mr. Keith was convicted,"" said Strickland in a statement. ""Mr. Keith still has appellate legal proceedings pending which, in theory, could ultimately result in his conviction being overturned altogether. The governor added, however, that he believes ""it is far more likely that Mr. Keith committed these murders than it is likely that he did not."" Strickland urged the courts to give a ""full, fair analysis"" of the issues raised in the appeal. He ignored the recommendations of the state's parole board, which last month unanimously recommended against clemency. Keith's lawyers applauded the governor's decision, but promised to continue the fight to clear the inmate. ""Mr. Keith remains incarcerated for a crime he did not commit, and that crime remains unsolved,"" said a statement from his five-person legal team. ""The commutation to a life sentence does not lessen the need for justice to prevail."" Prosecutors said the 46-year-old Keith had maliciously sprayed a home with gunfire, that left a 4-year-old dead, along with her mother and aunt. Three others were wounded but survived, including a man who later testified against the main suspect. At trial, the state argued one of the victims was the brother of an undercover police informant who had implicated Keith as a drug dealer. But Keith's public defenders point to at least one other suspect, and say a detective in the case lied on the stand about how a survivor of the shooting identified Keith. His defense team also later presented alibi witnesses. Calls to the Crawford County prosecuting attorney's office were not immediately returned. The issue of ""actual innocence"" and the rights of prisoners to challenge their sentences years after a trial will be argued next month at the U.S. Supreme Court. A Texas death row inmate wants DNA testing from evidence that had not been analyzed at the time of his trial, to try to prove he did not commit the crime. The Innocence Project, a New York-based legal clinic said 258 people have been exonerated through DNA testing and new evidence being uncovered, with their convictions being tossed out. Many defense attorneys have urged the courts to make it easier for inmates-- especially those facing execution-- to go to court to press for a new look at these innocence claims, including more sophisticated DNA testing of old evidence. ""It's a win-win for the justice system. If he turns out to be guilty, we have the certainty of that fact with objective DNA science prior to the time that we carry out the ultimate punishment,"" said Nina Morrison, a staff attorney with the Innocence Project. ""And if he's not guilty, obviously that's something that we, and surely the state, would want to know prior to the time that an irrevocable penalty of execution is carried out. ""","Kevin Keith was scheduled to die by lethal injection in two weeks .

"San Bruno, California (CNN) -- At first, residents thought it was an earthquake. Or maybe a big airplane had crashed. San Bruno, after all, is adjacent to the San Francisco airport. They heard the booms. Then they saw the giant fireballs, some leaping 80 feet high. The flames were so hot, so intense, that the roar could be heard far away and the heat sucked up the air. They did not know then that a gas line that had ruptured and exploded, triggering a fire that would leave their town in apocalyptic hues. They would only find out later what had happened. But in the middle of the chaos, they simply tried to survive. Homes, lawns, cars -- everything burned. At least four people died. Many others gasped their way to hospitals, four of them fighting for their lives with excruciating third-degree burns. Read latest on California fire . Judy Serresseque felt her whole house shake as though a mighty quake was about to swallow northern California, her living room filled with an orange glow. ""When I went to my front door, I looked out and everything was just flames,"" said Serresseque, who fled with her husband. ""The heat was intense, and you could hear it, you could hear the hiss."" A ""big rumbling sound"" sent Bob Hensel's cats into hiding. He looked long and hard for them before he pried open the garage door to escape the flames. As he drove off, he could see the bumper of his wife's car melt away. The explosion occurred Thursday evening, sending concrete chunks flying through the air. The heat from the blaze melted tail lights on cars parked blocks away. In daylight Friday, 15 acres of San Bruno resembled more a war zone than a quiet suburban California neighborhood. ""I was standing next to a police officer who'd been in Baghdad, and he said he had never seen anything quite so bad as this,"" John Hampton, a freelance photographer who witnessed the fire, told CNN affiliate KGO. ""It looks as if this area was firebombed."" Another photographer, Bryan Carmody, documented the tragedy with his camera lens. He said the actual gas fire was contained to a small area, but houses just started catching fire, one after another. And the blaze turned into one continuous fireball. ""The fire would just move from one house to the next because the fire was burning so fast and so big and so intensely,"" he said. ""It was definitely a sight to see."" Residents under evacuation orders fled to shelters. Others spent a panicked night in darkness after electricity was cut off. They feared for their friends, families and themselves, not knowing the path and scope of the fire. On Friday, cadaver dogs were still searching as authorities feared more than four people had perished in the blaze. Sergio Campos was on his way to class at Skyline College when he saw the fire and pulled over. Even from a distance, he could hear the roar. But he, like so many other confused San Bruno residents, didn't know whether to run toward the inferno to try to save people, or drive as far away as he could.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Three bombs left outside three Christian homes in western Baghdad detonated Tuesday evening, wounding at least three people, an Interior Ministry official said. It was not clear if the injured were Christian residents or others on the street. The latest attacks came as 35 Christian survivors of a chilling church attack last month arrived in France, where they will be able to seek asylum. A group called the Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the gruesome October 31 siege of the Sayidat al-Nejat cathedral that left 70 people dead and 75 wounded. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. In another western Baghdad neighborhood, a car bomb killed at least one person and wounded five, the official said. The bombing occurred near a Sunni mosque and an office belonging to one of Iraq's top Sunni Arab parties. Meanwhile, the death toll from a car bomb explosion in Basra increased to at least 12, the interior ministry said. At least 39 others were wounded when the car bomb exploded Monday in a busy commercial district in the western part of the city, the ministry said. In two major Shiite cities, another 11 people were killed Monday, the Interior Ministry  said. On a crowded street in the Iraqi city of Karbala, a blast killed at least 10 people and wounded 38, the ministry said. The bomb went off at one of the main entrances to the city where buses carrying Iranian pilgrims stop. In Najaf, at least one person was killed and 10 were wounded in a bombing, the ministry said. The parked car bomb targeted buses carrying Iranian pilgrims at the road leading to Najaf's old city.","The attack comes as a group of Iraqi Christians arrive in France .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities have arrested a reputed senior member of a major Tijuana-based drug cartel after a shootout, U.S. authorities confirmed Sunday. Eduardo Arellano-Felix was arrested in Tijuana, Mexico, on Saturday. Eduardo Arellano-Felix was arrested at a Tijuana, Mexico, residence Saturday, said Special Agent Eileen Zeidler of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office in San Diego, California. She said federal authorities received a tip on the whereabouts of Arellano-Felix and provided the information to Mexican authorities. No other details were immediately available. Arellano-Felix was one of the last wanted members of the powerful and brutal trafficking organization bearing his family name, authorities say. His brother, reputed Mexican drug lord Javier Arellano-Felix, was captured by U.S. authorities in August 2006 off the shore of southern Baja California. The brothers were on the top of the DEA's Most Wanted List, carrying rewards of $5 million dollars for their capture. Officials say seven brothers and four sisters of the Arellano-Felix family inherited the Tijuana cartel from Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo in 1989 after his arrest for drug trafficking. Eduardo was the last remaining brother who had an active role in the cartel. Today, the notorious cartel is split into two factions -- one headed by Eduardo Garcia Simental and another headed by Eduardo Arellano-Felix's nephew, Fernando Sanchez Arellano. The two sides have engaged in brutal fighting, accounting for nearly all the violence in Tijuana, according to the DEA. More than 400 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Tijuana this year. While Eduardo Arellano-Felix was not the boss of the cartel, DEA officials said his nephew sought his advice on decisions. Zeidler said the arrest of Arellano-Felix was a significant step in potentially dismantling the cartel. ""You pull the foundation out of the house and the house is going to come down,"" she said. ""[Arellano-Felix] was the foundation.""","Eduardo Arellano-Felix was arrested at a Tijuana residence Saturday .

"(CNN) -- An apartment left untouched since before the fall of the Berlin Wall has been discovered by a developer in the eastern German city of Leipzig, German media reports said Thursday. The fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the end of the communist regime in East Germany in 1989. The discovery, made by architect Mark Aretz, revealed a small one-bedroom apartment evidently abandoned quickly by its occupants as the Communist East German state disintegrated in 1989, Spiegel Online reported. A wall calendar showed August 1988, and the kitchen cupboard and drawers contained plastic crockery and aluminium cutlery along with communist-era food brands such as ""Vita"" Cola, ""Marella"" margarine, ""Juwel"" cigarettes and a bottle of ""Kristall"" vodka. ""When we opened the door we felt like Howard Carter when he found the grave of Tutankhamen,"" Aretz told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ""Everything was a mess but it was like a historic treasure trove, a portal into an age long gone."" According to Aretz -- a developer who renovates properties in eastern Germany -- the occupant appears to have been a 24-year-old man from Leipzig who had been in trouble with the authorities, judging by personal documents left behind. The most recent document was dated May, 1989 -- a police search warrant for a caravan. There was also a stamped and addressed postcard written by the occupant, but he had never sent it, Spiegel said.","Apartment found by developer in eastern German city of Leipzig .

"(CNN) -- Leaders of the burgeoning Tea Party movement say their projected midterm election victories should send a strong message: watch out in 2012. ""The Republicans need to know, we've done it in 2010. If they don't do the right thing in the next couple of years, it's not a problem. We'll come back in 2012. We'll do it all over again. We'll replace them with people that will uphold [our] principles,"" said Mark Meckler, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots -- one of the movement's largest groups. Tuesday's elections were seen as a crucial moment for measuring the staying power of the Tea Party movement, which was born out of frustration with the political establishment and steeped in economic anxiety. ""I don't think there's any question that if it were not for the Tea Party, the Republican margin in the House of Representatives would not be as high as it's going to be,"" CNN senior political analyst David Gergen said Tuesday night. ""They gave a lot of enthusiasm and fuel to the Republican Party."" After CNN projected that two Tea Party-backed Republican candidates would win their Senate races -- Rand Paul in Kentucky and Marco Rubio in Florida -- Meckler said the movement would keep holding Republicans accountable. ""Frankly, the Republicans blew it over a very long period of time. The largest deficit ever run up in history, before the current administration, was run up by George Bush,"" he said. ""Our job is to reverse that course and not allow any party to ever do that again."" With growing momentum after months of nationwide street protests and bus tours, Tea Party activists hoped to change the makeup of Congress and the way lawmakers were elected. At least one of their goals seemed to be likely early Wednesday, with CNN projections indicating that Republicans held 239 House seats to the Democrats' 183 -- well over the 218 seats needed for a majority. And in a tight battle and a significant win for Tea Party supporters, Republican candidate Pat Toomey defeated Democratic Rep. Joe Sestak to win the Pennsylvania Senate seat, CNN projects. But even though candidates endorsed by Tea Party activists made several key gains, the movement also suffered significant losses in high-profile contests. Far-right ideology from Tea Party candidates likely cost them Senate seats in Delaware and Nevada, according to John Avlon, a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for The Daily Beast. ""That could make all the difference in control of the Senate, so there should be some self-analysis about whether or not some of these more extreme candidates who won these partisan primaries represented their Republican Party best,"" he said. The grassroots nature of the Tea Party movement makes it difficult to define how many candidates on the ballot Tuesday were affiliated with it. There is no official entity that determines who is a Tea Party candidate. Before polls opened Tuesday, CNN analyzed races across the country to identify candidates who were Tea Party activists or whose campaigns were helped significantly by the Tea Party movement. From the list of the CNN 100 -- the top 100 House races in the country -- 21 candidates were closely connected with the movement's activists and ideology. At least 10 of them won, according to CNN projections. Nine Senate candidates and four gubernatorial candidates also had strong ties to the Tea Party. Of those candidates, at least five Senate race winners were backed by Tea Party activists. And the winner of South Carolina's governor race, Nikki Haley, received Tea Party support and an endorsement from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. In addition, various national and local Tea Party organizations endorsed more than 100 candidates in races across the country. The rise of the conservative Tea Party movement added a new element to this year's election cycle, roiling Republican races by boosting little-known and inexperienced candidates to victory over mainstream figures in GOP primaries across the country. But not all of them emerged victorious Tuesday. According to CNN projections, Tea Party-backed New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino lost to Democrat and former state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada avoided what many predicted would be a fatal blow to Democrats, beating out Tea Party activist Sharron Angle. And in Delaware, Democrat Chris Coons defeated Tea Party-backed Republican nominee Christine O'Donnell, CNN projects. Still, the losing Tea Party candidates appeared to be in high spirits as they addressed supporters after results came in. ""We were victorious, because the Delaware political system will never be the same. That's a great thing. The Republican Party will never be the same,"" O'Donnell said. Angle thanked supporters for fighting for their principles. ""I want you to see that I'm still smiling. And it's because I still believe in American exceptionalism,"" she said. No matter how many of the so-called Tea Party candidates won, the impact of the movement is expected to shift the Republican agenda to the right. Paul, on the heels of his victory, has already called for creating a Senate Tea Party caucus. Of those surveyed in CNN exit polls, 23 percent said one reason for their vote Tuesday was to send a message in favor of the Tea Party, 18 percent said they cast their ballots against the Tea Party and 56 percent of respondents said the Tea Party was not a factor in their decision. Independents surveyed were split, with 24 percent saying they were neutral toward the Tea Party, and 28 percent saying they opposed the Tea Party in this election. Exit poll results indicated a stronger showing for the Tea Party among older voters, with 47 percent of those 60 and older saying they support the Tea Party and only 26 percent of voters ages 18 to 29 saying they support the movement. But South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint said the success of the Tea Party is rooted in the fact that its members can't be easily counted. ""One mistake we're making in this election is to suggest that it's all about the official Tea Party movement,"" he told CNN Tuesday. ""For everyone who goes out to a rally, there are often hundreds, even thousands of people who feel the same way, who don't consider themselves a part of the Tea Party movement. I think there is an awakening going on in our country. There's a beginning of a process. It's not finalized tonight.""

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Before I went to Sudan, I didn't know much about the conflict in Darfur beyond everyone saying, ""It's the worst genocide of our time"" and watching footage on CNN of the Janjaweed militia wiping out whole villages. Really, we only decided to go there because one of our favorite photographers had been chatting with an old friend of his who is now a UN press officer in Khartoum. She offered to pull some strings and get us visas and organize flights around the country, so we said, ""F*** it"" and got on a plane. On the flight over, I went through this huge binder of research about the situation. It really messed me up. The scale of the devastation was difficult to comprehend: . There have been 300,000 people killed and at least 2 million displaced from their homes in Darfur since fighting broke out in 2003. This comes right on the heels of another civil war in the south of Sudan that killed more than 2 million people and displaced a further 4 million over the course of the conflict. As the plane landed in Khartoum, I had the biggest ""Ummmm, what the f*** am I doing here?"" moment of my life. From the minute we got off the plane to the minute we flew out again, I was s***-scared. And as it turned out, I was totally right to be. I never understood the motivation of the conflict until I went there. Why are they killing all these people, cutting their arms off and throwing them in the wells? Well, obviously that's a terror tactic, but it also makes the villages and towns where they do it unlivable afterward. Why ruin the land that you're raiding? It didn't seem to be about one group claiming rights to territory; they're all Muslim, so it isn't about religion or Arabs killing blacks, like it's being portrayed in the media. What is it for? Well, as little as 30 years ago, Sudan was one of the poorest nations in Africa. It experienced a huge famine in the early 1980s, just like Ethiopia. Then they found oil in the south, so they freaked out and sent all these paramilitary groups similar to the Janjaweed down there and kicked all the people off the land. These groups were not officially affiliated with the government, so the government could safely say, ""It's got nothing to do with us,"" but they were all secretly government-sanctioned. The civil war that this led to went on for nearly 20 years. They finally enacted a peace agreement to unite north and south Sudan, and the UN went to Sudan especially to monitor that agreement. But then -- bang! -- same thing happened again, elsewhere in the country. The Janjaweed started killing people in Darfur, and the government was saying ""It's not us doing it"" and doing very little to stop them. See the rest of Inside Sudan at VBS.TV . And that's the interesting thing. In fact, we could point our finger at America for the early days of it, because Chevron sank the first well in southern Sudan. When we went down south in Sudan and saw the wells, we found out that it's all Chinese companies there now. China doesn't have any of America's problems of bad press in the Middle East or Africa, or people back home saying they shouldn't buy conflict diamonds or whatever. China is in very good favor in those parts of the world. In 2009, China gave $10 billion in aid to African countries. So Africans are like, ""We love China."" In turn, China comes in and says, ""We'll take your oil and your gold. We don't give a s*** about your conflicts or who hates who here."" The work camps are all completely enclosed and staffed by Chinese and Malaysians. All the money that Sudan gets from these wells goes to the north to Khartoum. The south of Sudan is supposed to get 2 percent, but they have no auditing there, so it's like, ""Two percent of how much?"" It's crazy, you're in the poorest areas in the world, and you're constantly in the shadow of rigs that are pumping out oil for China. Everyone likes to say that America is addicted to oil, but at this point it's the entire world.","VBS goes to Sudan on a quest to learn the motivation behind the Darfur conflict .

"Washington (CNN) -- Although the war in Afghanistan remains unpopular with most Americans, the public supports President Obama's decision to send more U.S. troops to the conflict, according to a new national poll. Fifty-nine percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning said they favor the president's plan to send 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, with 39 percent opposed. ""Most of those who oppose Obama's plan would like to see the U.S. immediately withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. See complete poll results (PDF) The survey indicates that a majority of the public opposes the war, with 55 percent of respondents opposed and 43 percent in support of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. ""Three in 10 say that they opposed the war from the start and another quarter report that they favored the war when it began in 2001 but oppose it now,"" Holland said. Only 18 percent of those polled said that the United States is winning in Afghanistan. Two-thirds said neither side is winning. ""That may explain the support for Obama's plan, since a victory is likely to require more troops,"" Holland said. ""But it may also explain the overall opposition to the war, since Americans tend to dislike losing."" The survey also indicates a racial divide over Afghanistan, with whites questioned split over the war, but seven in 10 black respondents opposed to the war. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted last month and released November 24, 45 percent of those polled supported the war in Afghanistan, and 52 percent were opposed. The most recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted December 16-20, with 1,160 adult Americans, including 259 African-Americans and 786 whites, questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample.

"(CNN) -- Gunmen shot and killed the mayor of the Mexican town of Guadalupe as his wife and child watched, the mayor of nearby Ciudad Juarez told CNN. Mexican federal police confirmed the shooting death of Guadalupe Mayor Jesus Manuel Lara Rodriguez. Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Lara, who maintained what was apparently a second home in Juarez, was killed outside that house as he walked to his car. ""He was a very good man, a man set on bringing law and order to that city,"" said Reyes. ""This is a big loss,"" he said. Lara, who became the mayor of Guadalupe in 2007, had apparently taken up residence in Juarez to protect his family, Reyes told CNN. He kept his official home in Guadalupe. ""He was killed in the eastern part of Juarez ... he never told me he had a house here, he never asked for protection from the city,"" the Juarez mayor said. Reyes said violence increased in Guadalupe since 2,000 federal troops arrived in Juarez early in the year. Guadalupe -- a city bordering Hudspeth County, Texas -- once had 40 policemen but is now left with four, he said. The northern Mexico state of Chihuahua is one of the main battlegrounds for rival drug cartels fighting for access to the U.S. drug-trade corridor. Reyes said he had a long partnership with Lara as both mayors rallied for more support for border cities in the war against drug cartels. ""His [Lara's] case is the best proof that the fight against the flow of drugs into the U.S. is right at the border,"" said Reyes.","Mexican federal police confirmed the shooting death of Jesus Manuel Lara Rodriguez .

"(CNN) -- A Florida mother has been arrested for her alleged part in attempting to sell her 8-week-old son, police said Tuesday. Stephanie Bigbee Fleming, 22, is the third person charged in the case. Her mother, Patty Bigbee, 45, and her mother's boyfriend, Lawrence Works, 42, were arrested and charged last week. Fleming was already incarcerated on unrelated charges. Bigbee is accused of having approached a potential buyer in late October, offering to sell the infant for $75,000, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) said in a statement. The would-be buyer then contacted authorities. Together, they negotiated the price of the baby down to $30,000 and agreed to meet, the statement said. Bigbee and her boyfriend arranged the sale for last Friday, at which point officers swept in. ""They were in contact,"" said FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg about the mother and daughter. ""And according to our investigation, they discussed the sale of the child. The birth mother was told by her mother that the sale price was $10,000."" Police say Fleming had agreed to receive $9,000 from the sale and that she planned to buy a new vehicle with the money. The infant is currently in the custody of the Florida Department of Children and Families. Fleming's bond was set at $50,000, while Bigbee's was put at $100,000.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- About three dozen survivors of last month's brutal attack on a Baghdad church have found refuge in France, where they have been given temporary status as asylum seekers. The 35 Iraqis, many of them with bullet and grenade wounds, arrived by plane in Paris on Monday night and were taken by ambulance to hospitals. Another group of 93 people is scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks, France's immigration ministry said. French Immigration Minister Eric Besson said France was offering refuge to 150 victims of the attack as a gesture of friendship and support to Christians who face hardships. ""France supports their desire to remain and live in peace on their land, where they have lived for centuries,"" Besson said. They will be issued a long-stay, renewable visa by the French Embassy in Baghdad, health coverage and a permit that allows them to work for at least six months. Besson said the government will help the Iraqis find jobs. A group called the Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility for the gruesome October 31 siege of the Sayidat al-Nejat cathedral that left 70 people dead and 75 wounded. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. Among the dead were women, children and two priests. It was one of the worst attacks against Iraq's dwindling Christian minority in recent years. ""It was five hours of terror, five hours where we didn't know whether we were going to live or die,"" said one of the survivors after arriving in Paris. Christians were once believed to have been a community of almost 1.5 million people in Iraq. But as many as half have fled the country since the war began in 2003. Syriac Orthodox Archbishop Athanasios Dawood in Britain has criticized the Iraqi government for failing to protect its minorities and has urged Iraqi Christians to flee their homeland. ""I say clearly and now -- the Christian people should leave their beloved land of our ancestors and escape the premeditated ethnic cleansing. This is better than having them killed one by one,"" said Dawood, according to prepared remarks he sent to CNN. The latest church attack victims are being welcomed as part of a French government program for Iraqis belonging to ""vulnerable religious minorities,"" Besson said. Since the program began in 2007, he said, France has welcomed 1,300 people under its auspices.","Some of the survivors are suffering from bullet and grenade wounds .

"London, England (CNN) -- Shares in Rolls-Royce rose Monday after the company announced that it had made progress in understanding the cause of a Qantas mid-air engine blow-out. The shares rose by 2.62 percent -- they had been 14 percent down from Thursday after the Australian carrier revealed early Monday that oil leaks had been discovered in the engines on three of its planes after being examined by Rolls-Royce engineers. This follows last week's aborted flight by an A380, which was forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore shortly after take off when one of its engines failed. Rolls-Royce on Monday issued a statement saying the Qantas problem was caused by an ""incident specific to the Trent 900 engine."" ""As a result, a series of checks and inspections has been agreed with Airbus, with operators of the Trent 900 powered A380 and with the airworthiness authorities,"" the Rolls-Royce statement continued. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told reporters the leaks were ""beyond normal tolerances"" and that the planes will not return to service until the airline is ""100 percent sure"" about their safety, . ""It is disturbing that Qantas found three more engines that needed to be looked at. That's a total of four,"" aviation consultant Peter Goelz told CNN. ""This is a relatively... young aircraft. These engines have probably less than 200,000 total hours, so it is an issue that we need to be concerned about."" New safety fears ground Qantas A380s . Singapore airlines and Lufthansa also operate the A380 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, but they reported no problems after carrying out their own extensive checks. Their fleets are now flying again. Dubai-based Emirates also operate the double-decked Airbus A380 but with GP7000 engines, designed as part of a joint venture between U.S. manufacturers General Electric and Pratt and Whitney. These engines have not been part of the current safety scare. Before the share price recovery, more than $1.6 billion had been wiped off the value of British-based Rolls-Royce, its share value dropping by 14 percent since Thursday. Shares in EADS, which owns Airbus, were down by half a percent for the same period. ""We're looking at a period of time when investors will be pretty jittery,"" said Dan Thisdell of Flightglobal.com. ""But they've got to grapple with this problem in a way that maintains confidence among their prospective customers as well as existing customers. ""If it is some kind of underlying design flaw, though this would seem unlikely given the enormous expertise and modern computer simulation technology available to Rolls-Royce, then there could be a problem given the level of investment involved."" In August, another Rolls-Royce engine -- this time a Trent 1000 -- suffered an uncontained failure during testing in England. This particular model is designed to power Boeing's latest commercial aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner. Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that the Trent 1000 issue was not connected to the Qantas Trent 900 incident. Rolls-Royce said in the statement: ""This incident happened during a development program with an engine operating outside normal parameters. We understand the cause and a solution has been implemented."" With at least half of the 850 787s on order destined to be powered by Trent engines, Thisdell told CNN that this will be another profitable source of income for a very long time. ""Many airlines have placed orders for aircraft years down the line and have not yet selected their preferred engine,"" he said. ""But no-one has a better reputation than Rolls-Royce. Many airlines will order Rolls-Royce engines as a matter of course because they've had first rate service from them for years. ""Not every airline see it this way, but many -- particularly small and medium-sized airlines -- feel some comfort in having a single supplier of engines for all the aircraft they fly because it provides some commonality with maintenance, spares and training for mechanics."" As if to reinforce this point, Rolls-Royce on Monday announced a new $350 million engine servicing contract with Egyptair, who operate a fleet of Airbus A330s fitted with Trent 700 engines.","Rolls-Royce says Qantas ""incident specific to the Trent 900 engine""

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- On the fifth day of every month, the loved ones of soldiers killed and wounded in the Fort Hood shootings last year make sure to think positive thoughts instead of dwelling on the carnage of last November 5. ""We call ourselves a family; that's how we cope,"" Jessica Hansen, the fiance of wounded Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler, told CNN on Monday. ""We mark the fifth of every month. All of us do. Instead of using that to mark something tragic, we try to use that day to mark our accomplishments and our feats."" On Tuesday, Hansen and the others will finally learn more about what happened last November when the alleged gunman, Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, is wheeled into a military courtroom for the start of a hearing to determine if he'll be court-martialed. Hasan, 40, is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in the shooting spree at this sprawling Army post. He's paralyzed from the upper chest down after civilian police shot him four times. The Article 32 hearing, like a civilian grand jury, will consider the evidence against Hasan and decide whether the case will move forward to a court-martial that could bring the death penalty. Unlike a grand jury, the hearing is open to the public, and both the defense and prosecution can present witnesses and evidence. Army prosecutors have refused to speak publicly about the case or release a witness list. They are expected to call every person wounded in the shootings, as well as others, to provide a second-by-second account of what happened on November 5, 2009. John Galligan, Hasan's civilian attorney, had wanted the hearing closed to the public, but his motion was denied. Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, faces 13 counts of first-degree murder for allegedly opening fire at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, killing 12 soldiers and a civilian. He also is charged with 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder for the 30 military personnel and two civilians wounded at the center, where soldiers prepare to deploy for Afghanistan and Iraq. The shootings at the nation's largest Army post, in central Texas between Dallas and San Antonio, shocked the nation and raised questions about whether a so-called homegrown terrorist had operated within the military system without detection. The Article 32 hearing is not expected to provide answers to why Hasan, who had communicated with a known Islamic extremist and made anti-U.S. comments, was promoted nonetheless. At the time of the shootings, Hasan was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, military officials said. The FBI has said it was aware of communication between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American cleric who has promoted jihad against the United States and other Western countries. But investigators had determined those contacts were ""consistent with research being conducted by Maj. Hasan."" Clerics at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia -- which Hasan attended when he lived in the area -- described him as a loner. Shaikh Shaker Elsayed said they were not successful in finding him a wife, and Imam Johari Abdul-Malik said some people believed Hasan changed after his mother's death in 2001. Galligan, a longtime military lawyer who now defends accused soldiers, said Hasan spends his days on base in bed. He has a Quran and can watch television, and a pail in his cell serves as his bathroom, the attorney said. Legal jockeying so far indicates the Article 32 hearing will be contentious. Last week, Galligan said he instructed Hasan not to cooperate with a government-ordered psychiatric evaluation. Col. Morgan Lamb, the officer overseeing the case, had indicated in January that the military would not ""meet with, test or examine"" Hasan until after the Article 32 hearing. But in a recent memo obtained by CNN, Lamb said he reversed his decision after the defense said in court last month that it may introduce mental capacity evidence for consideration in the case. Galligan denied the defense had made such a statement. The hearing could stretch into November, with the prosecution set to present its case through October 29, followed by a one-week recess when Fort Hood will mark the first anniversary of the shootings, referred to by some as ""5/11."" On Monday, a federal holiday with the base closed to journalists, there was little attention being paid to the upcoming hearing. A front-page story in the Killeen Daily Herald with the headline ""Hasan's Article 32 Hearing Begins Tuesday"" was dwarfed by stories on frozen Social Security benefits and delays in federal aid involving Tropical Storm Hermine. Soldiers showed little interest in talking about the shootings or the suspect, refusing to give their names and offering only brief responses that indicated they want the whole thing to be over. For Hansen, the hearing is the first step of what she believes will be a long process to bring justice to the victims, including Zeigler, who was hospitalized for 10 months in Texas and Minnesota. With all the attention on Hasan as the hearing approached, she said she ""cringed"" at how some of those wounded in the shootings struggled alone and unnoticed. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Fiance of wounded soldier says families of victims band together .

"(CNN) -- Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin took time off from his political duties on Sunday to try his hand at Formula One racing in St. Petersburg. As the world's best racing drivers battled it out at the penultimate race of the 2010 Formula One season in Brazil, Putin got behind the wheel of a F1 car for the first time and spent several hours test-driving a Renault vehicle on an empty stretch of road on the outskirts of his home city. The former president reached speeds of 150mph in the car and was pleased with his racing debut. ""For a first time, it was good,"" he told reporters afterwards. Putin -- who is expected to run for a third term in the presidential office in 2012 -- is no stranger to extreme activities and the 58-year-old has often been spotted on hunting and fishing trips, as well as riding motorbikes and piloting planes. However, Putin's attempt at motor racing comes just four years before Russia hosts its first ever grand prix in Sochi -- the same year as the Black Sea Resort will be the venue for the Winter Olympics.","Vladimir Putin had a go at Formula One racing in St Petersburg on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- MotoGP is in mourning following the tragic death of Japan's teenage rider Shoya Tomizawa after an accident in the San Marino Moto2 Grand Prix on Sunday. Tomizawa came off his Suter bike on a bend and was struck by the following bikes of Italian Alex de Angelis and Briton Scott Redding -- an impact which saw the 19-year-old thrown down the circuit and into the gravel. Race organizers confirmed that Tomizawa had died in hospital from serious injuries to his skull, chest and abdomen. A statement read: ""Shoya Tomizawa suffered a serious crash and subsequent cranial, thoracic and abdominal trauma. ""He was taken to hospital in Riccione for immediate treatment but succumbed to his injuries. All the MotoGP family wants to express its deepest condolences to his family and friends."" Tomizawa's death was the first in the sport since 24-year-old compatriot Daijiro Kato died in April 2003 at the Japanese MotoGP in Suzuka. Moto2 is the class below MotoGP and the main race followed before news of Tomizawa's death had been confirmed. Honda rider Dani Pedrosa of Spain claimed victory, his fourth of the season and second in a row, after starting from pole position. Compatriot and world championship leader Jorge Lorenzo finished second and world champion Valentino Rossi was third. However, there was an understandably subdued podium ceremony when confirmation of Tomizawa's death became known. ""It feels so strange, there is a big hole inside me. I was so happy and then I was told the news and this big hole opened up inside me,"" the 24-year-old Pedrosa told BBC TV. Rossi, winner of the race for the past two seasons, was visibly moved to tears, saying: ""When it happens like this nothing else really matters.""","MotoGP is in mourning following the tragic death of Japan's Shoya Tomizawa .

"(CNN) -- Scientists say they are a step closer to recreating the conditions at the birth of the universe and to understanding life as we know it, after the successful collision of heavy lead ions in a massive machine in Europe. This week, for the first time, ions were smashed together inside the Large Hadron Collider along the French and Swiss border. Until now, only protons had been collided in the experiment. The tiny particles' lightning-fast collision promised to produce temperatures up to 100,000 times hotter than the sun, said Michael Tuts, a professor in experimental high-energy physics at New York's Columbia University and one of hundreds of scientists involved in the project. ""What we're doing is reproducing the conditions that existed at the very early universe, a few millionths of a second after the Big Bang,"" said Tuts, referencing the cosmic explosion that many scientists believe spawned the universe from one minuscule particle. ALICE, an acronym for A Large Ion Collider Experiment, is run through the European Laboratory for Nuclear Research and involves physicists, engineers and technicians from around the world. Many of these scientists will examine the aftereffects of this latest ion collision as they try to step back further to the universe's emergence billions of years ago. The lead ion, Tuts explained, is a lead atom that does not contain electrons -- thus, is more likely reflective of what matter existed in the millionths of a second after the Big Bang. By combining more and more basic elements, scientists hope to better understand how various particles came together to create the modern-day universe and all it contains. ""We hope to understand how we're put together, how these (basic) constituents go on to make protons and neutrons, which in turn go on to make the atoms that you and I are made of,"" Tuts told CNN. Microseconds after the Big Bang, there was a ""hot soup"" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University, said last year. Although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons, neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it.","Lead ions have collided for the first time inside a massive machine in Europe .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people who fled fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are crossing back into rebel-held territory because they say conditions at refugee camps are intolerable. A crowd of refugees gathers at the entrance to a USAID center near Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo. With no food, water or sanitation in the camps, people have decided that it is worth the risk to return to their homes, even though rebels killed and raped many people just last week, residents told ITN's Jonathan Miller, who is near the city of Goma. Many of their villages have been looted and emptied of people by the rebels, they said. Roads were filled with people returning to rebel-held territory, carrying their belongings on their heads or on their backs. However, others, fearful of fresh violence, continued to leave their homes, overwhelming aid centers.  See photos of the refugee camps » . Aid groups were expected to travel into the Congo's rebel-held territory on Sunday to help tens of thousands of people displaced by the latest bout of rebel fighting. On Saturday, aid groups delivered food and water to a refugee camp north of Goma, traveling through a narrow ""humanitarian corridor"" the rebels established following a cease-fire with government forces that the rebels announced Wednesday. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the international community cannot allow Congo to become ""another Rwanda,"" where 800,000 died during a 1994 genocide. Western diplomats shuttled between Goma -- the scene of some of the worst fighting -- and Kigali, in neighboring Rwanda, to meet with leaders in order to get a peace process back on track.  Watch the diplomatic efforts » . ""The immediate needs are obvious,"" said British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner in a joint statement Sunday. ""We saw them yesterday. The cease-fire last Wednesday needs to be bolstered,"" Miliband and Kouchner said. ""The humanitarian needs for food, shelter, water and health care must be met through universal provision and secure routes for delivery."" The cease-fire seemed to be holding Sunday, but both sides appeared to be massing troops near the cease-fire line. Government soldiers flew in from the capital Kinshasa and deployed in the jungle, and rebels were out in force on their side of the line. ITN reporter Miller heard intermittent firing from the hills that mark the line where the two sides face off only a few hundred yards apart. A small contingent of United Nations troops in the area donned flak jackets and helmets in response.  Watch report on gunfire near cease-fire line » . Miller said it was not clear if the two sides were firing at each other. The latest fighting broke out on October 24 when Congolese rebels led by renegade Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda launched renewed attacks in the eastern province of North Kivu. It came days after a tenuous week-old U.N.-brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces fell apart. The fighting between Nkunda's rebels and Congolese army regulars displaced thousands of civilians almost immediately, the United Nations said. Many of the displaced fled to Goma, the capital of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda. Nkunda is the leader of the National Congress for the Defense of the People. His rebel forces declared a cease-fire late Wednesday after four days of fighting. The fighting is based on ethnic grievances. Nkunda says he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attacks by Rwandan Hutu rebels. During the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, the country's Hutu majority killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus, according to the United Nations. When Tutsis came to power in Rwanda, many Hutus crossed the border into Congo.  They were afraid to return home, fearing they would be targeted for revenge by Tutsis, so they remained in the jungles of eastern Congo, where they preyed on local residents. In May 2005, it was reported that Rwandan Hutu rebels in eastern Congo carried out hundreds of summary executions, rapes, beatings and kidnappings of Congolese civilians in the province of South Kivu, according to GlobalSecurity.org. Nkunda, a Tutsi, has repeatedly blamed the Congolese government for failing to protect the Tutsis from attacks by Rwandan Hutus. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"(CNN) -- Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn believes Michael Schumacher can show improvement when the Formula One circuit moves to China next week. The seven-time world champion has struggled to challenge for a podium place in three races since returning to motorsport's elite class, and has been outperformed by young teammate Nico Rosberg. But Brawn, whose team won the world title last year after a scintillating start to the campaign, believes that the 41-year-old Schumacher has suffered from problems not within his control. While Rosberg claimed third place in Malaysia, Schumacher was forced to retire with a wheel nut problem. ""Achieving our first podium of the season with Nico was very rewarding in Malaysia at the home race of our title partner Petronas and a timely boost for the team,"" Brawn told F1's official Web site. ""Michael also had a strong weekend and is getting more up to speed with every race, although circumstances beyond his control limited his race performance in Melbourne and Sepang. ""We hope to continue these signs of improvement in China and it would be particularly good for Michael to be able to have a clean race and show the progress that he has made since the start of the season. ""I am very pleased with the performance of our drivers. We've achieved a reasonable set of results which are in line with the car's current pace, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that we are not quick enough to compete right at the front at the moment. This is obviously not a situation that we are happy with and we are working as hard as possible to close the gap."" Schumacher is 10th in the drivers' standings after finishing sixth and 10th in the first two races, while fellow German Rosberg is fifth -- four points behind overall leader Felipe Massa of Ferrari. ""The enthusiasm for Mercedes-Benz and the support of the fans is very big in China so we have an attractive race ahead of us in Shanghai next weekend, Schumacher said. ""I am confident that the fans will not leave the race disappointed. We looked quite reasonable in Malaysia at the last race and maybe things will play into our hands again in Shanghai. I am looking forward to the race and fully enjoying the competition again. ""Admittedly the last two races have not been very fortunate for me, but I am very much aware of the reasons for it. I know how things go in F1 and if you look into the detail of the two races, I think everything is still going according to plan. You can only improve step by step, and I am confident that we are achieving this.""","Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn says Michael Schumacher not to blame for problems .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Protesters of a tuition hike at University of California campuses stood their ground into Friday night, with 41 demonstrators at UC Berkeley cited for trespassing after their takeover of a campus building. Nearly 100 protesters at UC campuses have been arrested over the past two days in the demonstrations over a 32 percent tuition increase. The demonstrators, students and nonstudents alike, were cited for trespassing, spokeswoman Claire Holmes told CNN. Holmes said those arrested would be cited and released rather than taken to jail, per agreement with student leaders. Three students were arrested earlier at Berkeley in the wake of protests across several campuses that have shaken up the University of California system a day after officials approved a tuition increase to be enacted over the next two school years. University officials said the $505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made because of California's persistent financial crisis. Protesting students said the hike will hurt working and middle-class students who benefit from state-funded education. The first tuition hike, which takes effect in January, will raise undergraduate tuition to $8,373. The second hike kicks in next fall, raising tuition to $10,302, said university spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka. Students who live on campus could pay up to an estimated $17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing, according to the system's July 2008 finance guide. The January increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition hike last year. On average, tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide increased 6.5 percent, or to $7,020, since the previous school year, according to data from College Board. Students eligible for financial aid and whose families make under $70,000 will have their tuition covered, the university said. Caitlin Lawrence Toombs, a UCLA student, told CNN she'd have to request additional loans to pay for school and that with her brother starting at Berkeley soon the cost would place a heavier burden on her family. She, too, participated in the student outcries against the increase, she said. And many other students had yet to back down Friday. On the Santa Cruz campus -- where building occupations began last week with a library sit-in -- about 100 students staged a sit-in in the second-floor lobby of Kerr Hall soon after hearing the tuition hike had been approved, according to UC Santa Cruz Provost David Kliger. Many remained there Friday afternoon. The demonstrators made demands, Kliger said without listing them. They would not keep exits clear and broke into some parts of the building, he said, adding they are trespassing and could be arrested. In addition, the students could face suspension or expulsion. ""We cherish the principle of free speech,"" Kliger said. ""Regrettably, these actions go well beyond that."" At UC Berkeley on Friday morning, students occupied the second floor of Wheeler Hall, UC Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said. Campus police broke through a barricaded of furniture and office equipment on the ground floor and arrested three students, she said. The protesters demanded the reinstatement of 38 custodial staff members recently laid off, according to a Berkeley news release. The demonstrators also asked for amnesty and for a drop of charges against any protesters. Are you there? Share your images, video . An additional 250 demonstrators remained outside Wheeler Hall into the night, according to Holmes. Authorities arrested dozens of angry students on the campus late Thursday after they refused to vacate the school's administration building. The 52 students were taken into custody by the Davis Police Department and deputies from the Yolo County Sheriff's Department, according to Claudia Morain, a UC Davis spokeswoman. The arrests at Mrak Hall, the campus' main administration building, came about four hours after the normal 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) closing time. At one point, as many as 150 students were at the building protesting the tuition increase, Morain said. UCLA's Campbell Hall was occupied for several hours Thursday evening, a school spokesman said. The takeover was not planned or sanctioned by the main protest organizer -- the United State Student Association, according to USSA representative Gabby Madriz. The same building was briefly occupied Wednesday night by several dozen student protesters, according to a UCLA news release. The building was the site of the 1969 shooting deaths of two Black Panther Party members during an internal dispute, according to the release. The UCLA campus was the scene of the largest and loudest demonstrations Thursday. ""We're fired up. Can't take it no more,"" students chanted as they marched and waved signs at UCLA. ""Education only for the rich,"" one sign read. Some faculty members and campus workers -- worried about furloughs and layoffs to come -- joined the protesting students. ""Stop cuts in education and research,"" a sign carried by a teacher said. After the regents voted, students rushed to parking decks to stage a sit-in to block regents' vehicles from leaving. Campus police and California Highway Patrol officers in riot gear stood nearby. As one regent member walked out, students lining his path shouted, ""Shame on you, shame on you."" The situation ended without incident as students gradually left the scene. University executives told the regents the fee hikes are needed because they've already made deep spending cuts in the past two years -- cuts forced by the state budget. About 26 percent of the $20 billion spent each year by the system comes from the state's general fund coupled with tuition and fees paid by students, according to a summary on the regent's Web site. The fee increases are to be balanced by a raise in ""the level of financial assistance for needy low- and middle-income students,"" according to a statement from the Board of Regents. The tuition hike is expected to raise $505 million for the university system, and about $175 million of that money is to go toward student financial aid, the board said. CNN's Alan Duke, Augie Martin, Greg Morrison and Lynn Lamanivong contributed to this report.","NEW: Nearly 100 have been arrested at UC campuses over the past two days .

"(CNN) -- Nick Heidfeld has joined Mercedes as back-up for Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg to complete the new team's line-up for the 2010 Formula One season. The 32-year-old, who raced for BMW Sauber for the past four years and has a decade of experience in motorsport's elite category, will take on a testing role and also be a reserve driver. ""I am very pleased to be joining the Mercedes GP Petronas Formula One team,"" the German told official Web site www.mercedes-gp.com on Thursday. ""It's the team which has attracted the most interest in the close season, not only because of the comeback of Michael Schumacher, but also because this season sees the return of the Silver Arrows cars as a Mercedes-Benz works team for the first time in over 50 years. ""While I would of course have preferred a seat as an active driver, I am really proud to be part of the new Silver Arrows team. I have seen how committed everyone at the team is and I feel the same. I will be doing my very best to support Michael and Nico this year."" Heidfeld has a long association with Mercedes, which took over the world champion Brawn team at the end of last year. He was supported by the German manufacturer as a junior driver, and then was test driver for McLaren Mercedes for the 1998 and 1999 seasons before earning his first race drive with Prost in 2000. Since then he has competed in 167 grands prix, achieving 12 podium finishes, but was left without a team when BMW pulled out of F1 last year. He joins a team led by Ross Brawn, who led the outfit to shock double world titles in 2009 as Jenson Button won the drivers' crown and Rubens Barrichello placed third overall to help clinch the manufacturers' championship. Button has since moved to McLaren while veteran Brazilian Barrichello joined Williams, one of Heidfeld's former teams.","Nick Heidfeld joins Mercedes as back-up for Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- An Indonesian volcano has killed 240 people since it started erupting in October, officials said Saturday, a day after it spewed more hot ash and sent residents fleeing. More than 390,000 people have been displaced, according to the nation's disaster coordination board. At least 162 people suffered severe burns, the board said on its website. Indonesia's Mount Merapi started erupting on October 26. On Friday, it spewed volcanic material for more than an hour. Merapi, which looms on the horizon north of the major city of Yogyakarta, is on the island of Java. Officials said Thursday the worst may be over, but a danger zone remains within a 20-kilometer (12.2-mile) radius of the volcano. Government experts have kept Merapi's alert level at 4, the highest. President Obama was forced to cut short his visit to Indonesia this week because of the volcano's ash cloud. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called the volcanic eruptions a crisis situation. Over the weekend, he and several ministers visited the area to oversee relief efforts. The volcano has a summit elevation of almost 3,000 meters (10,000 feet). It is one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes and lies in one of the world's most densely populated areas. About 1,300 people died when the volcano erupted in 1930. Many people continue to live in the shadow of the volcano, raising crops and livestock.

"Washington (CNN) -- A suburban Washington county official at the center of an FBI investigation into years of kickbacks says he is innocent and that the facts will prove it. Jack Johnson, who served as the executive of Prince George's County, Maryland, since 2002, spoke to reporters late Friday after the FBI released details of how he and his wife allegedly tried to hide checks and evidence of illegal payments, even going so far as to flush a $100,000 check down the toilet. The Johnsons were both charged with tampering with evidence and destruction of records after they appeared in federal court late Friday in Greenbelt, Maryland, just outside the U.S. capital. ""I'm innocent of these charges and I just can't wait for the facts to come out,"" said Johnson. ""When they come out, I am absolutely convinced that I'm going to be -- that we will be vindicated."" An affidavit by an FBI investigator whose team was monitoring wiretaps detailed a dramatic end to an alleged years-long kickback scheme organized by the couple. Read the affidavit (pdf) After the Johnsons were arrested, FBI agents searched their Mitchellville, Maryland, home, walking out with at least 10 boxes filled with evidence. U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein stressed the investigation is continuing. The Johnsons were released on their own recognizance, but Jack Johnson will be required to wear a monitoring device and presumably will be allowed to continue serving out the last weeks of his expiring term as county executive if he chooses. The judge, however, ordered him not to attempt to destroy any evidence. Jack Johnson had been the Prince George's County prosecutor prior to his eight years as executive. Leslie Johnson was just recently elected to the nine-member Prince George's County Council. ""We socialize with them and it's just shocking,"" a female neighbor of the Johnsons told CNN affiliate WUSA on Friday. ""They're very nice people, very kind people."" The 10-page affidavit says the FBI began investigating Johnson in 2006 when it learned that certain real estate developers were paying Johnson for contracts. That led to ""a series of authorizations for the interception of wire communications."" The frantic end began early Friday when Johnson allegedly received a $15,000 payoff, and the FBI suddenly barged into the room to demand an explanation. Johnson told them the cash was for a party marking the end of his tenure as county executive. He also claimed he had no dealings with the developer who was with him. The FBI says Johnson made a series of false statements. The agents let him go but then eavesdropped on a series of frantic phone calls between the couple as Jack Johnson and the FBI headed for the Johnsons' Mitchellville home. ""Two women (agents) are at the door,"" Leslie told her husband. ""Don't answer it,"" Jack said. He told her to run upstairs to their bedroom and go to ""my drawer."" ""You will see a check in there that (an unidentified developer) wrote to me,"" he said. The affidavit says that when Leslie found the check, Jack told her to tear it up. ""Do you want me to put it down the toilet?"" she asked. Jack Johnson replied, ""Yes, flush that."" The agents monitoring the phone calls heard a flushing sound. Leslie Johnson grabbed cash from the bedroom and also ran to the basement and grabbed more cash. ""Put in your bra and walk out or something, I don't know what to do,"" Jack Johnson said. ""I have it in my bra,"" his wife replied. Agents then searched Leslie Johnson and found $79,600 in her underwear, the FBI affidavit says. The wild ending may end up costing the Johnsons. The FBI says there is probable cause to believe that the pair ""tampered with ... evidence and engaged in destruction, alteration, and falsification of records in a federal investigation."" The FBI document does not say how much money Johnson may have received in kickbacks or bribes. It does say at least some of the funds involved were targeted from an $80 million budget for programs supported by federal grants such as those from Department of Housing and Community Development.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi everyone. I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News. We are commercial free and coming directly to your classroom from the CNN Center in Atlanta. Let's go ahead and get things started right now. First Up: Katrina - Then and Now . AZUZ: First up, remembering a day five years ago that changed the lives of thousands of Americans: the day that Hurricane Katrina made landfall. Ceremonies and vigils took place all across the U.S. Gulf Coast yesterday. There's been a lot of progress and rebuilding since Katrina hit, but most people agree that there's still a lot that needs doing. During a visit to the Gulf yesterday, President Obama talked about the struggles facing the region. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I don't have to tell you that there are still too many vacant and overgrown lots. There are still too many students attending classes in trailers. There are still too many people unable to find work. And there are still too many New Orleans folks who haven't been able to come home. So, while an incredible amount of progress has been made, on this fifth anniversary, I wanted to come here and tell the people of this city directly, my administration is going to stand with you and fight alongside you until the job is done. AZUZ: If you were with us on Friday, you might remember the preview we gave you of ""Katrina: Then and Now."" It's a special project that compares New Orleans right after Katrina hit with how the city looks five years later. Today, we have the full report for you. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO) LAUREN DIMAGGIO, METAIRIE, LOUISIANA: Everything was gray, just like when you saw after 9/11 where, you know, the streets were all gray. You could not find any greenery. Nobody, no one coming down the street. It was very eerie, very eerie to be just in the silence. That's what I remember, it just being so quiet. CONRAD WYRE III, HARVEY, LOUISIANA: There's nothing, nothing really changed. I mean, like, you have an overturned car in the middle of the street. Yes, we moved that, but that's it. Like I said, the people are not coming back. You don't see the commerce, and it's like some parts of the city are still like a ghost town. It's just a reality that we have. It's like, hey, this is how we live and this is what we have to deal with. DIMAGGIO: In the photo with the shrimp boat that is going a little ways into the house, where that boat came from I don't know. But it's at the end of a street close to a levee, which right on the other side is a body of water. So, I don't know where this boat came from, but it certainly didn't belong on the street. JOYCE BERGMAN, NEW ORLEANS: I took pictures of a church. It was a church, basically, right behind me across the street. It was a two-story church with a huge set of stairs going up to it. And it collapsed sometime during the storm, so it was collapsed when I came back. The whole site has been cleared since, and now just the stairs are there. DIMAGGIO: I am hoping now that people will realize they have, whatever number it is, how many died in Mississippi, how many died in the Lower Ninth Ward. But really, you'll get to see, you know, it wasn't just that weekend or those few months, it continues. People are still affected by what happened. (END VIDEO) Atlantic Hurricanes . AZUZ: Very powerful images there. Well, you science students, budding meteorologists might be interested in our next story today. We're talking about a couple of weather systems. Last Friday, we told you about Tropical Storm Earl. Experts thought it might strengthen into a hurricane. It did. Earl became a category 1 hurricane yesterday. Forecasters think it could increase into a category 3 hurricane. Danielle, the storm that came before it, made it up to a category 4 storm status, although it was back down to a category 1 by Sunday afternoon. Officials still don't think it'll hit the U.S., but Danielle is causing dangerous riptides, or strong currents. More than 200 people had to be rescued Saturday off the coast of Maryland. Authorities said most of them were swimmers who had gotten exhausted from fighting the currents. Indonesia Volcano . AZUZ: Moving over to Indonesia, where thousands of people are trying to get away from this: It's a volcano, and it erupted over the weekend. That was kind of a surprise, since it hasn't done that in more than 400 years! Around 12,000 people who live in nearby villages were evacuated. This volcano last erupted in the 1600s. Officials say that because it's been inactive for so long, they don't know exactly what to expect. But, emergency response teams are on the scene. The Indonesian government says the situation is under control. Experts don't think there's too much risk of a large, destructive eruption. Freed American Home . AZUZ: The man stepping off of this airplane is former U.S. President Jimmy Carter; you see him right there. He got back from a trip to North Korea on Friday, and he brought Aijalon Mahli Gomes back home with him. Gomes is a U.S. citizen who was arrested in North Korea back in January for illegally entering the country. Former President Carter went to North Korea on a private, humanitarian mission to try and get Gomes released. Shoutout . BARBARA BALL, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which of these historic figures spoke at the 1963 March on Washington? Was it: A) Malcom X, B) Medgar Evers, C) Martin Luther King Jr. or D) Rosa Parks? You've got three seconds -- GO! Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's ""I Have a Dream"" speech was given at the March on Washington. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Rallies in D.C. AZUZ: You history students are familiar with the speech. It was one of the defining moments of the American Civil Rights Movement. In it, Dr. King talked about his dream of people from different races living together peacefully and being judged by their character rather than their skin color. This past weekend marked the 47th anniversary of the march on Washington. The ""Reclaim the Dream"" rally commemorated the occasion. It took place this past Saturday in Washington. Thousands of people were there. It started at a local high school and ended on the National Mall, at the site of the future Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial. That's just a few blocks away from the Lincoln Memorial, and that was where Dr. King gave the ""I Have a Dream"" speech in 1963. And it's also where another major rally took place on Saturday, the ""Restoring Honor"" rally. It was organized by conservative commentator Glenn Beck. Some reports estimated that tens of thousands of people gathered for the event. Beck said that the goal of the rally was to reclaim the Civil Rights Movement from politics. Is This Legit? SHELBY LIN, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The U.S. birth rate has gone up every year during the past decade. Not legit! Recently, it's been heading in the opposite direction. Birth Rate . AZUZ: So, here's an interesting question: Could the recession be connected to a decrease in the U.S. birth rate? At least one expert thinks the recession is the reason why. He says that when people are unsure of their financial future, they tend to put off having kids because, as some parents will tell you, kids are expensive. Now, the theory would seem to match up against this: In 2007, when the economy started to get weaker, there were 14.3 babies born for every 1,000 people. In 2008, the birth rate dropped to 13.9. Last year, it went down to 13.5. That same expert thinks that when the economy comes back, the birth rate will too. Beef Recall . AZUZ: About 8,500 pounds of ground beef are being recalled because of concerns about E. coli. That's a kind of bacteria that can make you very sick. Three people -- two in Maine, one in New York -- did get sick from E. coli. Officials connected that to certain shipments of ground beef, and that's what led to this recall. Fortunately, none of the three people who got sick needed to go to the hospital. Promo . AZUZ: Well, Fix Our Schools is a CNN project that takes a look at public education in America and focuses on some of the creative solutions that administrators and teachers and school officials and, yes, students are coming up with to cope, even as schools cope with budget crises nationwide. We're gonna have special coverage on CNN Student News with ideas from students on what works in their school and what could make school better. You won't want to miss it. It will be right here on CNN Student News. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go today, one last story, we're gonna butter you up. But it looks like we've got plenty to spare. 800 pounds' worth. That is how much butter it takes to create this edible artwork. If you eat straight butter. My aunt eats straight butter. I think it's gross. This butter sculpture is the main attraction at the New York State Fair. It's pretty impressive with all these details. I'd say the butter artists deserve a pat on the back. The butter sculptures have been showcased at the fair for decades. Goodbye . AZUZ:  They churn out a new one pretty regularly. And yes, we're spreading it on pretty thick. Buy hey, butter you gonna do? For CNN Student News, I'm melting.","Compare New Orleans today with how it looked after Hurricane Katrina hit .

"Palm Beach County, Florida (CNN) -- I am a U.S. Army veteran and I was once homeless and struggling with addiction. After I got out of the service, I was introduced to alcohol and drugs. I ended up on the street where I lived in drug houses, and saw shootings and crime of all types. The places I encountered when I was looking for a safe haven were no better than the streets. That's when the commitment in my heart to help homeless veterans was born. I've since dedicated my life to this cause. In 1994 I founded a nonprofit organization, Faith*Hope*Love*Charity, with another formerly homeless veteran, the late Donald Reed. In May 2000, the vision became a reality and the doors to Stand Down House, a transitional living facility for homeless male veterans, opened. After being named a Top Ten CNN Hero in 2009, I was able to complete my vision of providing a resource center that provides housing and services for women as well. About a quarter of homeless adults in this country are veterans, according to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans, yet the Census shows veterans represent only 10 percent of the civilian population. Studies vary because homeless populations are difficult to count, but on any given night, from 107,000 to 300,000 veterans are homeless. In the early years, we were mainly helping older vets. Now, we are seeing younger men, some in their 20s, many who have served in the war on terror, needing help. They may have different struggles from the older vets, but they still benefit from the same camaraderie. These men are also struggling with mental and physical illnesses, addictions and other issues related to combat, service and life.  They also get help with the interpersonal problems they cause. We help them regain their lives, just like regained mine. I not only wanted to help homeless veterans, I wanted to help them before they became homeless, before they have to live through what I did. My charity in Palm Beach County, Florida, assists veterans, soldiers, and  their families by providing supportive services, financial assistance, housing, mental health service referrals and more. I do what I do because I am one of them. It's as simple as that. I practice what we are taught in the service, that no man should be left behind. We are still brothers-in-arms. Our ""First Stop Veterans' Resource Center,"" FSVRC, helps with emergency financial aid, referrals, VA-SSA benefit information, employment assistance, and more, regardless of where the veterans live or service members are stationed. The needs are vast. For example, in early 2008, foreclosure rates in military communities increased at four times the national average. Veterans lead the nation in homelessness, substance abuse, depression and suicide, according the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. For veterans, especially those who have recently come back from active duty, the search for a job can be harder than it is for civilians. Skills learned in service or honed on the battlefield are not easily translated to the regular job market. Add to that the need for a period of readjustment to civilian life and dealing with physical and mental injuries. Earlier this year, the unemployment rate for both male and female vets from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was significantly higher than that of nonveterans, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs,  between 6,500 and 7,000 female vets in the United States are homeless, with almost nowhere for them to get help --  especially when compared with the number of facilities for homeless male veterans. It doesn't make sense when you look at the numbers. Women are four times more likely to end up homeless than their male counterparts. They make up around 15 percent of all veterans; 11 percent of Iraq War and Afghanistan War vets are women, 40 percent of active duty females have children, and 11 percent are single parents.  Many women are losing custody of their kids because of their active duty status  and deployment. Our First Stop Resource Center's housing program provides temporary housing and support services for these at-risk and homeless female veterans, with and without children, and families of soldiers and veterans. My commitment and my day does not end with my charity. I am a member of the Veterans Advisory Committee and Palm Beach County Veterans Task Force. I have helped with the burials of indigent veterans. I am also opening a local Veterans Court to help prevent veterans from cycling through the courts and to get them the help they really need. Many have resorted to drug use and other negative behaviors to deal with their combat and service experience, and wind up in our criminal justice system. In fact, I just got the news that our first case will be heard there on November 18. Helping our veterans and seeing them happy makes it all worth it. No man or woman will be left behind as long as we are this nation. That is why I do what I do 24-7-365. Isn't that what our veterans have done and continue to do for all of us? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roy Foster.","Army veteran Roy Foster struggled with addiction and homelessness .

"(Rolling Stone)  -- In the new issue of Rolling Stone, on stands in the digital archives this Friday, Phil Collins says he believes that he may have lived past lives -- and that he's contemplated suicide. The reclusive singer -- who hasn't released an album of new material in nearly ten years -- took writer Erik Hedegaard into his surprisingly modest home in Switzerland and explained that most of his time is now spent working on his gigantic collection of artifacts from the Alamo and raising his two young sons from his last marriage. Photos: Thirty Years of Genesis . Decades of criticism have taken their toll, and Collins says he has little desire to create more music beyond his new disc of Motown covers, Going Back. Rolling Stone: Collins' Motown road show brings soul classics . ""I sometimes think I'm going to write this Phil Collins character out of the story,"" the singer says. ""Phil Collins will just disappear or be murdered in some hotel bedroom, and people will say, 'What happened to Phil?' And the answer will be, 'He got murdered, but, yeah, anyway, let's carry on.' That kind of thing."" Other highlights from the article: . • Collins has noticed glowing, semitransparent light orbs in a series of photos he took at the Alamo. ""It's paranormal energy,"" he explains, noting that a psychic recently told him he fought at the fort in a previous lifetime. ""I don't want to sound like a weirdo. I'm not Shirley MacLaine, but I'm prepared to believe. You've seen the pictures. You can't deny them, so therefore it's possible that I was there in another life."" Rolling Stone: Collins on overcoming nerve damage . • A neck injury has left him unable to hold drum sticks, sign his signature or even (at times) wipe himself in the bathroom. ""I was going to stop drumming anyway,"" he says. ""I had stopped. I don't miss it."" • Collins admits that he's had suicidal thoughts in recent years. ""I wouldn't blow my head off,"" he says. ""I'd overdose or do something that didn't hurt. But I wouldn't do that to the children. A comedian who committed suicide in the sixties left a note saying,'Too many things went wrong too often.' I often think about that."" Copyright © 2010 Rolling Stone.","Singer Phil Collins says he believes that he may have lived past lives .

"(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo kept the MotoGP title race alive with victory at the Indianapolis Grand Prix on Sunday as world champion Valentino Rossi crashed out. Valentino Rossi ploughed into the grass alongside the Indianapolis circuit when he crashed out. Rossi saw his lead halved to 25 points with five races remaining as the Italian failed to finish for the first time since 2007. He went down on lap nine of 28 when battling for the lead with Yamaha teammate Lorenzo, and was able to remount -- but then had to retire two laps later due to his damaged motorcycle. Lorenzo had started the American race from second on the grid, ahead of Rossi but behind his fellow Spaniard Dani Pedrosa. Pedrosa, who won at Laguna Seca in California earlier this year and is fourth overall, suffered a crash on just the fourth lap while still leading. He picked up his Repsol Honda machine and rejoined the race in last place, but could only finish 10th. Lorenzo cruised to victory more than nine seconds clear of Alex de Angelis, who earned his first podium finish after starting fourth on the grid for San Carlo Honda Gresini. The 22-year-old now has 187 points, behind eight-time world champion Rossi's 212. ""Before this race I was telling the press that it was almost impossible, whereas now I would say it is difficult, but not impossible,"" Lorenzo told the MotoGP Web site of his title chances. He was delighted after having himself failed to finish the last two races at Brno and Donington. ""Today the situation has changed completely and now it has happened to Valentino and Dani, unfortunately for them. However, for me, the situation is good,"" Lorenzo said. ""It was difficult to keep my concentration for 20 laps, because it was a little bit boring. Bit you cannot relax when it is like that because if you think about something else you could crash. Anyway, I had some fun on the last lap and it is a very nice feeling!"" Former world champion Nicky Hayden finished third in his best result since joining Ducati, with the American having finished second in the inaugural Indianapolis event last year before switching teams. He managed to hold off a late challenge from Andrea Dovizioso, his replacement at Repsol Honda, while American Colin Edwards came home in fifth on his Monster Yamaha Tech 3. British rider James Toseland equaled his best finish in MotoGP when he claimed sixth for Edwards' team after Italian Marco Melandri crashed late on.","Jorge Lorenzo keeps MotoGP title race alive with victory at Indianapolis .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Motor vehicle accidents don't just impact the people involved, they also impact the economy, to the tune of just under $100 billion for medical care and injury-related productivity losses in the United States each year, according to a study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday. That includes $3.6 billion annually toward injuries to children. On average, each licensed driver in the United States ponies up about $500 a year toward the total costs, the CDC said. ""Every 10 seconds, someone in the United States is treated in an emergency department for crash-related injuries, and nearly 40,000 people die from these injuries each year. This study highlights the magnitude of the problem of crash-related injuries from a cost perspective, and the numbers are staggering,"" Dr. Grant Baldwin, the director of the CDC's Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in a press release. According to the study, injuries, both fatal and nonfatal, to people riding in cars and light trucks cost $70 billion a year. Injuries to motorcyclists cost $12 billion. Bicyclists and pedestrians, who are vulnerable against motor vehicles, cost $5 billion and $10 billion a year respectively, the CDC said. The study also found the amount of money that goes toward motorcyclists' and pedestrians' injuries is disproportionate when compared to the number of injuries, likely due to the severity of their injuries. While motorcyclists only account for 6 percent of motor vehicle-related fatalities and injuries, they lead to 12 percent of the costs. And pedestrians, who only comprise 5 percent of motor vehicle-related deaths and injuries, consume 10 percent of the total costs, according to the study. The CDC said several policy initiatives have been proven to cut down on crash injuries and deaths, including graduated driver licensing programs, which allow new teen drivers to get road experience in low-risk situations. The CDC says strong graduated driver licensing laws have been associated with up to 40 percent decreases in crashes among 16-year-old drivers. Other CDC-recommended policies include child safety seat education, seat belt laws and enforcement, sobriety checkpoints, and motorcycle and bicycle helmet laws. The CDC said the study, published in the the journal ""Traffic Injury Prevention,"" used data from 2005, the last year from which relevant data were available from multiple sources.","Motor vehicle crashes lead to about $100 billion a year in U.S. costs, says the CDC .

"(CNN)  -- AC Milan went top of Serie A for the first time this season with a 3-1 victory over Palermo in the San Siro as previous leaders Lazio lost 1-0 at newly-promoted Cesena Wednesday. Pato opened the scoring for Milan before Armin Bacinovic equalized for the Sicilians but a Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty and late Robinho third gave Milan a comfortable win. Their joy was complete as city rivals and reigning champions Inter were held to a 1-1 draw at Lecce and drop to fourth. Diego Milito scored ony his third goal of the season on 76 minutes as he returns from injury, but Uruguayan Ruben Oliver leveled for Lecce just three minutes later. Napoli moved above Inter to third as Ezequiel Lavezz grabbed an injury time winner at Cagliari. Lazio were suffering their second straight defeat after going down to AS Roma in the capital city derby at the weekend. Marco Parolo scored the only goal of the game five minutes from time to sink Lazio. Turin giants Juventus are in fifth after a 1-1 draw at Brescia as Alessandro Diamanti equalized after Fabio Quagliarella's opener. In Spain's Copa Del Rey, Real Madrid thumped Real Murcia 5-1 at home to avoid the domestic cup upsets of recent seasons. The first leg had ended goalless. Esteban Granero's early goal put Real ahead before Gonzalo Higuain's controversial second, which saw Sergio Ramos clearly obstruct visiting goalkeeper Dani Hernandez from an offside position. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso settled the match in the Bernebeu in the second half. But Murcia scored a consolation through Pedro's late penalty. Barcelona are also safely through to the next round, thrashing AD Cueta 5-1 at Camp Nou. Already 2-0 up after the first leg, goals from Nolito and Gabriel Milito gave the hosts a two-goal lead inside the first 10 minutes, although the visitors pulled a goal back through Guzman after 35 minutes.

"United Nations (CNN) -- A U.N. expert panel alleges that North Korea exported banned nuclear and ballistic missile technology to several rogue nations. The 75-page report, complied by a seven-member panel reporting to the United Nations Security Council, states that North Korea is involved in ""nuclear and ballistic missile-related activities in certain countries, including Iran, Syria and Myanmar"" and that special attention should be given by all member countries to inhibit such activities. The report, which was released this week, had been delayed from publication for six months by China, a friendly nation to North Korea, according to a diplomat familiar with the case. The diplomat spoke in a background briefing and did not want to be identified. Read more of CNN's coverage on North Korea . The experts write that North Korea is getting around U.N.-imposed sanctions and is masking financial transactions by the use of ""overseas entities, shell companies, informal transfer mechanisms, cash couriers and barter arrangements."" The report goes on to state that North Korea ""has established a highly sophisticated international network for the acquisition, marketing and sale of arms and military equipment, and arms exports have become one of the country's principal sources for obtaining foreign exchange."" The report detailed some of the ways is says North Korea -- formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) -- gets around U.N. sanctions: . --The DPRK is believed to use air cargo to handle high-valued and sensitive arms exports. Such cargo can be sent by direct air cargo from the DPRK to the destination country. Some modern cargo planes, for example, can fly non-stop from the DPRK to Iran, when routed directly through neighboring air space. --A technique now being used by the DPRK to conceal its arms exports is to ship components for the assembly of arms overseas in the form of ""knock-down kits"" which can be delivered to foreign assembly plants, the report says. In some cases, this is a turn-key operation with the participation of DPRK scientists, technicians and specialists. The North Korean government had no immediate response to the report. The United Nations Security Council imposed its last sanctions on North Korea in 2009 after the country conducted a nuclear test.","A U.N. report says North Korea exported nuclear and missile technology .

"(CNN) -- Passengers who disembarked from a Carnival Cruise Lines ship that was towed to port after losing power earlier this week gave mixed reviews on the experience, with several declaring it ""an adventure."" ""A lot of things went wrong, but it was really fun,"" said one small passenger, Ryan Harlan, who was traveling with his parents. ""We went to the Kids' Camp."" He said the Kids' Camp was, in fact, his favorite part, because he made some friends. And the worst part? ""Being stranded in the middle of the ocean,"" he said. Some 3,300 passengers left the ship Thursday after the three-day ordeal that began with a fire in the ship's engine room Monday. Engineers were unable to restore power to the ship after the fire was extinguished, leaving passengers without air conditioning, hot showers or decent meals. Instead, they had to settle for Spam and Pop-Tarts dropped off by the USS Ronald Reagan, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that came to assist. The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was investigating the onboard fire. Passengers said they were not told there was a fire. Guest Marquis Horace said the cruise line told passengers there was ""a flameless fire. ... Everybody just laughed."" And passenger Ken King said guests were told there was ""a lot of smoke."" ""It was absolutely deplorable,"" Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and ""they started making mayo sandwiches."" ""I expected a really nice time and it was like Gilligan's Island or something,"" he said. He said he ate a lot of bananas and dry cereal, but at one point didn't want to eat anymore because the smell of overflowing toilets, spoiled food and rotten milk was overwhelming. Once the USS Ronald Reagan showed up to assist, passengers felt safer, he said. And the Navy provided good food -- Horace said he particularly enjoyed the bean burritos. ""We tried to make the best of it,"" said Horace, who was traveling with his best friend for both of their birthdays. ""It just completely got ruined."" Some of the elderly passengers on board particularly struggled, he said. One woman, who used a scooter, could not take the stairs, and other passengers had to help her and carry the scooter. Horace said the woman across the hall from him was a diabetic, and her insulin had to be kept cold, but there was no way to do that. He said he and his companion had to help her to the bathroom. At one point, ""she was crying because she had no food,"" he said. One passenger was wheeled off the Splendor on a stretcher and was taken to a waiting ambulance, CNN affiliate KGTV reported. Horace said passengers brushed their teeth with bottled water, and ""showering in the dark is not fun."" ""All that stuff we take for granted was totally missed,"" Horace said. He told CNN affiliate KFMB some of the floors were ""saturated with feces and urine"" after the toilets backed up. ""It was really nasty,"" he said. Trying to navigate the ship in the dark was ""like a search and rescue mission,"" said passenger Josh Vest, who was on his honeymoon. One woman, who said she worked for the cruise line, was wearing a T-shirt that said, ""I survived the 2010 Carnival Cruise Spamcation."" Vendors met passengers at the port, selling the shirts for $20. ""The first part of it was OK,"" King said of the cruise. ""The food was great, staff was great."" But after the fire, he said, the food ""actually got worse. The toilets didn't work for about 12 hours."" Chris Harlan, Ryan's father, agreed. ""The first night was great when we got aboard, dancing and all that stuff,"" he told CNN affiliate KUSI. ""We called it an early night, and the next morning you could just feel the ship rattling, and we looked out the window and we could see smoke from our balcony."" Several people said the experience was ""an adventure."" ""Everything, from the military, to cold water showers, to Spam, to salads every day,"" Chris Harlan told CNN. Several passengers described long lines for food. But ""Carnival did a great job with the resources they had,"" he said. ""I can't say enough. The crew was great. ... We just made the most of it."" The vessel became stranded Monday off the coast of Mexico after the fire. While Carnival said Wednesday that most passengers knew that the Splendor's crew was doing the best it could, there were reports of passengers pledging not to take up the company's offer of a free replacement trip. Because the ship was without most of its power, the company decided to wait until daylight Thursday for tugboats to deliver the Splendor to a dock, Carnival Cruise Lines CEO Gerry Cahill said at a news conference. One passenger, David Zambrano, a KUSA-TV employee, called his Denver, Colorado, station Wednesday from his cell phone and said many passengers were in the dark in their cabins and had to wait in line for two hours to eat the cold meals, which were being delivered to the ship by helicopter from the USS Ronald Reagan. ""Many of the people I have talked to said that they will never take another cruise again, especially with Carnival,"" said Zambrano. Others, however, said they would return. In addition to offering a free cruise, Carnival has promised passengers a refund and said it will cover their transportation costs. ""Conditions on the ship have been challenging,"" said Cahill, reiterating the cruise line's apologies to families. ""We're disappointed about it. Reports from the ship show guests believe we are doing the best we can,"" Cahill said. ""We ruined their vacations. I am optimistic they will return."" Cahill said the crew did the best it could to make passengers comfortable, including offering free drinks. ""We wish to thank our guests for their patience and cooperation during this very difficult situation and offer our sincerest apologies,"" said Cahill. Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz acknowledged the unpleasant conditions. ""We know that the conditions were challenging and our crew worked extremely hard to make our guests as comfortable as possible until we could return them home safely. We sincerely apologize,"" de la Cruz said. The USS Ronald Reagan resupplied the ship on Tuesday. Sailors stood on the deck in 50-yard lines, handing off boxes of water, frozen bread, sandwich meats, granola bars, paper plates and more for the Splendor. The Reagan received 60,000 pounds of food, bottled water and supplies by airlift for the cruise ship, said Cmdr. Greg Hicks, spokesman of the U.S. Third Fleet. Carnival said it was making hotel and flight arrangements for guests once they reach port. About 100 representatives greeted the ship at the port Thursday to help passengers with transportation, hotel and other needs, Cahill said. The fire occurred about 6 a.m. Monday in the engine room of the Splendor, the cruise line said in a statement on its website. The blaze was extinguished, and no passengers or crew were injured. The seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast departed Sunday from Long Beach, California. Carnival has canceled a seven-day cruise that was to leave November 14 from Long Beach, the company said. ""We've been in business for 35 years,"" Cahill said. ""We've never had anything like this happen before."" John Heald, Carnival's senior cruise director, blogged Wednesday from the Carnival Splendor. ""I have to say that the crew has been absolutely epic and I am so very proud of each and every one of them,"" he wrote. ""One thing is for certain though,"" Heald added. ""I doubt anyone onboard will ever, ever want to eat a sandwich ever again.""

"New York (CNN) -- In a pair of unrelated incidents, three suspects were apprehended at New York-area airports within days of each other for attempting to smuggle $1.4 million worth of cocaine and heroin through customs, federal officials said Friday. In the first incident, on October 30, a woman was found with 30 pounds of cocaine hidden in wooden hangers and clothing, according to a news release from Customs and Border Protection's New York field office. The woman, Antoinette Gutierrez, was selected for a routine baggage inspection upon her arrival from Costa Rica at Newark Liberty International Airport, the agency said. In addition to the hidden cocaine, her clothing was soaked in liquid cocaine, it said. It put the value of the narcotics at more than $660,000. Two days later, on November 1, two men were taken into custody at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after heroin was found in their checked luggage, the agency said. Customs and Border Protection officers selected the two men, Jeffrey Pena and Edwin Ortiz, for an enforcement examination and found the clothing in their suitcases to be particularly heavy, the agency said. Upon closer inspection, officers found packages of a brown powdery substance in some pants and shorts. In total, Customs and Border Protection officers seized more than 16 pounds of heroin contained in brick-like packages, the agency said. It valued the heroin at $744,000. Jeffrey C. Piettell, Ortiz's defense attorney, said he thought his client might be able to get leniency in court if he is convicted. ""In any drug case, if a person is charged with possession with intent to distribute, their sentence is 10 years,"" Piettell said. ""I would expect the charge will have a minimum sentence of 10 years if he's convicted. But there are other factors that permit him to get a lesser sentence. Mr. Ortiz has no prior record."" The investigation has been turned over to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security, which will handle the prosecution. John Saleh, spokesman for the New York field office, told CNN that the agency held off announcing the arrests until it determined that the cases would not be harmed by making them public.","The suspects were taken into custody in two incidents .

"(CNN) -- Randy Turner knows there's a huge gap in age and technology between him and his adolescent students. Critics say social-networking site communications blur the necessary line between educators and students. So when the 52-year-old set up a MySpace page and his students began asking to add him as a friend and sending him questions about assignments, he realized he was on to something. ""Just the very fact that I have MySpace makes them think, 'Well, maybe we can talk to this guy and open the lines of communication,' "" said Turner, who teaches English at South Middle School in Joplin, Missouri. ""I realized this is a major way of communication for them."" MySpace had 72.8 million national users in June, versus Facebook's 37.4 million, according to a ComScore Media Metrix study. Once available only to students with college e-mail addresses, Facebook opened its virtual doors to everybody two years ago. Despite perceptions, the sites aren't populated just by teens and 20-somethings. A 2006 ComScore survey found that half of those registered on MySpace were 35 and older, while a similar study last year found that almost 40 percent of Facebook users were above 35. Teachers such as Turner believe sites like MySpace help them connect with their students about homework, tutoring and other school matters. But others fear the social-networking sites are breeding inappropriate relationships between teachers and students. In Missouri in particular, a rash of student-teacher sexual relationships have spawned crackdowns on social-networking friendships. Web site badbadteacher.com, which keeps track of teachers disciplined, arrested and convicted of inappropriate behavior with students, lists 11 such teachers from Missouri within the last two years. Which is why state legislator Jane Cunningham is sponsoring a bill in the Missouri House of Representatives that would ban elementary school teachers from having social-networking friendships with their students. Turner said he understands the reasoning for the bill. He acknowledged that in some cases, teachers have become the public face of inappropriate Facebook and MySpace relationships with kids. ""I see where they are coming from,"" Turner said. ""You can't argue with people whose intentions are trying to protect children. But the simple fact is, you take these people who prey on children and they are going to find a way to do it, whether it's over Facebook or not."" Those teachers are ruining it for the ones legitimately trying to help children, Turner said. ""There are so many kids who are stubborn against anything teachers say, who are struggling in the classroom and refuse to ask for help,"" Turner said. ""When it's so hard to reach these kids, why would you remove any of the weapons at your disposal to make a difference?"" Facebook does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register, according to its Web site. Users must be at least 14 to register on MySpace, although such age restrictions are difficult to enforce. In addition to the bill in the Missouri legislature, other school boards, teacher unions and parent-teacher associations across the country are drafting policies and issuing advisements about which online or text-messaging relationships are acceptable. The Lamar County School Board in Missouri recently implemented a policy forbidding teachers and students from having any text-message conversations or social-networking friendships. Jim Keith, an education lawyer who represents several school boards in Missouri, has been giving talks to teachers in which he explains that most of the inappropriate student-teacher relationships start out on a friendship level. Keith spoke of one instance where a parent thought her child was spending extra time with a teacher who was trying to help her child overcome shyness. At Keith's urging, they checked the child's phone bill and found 4,200 text messages between the teacher and student. ""As an educator, there is a line of demarcation between you and your student,"" Keith said. ""It's a line that you cannot come close to, let alone step over. You've got to establish it from Day One and say, 'I'm not your buddy; I'm not your friend; I'm just your teacher.' "" Keith agrees that teachers sometimes need to communicate after school with students about educational matters, but he said that's why teachers in Missouri have their own class pages hosted by their school districts. Those pages eliminate the need for Facebook or MySpace, he says, and allow the schools to monitor all student-teacher communication. Many students, including Dixie Johnston, a senior at Hickman High School in Columbia, Missouri, said that although their teachers have school-sponsored pages, most students rarely check them. Turner insists that Facebook and MySpace aren't the evils that regulators should be after. Instead Turner wishes the focus remain on vetting the teachers being put in charge of the nation's youth. ""It's a sad thing, but with teaching you are going to have people who are attracted to the profession because of easy availability of kids,"" Turner said. ""Those predators are going to be there. But most of the time there are warning signs, and that's what we need to be working on, getting those people out ... not stopping teachers who haven't caused problems from reaching those who need [help] most.""","Some teachers use sites like MySpace to help connect, communicate with students .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama paid tribute Thursday to American troops who 60 years ago fought a Communist regime that he said continues to be a provocative threat to peace in the region. Speaking on Veterans Day at the U.S. Army garrison in Yongsan, South Korea, the president drew parallels between America's ally and North Korea. ""Today, the Korean peninsula provides the world's clearest contrast between a society that is open and one that is closed; between a nation that is dynamic and growing, and a government that would rather starve its people than change,"" the president said in remarks prepared for U.S. military personnel and members of their families. Obama, who made a reference to South Korea's claim earlier this year that North Korea sank one of its vessels, said the United States ""will never waver in our commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea."" North Korea has another path besides pursuing nuclear weapons, Obama said. ""If they choose to fulfill their international obligations and commitments to the international community, they will have the chance to offer their people lives of growing opportunity instead of crushing poverty,"" he said. Obama is in South Korea for Thursday's opening of the G-20 summit, which will try to stabilize the world's financial markets. The president paid tribute to generations of men and women who served in the U.S. military. He praised South Korean troops and Americans who fought during the 1950-53 Korean War. ""Gentlemen, we are honored by your presence,"" Obama said of Korean War veterans in the audience Thursday. We are grateful for your service. And the world is better off because of what you did here."" The crowd roared when the president acknowledged the 62 veterans. ""They are all standing,"" he said. ""Looks like they're doing great. Let's give them a hand."" Obama also thanked those currently serving in South Korea, saying they ""carry on the legacy of service and sacrifice."" The president later attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the Yongsan War Memorial. The president placed his hand on his heart before troops fired a 21-gun salute. The president's visit to Seoul will include a meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and a meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao. Tensions about currency and trade are likely to run high at the G-20 meeting, which will be held Thursday and Friday in Seoul, the South Korean capital. Officials in China and the United States have accused the other of manipulating its currency at the expense of other economies. And the G-20 has acknowledged that the global economic recovery is advancing in ""a fragile and uneven way."" Widespread protests are expected at the summit, for which South Korea has mobilized its largest security force ever, according to the Yonhap news agency. A total of 50,000 police and riot police are being deployed, authorities told Yonhap. A number of South Korean union and civic groups are gearing up for large protests against the G-20, while other groups are planning unrelated rallies in hopes of drawing international media attention. Protests by Muslims in Indonesia also preceded Obama's visit there. But the president focused on the two countries' shared principles of unity and tolerance when he delivered a highly anticipated speech at the University of Indonesia right before he left for South Korea. In his speech, Obama reflected on the four years he spent in Indonesia as a child, referring to how he and his family were warmly accepted. He drew cheers when he sprinkled sayings from the local Malay language, such as ""Selamat Datang"" -- a greeting of welcome -- and the national motto ""Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,"" which means ""unity in diversity."" Noting that Malay is one of hundreds of languages of the archipelago nation, Obama lauded Indonesia for its spirit of inclusiveness despite its diverse population and history of dictatorship. ""But even as this land of my youth has changed in so many ways, those things that I learned to love about Indonesia -- that spirit of tolerance that is written into your constitution, symbolized in your mosques and churches and temples standing alongside each other; that spirit that is embodied in your people -- that still lives on,"" he said. Grappling with a troubled U.S. economy, the Obama administration has highlighted the strengthening of economic and military ties during the president's 10-day Asia tour. Obama started his trip with a three-day stay in India, before heading to Indonesia. Speaking in New Delhi on Monday, Obama said, ""We make some of the best products in the world and we want to sell them to a growing Indian market."" At the Seoul summit, G-20 leaders are expected to focus on the global economic recovery and mechanisms to ensure balance and sustainable growth. ""We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip. Collectively, the Group of 20 accounts for about 85 percent of global economic output. The 1997 Asian financial crisis prompted the creation of the group. The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. ""If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time,"" Rhodes said.","NEW: President Obama lays wreath at war memorial .

"(CNN) -- Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano wants to leave Liverpool, according to the English club's new manager Roy Hodgson, but Spain striker Fernando Torres wants to stay. Mascherano has been linked with a move to European champions Inter Milan, where his former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez is now coach, and informed Hodgson of his desire to leave on his first day back at Anfield following a post-World Cup break. The 26-year-old joined Liverpool in 2007 on loan from English rivals West Ham, and signed a permanent four-year contract in 2008. ""Yes, he wants to leave the club. He has made that perfectly clear,"" Hodgson told reporters at a press conference ahead of Thursday's Europa League qualifier against Macedonia's Rabotnicki. ""I think he wanted to leave a year ago and he wants to leave now. But he's contracted to Liverpool Football Club, so whether he leaves or not is our decision. ""The mere fact that the player is a little bit unhappy with his situation and would prefer to leave doesn't necessarily mean he will leave. It disappoints me, but it's not unusual. ""He has a two-year contract and I expect him to honor that until the day comes when the club decides to accept an offer for his services."" However, Hodgson had better news about the future of top scorer Torres, who has been linked with English double winners Chelsea after admitting to the former Fulham manager that he was unhappy with aspects of life at Liverpool. ""As far as I know, he is looking forward to coming back here on Monday,"" the 62-year-old said on Tuesday. ""He is enjoying a holiday, which is a well-deserved break as I don't think he's had one for three years. ""He is spending a lot of time with his family and, as far as I know, is keeping a very low profile and not really speaking to anybody. ""But he has told us he is looking forward to Monday, looking forward to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That's what I know, and I would suggest all other reports are erroneous."" Meanwhile, Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva has been recalled by Brazil for the friendly international with the United States on August 10 in New Jersey. The 23-year-old was not selected for the 2010 World Cup, but has been named by new national coach Mano Menezes -- who he worked with at previous club Gremio in Brazil. Menezes has called up 11 debutants in a 24-man squad, which features just Dani Alves, Ramires, Thiago Motta and Robinho from predecessor Dunga's line-up in South Africa. Dunga was sacked after the five-time world champions were beaten in the quarterfinals by eventual runners-up the Netherlands.","Liverpool manager has mixed news over futures of Javier Mascherano and Fernando Torres .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from Pakistan's massive flooding has climbed to 1,639, but the number could rise substantially as flood waters recede and more bodies surface, government officials say. More than 17 million Pakistanis -- about the population of the Netherlands -- have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago. In the past few days, at least 1 million people have been displaced in Pakistan's Sindh province, the United Nations said. Authorities issued evacuation orders after a levee burst. Want to help Pakistan? Impact Your World suggests how . Homeless families stomped through filthy waters as clean water remains a scarce commodity. Hundreds of thousands of victims have acquired transmittable ailments such as acute watery diarrhea, scabies and respiratory infections. The United Nations says more than $1 billion has been given or pledged. On Saturday, the United States announced the deployment of 18 additional helicopters to assist with relief efforts, according to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan. About 15 other U.S. helicopters and three other aircraft have transported 2 million pounds of supplies, the embassy said. But the need for help is greatly outpacing the supply. ""The magnitude of this crisis is reaching levels that are even beyond our initial fears, which were already leaning toward what we thought would be the worst,"" Maurizio Giuliano, a spokesman for the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Friday. ""The number of those affected and those in need of assistance from us are bound to keep rising. The floods seem determined to outrun our response."" The U.N. also said Friday that it is increasingly concerned about flood-driven malnutrition among children. ""The flooding has surrounded millions of children with contaminated water,"" said Karen Allen, deputy representative of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Pakistan. ""Most have nothing else to drink. We fear the deadly synergy of waterborne diseases, including diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition."" Acute malnutrition was high in much of Pakistan even before the floods. For instance, 27 percent of children under 5 in Baluchistan province were malnourished, as were 17 percent of children in Punjab, according to the U.N. A hospital in Sindh is overrun with people suffering from waterborne illness; two children share each bed and more are on the floor. A doctor at the hospital said there are ""not enough resources because of huge population ... coming to this hospital."" Remat Chacher, a farmer in Sindh, escaped the flood waters with his wife and two children earlier this month. But then his 3-month-old daughter Benazir got sick. ""She started to get fever and couldn't keep anything down ... lots of belly pain,"" said Ulla, the infant's mom. A few days later, the same symptoms struck the Chachers' son, 2-year-old Wazira. Both children died on the way to the hospital, with Wazira weighing just 8 pounds and Benazir weighing 2 pounds. At least 200 health facilities across the country have been damaged or destroyed, according to the World Health Organization. Flood waters have started to recede across Pakistan, but in the Indus River delta, the potential for more flooding remained high. It is unclear when displaced Pakistanis will be able to return to their homes. But many will have no house to return to. About 1.2 million homes have been destroyed from the flooding. CNN's Sanjay Gupta, Reza Sayah, Samson Desta, Sara Sidner, Moni Basu and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","More than 1,600 die from Pakistan flooding .

"(CNN Student News) -- October 7, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Afghanistan • Pakistan • Arizona . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hope you know your branches of government, 'cause they're all showing up in today's show. It's Thursday; I'm Carl Azuz; this is CNN Student News, bringing today's headlines right to your classroom. First Up: War in Afghanistan . AZUZ: First up, leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan are trying to stop something that started nine years ago today: the war in Afghanistan. These leaders are getting together for meetings this week to work on ways to end the fighting. One group that'll have to be involved in any kind of peace deal: the Taliban. That is the militant group that used to control Afghanistan when the war started back in 2001. They're not in power anymore; they were kicked out by the U.S.-led coalition. But they are the ones who are fighting against U.S., Afghan and coalition forces. Ivan Watson explains some of the challenges in getting the sides to agree. IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You've got to bridge a huge gap to get two warring parties to sit down at the negotiating table. And what you've got right now is the Taliban insisting it will not talk peace until what it calls ""foreign occupying forces,"" some 150,000 U.S. and NATO troops, leave the country. The U.S., for its part, it says that a negotiated peace would require the Taliban to cut ties with al Qaeda, to follow the Afghan constitution, and to put down weapons. So, there's a lot of space between these two enemies right now. The Afghan government seems to be trying to fit somewhere in between right now. Medal of Honor . AZUZ: A U.S. soldier who gave his life while fighting in Afghanistan is being awarded the Medal of Honor; that is the military's highest honor. In 2008, during a battle with the Taliban, Staff Sergeant Robert Miller, a Green Beret, purposely drew the enemy's fire so that his team could get to safety. The Army says Sergeant Miller's actions helped save his fellow Green Berets and 15 Afghan soldiers. President Obama presented the award to Sergeant Miller's family yesterday. His parents said that they feel a sense of pride, knowing that their 24-year-old son gave his life so that others could live. Twisters in Arizona . AZUZ: What you are looking at right here is the damage left behind when tornadoes hit parts of Arizona on Wednesday. At least two twisters struck near Flagstaff. Authorities say the storms derailed a train. They also damaged more than 100 houses and injured at least seven people. Officials said none of those injuries were thought to be serious. The train that was derailed, it had actually stopped on the tracks because of the tornado warning. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The legislative branch of the U.S. government is responsible for interpreting the country's laws. Not legit! Interpreting the country's laws is the responsibility of the judicial branch. Extent of Free Speech . AZUZ: The top part of that branch, the U.S. Supreme Court, is dealing with a case that involves the freedom of speech and the right to privacy. It all has to do with a small church that protested at the funeral of a U.S. soldier who died in Iraq. The church says it's protesting against soldiers who, in its view, fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality. Church members argue that the freedom of speech gives them the right to express their beliefs by protesting at certain events, including funerals. The father of the soldier whose funeral was protested says his son was not gay. He argues that the protest was an invasion of privacy. The Supreme Court isn't expected to rule on the case for several months. CALM Act . AZUZ: Swinging back over to the legislative branch of government. It's responsible for making laws, as you know, you've learned in government class. Congress is working on a law right now that could bring some CALM to TV. All right, you know how when you're watching a show and a commercial comes on. Well, not when you're watching CNN Student News. But, okay, the commercial comes on, and it's way louder than the show? That could stop. Last week, the Senate unanimously passed the CALM, or Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act. Basically, it says a commercial can't be louder than the show. If the House approves the bill later this year and President Obama signs it, it'll be the new law. Sound Check . DR. PHIL MCGRAW, HOST, ""DR. PHIL"": When you get into the internet, the problem with that is the bully doesn't have to look the victim in the eye. You know, they don't have to deal with them one on one. They don't see the repercussions of what they're doing. I call them keyboard bullies, you know. They can just do this stuff with great anonymity. 85% of the time, research tells us, there's no consequence to what they do whatsoever. Bully Free Pledge . AZUZ: We've been talking about different kinds of bullying all week long. Today, we want to talk about solutions, ways to try and stop bullying. Carol Costello visited a school in Oklahoma where students are promising to stand up against bullies. She talked to two students -- one who's been bullied, one who bullied other people -- about why they think this is such an important issue. (BEGIN VIDEO) WESTERN HEIGHTS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: I am somebody. I can make a difference. CAROL COSTELLO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: At Oklahoma City's Western Heights High School, students are pledging to protect the bullied. It's especially important to Susan Le. She knows how bullying feels. Is it worse with words, do you think? SUSAN LE, OKLAHOMA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: I think it is, because when I was little, like, people always said I was, like, really ugly. And it, I never knew it affected me so much. And, like, people would ask if I was a boy or a girl, and I was hurt. I never wanted that to happen and, like, it lowered my self esteem really bad. And I never wanted to go to school. COSTELLO: So, I see it hurts you. I see it hurts you so much. But you know you're beautiful, right? Yes. It's the kind of pain that affects so many children. One in three kids are bullied or bully every year. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kids being bullied don't always tell you about it. COSTELLO: Marissa Velasco, who is also participating in Western Heights' anti-bullying campaign, knows exactly what Simmons is talking about. In junior high school, she was a bully. Why? MARISSA VELASCO, OKLAHOMA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT: I don't really know if there was a reason. It was just an easy target, I guess. COSTELLO: Is it because other kids were making fun of those kids too? VELASCO: Yes, there was a lot of others also bullying. COSTELLO: So, sort of like a mob mentality. VELASCO: Yes. COSTELLO: When you were calling people names, did it make you feel better? VELASCO: It's not that it made me feel better. It's that I knew they felt worse. COSTELLO: Susan Le, Marissa Velasco certainly know the consequences. They're hoping to make this school year bully free. (END VIDEO) Blog Report . AZUZ: All right, there are a few places where you're keeping this conversation going. From our blog, it doesn't look like many of you think bullying's gonna go away. Listen to Teddy: He thinks bullying is a part of life, and says ""we all just have to live with it."" And Francis: ""It takes a strong person to stop bullying when they see it. We need more strong people."" Something new we're doing this year: the CNN Teachers' Lounge. This is also on our front page, right under our blog. Here's what some of your teachers are saying about bullying. Chrisbloom says his middle school has tried several anti-bullying programs, ""but each year, students still list bullying as the number one problem."" He says it's frustrating that this persists. RMS Groves tells us ""the biggest issue among students is the fear of telling adults, either for fear of personal harm or getting a reputation as a tattle tale."" And Teacher 12345 suggests trying to catch bullying before it starts. ""If you see mild conflict with two students, stop that before it turns into bullying."" Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Zielke's social studies classes at Pacelli High School in Austin, Minnesota! What is featured on the U.S. presidential seal? Is it: A) The White House, B) The president's picture, C) A bald eagle or D) An American flag? You've got three seconds -- GO! A bald eagle is front and center on the presidential seal.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Volcanic ash spewing from Indonesia's Mount Merapi has forced some airlines to cancel flights out of Jakarta's international airport, airport officials said Wednesday. Cathay Pacific Airways and Qantas Airways had canceled flights at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, airport spokesman Andang Santoso said. Singapore Airlines said it was continuing to fly. Large clouds of gas and dust from Merapi's recent eruptions also have forced some flight cancellations into and out of the Yogyakarta airport. Travelers were asked to check with their airlines for schedule changes. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama shortened his visit to the Indonesian capital because of concerns that volcanic ash could ground Air Force One in Jakarta, according to administration officials. Recent eruptions of Merapi, which started on October 26, have killed at least 156 people, officials at Sardjito hospital have said. The eruptions also have displaced an estimated 200,000 people. The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi, in Central Java, is famously unpredictable. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930.","Cathay Pacific and Qantas cancels flights at Jakarta's international airport .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of excited music fans wait in line on the lookout for their favorite singers on a hit television show. Elaha Sorur was the lone female finalist on this season's ""Afghan Star,"" the country's answer to ""American Idol."" Instead of spending the time outside a New York venue or Hollywood soundstage though, these fans braved barbed wire and gun-toting guards in Kabul to attend Afghanistan's premier pop music event: the finals of ""Afghan Star,"" the embattled country's answer to ""American Idol."" In line, bright mod outfits have replaced Kabul's normally conservative dress code. Onstage, men sport the latest styles. And on TV screens, a country's new battle between traditional and pop culture plays out. ""For the young generation,"" says one fan in line, ""it's very important to be cool, with a cool mind."" Inside the concert hall, Jahid Mohseni, a 38-year-old Afghan-Australian media mogul, tries to manage the chaos he's created. Singers, child acrobats and TV technicians all compete to get his attention before the start of Afghanistan's biggest night of television. Mohseni, who started the country's top television network, Tolo TV, said he's just trying to revive Afghan culture after the fallow Taliban era when music and television were banned.  Watch performances on ""Afghan Star"" » . ""Yes, we are promoting social change, but we cannot push Afghan society where it doesn't want to go. This is a commercial enterprise, and it's reflecting what people want,"" Mohseni said. In Afghanistan, more than 60 percent of the population is younger than 25, and judging by the popularity of ""Afghan Star,"" ""they're like people everywhere. They're not from Mars,"" Mohseni said. At the fourth-season finals this year, the audience included those who sat quietly as well as those who loudly cheered for contestants, including Naweed Forugh (who would be named the ""Afghan Star"" winner), Naweed Sabirpur, Mehran Gulzar and Elaha Sorur, the lone female finalist. ""Art is in the blood of Afghans and has been for centuries, and it is still,"" Sorur said. ""During the years of fighting, the people haven't been able to use their artistry, but with time, it will get better and better. Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan are ready for a change."" But not everyone is happy with Mohseni's programming choices. Afghanistan's guardians of Islamic values, the Ulema Council, protested that ""Afghan Star"" and Tolo TV's popular Indian soap operas were not part of Afghan culture. Afghanistan's minister for information and culture even tried to stop the soap operas in court, claiming that it was a question of national security. And last year, a female finalist on ""Afghan Star"" received death threats and was forced into hiding after her head scarf fell to her shoulders during a performance. ""This young woman, beautiful, dancing with her hair free ... that symbolizes everything that is forbidden and was forbidden in Afghan culture,"" said Havana Marking, director of a documentary about the show's 2008 season, also called ""Afghan Star."" Mohseni points out that Afghanistan is near two powerful neighbors: India, with a population of 1.1 billion, and Iran, with almost 70 million people (compared with Afghanistan's estimated 34 million). ""You just have to sit down with your critics and explain that if we don't have Afghan music and entertainment, Bollywood will take over,"" he said. ""We're just trying to hold our own in the middle of what is effectively a cultural war."" That culture war can be seen on Tolo TV. After meeting with the Ulema Council, Mohseni dreamed up another reality show called ""Tartil,"" or ""Koran Star."" The three finalists were quizzed by religious authorities and judged on how well they've memorized passages from the Quran, Islam's holy book. There were no wild ovations when the winner was announced. But the finale still produced a bombshell: a shy 16-year-old schoolgirl named Uzra Mohamedi, who accepted the oversize $3,500 check without cracking a smile and dressed in a traditional black veil. Other TV programming in Afghanistan includes state-run news and lifestyle shows, a popular locally produced drama about an extended Afghan family, a sketch comedy show -- and the hit Kiefer Sutherland drama ""24."" Mohseni said that ""Afghan Star"" pushes his country forward in subtle ways, for instance teaching a few valuable lessons in democracy. Winners are picked by fans who can vote on their mobile phones -- one SIM card, one vote. In previous elimination rounds, losers sometimes stormed off the set, refusing to accept defeat. But now they thank their supporters and graciously congratulate the winners. ""This is the educational component of our show, and hopefully it'll rub off on our politicians,"" Mohseni said. To coincide with Afghanistan's presidential elections in August, Mohseni created a reality show called ""The Candidate"" as a way to encourage a more robust political debate. Six young Afghans face off in mock presidential debates and compete in American-style election campaigns. In the future, Mohseni said he hopes the direction of Afghan culture will be decided democratically without traditionalists imposing values by force or government edicts. Either way, Tolo TV has an avid audience: According to Mohseni, the finals of both ""Afghan Star"" and ""Koran Star"" won their nights' ratings races, easily beating the competition.","""Afghan Star"" is Afghanistan's version of ""American Idol""

"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's ruling party candidate Dilma Rousseff garnered the most votes in Sunday's presidential election but fell short of the majority she needed to avoid a runoff. With 98.75 percent of the votes counted, Rousseff led the race with 46.74 percent of the vote, according to the Superior Electoral Court. She needed 50 percent plus one vote to avoid a second-round runoff. She will now face Jose Serra, a former mayor of Sao Paulo and one of the county's most experienced politicians. He had 32.68 percent of the vote with nearly 99 percent of votes counted, the Superior Electoral Court said. If she ultimately prevails, Rousseff -- a former Marxist guerrilla -- would be her country's first female president. The runoff election is scheduled for October 31. ""Thank you very much to all of you, and tomorrow we will again continue the conversation that we have been having since the beginning of this electoral campaign,"" Rousseff said soon after the count, according to video on Bandeirantes television. Sunday's general election spanned across all levels of government, from local offices to the presidency. Nine candidates vied for the nation's top job. Rousseff is the hand-picked successor of President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who has an 80 percent approval rating. The outgoing president has steered Brazil into a major global economy, and his choice for the next president appears to be influencing voters. The president is barred from running for a third consecutive term. Brazil has the world's eighth-largest economy, which has grown 7 percent a year on the strength of a commodities boom and market-friendly policies. And the country will get more worldwide attention in the coming years, hosting events such as the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. Voting is mandatory in Brazil for anyone over age 18 and under age 70. Some 135 million people were eligible to vote. CNN's Shasta Darlington and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","Dilma Rousseff, a former Marxist guerrilla, wins the first-round vote .

"Washington (CNN) -- After two days of meetings and talks led by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Israeli and Palestinian leaders leave Washington deadlocked over the contentious issue of Israeli settlements. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met alone behind closed doors for more than an hour and a half Thursday in a State Department room just outside Clinton's office. The one-on-one meeting followed their on-camera pledges to move the peace process forward and their hardy handshake with Clinton in the middle. But several diplomatic sources involved in the summit said the two leaders emerged from their meeting in a stalemate over whether Israeli settlements should continue. The two leaders met with Clinton to give a readout of their meeting. According to Fadi Elsalameen, who accompanied Abbas, the two leaders were very blunt about their opposing views. Netanyahu is under pressure from the Palestinians and the Obama administration to extend a 10-month moratorium on building Israeli settlements in the disputed West Bank territory. That moratorium is set to expire September 26. Netanyahu's conservative coalition government wants the Israeli prime minister to end the moratorium. Elsalameen said that during the leaders' private discussion, Abbas asked Netanyahu to extend the settlement freeze. Netanyahu reportedly said, ""I cannot extend."" Elsalameen says Abbas responded, ""Then I cannot continue."" Before the summit even began, Abbas had threatened to abandon final status talks if Netanyahu allowed Israeli settlements to go forward. The Palestinian leader is trying to show he'll keep his word. Elsalameen said Clinton was asked about what would happen if Israel continued to expand the controversial Jewish settlements. Elsalameen said Clinton responded, as Obama had publicly stated, ""Then all bets are off."" Despite the standoff between the Palestinian and Israeli leadership, Elsalameen said that starting Sunday, their chief negotiators will meet on a daily basis to try to entertain compromises. According to U.S., Israeli and Palestinian officials, the hope is that during those talks, some trust and confidence will be developed, and some of the other issues will be settled, possibly making it easier to find a formula for extending the moratorium. The issue could then be discussed when Netanyahu and Abbas meet again in Egypt on September 14 and 15. Both sides, and the Americans, fully expect some formula to be found at the last minute to extend the moratorium, the officials said. Obama told the leaders not to ruin this opportunity, according to the sources, and to make sure the 26th of September goes by quietly without incident . While nothing was agreed to, officials from both sides said the tone of this week's talks was fairly decent, and they expressed cautious optimism. Netanyahu was apparently in a good mood after the meetings, and Abbas, who was nervous and tense the night before the talks, seemed to come away from them in a better mood. He didn't feel pressured as he has been recently and was appearing to aides to be a little more relaxed and confident, they said. Elsalameen said Abbas would be visiting Libya and Tunisia to drum up support for the Palestinian people.

"(CNN) -- Three-time major winner Padraig Harrington fired his best score this year to take the halfway lead at the Transitions Championship in Florida, and then claimed he would be happy to be paired with Tiger Woods when the disgraced world No. 1 makes his golfing comeback at the Masters. The Irishman, whose last victory on the PGA Tour came at the U.S. PGA Championship in 2008, carded six-under-par 65 on Friday to move a shot clear of defending champion Retief Goosen, Sweden's Carl Pettersen and Woods' fellow Americans Jim Furyk and Bubba Watson. Asked if he would relish the opportunity to be paired with Woods at Augusta next month when the fallen superstar returns following his admissions of marital infidelities, the 38-year-old said he could handle the attendant pressures of such an occasion. ""If there is an issue being drawn with him in his first tournament back, if you're going to choose a golf course for it to happen, Augusta is the place,"" Harrington told reporters. ""It is as ordered as can be there, so I for one would be quite comfortable if I got drawn with Tiger. I do not see it being any different than being drawn with him the first two rounds last year. ""I do believe, though, if it was first two rounds at Bay Hill, that would be slightly different. But then again, you wouldn't mind being there to watch it all!"" Harrington is seeking to build on last weekend's third placing at the WGC-CA Championship in Miami, which was won by South African veteran Ernie Els, ahead of this season's first major tournament. The two-time British Open champion was four shots adrift of first-round leader Garrett Willis after an opening 69 at the Copperhead course in Palm Harbor on Thursday, having missed the pro-am to attend President Barack Obama's St Patrick's Day dinner at the White House. He carded five birdies and a bogey on his front nine, and picked up shots at 11 and 16 to be on eight-under 134. South Africa's Goosen, himself a two-time major winner, followed up his 67 with a 68 -- with Pettersen and Furyk doing exactly the same. Watson moved up the leaderboard with an eight-birdie 65 as he overcame successive birdies midway through his front nine to join the others on 135. World No. 2 Steve Stricker was tied for sixth after his 66 left him level with fellow American Jeff Maggert (68) and Australia's Steve Elkington (68) on 136. Willis slumped to a tie for 66th after a horrendous 77 which saw him double-bogey the first two holes, drop another shot at the third and then card another double at the ninth and a bogey at 11. World Match Play victor Ian Poulter missed the cut of 143 by three shots after a second successive 73, while British Open champion Stewart Cink, fellow major winner Rich Beem and young Japanese star Ryo Ishikawa also failed to make the weekend rounds.","Padraig Harrington says he would be happy to partner Tiger Woods at the Masters .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters in Detroit, Michigan, grappled with 85 fires in a four-hour period Tuesday night, officials said. ""A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,"" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. There were no reports of deaths or injuries, she said. ""We had winds from 30-50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,"" said Detroit Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. ""We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires which makes more fires with the wind being so strong."" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. the fire department responded to 140 calls for wires down before the evening outbreak. Detroit firefighters received assistance from fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods. ""It's a matter of public safety,"" Dumas said. ""We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires."" There also was at least one report of suspected arson associated with the fires, Mack said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor returned home Saturday from a Los Angeles hospital a day after she was rushed there by ambulance for a swollen leg, her husband said. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said Saturday. The 93-year-old actress spent several weeks at the same hospital after hip replacement surgery in July. She has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","The 93-year-old actress was released from a hospital Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Bernie Madoff's victims, who were collectively swindled out of more than $50 billion, effectively recouped more than $2 million on Saturday in an auction of the investment titan-turned-villain's personal items. The U.S. Marshals Service sold off nearly 500 pieces of personal property belonging to Bernie and his wife Ruth Madoff in New York on Saturday morning. The money raised through the auction goes the U.S. Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund to compensate the victims of Madoff's history-making fraud. ""Another chapter (in the Madoff saga) ended here today,"" Deputy U.S. Marshal Roland Ubaldo told CNN by e-mail. ""All 489 lots of ill-gotten gains sold today and the proceeds will go toward something good for a change."" For months, Madoff successfully avoided detention after his arrest for engineering a sprawling Ponzi scheme, posting $10 million bail and cloistering himself with his wife in their $7 million Manhattan apartment. But he lost his freedom -- as well as access to his once vast wealth -- when he pleaded guilty in 2009 to 11 counts including money laundering and perjury. A judge, saying he had perpetrated ""extraordinarily evil"" crimes, later sentenced him to 150 years in prison. On Saturday, some of Madoff's riches taken from his homes in New York City and Montauk, Long Island, were on the auction block. Several items went for significantly more money than had been expected in what the U.S. Marshall's office deemed ""a very successful day."" A 10.5-carat diamond engagement ring fetched $550,000 at the auction -- appreciably more than the $350,000 auctioneers had hoped to get. A Steinway and Sons grand piano, which had been expected to get $16,000, went for $42,000, while a pair of black velveteen slippers embroidered with the initials BLM in gold thread were sold for $6,100, said Ubaldo. Last year, the first auction of Madoff's property brought in more than $900,000, with most items selling for prices well beyond the highest pre-sale estimates. The 71-year-old is now at the Butner Federal Correction Complex, a medium-security prison in North Carolina, and scheduled to be released on Nov. 14, 2139. He masqueraded his investment firm as legitimate when it was nothing more than a front. He would use the funds from new investors to send payments to his more mature investors. He would falsely portray these payments as proceeds from investments, when they were actually stolen money.

"(CNN) -- Police are probing an apparent murder-suicide in Erie, Pennsylvania, saying they suspect a father shot dead his wife and two young children before turning the gun on himself. The two parents and children, ages 4 and 7, were found dead in an Erie home around 11 a.m. Saturday, said Erie Police Lt. Tom Eberlein. A bullet also grazed the ear of a 2-year-old in the house, and the toddler was sent to an area hospital, said Eberlein. The child's condition was not immediately known. The names of those killed have not been released; the case remains under investigation. Several neighbors told CNN affiliate WICU that they heard gunshots around 9 a.m. and then again about an hour later. ""They were a happy family, never seen them argue or nothing,"" Olivia Shultz, a neighbor, told WICU.

"Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- For 13-year-old Arrianna Merritt, the words mother and hero go hand in hand. Three years ago Sunday Arrianna watched her mother Kim Dahl drive a school bus loaded with children across the Mississippi River when the bridge began to buckle up and down. Thirteen people were killed in the bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  What Arrianna remembers most was the choice her mother made that day after the bus became tilted upward on a steep incline. ""Either you let us free fall -- or you hold that brake to the ground and you stay where you are.""  Dahl held the brake with her foot until she could reach for the parking brake. Millions of viewers saw the jaw-dropping images of the school bus as it teetered on the edge of a broken stretch of highway, with nothing but a guard rail separating it from a deadly fall.  Arrianna sat in the bus with her brother, 50 other children and eight adults. The bus ""went up, and then it went down,"" Dahl recalls, adding it soon turned into free fall and she was ""hanging on for dear life."" ""I thought 'this is it,' I'm not getting out, and I'm going to die."" The new 35W bridge: Is it the safest in America? With the parking brake on, Dahl kept the bus in place while everyone made it out the rear emergency door safely. Arrianna, 10 at the time, and her then-5-year-old brother David, were the last ones and had refused to get off with the others. ""We didn't want to leave our mom,"" David, now 8, remembers. ""I'm like 'get your butts off the bus,'"" Dahl said. They eventually did. Dahl says she managed to break free herself after a jolt on the bridge seemed to release her seatbelt, which had been stuck. Since that day, those on the bridge and their loved ones have never been the same.  This particular mother-daughter pair say they've always had a tight bond but Arrianna says she and her mother have grown even closer since their ordeal. ""We've always been close, but I think after the accident we got closer because we shared the same experience and we know what its like,"" Arrianna said. The physical reminders of that day often overshadow the emotional ones. ""It does hurt to see my mom in pain because she cant do the things that she used to love to do."" Dahl broke her back in the fall and that's been the primary cause of complications since. ""It's like a new me that I'm living with,"" Dahl said. ""It's almost like your freedom is taken away... I can't go grocery shopping by myself because I can't lift the milk up and put it in the cart."" ""My kids and my husband -- I couldn't ask for a better family,"" Dahl said. ""I mean my kids step up and do a lot of the work that I can't do or help me do things that I can't do. They're pretty good about saying 'yea.'"" ""I don't know if life will ever be normal like it was before July of '07 and prior, but we've made the best for it,"" said Dave Dahl. ""We've adjusted our lives, we've changed our lifestyles. But we've just got to be positive."" Dave Dahl reminds himself that things could have been worse. ""Our family unit here in this house is five people,"" he says. ""Within an instant it could have been two."" Arrianna in particular has taken on a number of duties, like cleaning the bathrooms and doing the laundry, that she says has taught her how to be ""a grown-up."" ""Most of the time when my mom is in the hospital or getting surgeries, I have to step in and be the surrogate mother to my younger siblings,"" Arrianna explains. The family also includes another daughter, Brianna, age 11. ""And my dad is working a lot of the time so he kind of doesn't have much time."" ""It kind of teaches me to grow up some and how to be a grownup and what it's like."" She adds it can get difficult once in awhile, but these days she simply reminds herself who she's doing it for. ""Now I kind of understand why I have to stand in and why sometimes I have to be the adult."" Kim Dahl deals with PTSD, as well, and still sees a therapist twice a month. And while Arrianna no longer has therapy sessions of her own, occasionally she still struggles.  Kim Dahl is among 122 victims and their families who've filed suit against URS Corp., an engineering and construction firm hired by Minnesota DOT to conduct engineering analysis on the bridge before it collapsed. A federal investigative report blamed the collapse on support plates that were too thin, and increased weight on the bridge from construction equipment.  The amount of punitive damages plaintiffs are seeking against URS is ""hard to say,"" said Dahl's attorney Bill Harper, who estimated it could be as much as $100 million.  ""URS was hired by the state to make sure the integrity of the bridge was safe for the public,"" Harper said Wednesday. ""They did not do what they promised to do -- and as a result -- that bridge collapsed.""  Attorneys for URS said the company's ""work was unrelated to the causes of the bridge collapse. ... URS did not design the bridge, was never asked to verify the bridge's original design, and did not know the bridge's original design was defective.""  Hennepin County District Judge Deborah Hedlund is expected to rule on punitive damages by mid-October.  Painful reminders . On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands. The sound of a jackhammer in the distance is enough to remind Arrianna of the construction noise taking place on the bridge at the time of the accident. It brings her to tears. Thankfully mom is nearby. ""She is kind of like my counselor because she listens,"" Arrianna said. She no longer needs a therapist, but it's these rare moments when mom comes in handy. And occasionally, Arrianna says, their roles are reversed. She recalls hearing her mother sometimes say things about how life would be easier if none of this had ever happened. Arrianna's advice? ""You need to move on, and you need to be strong and live your life to the fullest."" Those are words the family is living by.   Kim Dahl has had to give up what her husband Dave Dahl would call the ""wilder motor sports,"" and the five of them have taken on a new hobby: road trips. Kim Dahl says she'll never be able to drive a bus again -- something she misses more than anything. She had the same bus routes for years and knew the kids and their parents well. But the family camper may be the next best thing. So far, they've made it as far as Florida to the east and Colorado to the west. ""My mom could never afford it...we never went anywhere,"" Kim Dahl recalls of her childhood. ""And we went on [our] first trip and it was just awesome. To learn stuff and to see stuff was just amazing."" As Dave Dahl describes it, there's ""no stress, there's no itinerary, nothing, we just go."" ""Wherever we get is where we get,"" he adds. ""We kind of have a goal of where we like to be in the end."" Given the path Kim Dahl and her loved ones have traveled since 2007, that phrase could be the family motto too.","Mom helped save 52 kids, eight adults after '07 Minneapolis bridge collapse .

"(CNN)  -- Swedish golfer Henrik Stenson carded a solid 69 in the opening round of the WGC-CA Championship but it was his highly unusual recovery shot on the 12th on the Blue Monster course at Doral which raised more than a few eyebrows. Stenson did not leave much to the imagination with his Doral antics. Stenson stripped down to the bare essentials -- a pair of white boxer shorts -- before wading into the mud to hack out his ball after an wayward tee shot. The watching galleries could hardly believe their eyes as the tall Swede peeled off his clothes. ""Shirt, trousers, socks, shoes, hat, the lot was off,"" he told the Press Association. ""Because of the mud I couldn't really afford to play in any of my clothes as they would have been a real mess down the last six or so holes so I had no option,"" Stenson explained. After getting the ball back on to the fairway, Stenson eventually made a one-over par bogey on the hole when he could have dropped at least two shots by taking a drop. ""If you are saving a shot, that has to be worth taking your shirt and trousers,"" he added. What do you think of Stenson's cheeky recovery shot ? The incident proved the main talking point on the day that Tiger Woods made his return to strokeplay golf and 32-year-old Stenson jokingly said it might offer a new avenue for sponsorships. ""Absolutely, you never know, after this I might have a new endorsement with PlayGirl or something like that."" European Ryder Cup star Stenson is playing for the $1.4 million first prize in the tournament in Florida which has an elite 81-strong field. His recovery shot evoked memories of the last-hole drama at the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie when tournament leader Jean Van de Velde waded into the Barry Burn after taking off his shoes and socks. The Frenchman at least spared the blushes of the crowds by keeping on his clothes but he made a hash of hole and lost his chance of winning the famous major.","Henrik Stenson creates a stir with 'striptease' at top tournament in Florida .

"(CNN) -- After a night rife with primaries in the far-flung four corners of the United States, plus one in the nation's breadbasket, one race in the far Northwest is still up for grabs. In Alaska, incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski is trailing a political unknown. Joe Miller, who has the support of the Tea Party and former Gov. Sarah Palin, is leading by 51 percent to 49 percent, according to election tabulations. The numbers, which show Miller clinging to a less-than-2,000-vote lead, are based on a count of roughly 86 percent of the total expected vote. With as many as 16,000 absentee ballots expected to be received over the next couple of weeks, the contest is not likely to be resolved quickly. Among Tuesday's big winners was Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain, who fought off former congressman J.D. Hayworth. Down in Florida, Democratic Rep. Kendrick Meek's organizational support trumped political newcomer Jeff Greene's billion-dollar bank account in a hard-fought Senate primary. Miller -- on the cusp of one of the biggest upsets of the year so far -- said on CNN's ""American Morning"" Wednesday that high-profile endorsements helped his campaign, which reflects ""one central concern, and that is the out-of-control nature of D.C."" ""Bankruptcy is crashing down on this country,"" Miller said. ""Unless we end that entitlement mentality, no level of seniority is going to save us from that."" Miller added the problem is a result of a bipartisan ""crisis of leadership."" Alaska voters also went to the polls Tuesday to pick their gubernatorial nominees. Gov. Sean Parnell, who replaced Palin when she resigned last year, faced two challengers in the GOP primary. With 86 percent of the expected vote in, Parnell had almost 50 percent of the vote, according to the unofficial election count. His nearest challenger, Bill Walker, had 34 percent. On the Democratic side, Ethan Berkowitz led with 49 percent of the vote, while Hollis French had 39 percent. In the southeastern corner of the country, two wealthy candidates in Florida spent a lot of their own money on campaigns. Rick Scott's investment paid off. Greene's didn't. Scott, a millionaire political newcomer, defeated state Attorney General Bill McCollum in the Republican primary for governor, CNN projected. Scott spent $50 million of his fortune since joining the race in April. He claimed victory in front of supporters and alluded to the divisive nature of his fight against McCollum, the party-establishment favorite and former congressman. ""Some of you may have noticed this was a hard-fought race. We talked a lot about our differences, but tonight it's time to remember those things that bring us together -- to recall our core beliefs and recommit ourselves to fighting for our principles,"" Scott said. ""The Republican Party will come together, and the reason we will come together is our shared devotion to the values that make America great."" Scott was ahead of McCollum, 47 percent to 43 percent, with 92 percent of precincts reporting, according to election tabulations. Scott will face a November general election against Alex Sink, Florida's chief financial officer, who CNN projected will win the state's Democratic primary for governor. In a different race featuring a political veteran against a self-funded candidate with deep pockets, Meek declared victory over Greene in Florida's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. Meek led Greene 56 percent to 32 percent, with 78 percent of precincts reporting, according to election tabulations. Meek will take on Marco Rubio -- who CNN projected will win the Republican primary for Senate -- and Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent, in the general election. Rubio has cast himself as the outsider in the race, painting Crist and Meek as ""two people who support the direction that Washington is taking our country."" He said on CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday that ""Washington's agenda is destructive for America's future."" ""I'm very proud of my association with the Tea Party,"" Rubio said. ""But people misunderstand what the Tea Party movement is in America. It is not a centralized organization or a political party. It's the sentiment of everyday Americans who think that Washington has it wrong -- they're taking our country in the wrong direction. And they are looking for voices in American politics that will stand up to that and offer a clear alternative."" In northern Florida's 2nd Congressional District, Blue Dog Democrat Allen Boyd faced a tough challenge from his left from Al Lawson. The Associated Press projects that Boyd won that race by a slim margin. Meanwhile, in the Southwest, Hayworth conceded the GOP Senate primary Tuesday night in Arizona after a bitter campaign against McCain. McCain -- seeking a fifth term as senator -- was ahead, 59 percent to 30 percent, with 50 percent of precincts reporting, according to election tabulations. The race between McCain -- the 2008 GOP presidential nominee -- and conservative talk show host Hayworth started off nasty and didn't get any friendlier down the home stretch. McCain spent $20 million to fight off the intraparty challenge, unusual for a four-term incumbent. McCain is expected to easily beat any of the four Democratic primary candidates in the solidly red state. A 10-way Republican primary in the Arizona 3rd Congressional District race to replace retiring Rep. John Shadegg has attracted national attention because Ben Quayle, son of former Vice President Dan Quayle, is one of the candidates. The Associated Press projected that Quayle has won the primary. Quayle would face Democrat Jon Hulburd in the fall in the heavily red district. In the Northeast, longtime Republican Gov. Jim Douglas is retiring in Vermont, giving Democrats hope of competing for the seat. Five Democrats are running in what is considered a tight race. With 89 percent of the precincts reporting, four of those candidates each have more than 20 percent of the vote. The winner will face GOP Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie. In Oklahoma, two U.S. House Republican nominations were decided in runoff elections. Charles Thompson and James Lankford trounced their opponents Tuesday night. In Thompson's 2nd District, Republicans think they have a chance for a pickup this fall against conservative Democrat Dan Boren. Lankford will likely replace Rep. Mary Fallin, who's running for governor. CNN's Peter Hamby, Steve Brusk, Rachel Streitfeld, Jeff Simon and Mark Preston contributed to this report.","The Alaskan GOP senate nomination is still up for grabs .

"(CNN) -- Authorities and residents in rural Ohio searched Saturday for two women and two children who have been missing for several days. Blood was found in the Howard home of Tina Herrmann, 32, and her children Sarah Maynard, 13, and Kody Maynard, 10, Knox County Sheriff David Barber said Friday. Herrmann's friend, Stephanie Sprang, 41, is also missing. The sheriff described their disappearance as a missing persons case. ""Detectives are interviewing family members, friends and acquaintances,"" Barber told CNN affiliate WBNS on Saturday. ""Right now, there is no indication that they were abducted."" Herrmann failed to report to work at a Dairy Queen in Mount Vernon, in central Ohio, on Wednesday. A deputy came twice to the house and saw Herrmann's pickup truck. Lights were on in the house, but no one answered the door, Barber said. ""There were no signs of anything out of place,"" he said. A Dairy Queen manager entered the home on Thursday and discovered the blood. ""There is blood in the house. There is a sign of injury to a person or persons,"" Barber said Friday. Herrmann's truck was discovered Thursday night near Kenyon College in Gambier, he said. On Friday morning, the college lifted a lockdown it had put in place late Thursday ""as a precaution because of concerns that a person of interest in the disappearances might have been on campus."" The children were in school Wednesday, but not Thursday, the sheriff said. Sprang's vehicle was found at Herrmann's house, he added. State and federal agencies are assisting in the search, happening about 60 miles northeast of Columbus. Larry Maynard, the father of the children, spoke with WBNS. ""I am expecting the worst, hoping for the best,"" he said. Barber said Herrmann's live-in boyfriend, Greg Borders, will be interviewed. Borders is not considered a suspect or person of interest, the sheriff said. Borders told WBNS that he left for work early Wednesday and then spent the night at a friend's house in Urbana, Ohio. Borders said he would never hurt Herrmann or her children. He told CNN affiliate WSYX he had recently broken up with Herrmann but still lived in her home. Messages left Saturday afternoon for Barber were not immediately returned. Members of the close-knit community were gathering at a prayer service Saturday evening. ""There's a lot of anxiety,"" about the four people's fate,"" said Pastor Todd Miller of Amity-Apple Valley Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, about five miles from Howard. ""I don't think anyone is trying to speculate."" Kody Maynard has attended the church with a friend, Miller told CNN. ""He is very nice, very polite and quiet."" Members of the church spent eight hours Saturday assisting in the search, the pastor said. ""It has touched our church,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania wildlife officer investigating possible poaching was killed during an exchange of gunfire after making a traffic stop late Thursday, authorities said. David L.

Authorities detained Christopher Lynn Johnson, 27, early Friday, and were in the processing of bringing charges against him in the case, according to Adams County District Attorney Shawn Wagner. Johnson sustained a gunshot wound and was receiving treatment at a nearby hospital, Pawlowski said. ""It is truly a painful day for the Pennsylvania Game Commission,"" said department spokesman Jerry Feaser. Grove was a ""bright, highly educated conservation officer"" who graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a degree in wildlife and fisheries science, he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Apparently President Barack Obama doesn't need an iPad; he's got an aide for that: iReggie. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' retreat in Yokohama, Japan, on Saturday, a print pool reporter was within earshot of a brief exchange between the president and an iPad owner, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. ""So you like your iPad?"" Obama asked. The Thai leader nodded and asked Obama if he had one. ""These days mostly I have someone carrying my books. So that's my iPad,"" Obama said, referring to personal aide Reggie Love. Obama said as much in a New York Times interview last month. ""I have an iReggie, who has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place,"" he told the newspaper. Not everyone has an arsenal of human apps like the president's: a personal aide, several advisers, cabinet secretaries, a press shop and military leaders at his beck and call. Obama may not have a personal iPad, but he's not too disconnected from Apple's latest technological craze. According to the pool reporter, Jonathan Weisman, the president told Abhisit that he recently bought an iPad for first lady Michelle Obama. At a rally in Seattle last month, the president was approached by someone with an iPad that said, ""Mr. President, sign my iPad."" Obama penned his signature with the swipe of a finger instead of a pen. Obama is the first president to carry a smartphone with Internet and e-mail access, but the public rarely sees him using his BlackBerry. He may be considered tech-savvy, but the Oval Office isn't. The president's Resolute Desk, the large wooden partner's desk built from the timbers of the British exploration ship Resolute, has a telephone but conspicuously no computer. So what does the president do when he needs one? On at least one occasion, the president borrowed his personal secretary's computer. The White House posted a photo of the president sitting at personal secretary Katie Johnson's desk. He was due to deliver remarks that day and made last-minute edits on her computer. Maybe there's not an app for everything.","Obama and other world leaders are in Japan for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit .

"(CNN) -- He's the rock demigod who lives and breathes music, but whose heart beats thanks in part to a pacemaker. The former Guns N' Roses guitarist, whose real name is Saul Hudson, is probably the most recognizable man in rock 'n' roll. Yet beneath the mane of curly locks and leather top hat is a devoted musician who kicked a drug and alcohol addiction because it was getting in way of the music. ""I was a productive junkie ... I was driven by music. I did have these distractions, but I managed to be functional as best as I possibly could,"" he told CNN. ""What helped clean me up at the end of the day was the fact that, after a while, it started to get in the way of being able to do what it is I wanted to do... I've done more in the last four years than I could have possibly done if I was still using,"" he continued. Since leaving Guns N' Roses in 1996 -- ""As I walked out it was a huge weight off my shoulders"" -- he's produced his own material, collaborated with numerous musicians and was the driving force behind supergroup Velvet Revolver, a band he's trying to revive once again. He fixed his place in the pantheon of rock stars during his time with Guns N' Roses (""If I wasn't in that band, it would have been my favorite band"") and it's been almost 15 years since he spoke to lead singer Axl Rose after their much-publicized split. However, the idea of a Guns N' Roses reunion isn't completely out of the question. ""I used to be very sort of negative about it 'cause I just don't see it happening,"" he said, ""but at the same time you just never know. No efforts have been made to try and do anything about it so I guess you just leave it to chance. Maybe it will; maybe it won't."" While a potential reunion might please thousands of fans, Slash is looking forward to Velvet Revolver and other projects, despite the music scene experiencing what he calls ""a very weird time."" ""This whole thing with the internet being the mainstay of the industry at this point is taking a lot of adjusting and it hasn't really settled yet,"" he told CNN. ""[A] certain energy and a certain attitude and that to me is very rock and roll. And that seems to be lacking in commercial music, especially in commercial rock and roll right now.

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya's plan to use its judiciary to try perpetrators of post-election violence reneges on an earlier pledge to use an independent tribunal, Human Rights Watch said Monday. Residents of a Nairobi slum shout during clashes between rival groups in January 2008. The fighting, which flared after the 2007 elections, killed more than 1,300 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. It started after the main opposition candidate disputed the results, sparking some of the worst violence in the nation's history. A commission formed to investigate concluded that the nation's judiciary was not credible enough to try the suspects, and recommended a tribunal made up of Kenyan and international judges. If that did not work, the commission urged, the International Criminal Court should try the suspects itself. The government pledged last year to implement the suggestions, and then re-emphasized its commitment last month. ""An independent domestic court with international participation remains the best option to start establishing accountability, and the government should immediately adopt legislation to establish the special tribunal,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement. Leaders of the East African nation have been criticized for failure to form a tribunal to try perpetrators of post-election crimes. The announcement Thursday that Kenya was exploring using its judiciary as one of the options comes amid publicized wrangling among members of the coalition government formed in the wake of the violence. In a statement to announce the decision after a Cabinet meeting, President Mwai Kibaki said that the government was ready to pursue national healing. ""Cabinet was concerned that while it will not stand for impunity in the pursuit of justice, the country should equally pursue national healing and reconciliation,"" Kibaki said. ""This does not in any way reduce its desire to punish impunity."" However, he acknowledged shortcomings in the judiciary system. ""It will undertake accelerated and far-reaching reforms in the judiciary, police and investigative arms of government to enable them investigate, prosecute and try perpetrators of post-election violence locally,"" he said. Former U.N. chief Kofi Annan, who negotiated the deal that led to the coalition government, has repeatedly warned that the International Criminal Court would be asked to intervene if a tribunal was not established. Annan handed a list of post-election violence suspects to the ICC on July 9, a sign that he was losing patience with the delay in the formation of a tribunal. Analysts say the administration has been against an independent court because some top officials are on the list. The government is not putting its citizens' needs first, critics say. ""Bringing justice to these victims is the most urgent test of the coalition government's willingness to resolve Kenya's crisis,"" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""The Cabinet just resoundingly failed that test.""","Violence hit Kenya after December 2007 vote, more than 1,300 people were killed .

"(CNET)  -- To help answer some questions about this week's Copyright Office announcement regarding the legality of so-called cell phone jailbreaking, or the modification of the software that comes with iPhones and other handsets that is designed not to be changed, we've compiled the following list of Frequently Asked Questions: . What does the Copyright Office's ruling mean? The short answer is that jailbreaking your iPhone or other mobile device will no longer violate a controversial federal copyright law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. Bypassing a manufacturer's protection mechanisms to allow ""handsets to execute software applications"" is now permitted. But in practice, the actual impact of that portion of the decision may be limited. How does it affect iPhones specifically? Apple exercises greater control of its hardware and software than most of its competitors. Anyone remember last fall's court-ordered permanent injunction that Apple won against Psystar, which sold PCs with OS X pre-installed? On the iPhone, Apple restricts the software that can be loaded onto the device. Applications can be downloaded through the App Store, and to be included in the App Store, the program has to be vetted and approved by Apple. Apple says this maintains a high-quality user experience and weeds out malware. (An executive summed it up: ""You and your family and friends can download applications from the store, and for the most part they do what you'd expect, and they get onto your phone, and you get billed appropriately, and it all just works."") But if users want software that's not permitted in the App Store -- Google Voice is a big one, and tethering is another -- they need to jailbreak their phone. That unlocks the file system, allowing apps to be added without Apple's permission. Groups of software developers and individuals work to devise jailbreaking software for every new version of the iPhone's operating system that is released. The best known is probably the iPhone Dev Team, which makes its software available at no cost. Why do you say the practical impact of the Copyright Office's decision is limited? Until this week, Apple has possessed the legal equivalent of a double-barreled shotgun, which would have permitted the company to file lawsuits accusing users (or jailbreak software creators) of violating both the DMCA and breaching the contract in the form of the Apple iPhone Software License Agreement. Now, thanks to the Copyright Office, Apple's legal arsenal has been reduced to a single-barreled shotgun, the license agreement. But these amount to legal claims that the company could in theory pursue. In reality, Apple has never sued a single person for jailbreaking or distributing jailbreaking software. It's never even threatened to do so, even after years have elapsed. Translated: If Apple isn't going to sue the hundreds of thousands of customers merrily jailbreaking their iPhones, or the active developer community abetting their theoretically illicit activities, it doesn't matter what the caliber of their legal weaponry is. So why should we care? We asked Jennifer Granick, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the San Francisco-based civil liberties group that successfully petitioned the Copyright Office for the exception. Here's what she told us: ""Apple's never sued jailbreakers, but they claim it violates the DMCA, and thus there's a legal cloud. If they were right, they could stop people from jailbreaking the phones, i.e. get an injunction. Now, they can't. Even if it violates contract law, they'd have to sue, and all they could get would be a tiny bit of money. It greatly decreases any incentive they might have or develop to sue. And it takes injunction off the table. Which means that the law will not, in the next three years, prevent people from jailbreaking their phones."" In addition, the possibility of punitive damages has been eliminated. What does Apple say? Our old friend Leander Kahney extracted a statement from Apple on Monday, which says simply: ""Apple's goal has always been to insure that our customers have a great experience with their iPhone and we know that jailbreaking can severely degrade the experience. As we've said before, the vast majority of customers do not jailbreak their iPhones as this can violate the warranty and can cause the iPhone to become unstable and not work reliably."" Earlier, Apple had told the Copyright Office it opposed EFF's request in part because the App Store process protected consumers, because iPhone customers only license the software and do not own it, and that fair use should not allow circumvention. What was the Copyright Office's reasoning? On all the important counts, it agreed with the EFF. It said, for instance, that ""the amount of copyrighted work modified in a typical jailbreaking scenario is fewer than 50 bytes of code out of more than 8 million bytes, or approximately 1/160,000 of the copyrighted work as a whole."" The Obama administration had sided with Apple. The Department of Commerce said that granting the exemption ""might just as likely deter innovation by not allowing the developer to recoup its development costs and to be rewarded for its innovation."" A side note: the Copyright Office also granted another exemption, which allows used handsets to be reprogrammed to enable use of the mobile phone on another network. Why would I want to risk jailbreaking my iPhone? You might want to jailbreak your phone if there's a piece of software you simply must have. But jailbreaking should probably be left to people who are technologically savvy -- after all, if something goes wrong, you're on your own. The two big dangers to jailbreaking your phone are voiding your warranty, and not correctly following the instructions of whatever software program you're using to do the jailbreak, which can lead to a unusable or ""bricked"" phone. Taking a phone that's been jailbroken into an Apple store, or sending it to Apple's service center means they likely won't fix it because you've violated your user agreement. This includes repairing something that is not software-related, like a cracked screen. You may be able to find an authorized repair center that would do it, but it's still a risk. According to Apple, the company's support department already receives ""literally millions of reported instances of problems flowing from jailbroken phones."" In a letter to the U.S. Copyright Office (PDF) opposing the new exemption, Apple warned that legitimizing the practice of jailbreaking would be a security risk for the devices and result in more malware being installed because the App Store's protections would be bypassed. So does Apple have to support jailbreaking? Nope. Section 2(c) of the Apple iPhone Software License Agreement (PDF) bans any attempt to ""modify"" the iPhone software or to reverse-engineer it. What that means is that Apple can still legally -- if it chooses -- protect its phones from jailbreaking. The contract formed between the user and Apple (and the user and the wireless carrier) when the iPhone owner agrees to the user licensing agreement is binding, says Tom Sydnor, a senior fellow with the Progress and Freedom Foundation who takes an expansive view of copyright law. Just because the DMCA allows individuals an exemption to jailbreak their own phones, ""it doesn't mean Apple or a carrier can't protect contractual restrictions to deal with it,"" Sydnor said. ""Essentially the exemption says this is the sort of thing that falls in bounds of contracts."" Apple could pursue breach of contract if someone jailbreaks their phone, or they could sue a person or company that creates jailbreak software for inducing someone to breach their contract with Apple. In other words, Sydnor said, ""even if there was no DMCA, you could still be bound not to circumvent that technological protection."" What does the DMCA do, exactly? Check out section 1201 of the text of the 1998 law. Part 1 says that, in general, ""no person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access"" to a copyrighted work, including a computer program. Part 2 says that ""no person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic"" in any software that allows such circumvention. (Note this restriction has little impact on overseas software developers.) But there's an important caveat to the first part. The Library of Congress' Copyright Office is charged with evaluating the DMCA's impact every three years and adding exemptions on behalf of Americans who want to make ""noninfringing uses"" of copyrighted works. The last round of exemptions, for instance, said it's officially legal to ""unlock"" your cell phone's firmware if you're hoping to switch carriers while continuing to use the same device. So how does this week's DMCA announcement benefit consumers? While it doesn't completely remove all legal repercussions from users who want to jailbreak their own phone, losing the protection of the DMCA was a blow to Apple and other phone makers with proprietary software, according to Jason Schultz, co-director of Samuelson Law, Technology & Public Policy Clinic at UC Berkeley School of Law. ""It is an uphill battle now for Apple. What this does is kind of shifts things in favor of users,"" said Schultz. ""If Apple goes to court they have to explain to a judge why the copyright office is wrong (in this case) or why other laws should trump copyright laws."" ""Another way to say it is the DMCA was Apple's strongest weapon in controlling the iPhone platform. (Losing that exemption) is like losing your best player on the team,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- With the Tuesday night shooting deaths of two students from the University of Texas in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, six U.S. citizens have been killed in the volatile region this week, according to the U.S. consul general. ""We offer our deepest condolences to the families of victims. These incidences underscore U.S. travel warnings for Mexico,"" Consul General Dean J. Haas told CNN. ""The current warning is clear and states that U.S. citizens should defer unnecessary travel to Juarez and areas near the Mexican border."" The current travel warning for U.S. citizens posted on the State Department website states, ""Recent violent attacks and persistent security concerns have prompted the U.S. Embassy to urge U.S. citizens to defer unnecessary travel to Michoacán and Tamaulipas, to parts of Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango, and Coahuila, and to advise U.S. citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution."" The consulate, based in Ciudad Juarez, would not comment on the extent of U.S. involvement in the investigation of the U.S. citizens killed in Mexico or their effect on relations with Mexico. ""Mexican authorities are in charge of this investigation,"" Haas said. ""The U.S. government is engaged on a broad bilateral basis on a variety of issues, including law enforcement, with the Mexican government."" Violence is commonplace near the nations' border as powerful drug cartels battle for control of lucrative smuggling routes into the United States. ""We encourage U.S. citizens traveling in this area to register with the consulate. We have a mechanism to communicate travel updates of registered citizens within the state of Chihuahua,"" Haas said. According to Haas, 108 U.S. citizens have been killed in the consular district of Chihuahua since October 1, 2009. Lorena Izaguirre died of multiple gunshot wounds outside a tortilla shop on Saturday. In a separate incident on Saturday, Jovana Herrera and Luis Carlos Araiza where shot while driving a BMW near the Zaragoza International Bridge. Edgar Lopez died outside a house in Ciudad Juarez of multiple gunshot wounds, authorities said. On Tuesday, University of Texas at El Paso students Manuel Acosta Villalobos, 25, and Eder Diaz Sotero, 23, were gunned down in a hail of more than 30 bullets while driving in Chihuahua State, Mexico.","Incidents underscore U.S. travel warnings for Mexico, U.S. consul general says .

"New York (CNN) -- Charges were filed Tuesday against 17 people accused of taking more than $42 million from programs established to help Holocaust survivors, authorities said. ""The alleged fraud is as substantial as it is galling"" said Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for New York's Southern District, calling it a ""perverse and pervasive fraud committed against a not-for-profit organization of historic significance."" Over a period of almost 16 years, millions of dollars intended for Holocaust survivors ""instead found its way into the pockets of corrupt employees of the Claims Conference and an elaborate network of fraudsters,"" Bharara told reporters Tuesday afternoon. The money came from two funds managed by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also known as the Claims Conference, a nonprofit that was established almost 60 years ago to assist those harmed by Nazis. The Claims Conference distributes more than $400 million a year from funds provided by the German government to victims of the Holocaust. Bharara said conference officials first noticed the fraud and went to the FBI in December 2009. ""The Claims Conference is to be commended for notifying us as soon as they found out there were issues,"" he said. Six of the 17 people charged Tuesday with fraud and conspiracy are former and currant employees of the Claims Conference, according to Bharara. He called Semen Domnitser the ""ringleader"" of the fraud, saying that for more than 10 years he served as the director and oversaw both the Hardship Fund and the Article Two Fund. The Hardship Fund makes one-time payments of about $3,600 to victims who were forced to leave their homes while fleeing advancing Nazis troops. Bharara said some 5,000 fraudulent applications worth $18 million were processed through the fund. The Article Two Fund gives pension payments of roughly $411 a month to those who earn less than $16,000 after taxes and spent a minimum of six months in a concentration camp or at least 18 months in a Jewish ghetto in hiding or living under a false identity to avoid the Nazis. Bharara said that this fund had processed over 650 fraudulent applications worth more than $25.5 million. The Claims Conference issued a statement saying that since discovering the fraud, it had implemented numerous steps to strengthen its safeguards. ""We are outraged that individuals would steal money intended for survivors of history's worst crime to enrich themselves,"" said Julius Berman, chairman of the Claims Conference. Bharara said that applicants were recruited from the Russian-Jewish community and that fake birth dates, birthplaces and ""fabricated stories of persecution, completely made up stories about what happened to these individuals during World War II,"" were written in their applications. Bharara said the investigation continues and that some of the thousands of applicants also might be charged. It was unclear in some cases if the applicants knew that fraud was being committed, he said. Sixteen of the 17 people charged Tuesday have been arrested and four of them have admitted their guilt, Bharara said. ""We will bring to justice all those who would callously line their own pockets by looting an important lifeline for Holocaust survivors,"" he said.","Seventeen people are accused of taking part in the alleged fraud .
False claims were filed to get money from two funds, the U.S. attorney says .

"(CNN) -- Federal agents in Gulfport, Mississippi, arrested Sunday a 53-year old man, declared dead in 1994, on kidnapping charges. Thomas Steven Sanders was arrested in the early morning at a Flying J Truck Stop. He is suspected in the abduction of Lexis Roberts, 12, of Las Vegas, Nevada. She was later found dead. His capture is unusual because Sanders was legally declared dead in Mississippi by family members some 16 years ago. ""However, we now know that he is still alive and has ties to several states across the country,"" the FBI said in a statement earlier this month. Sanders, who is thought to be missing most of his teeth, has changed his appearance several times over the years. He is described as a white male, around 200 pounds with brown eyes. In September, Sanders was seen purchasing bullets at a local Wal-Mart in Las Vegas. The ammunition he bought was consistent with the caliber weapon used during Roberts' homicide, the FBI said. The girl's remains were found by hunters in early October in a wooded area north of Harrisonburg, Louisiana. She was last seen with her mother, Suellen Roberts, and Sanders. Sanders was alone at the time of his arrest.","Thomas Steven Sanders, 53, was arrested in Gulfport, Mississippi .

"(CNN) -- Flavio Briatore has successfully appealed against his lifetime ban from Formula One for his part in a race-fixing conspiracy at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, CNN confirmed Tuesday. Former Renault team boss Briatore was handed the ban last September by the World Motor Sport Council following an enquiry ordered by governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It ruled that Briatore and his chief engineer Pat Symonds, who was given a five-year ban, ordered Renault driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to deliberately crash his car to help his teammate Fernando Alonso to win F1's first-ever night race in Singapore. Blog: Court ruling sets dangerous precedent. But both men have had their suspensions quashed by the French high court sitting in Paris. The pair were also seeking substantial damages against the FIA of $1.5 million, but they have been awarded €15,000 ($21,630) and €5,000 ($7,220) respectively. The court gave the FIA 15 days to pay Briatore and Symonds, otherwise it will be given a penalty of €10,000 ($14,420) per day. The FIA has yet announce whether it will appeal the ruling. The court said that it had not annulled the decision by the World Motor Sport Council, but ruled it to be ""irregular"" and non-effective due to Mosley's level of involvement, the UK Press Assocation reported. ""The decision of the World Council was presided over by the FIA president, who was well-known to be in conflict with Briatore, with Mr Mosley having played a leading role in launching the inquiry and its investigation in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies,"" its judgment said. The 59-year-old Briatore said ""justice has been done"", the Press Association reported. ""As a sports person and one passionately involved in car racing for more than 20 years, the decision to apply to the civil courts to contest a decision of the FIA was a difficult one for me to take,"" the Italian said. ""The fact the World Motor Sport Council had been utilised to deal with a personal agenda aimed at pushing me out of the world of competition left me no other choice. ""The decision handed down today restores to me the dignity and freedom certain people had arbitrarily attempted to deprive me of. ""The court recognised all the criticisms I had formulated against the decision of the World Council were founded, by finding the FIA had rendered a decision it was not competent to pronounce, infringed its own articles of association, totally failed to respect my right to a fair defense and entrusted the tasks of investigation, prosecution and judgment to a principle player known by all to be hostile to me."" Briatore said he would ""enjoy this moment of happiness"" before discussing whether he planned to return to F1. The court decision came soon after Renault, handed a two-year suspended ban at the FIA hearing over the Singapore incident, announced that Frenchman Eric Bouillier had been appointed as Briatore's replacement as team principal. The team is attempting to restore its reputation in the aftermath of the Singapore incident, which came to light after Piquet Jr. was sacked and then went public with his admission of involvement. Double world champion Alonso of Spain won the race -- the first for Renault in two years -- despite starting from 15th on the grid. Just two laps after Alonso came in early to take on more fuel, Piquet's crash forced the deployment of the safety car and the subsequent pit stop of nearly all the other drivers -- an action that promoted Alonso to fifth from where he went on to secure victory.","Flavio Briatore successfully appeals against his life ban from F1 for his part in 2008 Singapore GP race fix conspiracy .

"Yokohama, Japan (CNN) -- World leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Sunday pledged to work toward a free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region. ""We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to achieving free and open trade and investment in the region,"" the leaders said in a joint statement at the end of their two-day summit in Yokohama, Japan. The summit brought together 21 leaders from countries around the Pacific Rim. But the group acknowledged challenges in the global economy and the environment. ""The Asia-Pacific regional economy is recovering from the recent economic and financial crisis, but uncertainty still remains,"" the leaders said. ""We also face heightened challenges with regard to the protection of our environment and natural resources, including the necessity to jointly address climate change."" The summit also included the first formal talks between the Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan and the Chinese president Hu Jintao since a territorial dispute in September strained relations between the two. This weekend marks the end of Obama's 10-day trip to Asia aimed at opening ""new markets for American products in this fast-growing part of the world,"" according to his weekly address. He headed back to the United States on Sunday. At the summit, Obama added, ""In the 21st century, there is no need to view trade, commerce or economic growth as zero-sum games, where one country always has to prosper at the expense of another. If we work together and act together, strengthening our economic ties can be a win-win for all of our nations."" Obama has also pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is seen as a building block in trying to create a free-trade area in the Pacific Rim. The TPP would cut import tariffs for several countries. The United States is scheduled to host next year's APEC summit in Hawaii. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","21 leaders wrap up a two-day economic summit in Yokohama, Japan .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Variations of two deadly superbugs that had previously only been discovered in the United States have surfaced in South America. Variations of two U.S. strains of killer bacteria have cropped up in South America, researchers say. The drug-resistant microorganisms are sweeping across communities in Colombia and have the potential to unleash devastating results, according to researchers at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston. ""The people of Colombia are not aware this is coming. It is killing people here and it is going to kill a lot of people there if we don't act quickly,"" Dr. Cesar Arias, one of the lead researchers of the study, told CNN. The study, which was carried out with the Universidad El Bosque in Bogota, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday. The bugs that have emerged in Colombia are genetically related to two strains of bacteria -- MRSA and VREF -- that have spread across the United States. MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, was once spread mainly in hospitals. In recent years, a number of people not in contact with hospitals have presented with the disease, which is a leading cause of severe skin infections in the United States. VREF, which stands for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, mainly arises in hospitals and infects people in critical care units. Both so-called superbugs can cause lethal infections and are resistant to antibiotics. There were no known cases of this type of MRSA in Colombia before 2005, and no cases of VREF before 2001, the study said. But a total of 15 MRSA infections have been reported in Colombia in recent years and some 50 cases of VREF have been identified since it was first documented in the country. The MRSA strain has also been found in Ecuador and Venezuela. For some reason, the bacteria in South America are acting in a similar way as their genetic forebears in the United States, Arias, who is an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the UT Medical School at Houston, said. They are becoming more resistant and spreading the same way, Arias explained. ""The dramatic thing is the first 15 patients who had this disease presented out of hospital, and 20 percent of these patients died,"" he said. Researchers are tracking the cases to see how the organisms got to South America. The focus now, Arias said, is to establish the link between the two regions and to figure out how to control their spread.","Superbugs that can cause lethal infections are hitting South America .

"Bowie, Maryland (CNN) -- President Barack Obama interrupted a campaign speech twice on Thursday to seek help for people in the audience who collapsed. ""I think we might have had somebody faint down here, so if we got the paramedics,"" Obama said about halfway through his remarks under bright afternoon sunshine at Bowie State University. ""They'll be all right. Just make sure you give them some space. And if somebody has a bottle of water, you might want to give it to them."" A few minutes later, near the end of his remarks, Obama again noted a member of the crowd in distress. ""Someone up here got a little hot. Let 'em sit down. Let 'em sit down,"" he said to the audience, asking if there was a bottle of water on stage for the stricken person. ""Remember, next time you come out here, eat something and drink something"" beforehand, Obama added. The president was stumping for Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is seeking re-election. Prince George's County medical personnel said they responded to a number of sick cases at the university on Thursday. Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady said that between 1:45 and 2 p.m., about an hour before Obama's speech, ambulance crews stationed at the campus as part of the White House event responded to reports of people ""fainting, getting dizzy, and otherwise passing out."" Prince George's County Fire Department officials later told CNN they were treating at least two dozen people at the university for fainting and dehydration. Brady said that while the temperatures were mild, ""in that rally area, the sun is extremely hot."" ""In addition, that rally area was extremely crowded and compacted,"" he said. ""You had the rally people shoulder to shoulder, if not closer, and standing for an extended period of time and waiting for the rally to start. A lot of these people that we treated today were senior citizens, so they're probably not accustomed to this type of environment, and those were the people that we found that experienced the fainting, the dizziness issues."" Also, a heckler was heard shouting ""You're a liar!"" early in Obama's remarks. The man was shouted down by others in the crowd, and it was unclear whether the president heard him. CNN's Tom Cohen and Vito Maggiolo contributed to this story.","NEW: Fire official says most of the ill were senior citizens .

"(InStyle) -- It's been almost three decades since the first-ever MTV Video Music Awards. And from the very beginning, stars like Madonna aimed to please their fans by shocking them, with a combination of risqué routines -- remember that ""Like A Virgin"" floor dance? -- and outré fashion. So, in anticipation of the award show's 27th iteration, which airs on Sunday, September 12 at 9 p.m. EST, InStyle looks back at five of the most memorable VMA performances and appearances ever, and wonders: Can we still be shocked, or have we seen it all? We'll be watching. 1984 At the inaugural ceremony in 1984, Madonna attained instant superstar status thanks to a scandalous rendition of her already-controversial single, ""Like A Virgin."" Clad in a lingerie-inspired ""wedding dress,"" complete with veil, ""boy toy"" belt, gloves, and a see-through polka dot skirt, she danced atop a giant cake, writhed on the floor and generally set the bar sky high for all subsequent would-be pop stars. See all of the VMA style shockers . 1999 Lil' Kim didn't perform at the 1999 show, which may have been for the best, given the extreme precariousness of her glittering purple ensemble. Instead, she presented the award for Best Hip-Hop Video with the help of a slightly nonplussed-looking Mary J. Blige and Diana Ross, who couldn't resist reaching over and jiggling the pasty-covered part at the podium. 2000 It was Britney Spears's second time at the VMAs -- she'd debuted the previous year, singing a relatively tame version of her first single, ""... Baby One More Time."" But in 2000, she stepped up and changed the game, opening with a cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction"" (which she performed while dressed in a menswear-style pinstriped suit), before segueing into her hit ""Oops! ... I Did It Again,"" and tearing off her shirt, jacket and pants to reveal a surprising nude-tone two-piece bodysuit. InStyle.com: Britney Spears's style transformation . 2003 In 2003, for the 20th Video Music Awards, VMA MVPs Britney and Madonna teamed up (along with Christina Aguilera) for a startling performance that nabbed each of them a second spot on our top-five list. The show opened with each of the younger stars paying tribute to Madonna's first-ever VMA appearance nineteen years earlier, singing ""Like A Virgin"" in not-so-virginal white. Then the Material Girl herself turned up in a suit to sing ""Hollywood"" ... and to kiss Britney, then Christina, on the lips. (Missy Elliot popped out of a ""wedding chapel"" to rap the finale.) InStyle.com: Madonna's transformation . 2009 Lady Gaga began her performance at last year's VMAs precisely where Madonna ended hers 25 years before: Dressed in white and rolling on the ground. But it's difficult to imagine anyone -- even Madge -- engineering the spectacle that followed as Gaga ran through ""Poker Face,"" and ""Papparazzi,"" then wrapped things up by rubbing fake blood all over her torso, face and hair. (She even got some in her eye, for maximum ick.) The other ensembles she donned that night were only slightly less startling: Her sheer red Alexander McQueen dress, topped with a lace mask and matching crown, was a standout.

"Berkeley, California (CNN) -- At some point, the ""rush to rehab,"" reached the ridiculous. Does a week pass without some celebrity, politician or famous athlete heading to a rehabilitation treatment center? And often with the cameras rolling. Rehab is getting a bad name from this, and I worry that this will rub off on our perceptions of the average alcoholic or drug addict who works hard to stay clean and sober, takes responsibility for his or her actions -- and knows that there is still work to do after the first 30 days. Doubt it? Then how to explain the cynical jokes on late-night TV, the tearful confessions from the talk-show couch, or this: ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew,"" a VH1 reality show that features famous or almost famous people in treatment for addiction or  behavioral issues. The cases of Lindsay Lohan (in and out of rehab; now off to jail) and Mel Gibson (reportedly in therapy after the release of the alleged tirade tapes) are just the most recent examples of a high-profile practice in vogue since the 1980s, when Betty Ford opened her famous center in Rancho Mirage, California. The celebrities followed. Of course, there are famous people who benefit greatly from a stay in treatment, who do it privately and with sincere purpose. But it's common, too common, to see the well-known on TV, after completing a 30- or 45-day program, proclaim themselves ""saved,"" only to show up on TMZ the next week partying or running people over with their cars. This ""rehab-abuse"" (used maybe to wait out a public relations storm after bad behavior, or draw attention to a stalled career?) devalues and trivializes the very real, very unglamorous struggle of pulling free of addiction and making amends for harmful behavior. More than others, the famous have a responsibility to treat the process with respect. As a former drug and alcohol abuser (clean and sober for more than 26 years), I know something about the work that goes into transforming a life. One of the first things I learned in Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous was that alcoholism and drug addiction are not excuses for injuring yourself or others. Part of recovery is making a list of people you've harmed, making amends to them personally and accepting the consequences of your past actions. I didn't make an announcement to the world and I still don't think I have all the answers, but I came out of it knowing a lot more. I also learned that I need to have a connection to something greater than myself, which to me is a higher power that I call God. Like other recovering substance abusers, I know I'm not the center of the world and life doesn't start and end with me. I've found that people who stay clean and sober the longest have some kind of spiritual belief, whether it's God, life force, universal energy or a sense of oneness with the world. They also realize that amends and apologies have to mean something and indicate a change in actions and thought processes. ""Apologies by proxy""-- when celebrities (or noncelebrities, for that matter) make inappropriate, racist remarks, then apologize to well-known people from the group targeted by the comment -- just don't cut it. Entering treatment for addiction means you get treatment for your addiction. Any other changes you make are up to you. That also means that a racist alcoholic who gets treated for alcoholism can still be a sober racist, anti-Semite, homophobe or engage in inappropriate behavior. Someone who spews hateful prejudices can stay in rehab forever, but unless he has some education, time for self-examination and the willingness to get to see people from diverse backgrounds as human beings and understand their lives and experiences, he'll be the same. The media could stem this perverse fascination by remembering the young people (and older people, too) struggling with substance abuse who see ""role models"" regress on national TV and feel hopeless for their own chance for recovery. What else can they think but, ""What's the use? If they can't stay clean with so many people helping, how can I?"" In the last 26 years, I've experienced the death of my parents, the death of my partner of 18 years and a new life as a single parent. I was hospitalized and came close to death. I was run over and couldn't work for a year. I didn't use drugs or alcohol as a way to deal with these experiences. Life happens to everyone. Let's stop glamorizing these celebrity addicts and adding to their out-of-control drama. Let's get real about their addictions and the impact on their families. Let's discuss solutions, and all the options for help. Let's sensationalize being clean and sober. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simma Lieberman.","Simma Lieberman says it's routine to see celebrities very publicly checking into rehab .
This trivializes the hard work of rehab, she says, makes it fodder for late-night gags and reality TV .
When celebs lapse, seem not to take treatment seriously, she says, it sends harmful message .

"(CNN) -- A former New Jersey woman now living in Nevada was arrested on suspicion of abducting her daughter during a custody struggle more than 25 years ago, authorities said. Nancy Dunsavage Fiedler, 57, of Incline Village, Nevada, was arrested Tuesday, according to the Somerset County, New Jersey, Prosecutor's Office and the Washoe County, Nevada, Sheriff's Office. She is accused of fleeing a courthouse in Somerville, New Jersey, with her then-6-year-old daughter, Eva Marie Fiedler, during a custody hearing on August 23, 1984. At the time, the girl's father had full custody of her, according to New Jersey prosecutors. On June 28, 1985, Nancy Fiedler failed to appear for an arraignment on charges of interference with custody, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The case resurfaced Tuesday, when Eva Marie Fiedler, now 32, attempted to change her name to Melissa Reed in order to obtain a marriage license in Washoe County, Somerset County prosecutors said in a release. A background check found a listing in the National Crime Information Center for Eva Marie Fiedler as a missing child out of New Jersey. ""Investigating deputies determined that [Nancy Fiedler] had changed her name to Debbie Reed and was living in Incline Village,"" near Lake Tahoe, the Washoe County Sheriff's Office said in a release. Washoe County authorities contacted Somerset County prosecutors, who asked the sheriff's office to locate Debbie Reed. They did so Tuesday night. ""Deputies noted that 'Debbie Reed' displayed the same descriptors as noted in the NCIC warrant for defendant Fiedler,"" New Jersey prosecutors said. After a brief interview, the woman admitted to authorities that she was Nancy Fiedler, Nevada authorities said, and was arrested. Eva Marie Fielder apparently had no idea she had been abducted or that her mother was sought by police, according to CNN affiliate KRNV. It was unclear why she was attempting to change her name. Capt. David Nikoley of the Washoe County Sheriff's Office told CNN Thursday that authorities aren't sure whether the girl knew of her abduction or why she sought the name change. Investigators in Nevada have not interviewed her yet, he said, and are awaiting a request to do so from New Jersey. ""The dust hasn't settled yet,"" he said. Washoe County authorities issued a statement saying the girl is now 31, but a flyer posted on a ""Protect Your Kids"" internet forum lists her birthday as May 9, 1978, meaning she would now be 32. The same forum, in a thread marked ""Parental Abduction,"" has a posting dated January 2010 from a person self-identified as Eva Marie Fiedler's cousin. ""Myself and our whole family would love more than anything to have her back,"" the posting says. ""... Please Eva Marie we all want you to come back and we all promise you will be safe with us we all love you ... if you or your mom are just afraid to come back, we promise you will be safe."" New Jersey prosecutors will extradite Nancy Fiedler from Nevada, according to the statement. Washoe County said she was being held at the county detention facility on a no-bail warrant pending that extradition. ""Throughout the years, detectives from the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office have followed dozens of leads, both domestic and international, in an attempt to locate defendant Fiedler and her daughter,"" with the assistance of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the statement said. ""Detectives have stated that throughout the years defendant Fiedler was able to remain undetected by obtaining a number of identities for her and her daughter,"" prosecutors said. According to the Asbury Park Press newspaper in New Jersey, authorities charged Nancy Fiedler's sister and the sister's husband with conspiracy to interfere with a custody order and contempt of court in the case, three years after the girl's disappearance. Prosecutors claimed the two, who were living in California, helped Nancy Fiedler keep the girl from her father. The couple was acquitted following a weeklong trial in 1988, despite admitting Nancy Fiedler and the girl had stayed with them for several months, the newspaper said. The couple claimed they had had no contact with the two since they moved out. The girl's father, identified as Greg Fiedler, testified during the trial, the Asbury Park Press said. Attempts by CNN to contact Greg Fiedler on Thursday were unsuccessful. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Authorities were tipped off after girl, now 32, applied for a marriage license .

"(CNN) -- Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung earned South Korea a comfortable 2-0 win against Greece in the opening match of Group B played in Port Elizabeth. The 2002 World Cup semifinalists created a string of chances against a poor Greek side who never looked like getting on the score sheet. Central defender Lee Jung-Soo opened the scoring for South Korea in the seventh minute, volleying home from close range from a well directed free kick delivered by Ki Sung-Yong. South Korea should have gone 2-0 up after 23 minutes when Monaco striker Park Chu-Young was sent through on goal by a defense-splitting pass from the boot of Park Ji-Sung. Chu-Young was only denied by a fine save from Greek goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas which saw the ball cannon onto the roof of the net. The Greeks were fortunate not to be further behind at half time as South Korea continued to push forward with a series of incisive moves. Aside from a chance which fell to defender Vasileios Torosidis in the third minute, and an error from South Korea's goalkeeper Jung Sung Ryon late in the first half Greece never looked like scoring. The second half carried on where the first finished off, and it was no surprise when Park Ji-Sung added a second for South Korea after 52 minutes. Latching on to a mistake made by Loukas Vyntra, the Manchester United midfielder swept forward into the penalty area before coolly slotting past a helpless Tzorvas. The goal did seem to finally wake Greece from their slumber, and striker Theofanis Gekas forced a fine save from Jung Sung Ryon in the 80th minute but it was a rare moment of skill in a woeful display by the 2004 European Champions. Moments later, Lee Chung Young nearly added a third for South Korea at the other end. The result means Greece continue their winless World Cup finals record. Their only other appearance in 1994 finals yielded no goals and no points. South Korea face a sterner test next Thursday when they meet Argentina in Johannesburg, while the Greeks meet Nigeria in Bloemfontein.","South Korea open their 2010 World Cup campaign with 2-0 victory over Greece .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday the United States must take the lead on energy, citing the ""enormous job creation potential that exists."" President Obama holds talks with members of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board on Wednesday. Obama's remarks came at the end of his first quarterly meeting with the Economic Recovery Advisory Board, which was created in February to provide the administration with independent, nonpartisan advice on how to promote economic growth and stability. The focus of Wednesday's meeting, which was streamed live on the White House Web site, was job creation and green energy. Obama told the board members he's seen ""some return to normalcy"" in parts of the financial markets.  Watch Obama describe the 'progress' he sees » . ""But obviously, one of the things I've been concerned about since I took office is looking beyond the immediate crisis in front of us to find out what is a sustainable economic model, post bubble and bust,"" he said. ""How do we create sound fundamentals on issues like education, on health care and ... energy, as well as all the innovation that's required around these various areas, so that moving forward, we don't find ourselves in an unsustainable economic model?"" he asked. Paul Volcker, who chairs the board, said as the panel discusses investments, they can't forget the risks of inaction. ""There isn't enough emphasis, it seems to me, on the cost of what happens if we don't do anything,"" said Volcker, who served as the chairman of the Federal Reserve during the Carter and Reagan administrations. Obama said the steps taken around energy this week have been ""promising."" The president on Tuesday announced new fuel economy rules, including a requirement for passenger cars and light trucks to get an overall average of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. Obama and the board spent about an hour discussing the immediate opportunities and challenges for green energy. Panel members expressed concerned that the United States is behind other countries in controlling carbon emissions. ""We think it's very important to act now,"" said John Doerr, a partner with Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers. ""If we act now, and send very clear signals to our business community and the nation."" Doerr said he thinks ""putting a price on carbon"" is the most important thing they can do, but he said it's not the only policy that can be adopted. He also stressed the importance of research and development funding. Obama has been pushing Congress to move ahead with legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution. Board member Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman and CEO of GE, called clean energy ""the most exciting, fastest growth industry of the 21st century."" He said his company's 70 energy-efficiency products are generating $18 billion in revenue and accounting for 50,000 jobs between GE and its suppliers. ""Technology is out there to be had. I think we have to have a broad aspiration to lead in technology,"" Immelt said. Richard Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, said he sees clean energy as a ""tremendous potential for us to lead"" and an opportunity for solid, middle-class jobs. Trumka expressed concern, however, that the tax code and various trade agreements the administration was looking at could put them at a disadvantage in the global market. But overall, he said, he sees green energy as a ""win, win, win"" for the country. The advisory board has been established for a two-year term, after which Obama will determine whether it is still needed. It is modeled on the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, created during the Eisenhower administration to provide the president independent advice on global affairs. Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist, serves as the board's staff director and chief economist. He also served as an economic adviser for Obama's presidential campaign. The other board members are: . • William H. Donaldson, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission . • Roger W.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Thursday signed the Tribal Law and Order Act, which provides greater law enforcement powers for tribal authorities on Indian reservations. At an emotional White House ceremony, Obama comforted a rape victim who broke down while trying to introduce him, by coming out early and offering her reassurance as she struggled to tell her story. Lisa Marie Iyotte of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe wept openly in describing the assault in 1994 by an attacker who was later convicted of another rape, but never prosecuted for the crime against Iyotte. Obama said the law he was signing would help prevent something like that from happening. Crime rates on some Indian reservations are 20 times higher than the national average, Obama said, adding that one in three Native American women are raped in their lifetimes, which he called ""an assault on our national conscience."" ""These are significant measures that will empower tribal nations and make a real difference in people's lives,"" Obama said of the new law. The law requires the Department of Justice to improve coordination with  tribal justice officials in prosecuting crimes on reservations, and  provides resources for better overall cooperation between tribal, state  and federal agencies. In addition, the measure increases the maximum sentence that tribal courts can impose to three years, instead of the previous limit of a one-year sentence. Supporters of the measure say the sentencing provision will expand the number of cases handled by tribal courts, increasing local tribal control on reservations. The new law reauthorizes existing initiatives such as at-risk youth programs and treatment programs, said Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians. ""Law enforcement on tribal lands has long been hamstrung by a lack of resources and by restrictions placed by the federal government,"" Keel said. ""The Tribal Law and Order Act is a significant step forward for tribal police."" The House approved the bill last week; it passed the Senate in June.","NEW: President Obama signs the Tribal Law and Order Act .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Clifton Mitchell helped register nearly 2,000 voters for the community group ACORN. But not one of them actually existed. Clifton Mitchell filled out voter cards using fake birthdays, Social Security numbers and baby-name books. ""I regret it. I paid the price for it,"" he said. Mitchell was convicted last year and spent nearly three months in prison. He's one of the few ACORN workers convicted of voter registration fraud. Today, he lives with his wife and two boys, ages 3 and 1, in a small apartment in suburban Seattle, Washington. Mitchell said he scammed the system because, ""I needed money; I had to support my family and I was new to the area. It was the only job I had."" Mitchell said ACORN threatened to close the office if he and his team didn't meet their quota to register 13 to 20 voters a day. So, without consulting their supervisors, he said, they came up with a plan. ""We came up with the idea: Let's make fraudulent cards. I tell my crew, 'I don't care how you get 'em, just get 'em,' "" Mitchell recalled.  Watch Mitchell explain how they created voters » . They took addresses from homeless shelters, used fake birthdays and Social Security numbers and took names from baby books to create voters out of thin air. ""Every day I'd go to the library and get a newspaper,"" Mitchell said. ""I had one guy who'd go to the phone book. Everyone had different methods."" The secretary of state called it ""the worst case of voter registration fraud in the history of the state of Washington."" ACORN was fined $25,000 and ordered to improve its oversight. The group is under investigation in 10 states for voter registration fraud, and Republican presidential candidate John McCain's campaign has accused ACORN of trying to rig the election for Democrats. But University of Washington law professor Eric Schnapper says the idea of fake cards turning into real votes is a myth. ""There are no known instances of fictitious people actually voting,"" Schnapper said. ""You look at some of the names: Mickey Mouse. Dr. Seuss. Mickey Mouse only votes in Disneyland. He's not going to show up at a critical precinct in West Virginia or North Carolina."" Schnapper said that if anyone should be upset, it's ACORN. ""The victims of this are the people who paid these workers $8 an hour to go out and find legitimate voters, and ...  they didn't get their $8 worth; they put down phony names,"" Schnapper said. Schnapper said he's worked on Republican and Democratic campaigns and has paid people to hand out leaflets or register voters. He said some of the workers do their jobs and some don't. ACORN said it has registered well more than 1 million voters, most of them Democrats. Though the group is under investigation in a number of swing states, such as Ohio and Nevada, amid accusations that it turned in fake voter registration cards, Schnapper said there's no evidence that any worker intended to commit voter fraud and actually take those names, produce phony identification and vote on Election Day. Threats of criminal prosecution may scare some groups into closing voter registration drives, according to Schnapper. It could scare actual voters away from the polls as well, he said, ""and that really does affect the outcomes of the election."" A report from the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School supports his claim. Researchers reviewed voter fraud claims across the country and found that most were caused by technical glitches, clerical errors or mistakes made by voters. One other finding: A person is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate another voter at the polls. ACORN has recently released a video on the Internet called ""Fight Back: The Truth About ACORN."" It uses a mix of interviews and video to fight what the group calls Republican efforts to suppress voter turnout. CNN asked Clifton Mitchell whether he and his team, at any point, got together to try to rig the election. ""When I did it, when my team did it, it wasn't to steal any election,"" Mitchell said. ""They're just trying to keep a job. But understand, I blame myself. I can only blame myself.""","Clifton Mitchell is one of few ACORN workers convicted of voter registration fraud .

"(EW.com) -- The fall season doesn't officially begin until Sept. 20, but the broadcast networks have already kicked off development for the following September. A number of hot projects have hit the marketplace -- a crime thriller and an Alcatraz drama from uber-producer J.J. Abrams, just to name two -- but those scripts don't seem nearly as provocative as the possibility of a (major?) comeback by a former ABC star. EW has learned from multiple sources that Tim Allen (""Home Improvement"") is looking to stage a return to prime time -- as long as it involves the right project. ""It will be huge,"" predicts one manager of Allen's comeback -- if and when it happens. Another source indicated that the actor is taking ""a few select meetings"" with writer-producers, one of whom may include Greg Daniels (""Parks & Recreation,"" ""The Office""). Is there a chance that Allen could even join the staff of Dunder-Mifflin? What is this, the return of the '90s stars? Not that there's anything wrong with that: There are certain veteran TV actors who will always trigger a flurry of excitement and activity from the industry if they indicate a desire to revisit their roots. Tom Selleck, a.k.a. ""Magnum P.I.,"" is expected to be the primary draw of ""Blue Bloods"" when it bows on CBS on Sept. 24. ""Friends'"" Matthew Perry is headlining ABC's mid-season comedy ""Mr. Sunshine."" Paul Reiser, who was on ""Mad About You"" from 1992-1999, will star in an eponymous comedy for NBC early next year. And Michael Chiklis, who last starred in the ""The Shield"" but headlined ""The Commish"" back in the '90s, was one of the most sought-after actors this development season before he joined ABC's ""No Ordinary Family"" (Sept. 28). And don't get us started on the enduring appeal of ""NCIS'"" Mark Harmon, who's been a bona fide TV star since his days on ""St. Elsewhere"" in the '80s. There are some TV stars who fans will always be drawn to, no matter what year (or decade) they decide to do another series. Allen now joins a small, but exclusive, list of actors that the broadcast networks yearn to cast every year in their next big TV shows. Perennial favorites include Kevin Bacon, Lisa Kudrow, Claire Danes, Ashley Judd, William H. Macy, Susan Sarandon, Elisabeth Shue, Josh Duhamel, and Scott Speedman.

"(CNN) -- In the grand scheme of things, LeBron James's answer to CNN's Soledad O'Brien regarding whether race played a role in the backlash to his ""The Decision"" special -- ""I think so, at times. It's always, you know, a race factor."" -- wasn't much. This wasn't Isiah Thomas supporting then-teammate Dennis Rodman's assertion that, if Larry Bird was black, ""he'd be just another good guy."" Yet here we are. For those of you who may have missed it, James chose to announce he was leaving his home state Cleveland Cavaliers via ""The Decision,"" an hourlong, prime-time special aired on ESPN. This was not the best decision anyone has ever made. In fact, in the annals of NBA-related TV decisions, it may rank just above Magic Johnson's deciding he'd make a good late-night talk show host and just below everything else. When at the end of the hour James announced -- finally -- that he was ""taking his talents to South Beach"" (making him sound more like a particularly driven Hooters waitress than an elite professional athlete), the sports world could stop holding its collective breath. Many used that very next breath to refer to James as some sort of selfish expletive. This was the equivalent of a breakup via Jumbotron times a million. The fact that the advertising revenue -- some $3 million -- went to the Boys & Girls Club didn't make it any less self-serving and egotistical and misguided. LeBron probably keeps that much on his Starbucks card. Somewhere along the line, though, the self-righteousness of the backlash eclipsed the selfishness of the initial announcement. And with that one innocuous comment on CNN, the backlash actually became the story itself. Noted good decision-maker and TNT analyst Charles Barkley stated on Philadelphia radio that James's continued decisions were ""like watching a movie -- just when you think it couldn't get any stupider, it gets more stupid.""  Barkley was 100 percent correct; just not in the way he intended. Some things worth noting: . • James didn't bring up the racial element, O'Brien -- who previously anchored a CNN special entitled ""Black in America"" -- did. His statement was in response to the question, ""Do you think there's a role that race plays in this?"" What was he supposed to say? ""No""? • Just because we elected Barack Obama, a black man, to the presidency, does not mean we immediately moved on to some sort of utopian post-racial society. Sorry. • James didn't say all the backlash was racial in nature. He didn't even say that most of it was. He didn't call anyone a racist. Heck, he didn't really say anything at all. He didn't ""play the race card"" as much as quickly drop it face-down in the discard pile. • James was 100 percent correct. • Even LeBron's closest advisor, Maverick Carter's less nuanced follow-up: ""It definitely played a role in some of the stuff coming out of the media, things that were written for sure"" seemed true enough after, well, things that were written. There wasn't anything particularly overt, except for (mostly white) sportswriters lamenting LeBron's sense of entitlement while displaying an absolutely shocking amount of their own. In the prologue to his 2006 book, ""Forty Million Dollar Slaves,"" William Rhoden wrote: ""Today's generation of pro athletes may be wealthy, but they are simultaneously cheered and resented -- a tension that can't last forever."" We like our greatest athletes to stick to a time-worn script, to stay where they are and persevere until mountains are climbed, hurdles are hurdled, bullies are vanquished and championships are won. We're able to overlook the staggering salaries and outrageous ticket prices in hopes of seeing another Michael, another Magic, another Bird. We like our sports stories to build like fairy tales, to end with Jack vanquishing the giant, with Cinderella going to the ball, with ""and they all lived happily ever after."" And when a superstar departs from this storyline, we feel betrayed. How could you do this to us? To claim that such reactions don't split at least partially on racial lines is to be either irrationally optimistic or willfully blindered. Even the numbers support a division. According to a Q Scores popularity poll taken after ""The Decision,"" James's negative Q rating amongst nonblacks went from 24 percent to 44, while among blacks it only gained one point, from 14 percent to 15. Those numbers can't be explained away, or attributed to some sort of polling error. To deny the racial aspect of the backlash entirely -- well, just when you think it can't get any stupider, it gets more stupid. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russ Bengston.","Lebron James said race played a role in backlash to ""The Decision""

"(CNN) -- India and Pakistan have finally found something they can agree on. Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi, an Indian and Pakistani doubles team, made it to the men's doubles finals in the U.S. Open. On Friday afternoon, the 16th-seeded pair lost to the top-seeded Mike and Bob Bryan, an American team of identical twins. This unlikely pair, dubbed the Indo-Pak Express, has become a symbol of pride for both nations. Qureshi, from Pakistan, says he can see it in the fans who come to watch. ""It was great to see all the Indian supporters, most of them wearing Pakistani flags on their faces, holding Pakistani flags and cheering for the same team,"" he said. ""That's a moment I will never forget in my life, meeting so many Indians supporting us."" India and Pakistan have been bitter foes since their creation in 1947, fighting three wars over the disputed territory of Kashmir and routinely exchanging fire over the border. Bopanna and Qureshi hope they can ease these tense relations with their message of peace through sport. At Wimbledon this year, the team sported T-shirts and jackets with the message ""Stop War, Start Tennis."" The pair has even proposed playing a match at the Wagah border crossing between India and Pakistan. ""And just looking at the bigger picture, I just feel if me, as a Pakistani, and him, as an Indian, can do so well on the court and be friends off the court, there's no other reason why those Indians and Pakistanis can't be friends,"" Qureshi said in an interview with CNN. Friends say they also carry this spirit of peace and cooperation with them off the court. ""They understand each other, speak the same language, their games complement each other,"" said Fazal Syed, a former Davis Cup player. They have chemistry, key to winning doubles matches, Syed said. In the audience at Wednesday's match was another unlikely pair: the United Nations ambassadors from India and Pakistan, cheering on the Indo-Pak Express -- together. This is the type of cooperation and progress that Bopanna and Qureshi hope to encourage. This chemistry has allowed Bopanna and Qureshi to upset several teams during the tournament. In round 3 of the U.S. Open, the pair beat No. 2-seeded Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia. Bopanna and Qureshi went on in the quarterfinals to beat 10th-seeded Wesley Moodie of South Africa and Dick Norman of Belgium. And on Wednesday, the pair beat unseeded Eduardo Schwank and Horacio Zeballos of Argentina. Bopanna hopes they can get their message to their home nations by playing well at the tournament. ""I think it's really about practicing well and then working as a team together, and I think that's the main key, just believing in each other,"" he said. The run to the finals in New York is sure to generate publicity at home. But the pair won't be talking politics. ""You can't mix politics, religion or culture with sports,"" Qureshi said. ""That's the beauty about it."" There's only one thing that the two players don't agree on, and it has little to do with cross-border differences. Bopanna likes spicy food; Qureshi most certainly doesn't.","Indian Rohan Bopanna, Pakistani Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi are the Indo-Pak Express .

"Westminster, Maryland (CNN) -- Matthew Snyder's funeral was to be a private affair, with family and friends gathering at a Catholic church to mourn the 20-year-old Marine who died a hero in Iraq, serving his country. But Matt's father says his grief was compounded by anger and helplessness because of about a dozen unwanted visitors, a fringe group standing at the center of a constitutional showdown. ""I was just shocked that any individual could do this to another human being,"" Albert Snyder told CNN. ""I mean, it was inhuman."" He speaks of members of a small Kansas church who have gained nationwide attention for protesting loudly at funerals of U.S. service members, denouncing homosexuality. Both sides will now receive a Supreme Court hearing over their competing constitutional rights. Oral arguments are Wednesday morning, with a final ruling some months away. At issue is a balancing test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech and religious expression rights of demonstrators, however disturbing and provocative their message. Several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the protests are conducted. Here, venue and context will be key to the justices' decision -- whether funerals warrant a greater zone of privacy, and whether the ""speech"" in this case was specifically aimed at a private citizens like the Snyder family. 'Everyone deserves to be buried with dignity' Matt Snyder always wanted to be a solider, his father said. His son enlisted just after high school, he said, and enjoyed the military life: ""I think Matt wanted to be in a job where he could help people and serve that purpose."" The young lance corporal died from a noncombat-related vehicle accident in Iraq's Anbar province on March 3, 2006. Albert Snyder called it the worst day of his life. The funeral was held at St. John Catholic Church in this northern Maryland town. Two days before, members of the Westboro Baptist Church had advertised its intent to appear and picket. That prompted a heavy police presence at the March 10 funeral, including a command center and SWAT team. Westboro Baptist Church members were confined to a pre-assigned space along a public road, some distance from the church building. The funeral procession was rerouted to avoid driving directly past the protesters. The hecklers carried signs that varied from the general to the personal: ""God Hates America,"" Priests Rape Boys,"" but also ""You're Going to Hell,"" and ""God Hates You,"" which the Snyder family claimed was directed at their son, who was not gay. The church patriarch Fred Phelps led the protest. ""That's what I preach. They're either fags or f---ing enablers. Take your choice, each one is going to hell."" Another church member said, ""We're here to tell them that they sent their son to hell."" There were no direct confrontations and no arrests of the church members. Albert Snyder then sued, claiming defamation and invasion of privacy. He says he became violently ill when he saw an online ""manifesto"" the Westboro Baptist Church posted after that protest. In it, the Phelps family said Albert Snyder and his wife raised Matthew ""for the devil"" and that ""God killed Matthew so His servants would have an opportunity to preach His words"" at other venues across Maryland. ""They are very sick individuals,"" said Snyder. ""It comes down to dignity. No one should be buried with what the Phelps did. Everyone deserves to be buried with dignity."" A jury agreed and awarded Snyder's family $2.9 million in compensatory damages, plus $8 million in punitive damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and intrusion upon seclusion, among other finding. Those total damages were later reduced to $5 million. It was the nation's first civil suit against the church over the protests. Albert Snyder testified he suffered severe physical and emotional distress, but church members argued their broader message was aimed at the unspecified actions of the military and those who serve in it. A federal appeals court agreed, concluding the signs and shouts did not directly refer to the lance corporal, and were therefore protected speech on issues of national debate. That court called the Kansas church's actions ""rhetorical hyperbole."" Now the Supreme Court is poised to offer the final word. Founder's daughter dismisses effort to silence church . Westboro is a mostly family affair, with the Phelps family making up most of the 75 or so congregants. They own a compound of houses in Topeka, Kansas, where they live and conduct services. The pastor has 13 children, at least 54 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. He described himself as an ""old-time"" gospel preacher in a CNN interview in 2006, saying, ""You can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God."" The church, founded in 1955 and led by Phelps, is not affiliated with any known Baptist associations but has been officially registered as a religious institution. Its members believe God is punishing the United States for ""the sin of homosexuality,"" through events including soldiers' deaths. Members have traveled the country hundreds of times, shouting their unique message. Before they began protesting the funerals of soldiers, church members brought their colorful ""God hates fags"" signs to the funerals of gay men who died of AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses. Church members also picketed the funeral of Matthew Shepherd, the victim of an anti-gay beating and one of those for whom the Matthew Shepherd and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was named. They also show up at football games, music concerts, Jewish institutions, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, state legislatures and courthouses. They plan to picket outside the Supreme Court at Wednesday's oral arguments in the dispute. Westboro leaders openly admit they seek to shock and provoke with their message. ""WBC's speech is in a format showing it is religious commentary,"" said church members in their brief to the Supreme Court. ""WBC's speech was public-issue speech, highly disliked, and needing protection. A massive public discussion is under way in this nation -- about the wars; the soldiers; their deaths; and their funerals. Everyone is using the occasion of soldiers' deaths to comment, about the policies of this nation."" Shirley Phelps-Roper, daughter of the church's founder and a leader of the group, dismissed Snyder's efforts to silence the church. ""I don't care what they want to,"" she said in a 2006 CNN interview. ""What they want to do is litigate our religious doctrine. Well, you don't do that in America."" Free speech or harassment? The Supreme Court has never addressed the specific issue of laws designed to protect the ""sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services"" as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased. But the high court has recognized the state's interest in protecting people from unwanted protests or communications while in their homes. In a larger context, the justices will be asked to address how far states and private entities such as cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket-free zones and the use of ""floating buffers"" to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting. Various jurisdictions across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the Westboro church protesters. In a separate appeal, the high court last year temporarily blocked Missouri's effort to enforce a specific law aimed at the church. Phelps, his daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper and other church members had protested near the August 2005 funeral of an Army soldier in St. Joseph, Missouri. State lawmakers later passed the ""Spc. Edward Lee Myers Law,"" criminalizing picketing ""in front or about"" a funeral location or procession. That issue could reach the Supreme Court in the next year or two. Snyder's attorney, Sean Summers, says there would be no constitutional quandary if the Phelps picketed the state capitol or in a public park. But he says this is different. ""When they protest outside a private funeral, they're not trying to advocate for or against a particular position,"" he told CNN. ""All they're doing is harassing a family so they can hijack someone else's private event."" The grieving father remains angry at the Phelps and said he is determined to continue the fight. ""They are using the First Amendment as a sword and a shield. My son and thousands like him did not put their lives on the line so that someone could abuse the Constitution like this,"" he said. ""Men and women have died for this right and to have it abused and spit on -- it's not free speech. This fight has never been about free speech to me, it's about harassment."" CNN's Kate Bolduan contributed to this report.","Westboro Baptist Church brings anti-gay message to soldiers' funerals .

"(CNN) -- Cargill Meat Solutions Corp. has recalled about 8,500 pounds of ground beef that may be contaminated with E. coli, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Saturday. The move came after three people, two in Maine and one in New York, were identified as becoming ill from a strain of E. coli, the government said. None of the three required hospitalization, said Cargill Inc. spokesman Mike Martin. ""It was a relief it wasn't more serious,"" he told CNN. The USDA says it believes certain BJ's Wholesale Club stores in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Virginia received the products. The recalled ground beef was shipped June 11 to distribution centers, where it was repackaged into consumer-size packages and sold under different retail brand names. The USDA did not identify the brands. The recalled beef bears the USDA establishment number ""EST. 9400,"" a product code of ""W69032"" and a ""use/freeze by"" date of July 1. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Services, which said it became aware of the problem on August 5, ""determined that there is an association between the ground beef products subject to recall and the cluster of illnesses in the states of Maine and New York."" Saturday's statement identified the strain as E. coli 026, which can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in severe cases, kidney failure. The government ""strongly encourages consumers to check their freezers and immediately discard any product subject to this recall."" The government lists the recall as Class 1, meaning ""there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death."" Consumers with questions regarding the recall should contact the Cargill consumer line at (877) 788-4953. Martin said Cargill is working with the USDA to learn what happened. ""We decided to take swift action to do the right thing,"" he said of the recall.","NEW: None of those who became ill required hospitalization .

"(CNN) -- Academy Award-winning actress Mira Sorvino is dedicated to ending human trafficking. She serves as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and she frequently travels abroad to raise awareness about the issue. Sorvino also been involved with CNN Heroes since 2007, the first year of the campaign. She recently sat down with CNN Heroes producer Brittany Stahl to talk about the campaign and her humanitarian work. Below are excerpts from that interview. Brittany Stahl: Tell me about your work fighting human trafficking. Why did you get involved, and what exactly do you do? Mira Sorvino: Trafficking is the worst kind of human depravity that you can imagine. And it involves children and the most vulnerable, the poorest of the poor. So, everywhere I go with the U.N., in addition to doing our official duties and holding our press conferences, I interview victims. I basically consider myself a victim's advocate. I feel like that that's the best way that I can expose the really horrendous nature of the crime to the public and try to produce swifter results. Because once you get to know individuals who have suffered at the hands of traffickers ... who have lived to tell the tale, it is so disturbing and heartbreaking that you feel compelled to act. You feel compelled to work against it. It's definitely a cause worth fighting for. Stahl: What is a hero to you? Sorvino: A hero is someone who braves extraordinary risk and gives so much more of him or herself ... to uplift someone or many people who are suffering. Stahl: Do you have any personal heroes? Sorvino: The first one that comes to mind for me is Martin Luther King. He was always my hero. That was always who I aspired to be like if I could be like anybody in a moral, human way. I read all of his speeches and his autobiography, and I just try to learn from his path and what he did. Stahl: You were a presenter at the first ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" back in 2007. What was that like? Sorvino: It was really amazing. I was extremely moved by all the extraordinary things that all the various Heroes had done. And that the emphasis of such a prestigious show -- on acts of altruism and selflessness and service -- is exactly what the world's focus should be on. It combats the ridiculous frothiness of reality TV and the consumerism that has sort of become our national religion. Human acts of kindness and love -- and love borne out by action -- is really what life is all about. It's about how much you're giving, not how much you're getting. So it's an extraordinary show, and I was really, really proud to be a part of it. Stahl: Did any of those CNN Heroes particularly inspire you? Sorvino: You know, they all did. I was just sort of in awe, one after the next. Wow. They just inspired me further to do what little I can on my side in any of my activism or things that I'm trying to do. It's just like: ""OK, yeah, you can do this. You can get involved, and you can try to make a small difference."" Stahl: Why do you think we need to honor everyday heroes? Sorvino: It's really inspirational. But you know there's lots of ways to be a hero, too. There are many people who are heroic in their everyday life and their everyday generosity. Some people are gigantic heroes who save people from burning buildings, and some people are just saving people by loving them in a constant and almost superhuman way. I think it's a wonderful thing.","Actress Mira Sorvino is a U.N. ambassador raising awareness about human trafficking .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Country music act Sugarland settled a lawsuit with a co-founder who claimed she was owed a share of the group's profits since she left five years ago, according to a court filing. Kristen Hall left the trio Sugarland to write songs and to pursue a solo career in 2005, leaving Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles to carry on as a duo. Hall filed a federal lawsuit against her former bandmates two years ago demanding that she be paid a third of Sugarland's profits because of her role in founding the group and in creating their hit debut album in 2004. U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten signed an order last week recognizing the settlement, although terms of the agreement were not included. Lawyers have until December 13 to file the final papers or else Hall has the right to re-open the lawsuit, the order said.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's unemployment rate rose to 20.09 percent for the second quarter of 2010, up from 20.05 percent from the previous quarter, Spain's National Statistics Institute said Friday. It is the highest level in 13 years, and it comes despite a rise in seasonal jobs for the summer. The figure means 4.6 million people are jobless in Spain. Spain has had one of the highest unemployment rates in the European Union, hovering near 20 percent for months. Data released earlier this month by Eurostat, the European statistics agency, showed the Baltic countries of Latvia and Estonia with similar jobless rates.

"(CNN) -- Imagine a star so luminous that it would burn the Earth up if it were anywhere near, a star that outshines the sun as much as the sun outshines the moon. A monster even in the abyss of space. The star is not some scientist's celestial dream. Astronomers used a Very Large Telescope -- the instrument's official name -- to detect the most massive star discovered to date. In scientific lingo, it's a ""hypergiant."" Led by Paul Crowther, professor of astrophysics at England's University of Sheffield, the team of astronomers studied two young clusters of stars, NGC 3603 and RMC 136a. R136a1, found in the RMC 136a cluster, is 10 million times brighter than the sun and is the heaviest star ever found, Crowther said Wednesday, with a mass that is roughly 265 times more than the sun. It was born even heavier, with a solar mass of 320. Astronomers previously thought 150 to be the upper limit. Several of the stars studied had surface temperatures of 40,000 degrees, more than seven times hotter than the sun. R136a1 is rare and resides in another galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its home is more than 165,000 light years away from Earth's Milky Way galaxy. As such, said Crowther, it is not visible to the naked eye, nor with a rooftop telescope. ""Owing to the rarity of these monsters, I think it is unlikely that this new record will be broken any time soon,"" Crowther said. Crowther's team used the sophisticated infrared equipment on the Very Large Telescope in a European Southern Observatory facility in Chile as well as data collected from the Hubble Space Telescope to detect the colossal star. The telescope is considered the world's ""biggest eye on the sky"" and is 8 meters (26 feet) in diameter. The research was published in the current issue of the British scientific journal The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. ""Unlike people, these kind of stars are massive when they are babies,"" Crowther told CNN. ""They lose weight as they get older."" At over a million years old, the star is already middle-aged, Crowther said, and could easily be a poster child for WeightWatchers, having shed a fifth of its initial mass over time because of powerful winds. In another million years -- a brief life span compared to the sun's 5 billion years of existence -- the giant star will probably explode as a supernova. It won't be noticeable on Earth because it's so far away. Crowther, excited about the new find, had to find simple terminology to describe it to his 6-year-old son Billy. Billy, in turn, wanted dad to name the monster star after him. That might have sounded a whole lot better than R136a1, but nonetheless, a star is born.","The newly detected star is 10 million times brighter than the sun .
Its birth weight was 320 times the sun .

But the 11-time Pro-Bowl selection has announced that he will continue for a 20th season with the Vikings following successful ankle surgery. He is now hoping to win his second Super Bowl title after taking Minnesota to within a match of last year's final, losing in New Orleans as his final throw was intercepted. Favre was visited by teammates Jared Allen, Steve Hutchinson and Ryan Longwell this week, and confirmed his return to the Vikings on Wednesday. ""It was very tough, I could make a case for playing and not playing. Ultimately much has made about the three guys coming down, it was really about the team,"" he told reporters at a press conference. ""When I left New Orleans a big part of me was, I don't want to say done, but the fact we lost that game... It's hard to make people understand. ""The mental toll is what is hard to deal with. This team is a very good football team, the chances here are much greater than other places. From that standpoint it has always made it easier, but answering the bell again... ""My wife always says I look at things more negatively than I should, but the 'what ifs.' I'd love to win the Super Bowl again, but what happens if you don't?"" Favre has been plagued by injuries throughout his career, and said even his latest surgery has not stopped a new spur forming on his ankle. ""I have played 309 straight games, I can't complain. There's nothing on me that's 100 percent, there's nothing on me that was the year before either. But the surgeries, I think, have made me a little better. ""There's a little bit of pain there. The fact is it's something I'm going to have to deal with. There's a little bit more range of movement there since the surgery, but we're not talking about a lot. I was hoping to resolve this, but every time you sprain an ankle, mine sprains a little bit easier than it did earlier in my career."" However, Favre is hopeful that he can add to his 1996 Super Bowl triumph, having returned to training on Wednesday. ""I've done it all. There's nothing left for me to prove. I'm here to have fun, help these guys win. I really enjoy this group of guys like you wouldn't believe. I think the feeling is mutual,"" he said. ""I can promise you this: Not that I have ever set out as a goal to play 20 years, [but] it's 20 years and I'm done. This is the last year of my contract. I'm sure a lot of people are like, 'Yes!' ""Did I just say that? I do believe it now. I do. I'm going to fall apart sometime.""","Brett Favre decides to play one more NFL season with the Minnesota Vikings .

"(CNN)  -- German World Cup star Sami Khedira joined up with his new Real Madrid teammates on Sunday after completing his move from Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart. The 23-year-old passed a medical on Saturday, and has now traveled to California for the Spanish giants' pre-season tour of the United States, the Real website reported. He and Sergio Canales, another of new coach Jose Mourinho's four acquisitions since he arrived from European champions Inter Milan, have swelled the Madrid touring squad to 25 after departing with Alvaro Arbeloa, Raul Albiol and Rafael van der Vaart. Real will play Club America in San Francisco on Wednesday, then take on Los Angeles Galaxy in the Rose Bowl on Sunday before heading to Germany for a clash with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on August 13. Real go to Belgium for a match against Standard Liege on August 17, then return to Spain to face Hercules in Alicante before hosting the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy match against Uruguay champions Penarol. Khedira became hot property after his superb performances in South Africa, where seized his chance after Germany captain Michael Ballack was ruled out of the World Cup through injury, as he formed a superb partnership in central midfield with Bastian Schweinsteiger. Khedira, who had been linked with a move to English Premier League champions Chelsea, has won 12 caps for Germany after making his debut less than a year ago. He scored his first goal for his country in the third-place playoff win over Uruguay. Stuttgart said details of the transfer fee remained secret, but reports have suggested he will move for around $18 million.","Germany midfielder Sami Khedira heads to U.S. after sealing Real Madrid transfer .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Amid the overwhelming flood disaster in Pakistan, the world has ""no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope"" that things can improve there, actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie told CNN Wednesday. Jolie is in the country as the personal envoy of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. She spoke to CNN from Islamabad after touring flood-hit areas of Pakistan, including the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. She described meeting a couple in their 70s who live on a pension and who watched as floodwater destroyed the family home they had worked hard to build. ""The woman is so embarrassed with her situation, and the man spoke of the fact that he never felt in his lifetime he is ever going to be able to recuperate what he's lost -- that he would never again have nice things, he would never have a nice bed, a nice house,"" Jolie told CNN. ""They lived in this place since 1972 and raised their children and their grandchildren there. And in a moment, a few hours, it was completely gone."" She said the area the couple lived in is now covered in mud and dirt, with feces in the fly-covered river nearby, all because of the floods. ""It doesn't have the dignity that they deserve to live in -- anybody deserves to live in,"" Jolie said. The couple lives in the village of Mohib Banda, where some 70 percent of the homes were destroyed or badly damaged by the swirling floodwater, according to the UNHCR. The death toll in the country has climbed to 1,738, the Pakistan Disaster Authority said over the weekend. Almost 21 million people have been affected by the flooding, Valerie Amos, the new U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said Monday. Water-borne illnesses from contaminated floodwaters have erupted nationwide. At least 1 million Pakistanis have crippling diarrhea or respiratory infections, and about 65,000 cases of malaria have been reported. Jolie's visit is intended to highlight the suffering of the millions of flood victims and the need for continuing aid for the displaced. One reason relatively few people have paid attention to the suffering in Pakistan, Jolie said, may be disaster fatigue. She pointed out Pakistan has endured several disasters in recent years, including an earthquake in 2005 that killed more than 70,000 people. ""We tend to focus on one issue at a time, because that seems to be what people can absorb and care for,"" she said. She added that it's difficult to convey the story of the disaster in Pakistan, and that even she had no idea what she would face. ""When I was standing in one of the houses, it was nine feet tall, the water. It was not a flood that made everything wet for a (while). It washed away children right out of their parents' hands. It destroyed lives."" Jolie said she would want people to remember this: ""They are people. They are family, and lovely, lovely, hard-working people and beautiful children, and they deserve dignity and assistance, and we have to treat them with respect and try to preserve what we can of their livelihood and their future."" The Pakistani people are resilient and will move on, Jolie said, but she urged international support to help them do that. ""I think we have no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope,"" she said. ""I think without that, we are just lost, and things deteriorate.""","Jolie is in Pakistan as the envoy to the U.N. high commissioner for refugees .

"Atletico Madrid upset European champions Inter Milan to secure the UEFA Super Cup in Monaco. Goals from Jose Reyes and Sergio Aguero handed the Europa League winners a healthy advantage before Inter's Argentina striker Diego Milito missed a late penalty. It signaled defeat for new Inter coach Rafael Benitez in his first competitive fixture, after taking over from Jose Mourinho, who joined Spanish club Real Madrid. Inter had the better of the opening half with Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder going close from a tight angle. But in the second half, Atletico posed more problems of Inter's defence and they deservedly took the lead when Reyes' shot squeezed past keeper Julio Cesar at the near post. As Inter pressed for an equalizer, Atletico doubled their advantage when Sergio Aguero turned home Simao's left wing cross. There was still time for Atletico keeper David De Gea to save Diego Milto's penalty in the final minute. Elsewhere, newly-promoted Kaiserslautern shocked German champions Bayern Munich with a 2-0 win in the Bundesliga. Two goals in as many minutes from Ivo Ilicevic and Srdjan Lakic gave the home side the advantage just after the half hour mark. Despite fielding a host of World Cup stars, including Franck Ribery, Thomas Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mark Van Bommel, Bayern couldn't find a way back into the game. Goalscorer Ilicevic was sent off in the closing stages for a second bookable offence but Kaiserslautern held on to win their second game in a row and climb to the top of the table.","Atletico Madrid lift the European Super Cup by beating Inter Milan 2-0 .

"(The Frisky) -- As a reality TV fiend, I assumed that ""Top Chef: Just Desserts"" was going to be totally vanilla. Oh, how wrong I was. Throughout the season, pastry chef Seth Caro has had some serious drama with assorted meltdowns and crocodile tears brought on by such tragedies as the fact that there were no more grapefruits in the kitchen. But this week's episode was beyond. Seth got so worked up after being told he couldn't make ice cream from scratch during a ""Quickfire"" challenge that he had a full-blown panic attack, saying he was leaving and screaming at the producers. He was carted off in an ambulance. And so, he was forced to drop out of the competition. But he wasn't the only one to go this week. Contestant Malika Ameen also decided to go home voluntarily, interrupting a judge to say, ""I would, perhaps, like to ask to be eliminated today."" Over the years, many people have quit reality TV shows in the middle of shooting. In honor of Seth and Malika, we rounded up 10 other reality TV dropouts: . The Frisky: 12 celebs who deny getting breast implants despite radical pics . 1. Ali dumped ""The Bachelor"" One minute Ali Fedotowsky was rolling around with Jake Pavelka in a pile of leaves on her hometown date on ""The Bachelor."" The next minute, she was knocking on his door and telling him, ""I have the most impossible decision to make right now. I just found out that I have to choose between staying here and going back to work."" After a discussion and a bunch of tears, Ali decided to leave the show. It was the first time on ""The Bachelor"" where a rose ceremony wasn't necessary. 2. Frank said ""no thanks"" to ""The Bachelorette"" A season later, Frank Neuschaefer closed the karmic loop. He was one of Ali's three finalists on ""The Bachelorette,"" but realized he still had feelings for an ex-girlfriend, Nicole. He dumped Ali in Tahiti and left the show. I thought for a second maybe he was pulling an Ed -- by leaving the show and coming back, you can virtually guarantee a dating show win -- but, alas, he never looked back. The Frisky: 10 stars with bad body habits . 3. ""Speidi"" escaped the jungle . Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt left ""I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here"" three times. First, they had a freak-out when they learned they'd have to take a turn cleaning their group's Port-O-Potty. Spencer said, ""I'm too rich and I'm too famous to be sitting with these people and cleaning up their s**t in the jungle, my man. And this cast is devaluing our fame right now. I'm sitting next to VH1 comedians that I have never even seen before ... I thought it was gonna be all celebrities."" They returned the next morning, when Spencer freaked out again. They returned once again but when Heidi got a stomach illness, they finally left for good. 4. Model was scared off by scissors . Every season of ""America's Next Top Model,"" there's a girl who is horrified when her hair is cut off during makeovers. But pageant queen Cassandra Whitehead took the cake in cycle eight. When the judges weren't pleased with her haircut and wanted to make it more like Mia Farrow's in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" she decided to leave the show rather than let them near her with a pair of scissors again.

Dina Manzo left ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" because she was over having to interact with Danielle Staub. ""I would say 99.9 percent is because of Danielle, but the other .1 percent was drama created by her,"" Dina explained. Guess she was scared that Danielle was actually going to make a skin suit out of her? 6. American Idol skipped the finals . Midway through season four of ""American Idol,"" fans voted Mario Vazquez right behind Carrie Underwood as their favorite to win. But he dropped out of the competition. ""I know I disappointed many fans, but it's all for the best, it really is,"" he said. ""It was a very, very hard decision, just thinking about everyone in the competition, who are my friends first, before competitors. It was a lot to think about, but my intuition told me I need to focus on personal things in my life."" Many speculate that Mario thought he could be a superstar without ""Idol."" He did get an album. But he is no Carrie Underwood. The Frisky: 15 signs you are ""just friends"" 7. Designer walked way from ""Project Runway"" Maya Luz was my favorite contestant on season 7 of ""Project Runway"" with her cool bangs and awesome designs. So when she quit the show saying she wasn't ready for Bryant Park, I was baffled. She explained, ""At the time I'd just graduated from school. I want to work for other designers. I want to maybe get my Master's. Just gain more experience, because when you're coming up with a collection, it needs to be totally representative of what I am. I just wasn't feeling like I was really ready to do it yet. I still stand by my decision."" 8. Puck was ushered off ""The Real World"" In its 24 seasons -- and by the way, how is that possible? -- ""The Real World"" has had about a zillion quitters, starting with Irene who left the show to get hitched in season two. The one we'll always remember the best: Puck, the nasty, foul-mouthed, snot-spitting bike messenger from season three. The housemates had to choose between him and AIDS activist Pedro Zamora. Guess who they picked? The Frisky: 30 things every woman should quit doing by 30 . 9. Quit ""Survivor"" for a good cause . ""Survivor"" has had its share of quitters over the years, too -- not that I understand why anyone would ever opt to stay on the show. Swimsuit model Jenna Morasca surprised us all in 2003 when she became the youngest winner of the show. A year later, she returned for ""Survivor: All Stars."" Midway through, she walked out the door to spend time with her mom who was battling cancer. She became the first woman to quit the show, though we certainly get why. 10. London left ""Daisy"" ""Daisy of Love"" may not have been the most popular reality TV shows of all time, but it is certainly one of the trashiest. On the show, Daisy quickly fell hard for brooding rocker London. He left, protesting the fact that the show seemed so fake. But -- surprise! -- he returned and in the end won Daisy's love.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has defended the club's American owners telling CNN he has ""no complaints"" with the way they have done their job. The 18-time English league champions were bought by the Glazer family in 2005 but have long been targeted by the club's supporters for running up huge debts. Though United have recently been rated as the world's most valuable sporting club by Forbes they still have estimated debts of over $1bn, leading many fans to call for a change of ownership. A group of wealthy businessmen called the Red Knights tried to launch a takeover bid last season but were knocked back, and now Ferguson has insisted the current owners are doing a good job. Is this the real Alex Ferguson? He told CNN: ""The debt has come through by the club being bought out by an owner. You know fine well that when a business is bought it's usually bought with debt. ""Because it's a football club it seems to attract a different type of negative reporting via the media and, particularly some of our fans. ""But Manchester United football club, when it went plc, it was always going to be bought. It was inevitable. So when a particular family like the Glazers have bought it, it's unfair they come in for criticism because anybody could have bought it. ""I have to say they've done their job well. They support myself, the manager, they've supported the players. I've never been refused when I've asked for money for a player. ""So what can I do other than carry on the way we're doing it and the way I'm allowed to carry on, I've no complaints.'' Ferguson is about to enter his 24th season as manager of one of the world's most high profile clubs. In that time he has won 11 English league titles and two European Cups. Speaking to CNN World Sport anchor Terry Baddoo on the club's pre-season tour of the United States, 68-year-old Ferguson reiterated his desire to continue as manager as long as he retains his health. He said: ""I'm at the right club, it's a fantastic club, it demands a challenge all the time. Every day, every year there's the challenge of being at the top and that helps me. I think you need good natural energy and I've been blessed with that. ""What you have to do is maintain the success of the club and make sure no matter when I quit the club is always in good hands and that's when I come back to the point about having young players. ""There's no need for a complete overhaul of the playing squad. I've got 12 players aged 21 or under which means the future should be pretty secure with them. ""Whenever I do go, and I don't seeing that being tomorrow, having my health is important. If I've got my health I can carry on. There will be a point when I do quit but when it is I've absolutely no idea. ""I tried it a few years ago and it was an absolute disaster. My wife made me change my mind and she was dead right. But when the time comes, I think the club should be ok.""","Alex Ferguson tells CNN he has ""no complaints"" with Man Utd owners the Glazer family .

"(CNN) -- American golfer and world number six, Jim Furyk, was kicked out of the first FedEx Cup play-off on Wednesday after missing his tee-off time by oversleeping. Furyk, 40, told the official website of PGA Tour that he set an alarm on his cell phone which ran out of power overnight and failed to wake him up. ""The hotel had power ... but somehow my phone died. I never use a backup because I just figure if the phone is charged, I'm good to go,"" Furyk said. After waking five minutes before he was due to start playing, Furyk made a dash from his hotel to the course but failed to get to the 11th tee of The Barclays tournament in New Jersey in time. Injury or family emergency are the only reasons that excuse a player's absence, consequently, Furyk will miss Thursday's planned round with countryman Steve Stricker and Ernie Els of South Africa. ""The rules are rules. No matter what tournament it was, I would be upset. But I'm more upset because it's this one,"" Furyk added. It means Furyk misses an opportunity to cement his third-place playoff standing in the race to be crowned champion. According to the playoff scenarios he could see his position slide to 19th before the Deutsche Bank Championship next week in Boston. One consolation to Furyk is that he already has enough points for the 30-man season-ending Tour Championship to be staged in Atlanta in September. Slugger White, the Tour's vice president of rules and competition told the PGA Tour website: ""It is unfortunate. Knowing Jim as I do and we all do, he handled it extremely professionally and put all of the blame on himself. ""He is a fan favorite and everybody likes him. He is a really good guy, but my hands are tied. I am sure he will recover quite nicely next week and jump right in there again.""

"(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar celebrated his ICC cricketer of the year award with another remarkable innings on Monday which should ensure that India wins the two-Test series against Australia if the pitch in Bangalore holds up. The 37-year-old batted throughout Monday's play as he moved from 44 to an unbeaten 191, just nine runs short of his sixth double-century in what is his 171st Test appearance. On Sunday, he became the first player to reach 14,000 runs in Tests -- just days after winning the International Cricket Council's top award for the first time in his illustrious career. He extended his world record to 49 centuries as he passed three figures with consecutive sixes off spinner Nathan Hauritz, helping India to 435-5 at stumps in reply to Australia's first-innings 478. Tendulkar, who fell just short of his seventh Test ton this year in India's first Test victory in Mohali, extended his third-wicket partnership with Murali Vijay to 308 runs. Tendulkar named cricketer of the year . The opener scored his maiden Test hundred before falling to fast bowler Mitchell Johnson in the 101st over for 139 as the left-armer took two wickets in four balls in the final session. Debutant Cheteshwar Pujara hit Johnson to the boundary from the second ball he faced, but was then trapped leg before wicket with the next delivery that kept alarmingly low. Suresh Raina (32) helped Tendulkar add another 61 before his brisk 43-ball knock ended with a reckless slog off part-time bowler Michael Clarke. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was unbeaten on 11 as he and Tendulkar negotiated their way to stumps, with India still 43 runs short of the tourists ahead of the final two days. Tendulkar was particularly harsh on Hauritz as he scored his 11th Test ton against the Australians, with the off-break bowler conceding 153 runs from his 39 overs. Laxman inspires remarkable India victory over Australia . The ""Little Master"" smashed 20 boundaries to go with his two shots over the boundary ropes, and has now faced 319 deliveries. Vijay was more sedate in what is only his eighth Test match, but also hit two sixes in his 310 balls faced -- though he should have been run out by Hauritz on 49 when he nervously scampered through for a single. ""It was a really special knock for me. It was a dream to play with Sachin. He helped me a lot and gave me pep-talks through the day,"" the 25-year-old told reporters. ""I was just focused on each ball and did not try to think too far ahead. I just want to do well whenever I get a chance."" Johnson, who won the ICC's top award last year, said Australia still had hopes of winning to level the series against the world's No. 1-ranked team. ""As a fast bowler, you want to see some bounce and carry, but this one was a bit too slow,"" he said. ""We stuck through the day and got a few wickets in the end to put some pressure on them. ""We saw signs of deterioration in the wicket at the end. Some kept low, a couple jumped. We have to wait and see what happens tomorrow.""","Sachin Tendulkar closes on another double-century as India reach 435-5 on day three .

The win equals the record -- held by Kaisterslautern and Bayern Munich -- for most wins at the start of a Bundesliga season. Tunisia striker Sami Allagui opened the scoring for Mainz after just two minutes. Hoffenheim hit back before half time with a strike from Demba Ba, but Hungarian striker Adam Szalai restored the home side's lead two minutes into the second half.

"(CNN) -- The first mobile phone powered by Google has gone on sale in the UK -- its first foray into the European market. The G1 represents Google's first foray into the mobile phone market. The G1 -- unveiled in New York last month -- has been released exclusively by T-Mobile and will go head to head with products such as Apple's iPhone, the Blackberry and other smartphones from makers including Nokia. The handset uses Google's Android software and is being touted as a phone with the capability of a hand-held computer. The arrival of Android signals the opening round of the battle between Google and its rivals such as Apple to create software for the next generation of mobile phones that allows users to connect seamlessly to the internet. It provides access to Android Market, which lets third party companies offer applications to users. The G1 makes use of applications such as Google Maps, instant messaging through Google Talk, as well as high-speed internet browsing and a 3-megapixel camera. Other manufacturers -- including LG and Samsung -- are expected to produce their own Google phones over the next 12 months. Analysts have said the gadget could potentially transform the mobile telephone market by providing service supported by advertising instead of subscription fees. But some believe the phone may struggle to compete with the iPhone in particular. Ernest Doku, from mobile phone comparison Web site Omio.com, told the British Press Association: ""Despite the popularity of the Google brand, the G1's design lacks the inherent 'cool' factor that made the iPhone 3G such a mass market success for Apple. ""The launch of the G1 is important not only because it's Google's first foray into the mobile market but because it's also the launch of an entirely new mobile phone operating system. ""Android is the equivalent of releasing an alternative to Microsoft's Windows - and equally as risky."" However T-Mobile UK managing director Jim Hyde told PA that the phone was set to ""revolutionise the way we use the internet on our mobiles."" ""It's uniquely built for effortless online communication whether you want to email, text or blog, and with access to some groundbreaking applications on Android Market, the possibilities really are endless,"" he added.","G1 -- unveiled in New York last month -- released exclusively by T-Mobile .

"(CNN) -- New France coach Laurent Blanc has chosen not to select any of the 23-man World Cup squad, that refused to take part in a training session during their disastrous tournament, for next month's friendly international against Norway. Blanc, who took over from Raymond Domenech following France's exit at the group stage of the competition, opted to exclude the whole squad for one match as a punishment for their role in the protest that came just two days before their final match against host nation South Africa. The French Football Federation confirmed the decision on their official website, with a statement saying: ""Laurent Blanc proposed to the federal council not to retain any of the 23 players officially selected for the World Cup in South Africa, for the friendly match against Norway in Oslo on Wednesday August 11. ""Laurent Blanc will release the list of players selected for this match on Thursday August 5."" France's tournament fell into disarray after Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home following a row with Domenech. Captain Patrice Evra then became involved in a heated public argument with coach Robert Duverne -- resulting in Duverne storming off the training ground with the squad retreating to their team bus and refusing to train. Among the players now not available to Blanc are Arsenal trio Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy and Abou Diaby, Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery, Barcelona's Eric Abidal, Chelsea's Anelka and Florent Malouda and playmaker Yoann Gourcuff -- who Blanc coached when he the pair were at Bordeaux. However, there is no suggestion that the ban will last longer than a single match and many of the players are expected to return for the opening Euro 2012 qualifier at home to Belarus -- although it remains to be seen whether Anelka and Evra, who were perceived as the ringleaders, will return to the squad. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris earlier admitted to L'Equipe newspaper that the players had made a mistake in refusing to train. ""We acted as a team. To strike was the decision of a squad who felt lonely, who believed that no-one had stood up for them and who had a message to convey. ""We went too far. It was a very awkward decision, a big mistake. It was completely stupid. But there were so many problems."" Lloris' Lyon teammate Jeremy Toulalan told the Journal du Dimanche: ""I'm not proud of what I did but I accept responsibility. There were no ringleaders and no slaves, no good guys and no bad guys. We were all involved and we are all responsible because nobody said a word against the boycott.""","Laurent Blanc choses not to select any of France's 23-man World Cup squad for Norway friendly .

"(Mental Floss) -- How well do you know your margarine history? Let's take a look at the origins of the butter substitute, and the dairy lobby's attempts to defeat it. Where did the name ""margarine"" originate? In a chemist's lab. French scientist Michel Eugene Chevreul discovered a new fatty acid in 1813 that he dubbed acide margarique. Chevreul's discovery contained lustrous, pearly deposits, so he named it after the Greek word margarites, for ""pearly."" Did Chevreul take his margaric acid and head straight for the toaster? Not quite. If you enjoy margarine, tip your cap to Emperor Napoleon III. Napoleon III saw that both his poorer subjects and his navy would benefit from having easy access to a cheap butter substitute, so he offered a prize for anyone who could create an adequate replacement. Enter French chemist Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès. In 1869, Mège-Mouriès perfected and patented a process for churning beef tallow with milk to create an acceptable butter substitute, thereby winning the Emperor's prize. Mental Floss: 10 foods that (thankfully) flopped . So Mège-Mouriès became the first margarine tycoon? Far from it. Despite Napoleon III's high hopes for Mège-Mouriès' product, which the scientist had dubbed ""oleomargarine,"" the market didn't really take off. In 1871, Mège-Mouriès showed his process to a Dutch company that improved on his methods and helped build an international market for margarine. The Dutch entrepreneurs realized that if margarine were going to become a substitute for butter, it needed to look like butter, so they began dyeing margarine -- which is naturally white -- a buttery yellow. Mège-Mouriès didn't get a princely sum for his invention; he actually died a pauper in 1880. The Dutch company that improved upon his recipe did pretty well for itself, though. The company, Jurgens, eventually became a world-renowned maker of margarines and soaps and later became a part of Unilever. How did the dairy world react to margarine's sudden popularity? They were predictably more than a little irked. Butter was big business, and the notion that a cheaper substitute, even one made in part with milk, might storm the market terrified dairy farmers. They didn't take the threat lying down, though, and convinced legislators to tax margarine at a rate of two cents per pound -- no small sum in the late 19th century. Dairy farmers also successfully lobbied for restrictions that banned the use of yellow dyes to make margarine look more appetizing. By 1900, artificially colored butter was contraband in 30 U.S. states. Several states took even more extreme measures to turn consumers away from margarine -- they required the product to be dyed an unappealing pink color. Mental Floss: How Temperance Movement almost killed root beer . Did other countries enact similar restrictions? If you think taxes and dyes are tough, then the Canadian government's anti-margarine campaign seems downright draconian. From 1886 until 1948, Canadian law banned any and all margarine. The only exception to this rule came between 1917 and 1923, when World War I and its aftermath left butter in short supply and the government temporarily gave margarine the thumbs up. Margarine didn't necessarily have an easier time after the ban was relaxed, either. Quebec's strong dairy lobby ensured that rules against dyeing remained in place in the province until 2008. Was there any way around these color restrictions? Sure. It sounds almost laughable now, but if you wanted to eat margarine on your toast without having to stare at its natural white color, there was a solution. As the coloring restrictions became widespread around the turn of the 20th century, margarine producers accepted that they couldn't dye their wares yellow. There was no reason why they couldn't simultaneously sell consumers margarine and yellow dye, though. When you bought a block or tube of margarine, you also got a packet of food coloring that could be kneaded into the margarine by hand. What helped margarine stay competitive with butter? More restrictions, of course. Paradoxically, the pure foods movement of the 1920s helped undermine natural butter and elevate the status of margarine. In 1923 Congress passed a law that made it illegal to add any other ingredients to butter, even additives that would help make the butter more spreadable. As any toast aficionado knows, margarine is a heck of a lot easier to spread than butter. Suddenly, butter makers couldn't tweak their products to make it easier to slather on breakfast, but margarine manufacturers could. Margarine's popularity skyrocketed. Margarine also got a bit bump from World War II. When wartime butter scarcity forced consumers to switch to margarine, lots of margarine holdouts realized that the improved product wasn't so bad after all. In 1950, the U.S. government repealed the heavy margarine tax, and the market continued to grow as individual states reversed their bans on colored margarine. The last state to repeal the ban on dyes? You guessed it: Wisconsin. America's Dairyland didn't allow dyed margarine until 1967. Mental Floss: 9 tasty foods named after people .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A jailed Italian mobster claims he can prove American student Amanda Knox, her former boyfriend and a drifter are innocent of murdering Knox's British roommate because he knows who the real killer is -- his brother. Luciano Aviello, 41, made the statement during a videotaped interview with Knox's lawyers. He said he had tried to write the Italian court several times to say that Knox and the others were innocent, but no one ever contacted him, defense and prosecution officials said. A source close to the case tells CNN that Aviello, who has been in and out of prison since age 17, was out of prison, living down the street from Knox and Meredith Kercher and under a ""protection program"" at the time of the murder. Aviello is serving 17 years in an Italian prison because of his association with the Camorra crime family. According to Italian media reports and Britain's Daily Mail, he has testified against the mob at several trials, always from behind a screen to shield his identity. Kercher, 21, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in the house she shared with Knox in November 2007. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, were found guilty in December 2009 of Kercher's murder and are serving sentences of 26 and 25 years, respectively. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, plead guilty to the murder and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. In March, Aviello contacted Knox's attorneys, who visited him in prison to learn more about his story. Aviello told Knox's lawyers during the videotaped interviews that his brother, who was staying with him at the time of Kercher's murder, came home one night and said he had killed a girl during a botched robbery. British and Italian media have reported the brother's whereabouts are unknown and neither the lawyers for Knox nor the prosecution would comment further. ""When he came to my house he had a bloodstained jacket on and was carrying a flick knife. He said he had broken into a house and killed a girl and then he had run away,"" Aviello said in his statement. Originally from Naples, Aviello says he was living in Perugia at the time of the attack. ""I know [he was involved] because my brother confessed to me that he had killed Meredith and he asked me to hide a blood-stained knife and set of keys,"" he said, according to an attachment to Knox's appeal documents. Aviello told the lawyers that his brother said he and an Albanian man broke into the house and found ""the poor English girl,"" Kercher and the drifter, Rudy Guede. Aviello said when Kercher saw them she ""started screaming like mad"" The brother ""stabbed her in the throat then he tried to stifle her screams,"" Aviello said. ""Meredith defended herself like mad, scratching and hitting out at him."" Aviello said he can prove Knox's innocence and his brother's involvement because of evidence he buried at his home. ""I had everything under a little wall behind my house,"" he said. ""I am happy to stand up in court and confirm all this and wrote to the court several times to tell them but was never questioned."" Italian prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, who led the case against Knox and Sollecito, told British and Italian media that Aviello's claims were irrelevant since the court already deemed him not credible and didn't interview him. Allevio sent the court three letters during the course of the trial, one of which was obtained by CNN. In the letter, which was sent to the court in 2009, Aviello said he was writing because he wanted to clarify ""what the media has distorted"" about Knox, Sollecito and Guede's involvement in the crime. Allevio also said that he met Sollecito while he was in prison and even expressed his ""bewilderment"" at how out of hand the trial had gotten. Allevio said in the letter that he knows ""the name of the real assassin"" because Kercher's death was committed by ""persons that are dear to me."" He did not identify his brother or anyone else in the 2009 letter, but he has now told Knox's lawyers his brother was the killer. Mignini told CNN on Thursday he couldn't comment much on Aviello's assertions because ""we need to verify his claims, in general, all of what he is saying."" Mignini said he has not yet interviewed Aviello, but will begin looking into his background as part of an investigation. That investigation will include checking out the burial of the key. Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he hopes a judge will allow Aviello to testify at Knox's appeal hearing, which is likely to take place in the fall. See the evidence presented in the Knox case . ""The court should have vetted the reliability of the person and the worthiness of his claims,"" Dalla Vedova said. ""We have posed again the same request to the appeals court. In filing an appeal, Dalla Vedova pointed to Aviello's letters to the courts, saying they show Knox was not able to present all the witnesses, and that may have influenced the verdict. Mignini disputed the claim. We ""can't simply investigate in the course of a trial every claim that comes up,"" Mignini told CNN. David Marriott, a spokesman for the Knox family, said that while they don't yet know whether Aviello's claim is valid, he feels it is only right that Knox get to air all the evidence in court. Even if the story isn't true, Knox and her lawyers should at least get the chance to investigate it and have his claims heard, Marriott said. ""The fact that the court didn't even decide to question him or at least look further into the claims is a part of what Amanda's appeal is all about,"" he said. ""We don't know the truth, but the court has the responsibility to check it out."" Marriott also said he thinks it's possible Aviello's statements weren't checked out because Italian police and prosecutors believed they already solved the case. ""There's no motivation I would guess for the police to actually pursue it,"" he said, when asked if the keys, clothing or knife Aviello claims were buried were ever dug up. ""In their minds not only is it over, but why would they investigate something that might show their initial investigation was faulty.""","Jailed mobster Luciano Aviello claims his brother told him he killed Meredith Kercher in botched robbery .

"Washington (CNN) -- With Congress adjourned until after the November elections, the campaign season accelerated Thursday as top Democrats accused Republicans of a strategy of obstruction while the House GOP leader called for an overhaul of how the chamber works. President Barack Obama met with Democratic leaders from both chambers before they left Washington for the election fray back home. Democratic sources said the party's congressional leaders pushed Obama to be more aggressive in helping them campaign in the final weeks before the November 2 vote. Their message after the talks with Obama focused on legislative accomplishments on behalf of working-class Americans despite the relentless Republican opposition. ""The Republican strategy has been and continues to this day to create gridlock and failure,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, told a news conference. The strategy failed, Hoyer said, because Congress passed major bills including health care reform and Wall Street reform, ""but they gave the impression to the American people that we couldn't work together."" Meanwhile, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, laid out a sweeping reform agenda for Congress, promising to make spending increases much tougher if he becomes House speaker in January. Republicans are pushing for a repeat of 1994, when a conservative-driven wave helped them seize control of the House from Democrats two years after Bill Clinton became president. This year, they are criticizing Obama and Democrats for continuing to increase the federal deficit and failing to bring down high unemployment in the slow recover from the economic recession. Democratic leaders have said they expect to lose some seats in the November voting, but they insist their part will retain majorities in both chambers of Congress. Addressing the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Boehner promised to help usher in a new era of bipartisan cooperation, but also pledged to change House rules in a way that would strongly favor the agenda being pushed by fiscal conservatives, including the Tea Party movement. In particular, he proposed doing away with the ""comprehensive"" spending bills that have been a hallmark of the congressional appropriations process for decades. Those measures authorize spending for multiple departments and agencies. ""Let's break them up to encourage scrutiny and make spending cuts easier,"" Boehner said, later adding that House members ""shouldn't have to vote for big increases at the Commerce Department just because they support NASA. Each department and agency should justify itself each year to the full House and Senate, and be judged on its own."" Boehner also proposed a new ""cut as you go"" rule that would require any bill containing a new government program to also include steps to reduce the same amount of spending elsewhere. Asked about the hostile political climate in Congress, Boehner said: ""There's no question that there's a lot of scar tissue that's been built up on both sides of the aisle, and both parties are to blame."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs agreed that Congress needs fixing, but he cited a different cause of the problem -- gridlock due to Republican intransigence. ""We've got judges that have sat around for 240 days, that passed out of a committee unanimously,"" Gibbs told reporters, later adding: ""It's not the way that place should run. It's not what the American people want to see. But it's the way Republicans have acted on Capitol Hill for the entirety of the president's time here in Washington."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Boehner's call for reforms was intended to shift focus away from what she described as a dearth of Republican ideas. ""It's no wonder that Mr. Boehner wants to talk about process,"" Pelosi said. ""They have no substantive issues to take to the American people. We'd rather talk about progress than process."" Obama already appears to be in campaign mode, traveling to four states this week to hold town hall-style meetings and address Democratic rallies. At a meeting Tuesday in New Mexico, Obama faced a range of questions but no matter the topic -- education, small businesses, military veterans, clean energy -- he repeatedly reminded listeners that the upcoming congressional elections would be their time to decide. ""I hope everybody is going to pay attention and do their homework and find out about candidates,"" Obama said at the end of the hour-long event. ""And I think what you'll find is, is that when you're making choices for governor and you're making choices for Senate and Congress, that these choices are going to mean something."" He encouraged people to ask themselves, ""What direction do I want this country to go in?"" ""Do I want to invest in our people, in our middle class and making it stronger, and our infrastructure and our education system and clean energy -- is that one vision,"" Obama said, ""or are we just going to keep on doing the same things that got us into this mess in the first place?"" That's the kind of messaging that congressional Democrats want from Obama, according to multiple senior Democratic sources who spoke to CNN after party leaders met with the president. Pelosi told Obama they wanted him to continue to make the Democratic case on jobs and the economy, and to contrast it with the Republican positions, the sources said. Obama said he would, and signaled there would be more campaign events than the handful already announced, according to the sources. CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh and Alan Silverleib contributed to this story.","NEW: Sources say Democratic leaders urge Obama to step up campaigning .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. response to the increasing natural disaster in Pakistan is, like so much else when it comes to American relations with that country, too little and too tentative. Epic flooding now hitting Pakistan is an unfolding humanitarian crisis on the scale of its 2005 earthquake, which claimed some 75,000 lives, or the 2004 Asian tsunami, in which more than 200,000 people died. And because of the gradual nature of flooding, as opposed to the sudden impact of an earthquake, the devastation over time could overwhelm those earlier crises. One in nine Pakistanis -- some 20 million people -- are already homeless, lacking food or medicine. Health officials warn that a cholera epidemic is likely, with 3½ million children now at risk. Despite the cataclysmic scale of this disaster, the Obama administration is not responding with the same direct, comprehensive and large-scale effort that the Bush administration undertook in response to the 2005 Pakistani earthquake and the 2004 Asian tsunami. This current approach of primarily relying on the Pakistani government and local aid groups will not work -- either in terms of meeting the scale of the crisis or swaying Pakistani public opinion toward the United States. American aid to the flood victims is a clear humanitarian imperative. Some have argued that it is also in the national security interest of the United States to win friends and stabilize the country. This is of particular concern since, according to my contacts in Pakistan and reports in South Asia media, radical Islamist groups allied to al Qaeda are on the front lines in providing direct aid to the flood victims. Jamaat-ud-Dawa, linked to the terrorists who carried out the 2008 attack in Mumbai, India, has already reportedly established 13 relief camps, with some 2,000 members providing help. Pakistan, the only nuclear-armed Muslim majority country, is the home base for both the Taliban and al Qaeda. Its population faces growing radicalization; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Adm. Mike Mullen, has called it the most important country to the future of Islamist extremism. The United States thus far is donating $76 million in assistance, only a portion of which is being provided directly by the U.S. military. But the $76 million is dwarfed by the massive humanitarian assistance -- hundreds of millions -- the U.S. military brought directly to victims of the 2005 earthquake and the 2004 tsunami -- delivered via aircraft carriers, hospital ships and thousands of American troops. U.S. military helicopters flew some 6,000 relief operations to Pakistani earthquake victims alone. For both the 2005 earthquake and the tsunami, the U.S. military worked closely with local governments, but did not leave it primarily up to them to deliver the aid. Large-scale humanitarian assistance can have a dramatic favorable influence on public opinion. The nonprofit organization I lead provided empirical proof of this in conducting the first public opinion surveys of Indonesia after the tsunami and Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake, as well as follow-up polls. After the tsunami struck Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, on December 26, 2004, the United States led an extraordinary international relief effort of on-the-ground, people-to-people aid. It was broadcast nonstop on local Indonesian television and had a clear American ""brand."" Afterward, public opinion among Indonesians dramatically swung toward the United States, with 65 percent of Indonesians expressing a favorable opinion as a direct result of American aid. Mullen called the shift in Indonesian public opinion toward America ""one of the defining moments of this new century."" Similarly, after the devastating earthquake hit Pakistan in 2005, the United States stepped in with another intensive relief effort -- again widely reported in local media and clearly identified as American aid. Afterward, our surveys found that 79 percent of self-identified Osama Bin Laden supporters (78 percent of all Pakistanis) thought well of the United States because of its humanitarian mission. Among all Pakistanis, the U.S. government was more popular than al Qaeda, the Taliban, or any Pakistani Islamist radical group -- even among Pakistanis who thought favorably of these groups. Indeed, the number of Pakistanis who voiced a favorable opinion of the United States doubled from 23 percent six months before the earthquake to 46 percent one month after American aid began. Yet our research shows that in the case of both the tsunami and Pakistani earthquake, public opinion changed only because the American military delivered the aid directly, in a comprehensive campaign cooperative with, but not dependent on, local governments or nonprofit groups. Whether from donor fatigue or simply a lack of vision, the United States is not mobilizing a similar effort now. In addition, the Pakistani government's response to the crisis has been ineffective at best. Distrust of Pakistan's political leaders is spreading as rapidly as the floodwaters. The United States has the same opportunity as the radical Islamists to fill the void. It can help the victims of one of the largest natural disasters we have recently seen. The United States can also win over Pakistanis, in the key country in the battle against extremism. But only if the administration steps up and deploys the same level of military resources as with the 2004 tsunami and the 2005 Pakistani earthquake can we succeed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen.","Ken Ballen says Pakistan floods are crisis that could rival 2005 earthquake, Asian tsunami .
But U.S. not meeting disaster with rapid, comprehensive approach, as before .
Extremists ready to assume aid role; U.S. squandering chance to woo Pakistanis, he says .

"CNN -- Spanish giants Real Madrid have confirmed they have reached an agreement with Portuguese club Benfica for the transfer of Argentina striker Angel di Maria. The 22-year-old is expected to sign a six-year-deal at Madrid with the fee believed to be in the region of $30 million. Di Maria is Jose Mourinho's first signing since taking over as manager from Manual Pellegrini at Madrid on May 31. ""Real Madrid and Benfica have come to terms for the transfer of Angel di Maria. The player will sign a six-year contract,"" the club said in a statement on their website. The attacking midfielder won the 2007 World Under-20 championship with Argentina in Canada. He also scored the winner against Nigeria in the final at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Di Maria is currently on international duty at the World Cup in South Africa, and has started all four of Argentina's matches. He started his career at CA Rosario Central of Argentina before moving to Benfica in 2007 after a host of impressive displays. He then alerted many of Europe's top clubs last season after helping Benfica claim a Portuguese league and cup double. Di Maria is expected to be the first in a string of big name signings as Mourinho attempts to wrest the Spanish league title back from rivals Barcelona.","Real Madrid confirm agreement to sign Argentina's Angel di Maria from Benfica .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 35 years after a Texas judge sentenced him to death, Ronald Chambers was found dead Monday morning on the floor of his cell. Guards found Chambers, 55, unresponsive around 6:30 a.m. while doing their rounds, Dallas County Sheriff Spokeswoman Kim Leach said. He was then transported to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, where he was pronounced dead. The Dallas County medical examiner's office said it would take six to 12 weeks before Chambers' cause of death could be definitively determined. But Leach said Chambers had many health complications when he came last year to the Dallas County jail. Chambers was 19 when he and Clarence Ray Williams kidnapped Mike McMahon and his date from the parking lot of a Dallas nightclub, then ordered them down the embankment of the Trinity River, according to the Texas Attorney General's Office. The two men robbed the couple and, after shooting at them, left them for dead. The female survivor, Deia Sutton, testified that she and her boyfriend survived the first attack, but Chambers went back and killed McMahan by repeatedly hitting him over the head with the barrel of a shotgun. On December 18, 1975, a jury found Chambers guilty of capital murder and a judge subsequently put him on the state's death row. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals twice set aside his conviction -- once because he wasn't read his Miranda rights after being interviewed by a state psychiatrist -- but both times he was retried and convicted again. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court again granted Chambers a stay of execution, amid questions about the instructions given to the jury, the Dallas Observer reported. The case was sent back to Texas and a fourth sentencing trial was set for spring 2011, according to published reports. While numerous reports called Chambers the ""Dean of Death Row,"" because of the various legal maneuverings he didn't have a death sentence the entire time he was behind bars, including at the time of his death.  Excell White, who killed four people in 1974 and wasn't executed until 1999, spent more time -- 8,854 days -- on death row before being put to death than any other Texas convict. Texas, which has executed more prisoners since 1976 than any other state, pays $86.08 to execute a death row inmate, or the cost of drugs used in a lethal injection, the state's Division of Criminal Justice reports. That compares to the $17,338, on average, that it costs to jail a Texas inmate for 12 months, according to 2009 data from the National Institute of Corrections, which is below the national yearly average of $28,689.","Ronald Chambers was found on the floor of his cell and later pronounced dead .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo was to the fore as Real Madrid came from behind to defeat Sporting Gijon 3-1 on Saturday night and move three points clear of Barcelona at the top of Spain's La Liga. Former Real reserve player David Barral shocked the home fans with the opening goal eight minutes after halftime when he beat the offside trap and fired into the roof of the net past goalkeeper Iker Casillas. But the expensively assembled Madrid team responded immediately, with Rafael Van Der Vaart making up for an earlier missed header as he pounced after Gijon keeper Juan Pablo failed to deal with Ronaldo's swerving free-kick. Pablo was booked after protesting that the Dutch midfielder had appeared to use his hand to control the ball before smashing in the rebound. Real took the lead in the 57th minute with another opportunist goal as midfielder Xavi Alonso netted his second of the season as he nodded in at the far post after Ronaldo rose highest to power a header which was destined to go well wide of Pablo's goal. Gonzalo Higuain, who scored a hat-trick against Valladolid last weekend, wrapped up the victory 11 minutes later when he cut in from the right and surged towards the Gijon penalty area before slotting in a low left-foot effort. It was the Argentina forward's 20th league goal this season, and sealed Real's 14th win from 14 at the Santiago Bernabeu. Coach Manuel Pellegrini, who received a vote of confidence from Real's directors after the disappointing last-16 exit from the Champions League two weeks ago, was not happy with the way his team played. ""We did not have a good first half, we did not have the creativity to break through Sporting's defense,"" the Chilean said. ""But what's important is that after the goal we conceded we knew how to react and we improved a lot in the second half. The team won and that's the most important thing."" Barcelona, who face English club Arsenal in the quarterfinals of Europe's premier club competition, can draw level on 68 points with victory at Real Zaragoza on Sunday. Sevilla's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League were dented by a 2-0 defeat at Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol in Saturday's late match. Striker Dani Osvaldo headed an eighth-minute opener and then doubled the lead on the breakaway after an hour to leave Sevilla four points behind third-placed Valencia, who host Almeria on Sunday. Sevilla, knocked out of the Champions League by CSKA Moscow in midweek, will lose fourth spot if Mallorca draw with Atletico Madrid on Sunday. Athletic Bilbao moved to within a point of Mallorca after drawing 2-2 with Getafe on Saturday, with both teams reduced to 10 men. Pablo Orbaiz put the Basques ahead but was sent off seven minutes before halftime, with Getafe having earlier drawn level through Manu (32). Fernando Llorente restored the hosts' lead from the penalty spot with 10 minutes left after Miguel Torres received a second booking, but Pedro Leon leveled on 86. Bilbao edged ahead of Deportivo La Coruna on goal difference after the Galicians suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at home to relegation-threatened Valladolid.

"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic upstaged Lionel Messi as Barcelona edged past lowly Osasuna with a 2-0 victory to go top of Spain's La Liga.

But Josep Guardiola's men were made to work hard by Osasuna and were thankful to their Swedish forward Ibrahimovic who broke the deadlock on 73 minutes. Teenager Bojan Krkic added a late second to seal the game. Blog: Is Messi better than Maradona ? The result takes Barcelona three points clear of rivals Real Madrid at the top of the league but Real can regain first place if they beat Getafe on Thursday.

"(CNN) -- The search for a freckle-faced 10-year-old North Carolina girl is over, with police announcing Friday that they had found her remains. ""We have recovered enough physical evidence to believe we have found Zahra (Baker),"" said Hickory, North Carolina, police Chief Tom Adkins. ""Today, our community mourns, our state mourns, our nation mourns, and the world mourns."" Adkins said that DNA from a bone dug up off Christie Road in Caldwell County -- the same place Zahra Baker's prosthetic leg was recovered late last month -- was consistent with that taken from the girl's personal items in her Hickory home, about 15 miles away. Meanwhile, investigators are working to confirm that more human remains found earlier this week on Dudley Shoals Road in Caldwell County -- five miles from the Christie Road discovery -- also belonged to Zahra. The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation will create a complete DNA profile of Zahra, using samples taken from her biological father and mother, to confirm they match the Caldwell County remains, according to Adkins. While there will be no confirmation until those tests are completed, Adkins said Friday that medical examiner's staff at the Dudley Shoals Road site said the remains found there ""were consistent with a child."" ""Investigators, agents, officers and staff who have worked on this case are devastated that they were not able to find Zahra alive and bring her home safely,"" Adkins said. The girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, reported Zahra missing on October 9. Elisa Baker was arrested the next day, after police said that she admitted writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home in Hickory. But no one other than a relative had seen Zahra since September 25, according to authorities, when a woman said she saw the girl at a furniture store. In mid-October, police announced they were treating Zahra's disappearance as a homicide. The disappearance of Zahra made international news. The girl, whose biological parents were both from Australia, lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer. The girl's father, Adam Troy Baker, was arrested late last month in nearby Catawba County on eight charges: five counts of writing bad checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Authorities said that the charges were unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, and he was later released on bail. His wife, Elisa Baker, remains in jail. Besides an obstruction of justice charge for the ransom note, she was accused of writing worthless checks. Police said that she has been cooperating with investigators, including going with them to the Dudley Shoals search site. Elisa Baker's sister, Carrie Fairchild, spoke on HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" soon after police reported they had found Zahra's remains. ""Most of the family's reaction is we're heartbroken and dealing with probably a lot of anger, too,"" said Fairchild. ""She's made her way into everyone's heart. She was a special girl and she will definitely be missed."" Friday's announcement is the most significant, but not the first major development in the search for Zahra's remains. On October 27, investigators announced they had found the 10-year-old's prosthetic leg in a brushy area off Christie Road. And earlier this month, authorities reported finding the bone that Adkins said Friday belonged to Zahra. Zahra's biological mother, Emily Dietrich, who has not seen her daughter since she was an infant, arrived in North Carolina on Thursday. Dietrich was emotional as she kneeled outside a makeshift memorial at the Baker home, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. At Friday's news conference, Adkins stressed that ""this is still a developing case"" and that investigators would continue to gather evidence. No one has been charged with a crime directly related to Zahra's disappearance and death. CNN's Deborah Bloom contributed to this report.","NEW: ""She's made her way into everyone's heart,"" a family member says about Zahra Baker .

"(CNN) -- Thirty-four vehicles, including four semi-trailer trucks, were involved in a chain-reaction pile-up Monday morning in Colorado that temporarily shut down a major highway and sent 12 people to area hospitals, state police said. The massive accident occurred on Interstate 25 northbound in Larkspur, about 40 miles south of Denver and 30 miles north of Colorado Springs, Colorado, State Patrol Trooper Nate Reid told CNN. None of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening, according to Reid. He added that road conditions were icy and wet at the time of the accident. Motorist Brad Simpson told CNN affiliate KOAA, ""It was just really bad snow, it was something where a lot of people were driving way too fast for the conditions."" Authorities used school buses to move people who were not injured but were stuck on the highway. They were taken to a shelter at the New Covenant Church in Larkspur, authorities told CNN affiliate KUSA. The accident prompted police to close the highway northbound. Several CNN affiliates, including KMGH and KWGN, reported that one lane reopened around noon and traffic was moving through all lanes by 12:45 p.m. -- about four hours after the accident happened.

"(CNN) -- Young golf star Rory McIlroy has turned his back on the PGA Tour and decided to focus on playing in Europe next year, revealing that he feels ""lonely"" when on the U.S. circuit. The 21-year-old, who won his first PGA Tour title at Quail Hollow in May, will follow Ryder Cup teammate and new world No. 1 Lee Westwood in concentrating on the European Tour. ""Sometimes you feel as though you have to be in America just to play the mandatory 15 and, at the start of this year, that was something I really wanted to do,"" he told reporters in Singapore, according to Reuters.com. ""I did that, but I also realized it wasn't for me -- but then it doesn't mean to say that I don't want to play fulltime in the States again."" The world No. 9 qualified for the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs in his rookie year in the U.S. as he earned more than $2.5 million in prize money and finished 26th overall. ""I found myself in America -- especially in the FedEx Cup play-off series -- just not wanting to be there, especially on the golf course,"" the Northern Irishman said. ""I switched on the Golf Channel and began watching the Omega European Masters in Switzerland and thinking to myself I would rather be there instead. ""It would be easier if I had a place in the States, and that would definitely make it easier to play both tours. Besides, with the majors and the WGCs, plus a few other events such as my defense of the Wells Fargo Championship, I will still play 11 or 12 there next year, and I will be happy with that."" McIlroy said he made his decision before European Tour officials increased the minimum number of tournaments required for full membership to 13. ""But that does make it more difficult,"" he said. ""Besides, I enjoy my time too much back at home. Holly [his girlfriend] also has another two years at university and we have two dogs, a nice house and I love my life back in Ireland, back in Europe and I don't want ever to give that up. ""But if I keep playing the way I have been playing, I will get all the invitations I need. Also after playing the Ryder Cup, I got a great sense of the camaraderie out there, and I got to know many of the European guys a lot better. ""The thing is that if you are playing well in the States, it's a great place to be, but if you're not it can be a lonely place. Whereas if you are not playing well on the European Tour you still have plenty of mates to hang out with."" McIlroy has decided to skip this week's Singapore Open, where Ryder Cup teammate Ian Poulter will defend his title, and instead focus on retaining his own Hong Kong Open crown later this month. Englishman Poulter will be up against the European Tour's leading money-winners, Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell, plus Sunday's WGC-HSBC Champions winner Francesco Molinari. Former world No. 1 Tiger Woods will defend his Australian Masters title in Melbourne this week, with the field also featuring Colombia's Camilo Villegas and Spain's Sergio Garcia. Home hopes include two-time champion Robert Allenby, former U.S. Open champion Geoff Ogilvy and Stuart Appleby.","Rory McIlroy will return to the European Tour as a full member next season .

"(CNN) -- While winter's start remains more than a month away, much of Minnesota and Wisconsin were under a winter storm warning Saturday, with some areas seeing almost a foot of snow. As early as 10:30 a.m., 11 inches of snow had fallen in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, the National Weather Service reported. Other Minnesota communities had seen 10 inches by midday, including New Hope, Amboy, Mankato and Montgomery, while parts of Minneapolis were blanketed by at least nine inches of snow. In some areas, an inch of snow was falling an hour. ""Even though we get this every single year, for whatever reason, the first snow of the year appears to make everyone forget how to drive in snow,"" Drew Gordon, of Eagan, Minnesota, told CNN Radio. ""So it's always a huge, huge mess."" Shortly after 5 p.m., the Minnesota State Patrol reported on its Twitter page that officers had responded to at least 401 crashes on Saturday, 45 of them with injuries. The agency warned drivers that conditions could worsen in the evening, as roads turned icy. The storm also affected air travel, with dozens of flights to and from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport delayed or canceled. The snow was accompanied by sustained winds blowing as high as 25 mph. The National Weather Service's warning extends through noon Sunday, with just under a foot of snow predicted in the heaviest hit areas, including Minneapolis and St. Paul. The storm's weekend timing muted its impact on traffic and the economy. Still, as the first big snow since last spring, it managed to jolt even Minnesota residents familiar with wintry weather. ""The reality hits when you need to dig out the shovels, and the snowsuits and the boots,"" said Lisa Saline of Bloomington told CNN Radio. ""I'm glad I don't have kids in strollers anymore, and I can hand them a shovel and have them go do the driveway."" The snow was forecast to continue into Sunday, and more might come before long, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures were forecast to be below freezing much of next week, with a 30 percent chance of additional snow on Tuesday. Minnesota and Wisconsin aren't the only U.S. locales experiencing wintry weather in mid-November. ""Near blizzard conditions"" are forecast for Wyoming and parts of western Nebraska starting as early as Monday night, with persistent snow combining with sustained winds as high as 45 mph and gusts up to 60 mph. While the National Weather Service is predicting a break Thursday, another winter storm could barrel through that region next weekend.","NEW: Minnesota State Patrol has responded to 401 accidents, 45 with injuries .

"(Health.com) -- The changes may be subtle, especially at first: An aging executive misses an appointment or two, or can't recall what was said in last week's meeting. A doctor who's nearing retirement suddenly blanks on a longtime patient's name. So-called senior moments like these aren't unusual as people age, but if memory lapses on the job persist, get worse, and can no longer be overlooked or downplayed by colleagues, it could be a red flag for Alzheimer's disease. ""New cases of Alzheimer's occur every 70 seconds,"" says Richard Mayeux, MD, a professor of neurology, psychiatry, and epidemiology at Columbia University, in New York City. ""The total number of individuals with problems like this will increase as the population ages."" Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease . Given the aging population and the weak economy -- which is prompting older people who do have jobs to stay in them -- the problem will likely only get worse. More than 5 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer's disease, and this number will quadruple by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in May, 35% of employed adults over the age of 61 said they'd delayed their retirement due to the recession. Roughly 60% of people in their 50s were worried they would have to do the same. Spotting the warning signs of Alzheimer's . What does early Alzheimer's look like on the job? The warning signs may differ depending on the profession, but one common denominator that affects executives, doctors, and construction workers alike is an overall decline in job performance, according to John C. Morris, MD, the director of the Alzheimer's disease research center at Washington University, in St. Louis. ""People just can't do their job as well as before,"" Dr. Morris says. ""These changes or declines in mental ability are subtle, so co-workers will cover up at first and make excuses such as 'Well, Fred is getting over the loss of his brother' or 'We just got a new computer system.' Gradually, their level of responsibility has to keep getting reduced so the person is either let go or kept on in a largely ceremonial role."" Health.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory . This pattern of rationalization and decreased responsibility is ""very common,"" says Patrick Lyden, MD, the chair of the department of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles. ""We see it most often in businesses where the founder is still in charge."" Short-term memory loss is the hallmark early symptom of Alzheimer's. Initially, memory problems may show up as forgetting appointments, repeating anecdotes, confusion, misplacing things, and trouble finding the right word in conversation. ""Eventually the diagnosis is made when the impairment is to the point where no one can ignore it anymore,"" Dr. Lyden says. ""People come to me because the forgetfulness has gone beyond names and phone numbers to include meetings, key decisions, and reiterating and rehashing decisions that have already been made."" Health.com: How to age-proof your memory . Memory loss isn't the only warning sign, however. Others include difficulty with technology and new tasks, and personality changes such as becoming more withdrawn and less talkative. In some cases, people may become irritable or agitated, or may start to behave inappropriately. These signs often become noticeable in the workplace before anywhere else. ""A lot of time stuff shows up at work that doesn't show up at home,"" says Anna Treinkman, RN, a nurse practitioner at the Rush University Alzheimer's Disease Clinic, in Chicago. Getting help . If a person begins to experience persistent memory problems and other signs of Alzheimer's, the first step is an evaluation that may include blood work, an MRI, and tests of mental function, says Dr. Mayeux, who wrote about Alzheimer's symptoms in the workplace in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year. It's important to seek medical attention sooner rather than later, as early diagnosis may improve prognosis, says Nina Silverberg, PhD, assistant director of the Alzheimer's Disease Centers program at the National Institute on Aging, in Bethesda, Md. ""Get evaluated by a medical professional, whether a neurologist, neuropsychologist, or primary-care doctor,"" Silverberg says. ""The belief in the field is that the earlier you catch it, the more effective certain treatments are. The less damage [to] the neurons, the more likely we will be able to preserve what you have for as long as possible."" Health.com: Alzheimer's disease: Should I take medicines? If early Alzheimer's is diagnosed, starting one or more prescription drugs may help slow the progression of the disease. But the available medications work only for a short period of time and only in some people, Silverberg says. How to handle Alzheimer's at work . If you have a co-worker who you suspect may be showing signs of Alzheimer's, sitting down with the person and expressing your concern in a nonjudgmental fashion can be helpful. ""Say, 'Have you noticed any memory problems? Do you have concerns or has anyone else commented about this?'"" Treinkman suggests. Calling a family member may also be an option. Although a person could become defensive, ""it's in their best interest to get an evaluation while still working, so they don't get fired,"" Treinkman says. Some employees may be eligible for short- or long-term disability, she adds. Health.com: Should you get disability insurance? The Social Security Administration recently approved expedited benefits for people who have been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's, which is defined as dementia occurring before age 65 (when Medicare kicks in). Roughly 10% of Alzheimer's cases are early-onset. Mary Sano, PhD, the director of the Alzheimer's disease research center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, worries that the legitimate concerns about rising rates of dementia in the workplace could spill over to older workers who are still competent. ""The awareness of a progressive disease with likelihood of further deterioration would impact on the ability to continue in many types of jobs,"" Sano says. ""Raising the retirement age could increase the likely occurrence of the working population being at risk for the disease, but most problematic is the potential stigma that this risk may impose on an older worker.""

"(CNN)  -- The thumbs of two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso are now insured for 10 million euros ($13.3 million) as part of a new campaign by Spanish-based bank Santander. Alonso's thumbs are both essential to F1 driving and ""a sign of victory and that everything is under control and well-protected,"" the bank said in announcing the new deal. The Ferrari ace will be starring in a series of ads for Santander's new insurance campaign, which kicked off Monday near Madrid. Alonso is a national hero in his native Spain after claiming back-to-back Formula One world championships in 2005 and 2006 when driving for Renault. He moved to McLaren for the 2007 season, but an intense rivalry on and off the track with teammate Lewis Hamilton led to Alonso leaving the team after one season. After returning to Renault for a second spell, the 28-year-old moved to Ferrari for the 2010 season, joining Felipe Massa at the famous Italian team. He led a Ferrari 1-2 at the opening round of this year's championship in Bahrain, but has been less successful in the two latest races, lying third in the title race ahead of next weekend's Spanish Grand Prix. ""We haven't always gained what we could have, according to our potential, but we're fighting for the title and this is what counts more than anything else,"" he told gathered reporters as his unusual insurance deal was announced.","Spanish F1 star Fernando Alonso has his thumbs insured for $13.3 million .

"(CNN) -- The men's U.S. Open final between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will be played on Monday after officials made the decision to call off the match due to persistent rain in New York on Sunday. The final was due to start at 4.30pm local time but U.S. Open officials took the decision to postpone the match at 6.20pm, with the rain at Flushing Meadows showing no sign of stopping. ""Due to the continued uncertainty of the weather forecast and to be fair to the players and not inconvenience our on-site fans any longer, we regrettably have to move the US Open Men's Singles Final, "" a statement on the official U.S. Open website read.

The women's doubles champions will also be decided on Monday, with Lizel Huber and Nadia Petrova leading Vania King and Yaroslavl Shvedova  5-4 in the final set. The doubles match is scheduled for 3pm local time, with the men's final to follow not before 4pm. For world number one Nadal it will be his first U.S. Open final, having already won the other three grand slam tournaments. Should he win the Spaniard would not only achieve the career grand slam but would become the first man since Australia's Rod Laver in 1969 to win the French, Wimbledon and U.S. slams back to back. Meanwhile, third-ranked Djokovic will be contesting the New York final for the second time in his career after beating six-time champion Roger Federer in a five-set semifinal on Saturday. Informed that rain was forecast for Sunday by reporters in his press conference, the Serbian was relieved that he might be given some extra rest time after his exertions over Federer.

"(CNN) -- A hearing for a soldier accused of killing Afghan civilians for amusement enters a second day Tuesday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. Military officials will determine if there is enough evidence to court martial Pfc. Andrew Holmes over the allegedly premeditated deaths of three Afghan civilians. Holmes is also charged with smoking hashish, possessing a dismembered human finger and wrongfully possessing photos of human casualties. He is accused of conspiring with Spc. Jeremy Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. On Monday, Spc. Ryan Mallett testified that he was on patrol with Holmes and Morlock in January when more than 20 soldiers were taking part in an operation to gather intelligence in an Afghan village. He testified that Holmes and Morlock gestured to an Afghan farmer working in a field with about eight other farmers to come closer so they could question him. Mallett said he saw the soldiers have the man raise his shirt to prove he didn't have any weapons. That's when Mallett heard Morlock yell, ""He's got a grenade, Holmes, shoot him,"" Mallett testified. ""I saw him [Holmes] shoot. I couldn't tell if he hit him. There were little pockmarks on the wall. I saw the grenade go off,"" Mallett testified. Mallett said Morlock and Holmes ducked behind a wall to avoid the grenade blast. As he ran down to the scene, Mallett said he tripped and fell but got up and kept running. He said the Afghan farmer was dead. Mallett said he recalled that as the soldiers checked their weapons, Holmes had shot eight to 10 rounds, and Morlock had shot two to three rounds. Also on Monday, Benjamin Stevenson, special agent for the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation Command, testified by phone from Afghanistan about visiting Bagram Air Base in May and finding human remains. ""When we reached the location, we climbed up on a barrier, and right where we were told the fingers would be -- that's where they were,"" Stevenson testified. Stevenson said fingers were wrapped in cloth. He also described the discovery of two bones that appeared to be arm or leg bones. Holmes is one of five U.S. soldiers from the 5th Stryker Brigade accused of killing civilians for sport and staging the deaths to look like legitimate war casualties. In all, officials charged 12 U.S. soldiers in what they called a conspiracy to murder Afghan civilians and cover it up, along with charges they mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs. Five of the soldiers face murder charges, while seven others are charged with participating in a coverup. Morlock was the first of the five to face an Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Morlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing Afghan civilian Gul Mudin in January with a grenade and rifle; killing civilian Mullah Adahdad in May in a similar manner; and shooting to death Marach Agha in February. All of the accused men were members of a 2nd Infantry Division brigade operating near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. The three others facing murder charges are Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs, of Billings, Montana; Adam Winfield, of Cape Coral, Florida; and Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas, Nevada. According to the military documents, the five were also involved in throwing grenades at civilians. Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. Wagnon allegedly kept a skull from a corpse, according to charging documents. Several soldiers are charged with taking pictures of the corpses, and one soldier is charged with with stabbing a corpse. Holmes' civilian lawyer, Dan Conway, has said his client did not kill any civilian and was ordered by his supervisor, Gibbs, to keep a human finger. ""There is no proof that ... Holmes caused or conspired to cause the death of any human being unlawfully,"" Conway said. During a break in the hearing Monday, Conway told journalists, ""The government, as they often do in some these of cases, casts a net entirely too wide."" Conway has said he plans to ask serious questions about the Army's command of a platoon that everyone agrees went terribly astray. ""The only way these kind of allegations can occur is the command is completely derelict in supervising, meaning not there, or they're ignoring that this kind of conduct may be occurring,"" Conway said. ""And I don't know which one it is at this point."" The Army refuses to comment on any aspect of any of the cases and has sought to limit circulation of evidence, especially since videotaped interrogations of some of the soldiers and alleged written confessions by some soldiers were obtained and reported by media outlets, including CNN. But it was the Army's own charging documents that portrayed a platoon gone rogue. In explicit detail, the Army wrote how killings were staged -- how a fellow soldier was beaten and how  Gibbs allegedly threw human fingers at another soldier believed to have snitched about the group's hashish smoking. The Army moved to restrict attorney access to what has been described to CNN by some who have seen them as a series of gruesome photos of dead Afghans by allowing inspection of the material only at a secure facility at Lewis-McChord. A number of attorneys have objected, telling CNN the Army is limiting their ability to defend their clients because it is more concerned how the charges are being played in the media and perceived in Afghanistan. CNN's Patrick Oppmann, Barbara Starr, Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Todd Schwarzschild and Courtney Yager contributed to this report.","Pfc.

"(CNN) -- Mexico's government must create jobs and improve education to help fight drug trafficking, the country's senate president said in an interview with CNN en Espanol. ""Together they form a true strategy for fighting crime and violence,"" said Sen. Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera, a top official in Mexico's opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party. Currently, Mexico's war on drugs is a ""fight of firepower between criminals and the state,"" he said. ""We have seen 30,000 people die in the past four years,"" Beltrones said. ""And we are very close to seeing, at the end of this six-year term, an equal number of dead as in the Vietnam War."" Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels shortly after taking office at the end of 2006. Since then, more than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence across the country. And Calderon's government has dispatched about 50,000 troops to the nation's trouble spots. A past governor of Sonora state, which borders Arizona, Beltrones also discussed California's recently defeated proposition to legalize marijuana. Proposition 19, which failed to garner enough support from California voters earlier this month, left many Mexican lawmakers wondering what they would do if it had passed, he said. California has already legalized medical marijuana. Supporters of Proposition 19 argued that the ""prohibition"" of marijuana -- much like that for alcohol decades ago -- has created a violent criminal black market, led today by international drug cartels. But opponents prevailed earlier this month. Still, Beltrones said the debate over legalizing marijuana is an issue Mexican officials will have to tackle ""sooner or later."" ""But we could not do it without developing a strategy with the United States, which is the drug's largest consumer... Crime and drug trafficking, which are transnational problems, need international solutions,"" he said. CNN en Espanol's Mario Gonzalez contributed to this report.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- A communication breakdown has left people in anxious limbo around the globe with those outside Haiti not knowing whether loved ones there survived a major earthquake, and those in Haiti unable to get word out that they're safe. With few phone calls going through in the Caribbean nation in the aftermath of Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, people were driven to texting, social networking sites and other online communication. Thousands of people reached out through CNN's iReport Web page, posting pictures of missing loved ones and asking anyone with information to contact them. Pleas for help filled page after page on iReports, including: . • Johanna Neyra, who was trying to track down her cousin and his wife, Luis and Heidy Carazas. Luis Carazas works for the Archdiocese of Port-au-Prince, in the Haitian capital. ""His family is very concerned in Peru,"" said Neyra, who waited for word of their fate, knowing the official Vatican newspaper had reported that Joseph Serge Miot, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Port-au-Prince, had died in the earthquake. • Naeemah Carre of Garden City, New York, reported no success in trying to raise her brother and six other relatives via e-mail and Facebook. • New York City resident Marie Aline Sillice had not heard from her father, Frangel Victor Sillice, or her cousin Yvon Consean, who were to have been traveling outside the Haitian capital on Tuesday. • Chico and Kathleen Boyer waited in Brooklyn, New York, to hear from daughter Maureen, who moved to Haiti two weeks ago. A number of aunts and cousins also were missing. Maureen Boyer posted to her Twitter account late Tuesday afternoon, but had not been heard from since. ""When the earthquake hit, she may have been home already or on the road close to home,"" Kathleen Boyer said in her iReport. ""We can't get through to the consulate to report her as a missing U.S. citizen."" • Renee Guercia of Muttontown, New York, waited for word about her 71-year-old father, Joseph, who was in Port-au-Prince on business when the quake hit.

""They were having a conversation when the earthquake hit and the roof caved in,"" Renee Guercia said. ""John called out for my dad and there was no response."" Scarborough -- knocked unconscious -- was later rescued from the rubble of the hotel and airlifted to Miami, Guercia said.

"(CNN) -- While Myanmar's military rulers ordered Aung San Suu Kyi detained for two decades, legendary rock band U2 gave her a voice -- in the form of the hit song ""Walk On"" -- on the world stage. Bono, the Irish band's lead singer and a long-time political activist, was among those cheering the pro-democracy activist's release Saturday. In an exclusive CNN interview, Bono said he was ""feeling great"" for Suu Kyi, adding that he's hopeful the action might signal real political progress in the south Asian country after decades of political strife. ""It's sort of a cautious joy, because though she's out in the world, ... she's perhaps more vulnerable,"" Bono told CNN. ""I'm very excited, very thrilled at the possibility that this might be the beginning of some sort of rational discussion."" Bono said he'd spoken with members of Suu Kyi's family recently, but hasn't heard from them or the democracy leader since her release Saturday. Still, he said he's been eagerly following the recent developments of a woman he has deemed a ""real hero"" for her humility, conviction and idealism over the years. ""She is kind of the Mandela of our moment,"" said Bono, referring to Nelson Mandela, who spent decades in prison during South Africa's apartheid era prior to his release and political ascent. ""She's a character of great grace. Her struggle has become a symbol of what's best about our humanity and worst."" U2 and Bono have long been among Suu Kyi's most high-profile advocates. The band wrote its hit 2001 single ""Walk On"" about the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner. Bono wore a t-shirt emblazoned with Suu Kyi's face in the music video, while tens of thousands of concertgoers sometimes held up her picture while the song was played. In a 2004 Time magazine article, Bono explained why U2 dedicated the song to a woman he called ""a real hero in an age of phony phone-in celebrity."" ""Suu Kyi, with an idea too big for any jail and a spirit too strong for any army, changes our view -- as only real heroes can -- of what we believe is possible,"" he wrote. Suu Kyi's MySpace page said that Myanmar's ruling junta had banned the song, which contains the lyrics: . ""And if your glass heart should crack . And for a second you turn back . Oh no, be strong -- . What you got, they can't steal it . No, they can't even feel it . Walk on, walk on . Stay safe tonight."" In 2004, U2 joined forces with R.E.M., Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Sting, Pearl Jam, Peter Gabriel and other rock stars on an album called ""For the Lady,"" which was released in support of Suu Kyi. Bono said his excitement at Suu Kyi's release was tempered by fears that she could be arrested again or become a target for political opponents. He said that he hoped the United Nations and other world bodies would seize the moment, and facilitate talks to create a permanent political resolution in Myanmar. This was the third time Myanmar's regime has released Suu Kyi from house arrest. Benjamin Zawacki, Myanmar expert for Amnesty International, noted that her last release had been unconditional and then she was thrown again into house arrest. ""For this to be real, there has to be progress toward real peace,"" said Bono.","Rock music icon Bono expresses 'cautious joy' after the release of Aung San Suu Kyi .

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher made an impressive return to Formula One in the first day of official testing for 2010 in Spain on Monday -- but was upstaged by another driver making his comeback, Ferrari's Felipe Massa. Schumacher, who has ended a three-year retirement to drive for Ross Brawn's new Mercedes team, was third quickest behind Massa and BMW Sauber's new signing Pedro De La Rosa. The 41-year-old German took over from Nico Rosberg with about an hour and a half of the Valencia session remaining, and ended up posting a time more than a second faster than his younger teammate. ""It was a perfect rollout for the new car today. I felt totally comfortable and really had a feeling that everything was very natural,"" Schumacher told his official Web site. ""It felt just like at the very beginning of my career in 1991 when on the first lap, I thought wow that was really fast, and then on the second lap, I was extremely excited. I feel just like a young boy again and really enjoyed myself. ""We did a good job today, making a few control checks, and the most important thing was that the car ran reliably. With Nico and I covering 79 laps today, it was a superb job by the team."" Rosberg, who drove for Williams last year before Mercedes took over world champions Brawn and signed the German, completed 39 laps and Schumacher was on the track for 40, according to Web site autosport.com. ""For me, to have him here is a great thing, fantastic,"" Rosberg told reporters about his alliance with Schumacher. ""It has given me a little bit of extra motivation. ""My relationship with him is very good. I get on well with him. We respect each other and I think we will be great teammates. There will be a few things I'll be able to pick up from him as he is one of the best that has ever driven."" Massa was back behind the wheel of a Formula One car in a public session for the first time since his accident in Hungary in July, which left him needing life-saving skull surgery. The Brazilian clocked an unofficial fastest time of one minute and 12.574 seconds as he completed 102 laps, autosport.com reported, with veteran Spaniard De La Rosa posting 1:12.784. Schumacher's 1:12.947 put him well ahead of Rosberg, who was fourth best on 1:13.543. McLaren test driver Gary Paffett was fifth fastest, but his team's official race entries for this year -- world champion Jenson Button and his predecessor Lewis Hamilton -- sat out the session. Hamilton will drive on Tuesday, and Button is scheduled to take the wheel on Wednesday. The other drivers to take part were Button's former Brawn teammate Rubens Barrichello in a Williams, Toro Rosso's Sebastien Buemi and Renault's new signing Robert Kubica.","Michael Schumacher makes impressive return to F1 in first day of official testing for 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao staked his claim to be the best pound-for-pound boxer on the planet after his brutal demolition of Antonio Margarito in their WBC light-middleweight title bout in Dallas, Texas late Saturday. Nicknamed Pacman, Pacquiao -- the only boxer in history to have won a world title at seven different weight divisions -- claimed his eighth belt in a new class after a unanimous decision over Margarito. Pacquiao dominated from the outset, with his superior hand speed and power constantly troubling the Mexican fighter who had boasted a significant height and reach advantage. But the champion's ruthless barrage of punches inevitably began to take their toll on Margarito's face as a nasty cut opened up below his right eye. At one point in the 11th round Pacquiao appeared to look towards referee Laurence Cole as if he was trying to get him to call a halt to the fight. Despite his domination Pacquiao could not land the knock-out blow against what was thought to be his biggest opponent yet, even taking a few powerful blows himself in the middle rounds. ""He is really strong,"" Pacquiao commented after the fight, in quotes carried by Agence France-Press. ""I never expected him to be as strong as he was."" But he admitted that the injuries sustained by Margarito, who had completed a suspension after being caught with plaster-filled hand wraps in his gloves prior to a fight against Shane Mosley, caused him some concern. ""I feel for my opponent,"" Pacquiao said, in quotes carried by AFP. ""His eyes (were swollen and cut) and bloody face. I wanted the ref to look at that."" The build up to the fight had been overshadowed by rumors that the Filipino could soon retire. Last month Pacquiao's long-time coach Freddie Roach said the Filipino was more preoccupied with his new role as a lawmaker and could not concentrate on his preparations for the November 13 bout. The pair eventually agreed to move their training camp to the U.S. to focus on the fight. Pacquiao had been lined up for an eagerly-awaited clash with American Floyd Mayweather Jr. earlier this year, but negotiations broke down amid a welter of recriminations and legal threats. A clash with Mayweather would likely be the richest in boxing history, but appears no closer to fruition.","Pacquiao the only boxer in history to have won a world title at seven different weights .
