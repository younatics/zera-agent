"(CNN) -- U.S. officials said Friday that -- contrary to earlier Venezuelan government claims -- the aircraft of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has been granted permission to enter U.S. airspace on Maduro's flight to China. A senior administration official said Friday that the State Department received a message from the Venezuela Embassy's charge de'affaires confirming satisfactory resolution of the issue Thursday night. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said earler Thursday that U.S. officials blocked plans for Maduro's presidential plane to fly through Puerto Rican airspace, with Jaua describing the move as an aggression. But a State Department official, echoed by other U.S. officials, said Friday that clearance was granted Thursday night for the flight over Puerto Rico. ""Although the request was not properly submitted, U.S. authorities worked with Venezuelan officials at the Venezuelan embassy to resolve the issue,"" Marie Harf, State Department deputy spokeswoman, said. ""U.S .authorities made an extraordinary effort to work with relevant authorities to grant over-flight approval in a matter of hours. As a result we were able to notify the Venezuelan authorities (Thursday) night that permission was granted."" Maduro is scheduled to travel to China on Saturday. Harf said the request for diplomatic clearance was made sooner than the three days' advance notice required for diplomatic flight clearances. ""Additionally, the plane in question was not a state aircraft, which is required for a diplomatic clearance,"" Harf added. ""We advised Venezuela on the correct way to get the clearance and notified (Venezuelan) authorities ... that permission was granted."" Before the apparent resolution of the situation, Maduro called the matter ""a serious offense"" during a broadcast on state television. The Venezuelan president vowed to take action, adding that the United States had also denied visas for several members of his country's delegation scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York. ""If I have to take diplomatic measures against the U.S. government, I will take them to the most drastic level if it is necessary, but I am not going to accept any type of aggression,"" he said. A State Department official called the visa issue untrue, saying the United States had approved them. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Elise Labott, Jamie Crawford, Patrick Oppmann and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: U.S. official says Venezuelan Embassy confirmed satisfactory resolution .

"(CNN) -- If you've ever griped about being mired in a traffic jam, there was proof this weekend in Russia that it could have been worse. Much, much worse. The backup Sunday afternoon on part of the main highway between Moscow and St. Petersburg -- the country's two most populated cities -- stretched 125 miles long, according to media reports cited by state-run RIA Novosti news. Video showed fog, but little evident precipitation after days of heavy snow. Even so, movement along sections of the M-10 highway largely was limited to foot traffic, not vehicular traffic, as trucks and cars sat motionless. Efforts to clear roads had some impact by early evening, by which time tie-ups were down to 34 miles along the M-10 highway, reported the State Automobile Inspectorate, a division of Russia's Interior Ministry. The length of the traffic jam was shrinking about three-fourths of a mile every hour, a spokesman for that agency told the state news outlet. That is an improvement, but still a far cry from the ""normalization"" of traffic that Russia's Emergencies Ministry said would occur by 6 p.m. Sunday, according to RIA Novosti. An Emergencies Ministry spokesman reported that, by then, one lane in each direction of the M-10 was clear of snow -- allowing trucks to creep along at 5-10 kph (3-6 mph). Blame for the slow slog goes, at least in part, to bad weather. The traffic headaches began Friday, when heavy snow began falling in western Russia. By the time it finally tapered off, three feet had fallen. While snow and related traffic woes are hardly unprecedented in Russia in December, drivers had other reasons to complain. In comments on social networking and news websites, as related by RIA Novosti, stuck drivers and passengers reported cafes along the clogged roadway took advantage of them by ratcheting up prices. Others said some gas stations had run out of fuel, or grumbled that authorities weren't much help. Video showed an inflatable tent popped up on the side of highway, with tables inside full of people filling up on food and drinks. In addition to hot food and warming stations, the RIA Novosti report noted the Emergencies Ministry was making psychological support available to those having trouble coping with the days-long traffic nightmare. ""(Emergencies Minister Vladmir Puchkov) is making sure that all necessary measures are being taken and that all vital personnel in afflicted regions have everything they need,"" a ministry spokesman said.","Heavy snow starting Friday caused traffic woes in western Russia .

"(CNN) -- One hundred, eighty-three chicken wings. In 12 minutes. That's what it took for Sonya Thomas of Virginia to beat her opponents -- including Joey Chestnut (currently ranked No. 1 by the International Federation of Competitive Eating) -- to win the United States Chicken Wing Eating Championship. Thomas' victory Sunday broke her previous record of 181 wings and took top honors at the 10th annual Buffalo Chicken Wing Festival in Buffalo, New York. ""This is the Super Bowl for the chicken-wing industry,"" said Drew Cerza, self proclaimed ""Wing King"" and festival founder. The event this year drew 85,000 visitors from every state in the nation and over 39 different countries, a feat that's hard for Cerza to believe, considering the festival's meager beginning 10 years ago. Despite the Buffalo wing's invention in Buffalo at the city's Anchor Bar in 1964 -- ""with,"" according to Cerza, ""a sauce of Frank's hot sauce and butter"" -- Buffalo was without a wing festival for decades. ""Then this movie -- 'Osmosis Jones' -- comes out,"" Cerza said. The Farrelly Brothers' 2001 movie was about a junk-food-loving dad, played by Bill Murray, who was trying to get to a national wing festival in Buffalo. Only there was no such festival, much to Buffalo writer Donn Esmonde's dismay. In one of his columns, he called for someone to start one. Cerza didn't see the column until he was outside cleaning his garage and was moving a stack of newspapers. But once he read it, the former food promoter, began to put the wheels in motion. ""I had no money. But I bought all of these turkey fryers, I had to fly restaurateurs in and put them up in hotels,"" Cerza remembers. ""I would've lost my house if it rained."" Luckily, it didn't rain, and the festival has continued to grow over the years. So big, in fact, that one year it ran out of wings altogether. ""We went around to the different restaurants in town and bought all of their chicken wings."" Cerza's decision to start the festival and his commitment to it earned him a spot in the festival's ""Hall of Flame,"" along with the actor that inspired it all, Bill Murray. Murray couldn't make it to the induction ceremony, which was a part of the weekend's festivities, along with a music performance by Sand Ox with Duff Goldman of Food Network's ""Ace of Cakes."" There was also plenty of competition -- a Miss Buffalo Wing pageant, a sauce-off contest, and a ""bobbing for chicken wings"" contest. The bobbing-contest winner, Angel Daniels of Brooklyn, pulled 15 chicken wings from a kiddie pool filled with blue cheese dressing in three minutes. But wings obviously were the main attraction -- more than 50 tons of wings, prepared at least 100 ways, brought out the crowds. ""The chicken gods were looking down,"" Cerza said.","""The chicken gods were looking down,"" says the festival's founder .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Cosmetic advertisements in Asia are targeting men with blunt campaigns aimed at skin color that one lawmaker labels racist. A still from a commercial for Emani's skin whitener. In one TV commercial, two men, one with dark skin, the other with light skin; stand on a balcony overlooking a neighborhood. The dark skin guy turns to his friend and says in Hindi, ""I am unlucky because of my face."" His light skin friend replies, ""Not because of your face, because of the color of your face."" Suddenly the light skin guy throws his friend a cream. It's a whitening cream. It is one of several television commercials aimed at men in Pakistan and India. In the end the darker skin actor is shown several shades lighter and he gets the girl he was after. Most of the ads end up that way. The commercials are sending a not-so-subtle message to men in Asia: Get whiter skin, and you'll get the girl and the job of your dreams. Or at the very least you'll be noticed. ""We always have a complex towards a white skin, towards foreign skin or foreign hair,"" Jawed Habib says.  Watch how skin whitening ads send a harsh message Â» . Habib should know. He owns a chain of 140 salons located in India and across the world. ""We Indian people, we Asian people are more darker, so we want to look more fair."" Skin whiteners were once targeted only to women. Now the products are a hot commodity for men. Many of the brands being advertised for men are well known around the world -- including Nivea and Garnier. A marketing study found sales for skin whitening creams have jumped more than 100 percent in rural India and sales for male grooming products are increasing 20 percent annually. Hindustan Unilever, one of the largest consumer products companies in India, noted in recent annual reports that ""skin lightening continues to be a major area of emphasis"" for its skin care division. And Emami Ltd., the company which produces ""Fair and Handsome,"" sent CNN an email saying: ""Fair and Handsome is a market leader with almost 70 percent market share in India and doing extremely well in Gulf countries and the Middle East as well."" But in a country where most people have brown skin, the message being sent to men and women has some people outraged. ""Basically if you need a job you have to have white skin. If you want a good partner, a companion you need white skin and you always seem to get it once you've used the fairness cream. Basically I think it's completely racist and highly objectionable,"" says Brinda Karat. Do you think skin-whitening commercials are racist? Sound off below . Karat is a member of India's Parliament who has made formal complaints about the advertisements to Indian authorities. She says the ads are simply playing on a social stigma that already exists in India. To get a good look at the pervasiveness of the stigma attached to dark skin in India all you have to do is look at the want ads for Brides and Grooms in the newspaper. Arranged marriages are still commonplace in India, and the advertisements for brides and grooms often list physical attributes of the person being sought. Many of the ads list ""fair"" as one of the wanted physical characteristics. ""I mean at a time when we're talking about talents and skills, and the need for the accessibility to that to develop our potential; what does it do to dark persons' self esteem?"" Karat says. ""I think it should be stopped."" But the product makers say they are simply giving the public what it wants, and a few Indian consumers agreed. Deepak Rajput said: ""Everybody wants to look handsome and beautiful, why not me?"" Salon owner Jawed Habib says he will accommodate if that is what the customer wants, but he doesn't push the skin whitening products. ""Why do you even think about it?"" He says: ""Let's accept the way we are.""","Indian lawmaker slams skin whitener products as racist, highly objectionable .

"(CNN) -- The world's best female golfer, Lorena Ochoa of Mexico, has exclusively revealed to CNN that a meeting with Tiger Woods in her youth inspired her to become the player she is today. Tiger Woods and Lorena Ochoa pose at the Golf Writer's Association of America Awards in 2007. The pair first met at Tory Pines when both competing in the Junior World Championships, an event that Woods won a record six times and Ochoa has won five. The two then met again 15 years later at the Golf Writer's Association of America Awards where both were named players of the year. Ochoa, 27, told CNN's Living Golf program the meeting had a big impact on her: ""You don't realize the importance of things until you're older and look back.  I'm just glad it worked out the way it did for us. ""He was boy and I was a girl, we were both young and we didn't know what we were doing.  I didn't see him for another 15 years, but I reminded him and showed him the pictures and he was like ""wow""."" Ochoa, who started playing golf aged just five-years-old, has now won 26 LPGA Tour titles but said despite the success it has been harder to sustain her number one spot than it was to attain it. ""It's harder to stay number one than getting there - if you get distracted or stop practicing you can very easily lose your position. Ochoa overtook Annika SÃ¶renstam to become the world number one ranked golfer in 2007 and since has won two majors, including the Women's British Open and the Kraft Nabisco Championship. The Mexican also picked up the Honda LPGA Thailand recently but says her drive to win more remains the same: ""My life has changed a lot. I've been preparing myself to get to that position so it didn't take me by surprise.  It took me five years from turning professional to becoming the number on in the world. It's not easy but it's been a lot of fun and I want to stay here.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A budget deal reached last week to avert a government shutdown won approval Thursday from both the House and Senate, sending it to President Barack Obama for his signature. The measure cuts $38.5 billion in spending while funding the government for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends September 30. With its passage, the White House and Congress will now focus on what are expected to be more rancorous battles over a budget for fiscal year 2012 and the upcoming need to raise the federal debt limit. A final-hour agreement last Friday in talks involving Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Speaker John Boehner included the spending cuts demanded by Republicans as a step toward controlling America's skyrocketing debt. The measure passed the Republican-controlled House on a 260-167 vote. The bill would not have passed without support from members of both parties, as 59 members of the Republican majority opposed it, showing the challenge faced by Boehner in keeping his conservative Tea Party-infused caucus unified. amid politically perilous tax and spending negotiations with the Democrats. The House vote also reflected growing liberal angst and anger over the impending spending reductions. Only 81 Democrats backed the measure; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, voted no. In the Senate, the final vote was 81-19. Under the deal, $38.5 billion would be from the budget including funding from a wide range of domestic programs and services such as high-speed rail, emergency first responders and the National Endowment for the Arts. As part of the agreement, Congress also voted Thursday on measures to de-fund Planned Parenthood and Obama's health care overhaul. As expected, both passed the House and were defeated in the Democratic-controlled Senate. One point of concern for conservatives was a report released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showing that of the $38.5 billion in savings, only $352 million will actually be realized this fiscal year. Boehner insisted Thursday that all of the cuts will take effect eventually, but conceded that the analysis ""has caused some confusion"" among House members. ""There are some who claim that the spending cuts in this bill ... are gimmicks,"" he said on the House floor. ""I just think it is total nonsense. A cut is a cut."" Freshman Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Illinois, told CNN that the uproar ""certainly doesn't help (Boehner's) case and added that he would oppose the bill. ""I'm disappointed,"" he said. ""I just think we could have gotten more."" Regardless, the measure cleared Congress one day before the federal government's current spending authorization expires. Negotiators narrowly avoided a partial government shutdown last week by agreeing to the deal and passing a short-term spending measure to give Congress time to review the agreement. In an interview Thursday with ABC News, Obama cited areas of agreement with Republicans in starting a process for reaching a deficit reduction agreement, but he conceded some deep-rooted differences will remain unresolved until after the 2012 elections. Obama repeated his theme from Wednesday's speech on fiscal policy that America faces a choice between a budget-slashing Republican vision that will change how society functions and a revenue-raising Democratic vision that maintains the social safety net in place for decades. So far, both sides generally agree on seeking deficit cuts of $4 trillion over the next 10-12 years, Obama said, and they have similar thoughts on some areas for fiscal reform and spending reductions. At the same time, Republicans adamantly oppose Obama's call for increasing tax revenue by ending Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and other reforms that would eliminate loopholes. In the end, Obama said, ""some of it will be settled by the American people in the election, and I think that is how democracy should work."" Earlier Thursday, Obama said that ""no matter how we may disagree between parties, no matter how much we spend time debating the issues, at some point we're going to have to come together as Americans."" He spoke uring a meeting with former Sen. Alan Simpson, a Wyoming Republican, and former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, the co-chairs of Obama's deficit reduction commission that issued its report last December. As attention turns to larger battles over the fiscal year 2012 budget and raising the nation's debt ceiling, Democrats and Republicans continued expressing widely differing positions designed to appeal to their respective political bases. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin laid out the GOP's vision last week when he unveiled his 2012 fiscal blueprint. The congressman's plan, which he says would cut projected deficits by roughly $4.4 trillion over the next decade, calls for significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid -- two hugely popular entitlement programs. Under Ryan's plan, Washington would eventually stop directly paying bills for senior citizens enrolled in Medicare. Instead, recipients would choose a plan from a list of private providers, which the federal government would subsidize. Medicaid, which provides health care for the disabled and the poor, would be transformed into a series of block grants to the states. Republicans believe state governments would spend the money more efficiently and would benefit from increased flexibility, while Democrats warn that such a move would shred the health care security provided to the most vulnerable Americans in recent generations. Ryan's plan also would overhaul key portions of the tax code, dropping the top rate for individuals and businesses to 25% while eliminating a number of loopholes. The House is expected to pass the Ryan proposal Friday. Senate Democrats, however, are certain to block the measure. Obama's budget plan, outlined in Wednesday's speech, aims to cut deficits by a combined $4 trillion over the next 12 years without significantly changing Medicare and Medicaid. The president's plan includes a repeal of the Bush-era tax cuts on families making more than $250,000 annually -- something sought by Democrats but strongly opposed by Republicans. Obama also called for the creation of a ""debt fail-safe"" trigger that would impose automatic across-the-board spending cuts and tax changes in coming years if annual deficits are on track to exceed 2.8% of the nation's gross domestic product. The president claimed that by building on or adjusting the health care reform bill passed last year, $480 billion would be saved by 2023, followed by an additional $1 trillion in the following decade. He proposed tightly constraining the growth in Medicare costs starting in 2018. The rhetoric over the two leaders' respective plans has become increasingly heated in recent days. In the ABC interview, Obama framed what he called the two choices that will face voters in the 2012 vote. ""We can't get everything the government offers and not pay for it,"" Obama said. ""Either we don't pay for it, in which case we have a society that is not caring for our seniors the way it should, is not providing some basic security for people who really need it, and is not investing in the future. ""Or we can decide to continue on the path that has made us the greatest country on Earth,"" the president continued. ""Make those investments. Have a basic social safety net. And we can do it without hurting the middle class or fundamentally changing these programs."" Earlier, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York said the Ryan plan would lower the tax rates on America's wealthy to the lowest levels ""since 1931 when Herbert Hoover was president."" ""Talk about trying to turn back the clock,"" said Schumer, who also pledged that ""no plan to end Medicare as we know it will ever, ever pass the Senate."" Ryan, meanwhile, ripped Obama on Thursday for using ""demagogic terms and comparisons."" The president's plan is ""fundamentally unserious,"" Ryan said. Obama has brought himself ""down to the level of the partisan mosh pit"" and made it tougher for the two parties to reach an agreement, he said. Against that backdrop, Democrats and Republicans also have to contend with an impending vote to raise the nation's debt ceiling. Congress needs to raise the limit before the federal government reaches its legal borrowing limit of $14.29 trillion later this year or risk a default that could result in a crashing dollar and spiraling interest rates, among other things. GOP leaders have stressed that any vote to raise the cap has to be tied to another round of spending cuts or fiscal reforms. The administration, in contrast, has called for a ""clean"" vote on the cap, which would raise the limit without adding any conditions. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has warned that trying to force the issue would be tantamount to playing a game of ""chicken"" with the economy. CNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash, Tom Cohen, Brianna Keilar and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","NEW: Obama tells ABC that some fiscal issues won't get resolved before the 2012 vote .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Twenty-six alleged members of a Hispanic gang believed to be one of the nation's largest and most violent were indicted in North Carolina and charged with offenses including drug activity, racketeering, assault and murder, according to federal court documents. Police arrest a suspected MS-13 member during an April operation targeting the gang in El Salvador. A 55-count indictment was returned by a Charlotte, North Carolina, grand jury Monday and unsealed Tuesday. It alleges that since 2003, the members of Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, committed four murders; trafficked cocaine and marijuana; and committed multiple robberies and assaults, among other crimes, the Department of Justice said in a written statement. One of the gang's purported leaders directed activities from his El Salvador prison cell, communicating with U.S. gang members and receiving money they wired, authorities said. The suspects were charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, a law used to target organized crime groups. Authorities began executing the arrest warrants against the 26 suspects Tuesday. ""Today's indictment is merely the latest sign of the gang's reach, and it shows the breadth and seriousness of the crimes that MS-13 members are alleged to have committed,"" Attorney General Michael Mukasey said Tuesday in Charlotte. The four murders occurred in Greensboro and Charlotte, North Carolina, authorities said. Those who committed them received assistance in avoiding arrest from other gang members, the indictment alleges. Gang members also discussed plans to kill another individual who they believed was cooperating with police, it says. Federal law enforcement sources said that while the arrests were taking place in North Carolina, Salvadoran authorities carried out related raids on gang leaders in that country. MS-13 has long been regarded by law enforcement as one of the deadliest gangs in the United States and beyond. It is estimated to have up to 50,000 members worldwide, about 10,000 of whom are believed to be active in at least 38 American states, according to an attorney general's report to Congress on gangs in April. In 2004, the FBI created a task force that focuses specifically on it. ""Members smuggle illicit drugs, primarily powder cocaine and marijuana, into the United States and transport and distribute the drugs throughout the country,"" the report said. ""Some members also are involved in alien smuggling, assault, drive-by shooting, homicide, identification theft, prostitution operations, robbery and weapons trafficking."" The report notes an increase in gangs based in Charlotte, among other areas -- ""particularly Hispanic gangs,"" although MS-13 is not mentioned by name. In 2007, the Justice Department announced that it had charged other MS-13 leaders with federal racketeering crimes. Among suspects named in those charges were two men who authorities said ordered murders in the United States from their prison cells in El Salvador. Most MS-13 members are immigrants from El Salvador or children of Salvadoran immigrants, federal authorities said in the indictment. The gang originated in Los Angeles, California, but has spread across the United States as well as into Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. The United States has expanded its anti-gang efforts into Central America, authorities said. Last year, for instance, the FBI and El Salvador's National Civilian Police joined to create the Transnational Anti-Gang center. FBI anti-gang agents were posted in the nation to work side-by-side with the National Civilian Police, Mukasey said Tuesday. He added that the anti-gang center was ""instrumental in the investigation that led to today's operation here in Charlotte."" Also, he said, the International Law Enforcement Academy in El Salvador provides anti-gang training to Central America police and prosecutors, and the FBI's Central American Fingerprint Exchange helps assist police in Central America in apprehending gang members. ""The Transnational Anti-Gang Center has strengthened and improved the exchange of information and intelligence between police agencies in El Salvador and the United States, making it into an agile, fluid and timely process,"" Jose Luis Tobar Prieto, deputy director of the National Civilian Police, said in the Department of Justice statement. ""In a parallel manner, TAG's work has hampered the accelerated evolutionary process that gangs operating in both countries have displayed in the past few years."" Anti-gang centers are planned for Honduras and Guatemala, Mukasey said. Of those arrested in North Carolina on Tuesday, half face penalties upon conviction of up to life in prison for their alleged involvement in murder and drug trafficking, the Department of Justice said. The others would face a range of sentences of up to 20 years in prison.","Federal agents nab 26 suspected members of MS-13 gang .

"Moscow (CNN) -- The man claiming responsibility for last month's deadly bombing at Moscow's main international airport is the self-declared mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks and is described by the U.S. government as ""the leader of the Chechen insurgency."" Doku Umarov, who says he ordered the airport blast that killed 36 people, is the head of the Caucasus Emirate, a Chechen Islamic jihadist group. In a video message posted on a website that regularly carries messages from Chechen rebels, Umarov said the message was recorded on January 24 -- the day of the suicide bombing at the airport. He wore camouflage combat fatigues and a black skullcap. ""The special operation was done in accordance with my order. Similar special operations will be taking place in the future,"" he said in Russian. In a separate message posted over the weekend, Umarov vowed to deliver ""a year of blood and tears"" to Russia, saying that there were dozens of rebels prepared to carry out attacks. ""I won't tell you there are hundreds of us prepared for jihad. But 50 or 60, God willing, we will find,"" said Umarov. ""Those operations will be conducted monthly or weekly, as Allah allows us,"" he said. Umarov himself once expressly opposed terrorism. Now, he is designated by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist. ""The emergence of Umarov as the leader of the Chechen insurgency intensified the split between national separatists and radical jihadists and led to a movement seeking to create an Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus with Umarov as the Emir,"" the department website says. ""Umarov claimed responsibility for masterminding attacks in both Russia and the Caucasus region,"" including the 2009 Nevsky Express train derailment that killed 28 people and the 2010 Moscow subway bombings, which killed 40, the State Department says. In a statement in June 2010, the department's coordinator for counterterrorism, Daniel Benjamin, said Umarov poses threats to the United States and Russia and that his attacks ""illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem we face today."" The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, part of the U.S. federal government, notes that the Caucasus Emirate cooperates with al Qaeda and has declared jihad on the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Israel. In Moscow, investigators say they have identified the suspected suicide bomber behind the airport attack as a 20-year-old man from the North Caucasus region. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's Federal Security Service, has refused to publicly name the suspect or identify his specific origin. But he told Russian state television the alleged bomber was under the influence of drugs before the attack. ""Biological studies revealed the presence of a huge amount of highly potent narcotic and psychotropic substances in parts of the suicide bomber's body,"" Bortnikov said. Sitting beneath a black flag and flanked by two other bearded rebels in the message posted first, Umarov named the young man to his left as ""Mujahedeen Seifullah."" He said the man was being sent on a mission, although it is not clear from the video if this was the suspected Moscow airport bomber, or when the message was recorded. ""I would like Putin and Medvedev and all other kaffirs and enemies to understand that there are many of us who will follow in our footsteps and give their lives for Allah,"" Umarov said. Umarov, thought to be 46 years old, is a seasoned fighter who has survived more than three years as the self-styled leader of the Caucasus Emirate despite a concerted campaign by Russian special forces to kill him. His video appearances reveal a stocky man with craggy features and a dense beard. Umarov was born in southern Chechnya in 1964, according to Chechen websites, and describes his family as part of the ""intelligentsia."" He came of age as the separatist campaign against Russian rule began to take root and joined the insurgency when Boris Yeltsin sent troops into the region in 1994. A peace deal reached with the Russian government briefly interrupted the Chechen revolt, with leading separatists -- including Umarov -- taking up positions in government. But it was a fragile truce and after a series of bomb attacks in Russia in 1999, Moscow sent its troops back into Chechnya. Umarov and others took up arms again. Russia's brutal military campaign began in 2000, soon after Vladimir Putin became president, and was widely criticized by human rights groups. In 2003, Human Rights Watch accused Russian forces of ""committing hundreds of forced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, and widespread acts of torture and ill-treatment"" in Chechnya. David Satter, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said the Russians ""had little concern for civilian casualties and used all kinds of weapons in the second war they hadn't used previously."" It changed the nature and the goals of the Chechen revolt. The Chechen rebellion began morphing into a jihad to liberate the Muslim lands of the Caucasus. Chechnya is about 95% Muslim. Satter said Moscow had ""effectively created the conditions for Islamic terrorism while systematically eliminating those with whom it might have had a dialogue."" In 2005, Umarov gave a rare interview to Radio Free Europe. He had scars on his lips and chin and walked with a limp, apparently after stepping on a landmine. ""Everything they (the Russians) are doing in Chechnya is done to break the human spirit, to make people lose their humanity. And they are having considerable success with the horrific things they are doing to people,"" he said. The U.S. State Department said that in 2005, Chechen security forces seized Umarov's relatives ""including his father, wife, and six month old son. They later released the wife and child, but the father's location remained unknown. In August 2005 security forces also detained Doku Umarov's sister, Natasha Khumadova."" In November 2007, Umarov declared himself the emir of the Caucasus. In a proclamation published on a Chechen jihadist website, he declared, ""It was my destiny to lead the Jihad. ... I will lead and organize Jihad according to the understanding, given to me by Allah."" He began to embrace terrorism and revived the Riyad-us-Saliheen brigade for high-profile suicide missions. It had previously been involved in the siege of a school in Beslan and the takeover of a Moscow theater, both of which ended with heavy loss of life. Andrew Kuchins of the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University said the Caucasus Emirate's targets have shown up Russian weaknesses. ""These are really key transport infrastructure links that you would think would be under the highest protection possible,"" he said. Umarov's links with other jihadist groups, and in particular al Qaeda, have been the subject of much speculation but little certainty. Chechens have fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and, along with other Muslims from central Asia, are said to have joined forces with the Taliban in northern Afghanistan. The Russian authorities say al Qaeda operatives are involved in the north Caucasus. Beyond spectacular attacks designed to bring terror to the Russian people, most analysts say the insurgents are unable to challenge the authority of the Russian state. ""They're too loosely organized, the sources of the grievances of many of the groups are too different, they are more locally based,"" Kuchins said. But he sees no end to the instability in the northern Caucasus. ""It's like a classic frontier zone, like the FATA (the tribal areas) in Pakistan,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Rumblings from Mexico's most well known volcano forced several U.S. airlines to cancel flights in the country's capital on Thursday. Popocatepetl volcano has let out nearly 100 bursts of steam, gas and ash in the past 24 hours, the National Center of Disaster Prevention said. The ashes haven't reached Mexico City International Airport, airport officials said in Twitter posts. But Delta, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines canceled a dozen flights that had been scheduled to depart from the airport on Thursday. At the nearby Toluca International Airport outside Mexico City, Spirit Airlines canceled flights to and from Ft. Lauderdale and Dallas. No Mexican airlines had canceled flights at the airports, officials said. After detecting elevated activity, authorities flew over the volcano on Thursday. Disaster officials said they had measured 12 hours of tremors of high and medium frequency at the volcano, which is about 50 miles away from Mexico City's airport. Located in a national park southeast of the capital, Popocatepetl can be seen from there on a clear day. It is one of Mexico's highest peaks and last had a major eruption in 2000. But there have been rumblings since then. In April, authorities barred people from getting close to the volcano after a series of explosion and expulsions of ash and gas.

"(CNN) -- With a first name that means ""wave"" in Catalan, perhaps Ona Carbonell was destined to pursue a career in water sports. And for a self-confessed ""mermaid,"" synchronized swimming provides the ideal escape. ""I don't know why but the water, for me, it's perfect. I feel better inside the water than outside,"" Carbonell told CNN's Human to Hero series. She has become Spain's most successful synchronized swimmer, collecting two Olympic medals and more than a dozen at the world championships. ""You can do anything -- you can create and (be) very original. It's an artistic sport,"" she added. Then there's the glitzy outfits -- and the hair, which is lacquered into a hard gloss with gelatine to keep it styled in the water. Like Venus Williams in tennis, Carbonell -- who is studying fashion design at university -- and her teammates play a role in creating the costumes they wear. The collaborative approach also applies to choosing music to routines and developing the choreography along with their coaches. Carbonell's big tune is ""Barcelona"" -- the ode to her home city sung by Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballe, to which she performed at July's world championships in the Catalan capital. ""It's the music of Olympics '92 and it's very nice song and very nice choreography -- I think it's very beautiful,"" Carbonell explains. ""The costume is like Gaudi -- in Barcelona very famous -- and blue and shiny like Montserrat Caballe when she sings."" The 2013 world championships were a special moment for the 23-year-old. She was able to get close to the countries now dominating the sport, Russia and China, as she earned seven podium placings across the individual and team events. But it's clear that for Carbonell, picking up silverware isn't her lone goal. Being underwater for 20 seconds at a time -- unable to even communicate with your partner -- adds to the feeling of peaceful isolation. It's an escape, however, that requires its participants to combine artistic elements with strength and technique, similar to rhythmic gymnastics or figure skating. On average Carbonell suspects she spends 10 hours in the pool a day -- a necessary workload if she is to catch her Russian and Chinese rivals. While twisting, turning and lifting, competitors have to make sure the strain doesn't show on their well-manicured faces -- sometimes they put the waterproof makeup on themselves but on other occasions they have makeup artists. Any sign of straining and the judges are sure to pounce. The degree of difficulty is thus high. Growing up in Barcelona, the vibrant city in northeastern Spain that rests by the Mediterranean Sea, paved the way for Carbonell's development in ""synchro."" ""When I was seven I did rhythmic gymnastics,"" she recalls. ""When I was nine I started synchronized swimming because I liked the water a lot. I spent a lot of hours in the sea."" It prepared her well for a life in the pool, which requires strong stamina. ""There are many hard things in synchronized swimming but the hardest is to hold our breath inside the water,"" Carbonell says. ""When we go up and breathe, you have to do a good face and smile. ""We have to work a lot to hold our breath because many moves in the performance are like 20 seconds without a breath. ""We don't communicate -- it's impossible. Sometimes when we don't have music we speak inside the water but it's very difficult and without goggles you see very bad. ""You have to believe in each other."" In the team format that consists of eight swimmers -- one of the two Olympic disciplines, while there are seven formats at the world championships -- Carbonell and company are aided by underwater speakers. ""We listen perfectly inside and outside, too, and it's nice because it's like all the other people,"" said Carbonell. ""A lot of people don't know we have a speaker inside."" Spain, with Carbonell in the group, claimed a silver medal in all three team events in Barcelona, finishing second to Russia. Individually she collected four bronze medals, with Russia once again leading the way. Russia's clean sweep of all seven gold medals confirmed its status as the powerhouse of the sport, unlike the early days. When synchronized swimming first became an Olympic sport in Los Angeles in 1984, Canada, the U.S. and Japan led the way in the absence of the East European nations -- who boycotted the Games in retaliation for the West's refusal to attend Moscow '80. ""Russia is very difficult to get,"" said Carbonell. ""China is difficult, too, but maybe I get."" Carbonell did win gold at the 2009 world championships in Rome in the team free routine, but the highlight of her career remains tallying a silver in the duet and team bronze at last year's Olympics in London. Caught up in the moment, she was unable to appreciate her achievements. It was only when Carbonell went on holiday did she fully reflect. ""I (thought) a lot about the competition -- 'Oh it's a very, very big thing that we did,' "" she says. ""For me, the most important result in my life is the silver medal in London because it's very hard to get there. I'm younger and my partner was like eight years older than me. Carbonell is now working towards the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ""I think we go for gold, and work more, more, more,"" she says. As for later in life, Carbonell isn't the sort to predict what she will be doing in 10 years. She wonders, though, if men will be allowed to compete in international tournaments at some stage. For some, men and synchronized swimming are forever linked to a skit on U.S. comedy show Saturday Night Live decades ago starring Martin Short. ""I don't understand why in synchronized, there is not men's,"" said Carbonell. ""In ballet there are men. For me it would be very good if men start to do synchronized swimming.""","Ona Carbonell is a world champion and Olympic medalist in synchronized swimming .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A New Orleans police officer who was fired after the 2005 beating of an unarmed man on Bourbon Street was ordered reinstated to his job by an appeals court, the court clerk told CNN on Thursday. Robert Evangelist was acquitted of charges related to the beating in 2007 but lost his job as a police officer. Barring an appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court, Robert Evangelist can return to his job on the police force, said the clerk with Louisiana's 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. The ruling was issued Wednesday. The beating of Robert Davis in October 2005 attracted international attention, as it was captured on videotape by The Associated Press and its aftermath was recorded by a CNN photojournalist. The images, broadcast worldwide, added to the woes of the New Orleans Police Department after Hurricane Katrina's devastation in the city. Evangelist was charged with false imprisonment while armed with a dangerous weapon and second-degree battery in the incident. He was acquitted of the charges in July 2007. Another officer, Lance Schilling, also was charged with second-degree battery, and he and Evangelist were fired. Schilling committed suicide in June 2007. Evangelist appealed his termination to the city's Civil Service Commission, which upheld the firing, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. He then appealed to the 4th Circuit Court. A third officer, Stuart Smith, was suspended from the force for 120 days but allowed to keep his job. He initially was charged with simple battery against an Associated Press producer, but the charge was later dropped. Davis, who was 64 at the time, has said he does not remember the incident. He said he asked a mounted police officer about the city's curfew and then walked away, only to be ""sucker-punched"" by another officer shortly afterward. Davis denied allegations he had been drinking at the time, saying he does not drink. He has said he suffers aftereffects from the beating. Davis' federal lawsuit against the city was settled last month for an undisclosed amount, the Times-Picayune reported Thursday. His attorney, Stephen Bruno, told the newspaper Wednesday he was surprised by the appeals court ruling. ""He is not fit to be a school crossing guard, "" Bruno said of Evangelist. ""He does not have the moral character to be police officer, and have the power and the force to have a gun and a Taser.""

"(CNN) -- Marin Cilic has fought many battles on the court but the Croatian star may face his biggest fight in the court when he appeals against his nine month doping ban. Currently ranked 24th in the world, Cilic tested positive for the stimulant nikethamide at the Munich Open in Germany last April and will not return to action until February 1, 2014. The 24-year-old, who has had the ban backdated to May 1 this year, told an independent tribunal that the nikethamide had entered his system after he took Coramine glucose tablets which had been purchased on his behalf. Cilic will now appeal against the decision by taking his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, claiming he was not aware that the Coramine tablets contained a banned substance. ""The substance in question originated from a glucose tablet purchased at a pharmacy in France,"" Cilic said in a statement Monday. ""Unbeknownst to me, the glucose tablets contained a substance that is banned in competition. ""I wish to emphasize that I have never knowingly or deliberately taken any banned substances in my life and that I am opposed to any use of performance enhancing substances in sport."" The tribunal accepted that Cilic ""did not intend to enhance his performance"" by taking the substance, and ruled he will instead serve a reduced ban of nine months. Cilic, who has not competed since withdrawing from Wimbledon citing a knee injury, has had his results at the Munich Open expunged and has forfeited both the prize money and rankings points from the event. The Croatian reached a career high of No.9 in the world in 2010 after reaching the semifinals of that year's Australian Open. Cilic is the fourth tennis player to be hit with a ban for drug violations in 2013. Serbia's Viktor Troicki was suspended by the ITF for 18 months in July after being found guilty of failing to provide a blood sample during April's Monte Carlo's Masters. But Serbian Troicki has vowed to appeal the decision after alleging the doctor conducting the blood test allowed him to miss the procedure. In May, Brazil's Fernando Romboli tested positive for diuretics, furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide which resulted in him being handed an eight-and-a-half month ban. In February, Czech player Barbora Zahlavova Strycova received a six month ban after testing positive for sibutramine, a substance which is often found in weight loss products. The ITF has stepped up its fight against drugs cheats since announcing its plan to introduce biological passports in March. Each player will have an individual electronic biological profile and be tested more regularly to monitor their levels and alert the authorities to possible drug use.","Marin Cilic has been hit with a nine-month ban after testing positive for banned substance .

"(CNN) -- A frog that eats birds and a gecko with leopard stripes are among the 163 new species discovered last year in the Greater Mekong region of southeast Asia, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund. The Cat Ba leopard gecko is found exclusively in Cat Ba Island National Park in northern Vietnam. The discovery of 100 new plants, 28 fish, 18 reptiles, 14 amphibians, two mammals and one bird species highlights the extent of the biodiversity in the region, said Barney Long, head of the WWF's Asian Species Conservation program. ""It's a melting pot of diverse habitats. It has some of the wettest forests on the planet, high mountains, and a diverse array of terrestrial and marine habitats, including the Mekong River,"" he said. ""We continue to find new species of fish, primates and mammals, and nowhere else compares to the amount of large mammals that have been discovered in the region. It shows how little we know about species in the region,"" he said. ""From a biodiversity perspective, there are still huge amounts to discover about region."" The Greater Mekong consists of the countries through which the Mekong River flows: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and Yunnan Province of China. With 16 global ecoregions -- areas defined by their shared ecological features and animal communities -- the Greater Mekong has more protected spaces than anywhere else on mainland Asia, according to the WWF. The colorful Cat Ba leopard gecko of northern Vietnam has large, orange-brown ""catlike eyes"" and a body of leopard stripes, according to a report released Friday. Its name refers to its place of origin, Cat Ba Island, the largest of 366 islands in Cat Ba Archipelago and home to many rare species that can only be found on the island. Scientists believe the high number of species unique to the island might be due to the long separation of the island from continental Vietnam, the report says. Limnonectes megastomias -- a fanged frog with an appetite for other frogs, insects and birds -- has only been found in three remote areas of medium-to-high altitudes in eastern Thailand. Globally, new species of mammals are rare finds, but in 2008 alone, new species of the mouselike musk shrew and a tube-nosed bat emerged from the region.  See photos of newly discovered species Â» . War and political unrest have kept large parts of the region, particularly Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, off-limits to scientific exploration up until the past two decades, Long said. Since 1997, nearly 1,200 new species have been discovered, many that cannot be found anywhere else, said Dekila Chungyalpa, director of WWF's Greater Mekong Program. But the rapid pace of development in the Mekong region, coupled with the effects of climate change, are threatening to drive the species into extinction, Chungyalpa said. ""As we become familiar with more species in the region, our understanding of climate change and how it impacts these new species is changing,"" she said. Chungyalpa said conservative estimates by the WWF project a 1-meter rise in sea level on the delta's coastline over the next decade, which will affect not only marine life, but also people who rely on the delta as a source of sustenance and employment, she said. In 2007, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its Fourth Assessment Report, which projected that global sea levels could rise from 18 to 59 centimeters (7 to 23 inches) over the next century based on six possible scenarios. Already, Chungyalpa said, the area has been affected by an increase in tropical storms off the coast, which brings in more seawater and changes the flooding patterns in the delta. Some researchers, however, have questioned the link between climate change and more intense tropical storms. Apart from climate change, construction of dams and hydropower plants along the delta could further disrupt its waters, potentially displacing millions, destroying sources of drinkable water and disrupting the production of rice, Chungyalpa said. ""The delta is the rice bowl of the region. What will happen to people who depend on it if it's no longer there?"" she said. The WWF says it supports the idea of an agreement among the Mekong countries on how to respond to infrastructure development and climate change in terms of protecting its natural resources and people. ""Climate change is making it obvious that we can't treat development like it's a separate issue,"" she said. ""We need to be addressing this issue now. It's such an immediate issue for us and it's going to change everything in this region if we don't address it.""","Discoveries highlight extent of region's biodiversity, World Wildlife Fund says .

"(LifeWire)  -- Rachel Hunt has encountered it all: automated operators, interminable phone trees, customer service representatives who've ""never heard of"" widely advertised promotions. Bad or no customer service can drive consumers crazy. But the public relations account director from Chevy Chase, Maryland, says her most memorable moment was when a customer service rep informed her that her house wasn't there. ""My husband and I were trying to get service from a cable TV provider and were told by a representative that our address didn't exist,"" she says. ""They said they couldn't help us or sign us up for service, even though our neighbors across the street had cable. It probably took eight hours to get it all straightened out."" The downfall of service . Thanks to outsourcing, labyrinthine answering systems and unresponsive corporations, many have come to dread what's paradoxically known as ""customer care."" ""People get lost in that maze of 'press 1 for this and press 2 for that,'"" says Randi Busse, president of Workforce Development Group Inc., a customer service training center in Long Island, New York. ""Years ago, the customer was the most important thing, but today, businesses large and small are indifferent."" Real service is such a rarity that some frustrated folks are turning into what BusinessWeek calls ""consumer vigilantes."" The vigilantes blog about battles with customer service departments; they use the Web to track down high-ranking employees' e-mails and direct lines. Surfing for satisfaction . After weeks of bad TV reception (and repeated requests for help) following Hurricane Ike, Sarah Shah, an image coach from Houston, found a Comcast executive on Twitter, a social networking site. ""I tweeted him and asked if he could help and he tweeted right back and said, 'Here's my e-mail, shoot me your account number,'"" says Shah. ""By the end of the day, five trucks, three supervisors and two technicians were at my house and we had the best cable reception we've ever had. All it took was finding a person high enough on the food chain to fix the problem."" Michelle Gotay, a motivational speaker from Watertown, Connecticut, went up the corporate ladder in a creative way after unsuccessful calls to an automaker about her problematic car. Gotay dressed up as a ""nutty character"" and vented her frustrations in a YouTube video she forwarded to the executive offices of Nissan North America. ""My friends thought I was nuts and that no one would ever see it or respond. But 16 hours after I e-mailed them the link, I heard back from the company. They loved the video and helped me resolve my car issues."" The new word of mouth . Web-based customer empowerment is rapidly changing customer service, says Amy Muller, co-founder and chief community officer for GetSatisfaction.com, an online clearinghouse for complaints and responses. ""With blogs and social networks and the way information can be posted so freely, word of mouth is incredibly powerful,"" says Muller. ""It's more and more difficult for companies to survive without learning to embrace this new era. They don't have a choice but to start to provide better customer service, especially in hard economic times."" Muller says nearly 300,000  registered users interact on GetSatisfaction.com with nearly 18,500 companies -- from big guns like AT&T, Ford and Verizon to startups like Foxmarks and Widgetbox. Customers post questions or complaints which company reps (or other customers) try to resolve. ""We've had situations where a customer will come in furious and the company will step in and do a stellar response and then the customer will go away happy,"" says Muller. ""And it all happens in a public way. We believe in the good, the bad and the ugly all being out there."" The dark side . The ugly stuff is not always on the company's part, says Vernon Effenberger, 31, a PR account executive from Austin, Texas. ""I worked for an energy company for 2 Â½ years and I once got a call from a woman who didn't have power at her restaurant,"" he says. ""The problem was on her end -- she hadn't had all the inspections she needed -- but she was livid. She said, 'If I ever see you, I will kill you.' I'd had people yell at me before, but I'd never had a death threat."" Robin Taylor, 42, a Nashville, Tennessee, customer care rep, says customers scream, cuss and even cry. But the calls that really get on her nerves are the ones from ""the freaks."" ""There's one guy who calls and just says 'You f--ing b---ch' in this weird low tone and then hangs up. He's called a couple of times,"" she says. ""And then there's another guy who calls in regularly and says he wants to discuss his bill, but then says 'I want you to tell me to write with a pink pen. And I want you to say, 'Do it now!'"" The golden touch . Most people who contact customer service sincerely need help, and companies would do well to listen to them, says Busse, who's worked in the industry for 15 years. ""Customer service is going to be the new differentiator,"" she says. ""Price isn't the deciding factor anymore -- it's service."" That's certainly what worked for Rachel Hunt, who says her most recent customer service experience, in which an L.L. Bean rep took 10 minutes to help her track a pair of hard-to-find clogs for her husband, was ""positively amazing."" ""I'd normally think someone would just want to take the order and get off the phone, but he was really cooperative and patient and very friendly,"" she says. ""I felt like I should send the company a thank-you note. It definitely left me with a positive feeling."" LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to Web publishers.

"(CNN) -- Matthew McConaughey lost 40 pounds for December's ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" and Matt Damon worked out for four hours a day to get ripped for ""Elysium."" Ashton Kutcher, meanwhile, wanted so badly to get the role of innovation icon Steve Jobs right, he put himself in the hospital. The 35-year-old actor became a fruitarian while filming Steve Jobs biopic, ""jOBS,"" in an attempt to ""understand some of his discipline,"" Kutcher explained to CNN. He picked up a book Jobs once read by Arnold Ehret called ""Mucusless Diet Healing System"" and began to eat nothing but fruit, shedding 15 to 18 pounds in the process, according to ""jOBS"" director Joshua Michael Stern. What the Jobs movie got right, and wrong . ""(Jobs) was a really disciplined guy in a lot of ways, around his work and his life and his relationships and his products,"" Kutcher said. ""And part of going on the diet was just to try to get an understanding of that. I didn't like it very much. It was really painful, ultimately. But it was really worth it, 'cause I think I gained a level of empathy towards that kind of discipline and focus that I don't think I could have played the role without."" Arriving Friday, ""jOBS"" traces Steve Jobs' ascendance from college dropout to globally influential creator and will recount his founding of Apple along with Steve Wozniak (played by Josh Gad). As one of the more tech-savvy stars in Hollywood, Kutcher was initially nervous to portray someone he calls his ""hero."" ""I admire him, and I admire his work,"" Kutcher told CNN. ""The scariest thing for me was that I wanted ... people to see my portrayal of him and see it as a portrayal that was honoring him and being honest about some of the flaws that he had. That was really a daunting task."" Of course, Kutcher came to the part with a genetic advantage: The actor, who also stars on CBS' ""Two and a Half Men,"" shares a resemblance to the late Jobs, who died in October 2011. But according to director Stern, Kutcher didn't try to rely on just his looks. ""Ashton walked into the first meeting already channeling Steve Jobs,"" he told CNN. ""He had the mannerisms; he'd studied hundreds of hours. He knew from that first meeting that I needed to take away evidence that he could play the part."" Kutcher's total immersion into the character was so complete that Stern walked away from the actor with newfound respect. ""He studied the guy; he lived in his skin every day, which wasn't the easiest place to live, and I really respect him quite a bit. He gave everything he had, and more than anything I knew that this role was important to him. And when something's important to you no matter what you do, you're going to give it everything you have."" Despite those efforts, ""jOBS"" has faced criticism ahead of its release date, from Kutcher's casting on down. The biopic was originally slated to bow in April, but was bumped back to August reportedly so the studio could have a longer marketing push. Reviews, thus far, have been mixed, and then there are those questioning its timing. Kutcher says that when he received the script, which was already a work in progress when Jobs died, that he did have that ""immediate concern."" ""I know that there were some people that were close to him who didn't want a movie to be made this soon,"" he said, but because ""I have friends that actually know him, I felt ... I could at least protect his legacy somewhat by playing (the part), and I knew I would dedicate myself to making it as good as I could."" When you make as great of an impact on the world as Steve Jobs did, that story's going to be told eventually, no matter what. ""I would rather have it get told before the tales about him get too tall and while we could tell an honest story,"" Kutcher continued. ""A lot of times, someone passes away and all of a sudden the stories become these fictional tellings of what happened. I think this film is as close to true as we could find."" At this year's Teen Choice Awards, Kutcher addressed the young crowd in a Jobs-ian motivational moment. He told fans ""sexy is smart,"" ""opportunities look a whole lot like work"" and closed his speech by saying, ""build a life; don't live one."" CNN's Carolyn Sung and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Ashton Kutcher is portraying Steve Jobs in this weekend's biopic 'jOBS'

"(CNN) -- The earthquake in Sichuan, southwestern China, last May left around 69,000 people dead and 15 million people displaced. Now ecologists have assessed the earthquake's impact on biodiversity and the habitat for some of the last existing wild giant pandas. Giant pandas are more endangered than ever since the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. According to the report published in ""Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment"", 23 percent of the pandas' habitat in the study area was destroyed, and fragmentation of the remaining habitat could hinder panda reproduction. The Sichuan region is designated as a global hotspot for biodiversity, according to Conservation International. Home to more than 12,000 species of plants and 1,122 species of vertebrates, the area includes more than half of the habitat for the Earth's wild giant panda population, said study lead author Weihua Xu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. ""We estimate that above 60 percent of the wild giant panda population was affected to some extent by the earthquake,"" said Xu in the report. In an effort to develop conservation strategies for the panda's remaining habitat, Xu and his colleagues used satellite imagery to determine the pandas' habitat loss and fragmentation in the South Minshan region, which is adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter. Since forests are the main vegetation type used by the pandas, the authors compared forested areas in satellite images from September 2007, before the earthquake, to images after the earthquake and its aftershocks, in July 2008. The authors then combined results based on these satellite data with criteria that make forests suitable for pandas, including elevation, slope incline and presence of bamboo. Their analyses revealed that more than 354 square kilometers, or about 23 percent, of the pandas' habitat was converted to bare land. Of the remaining habitat, the researchers found that large habitat areas had been fragmented into smaller, disconnected patches, which Xu says can be just as harmful as habitat destruction. ""It is probable that habitat fragmentation has separated the giant panda population inhabiting this region, which could be as low as 35 individuals,"" said Xu. ""This kind of isolation increases their risk of extinction in the wild, due in part to a higher likelihood of inbreeding."" Xu and his colleagues proposed a plan to encourage pandas to move between patches using specially protected corridors. They also recommend areas to be protected outside of nature reserves and that post-earthquake relocation of affected towns takes panda habitat into consideration. ""It is vital to the survival of this species that measures are taken to protect panda habitat outside nature reserves,"" said Xu. ""Giant pandas in this region are more vulnerable than ever to human disturbance, including post-earthquake reconstruction and tourism. When coupled with these increasing human activities, natural disasters create unprecedented challenges for biodiversity conservation.""","New report on affect of 2008 Sichuan earthquake on wild giant panda population .

"(CNN) -- Over 350 new species including the world's smallest deer, a ""flying frog"" and a 100 million-year old gecko have been discovered in the Eastern Himalayas, a biological treasure trove now threatened by climate change. The region studied covers a vast expanse of the mountain region. A decade of research carried out by scientists for the WWF in remote mountain areas brought discoveries such as a bright green frog that uses its red and long webbed feet to glide in the air. The WWF report, ""The Eastern Himalayas -- Where Worlds Collide,"" details discoveries made by scientists from various organizations between 1998 and 2008 in a region reaching across Bhutan and northeast India to the far north of Myanmar as well as Nepal and southern parts of Tibet in China. ""The good news of this explosion in species discoveries is tempered by the increasing threats to the Himalayas' cultural and biological diversity,"" Jon Miceler, Director of WWF's Eastern Himalayas Program, said in a press statement. ""This rugged and remarkable landscape is already seeing direct, measurable impacts from climate change and risks being lost forever."" The report describes more than 350 new species discovered, including 244 plants, 16 amphibians, 16 reptiles, 14 fish, two birds, two mammals and at least 60 new invertebrates. One of the most significant findings was not exactly ""new"" in the classic sense. A 100-million year-old gecko, the oldest fossil gecko species known to science, was discovered in an amber mine in the Hukawng Valley in the northern Myanmar. The report mentions the miniature muntjac, also called the ""leaf deer,"" which is the world's oldest and smallest deer species. Scientists initially believed the small creature found in the world's largest mountain range was a juvenile of another species but DNA tests confirmed it was a new species. The Eastern Himalayas harbor a staggering 10,000 plant species, 300 mammal species, 977 bird species, 176 reptiles, 105 amphibians and 269 types of freshwater fish. The region also has the highest density of Bengal tigers in the world and is the last bastion of the charismatic greater one-horned rhino. Historically, the rugged and largely inaccessible landscape of the Eastern Himalayas has made biological surveys in the region extremely difficult. As a result, wildlife has remained poorly surveyed and there are large areas that are still biologically unexplored.","Over 350 new species discovered by ten year project in Eastern Himalayas .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Hurricane Bill churned in the Atlantic Ocean toward the west-northwest as a major Category 3 hurricane Tuesday evening. Hurricane Bill is expected to continue toward the northwest Tuesday night and Wednesday. Around 8:30 p.m., reports from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plane indicated Bill had strengthened, with maximum sustained winds near 125 mph. The National Hurricane Center said further strengthening is possible. When a hurricane's sustained winds reach 111 mph, it reaches Category 3 status. When sustained winds reach 131 mph, it becomes a Category 4 storm. The center said Bill is a large storm, with hurricane force winds extending outward up to 45 miles (75 kilometers). Tropical force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 kilometers). The hurricane center expects Bill to turn to the northwest Wednesday. ""On this track, the core of Bill will be passing well to the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands late Wednesday and early Thursday,"" forecasters said. The northern Leeward Islands are to the east of Puerto Rico. Weather models showed the storm also missing Bermuda as it heads nearer to the upper U.S. East Coast, CNN meteorologists said Tuesday. Although Bermuda may escape a direct hit from Bill, it might experience strong waves and fierce winds, meteorologists said.  Track Hurricane Bill's path across the Atlantic Â» . No computer models Tuesday showed Bill posing a danger to the United States. Bill, the first hurricane of the 2009 Atlantic season, was heading west-northwest at near 16 mph as of Tuesday afternoon. It was centered about 635 miles east of the Leeward Islands. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 45 miles from the center, and tropical storm-force winds of at least extended up to 175 miles out. The remnants of Tropical Depression Ana continued to drop heavy rain across Hispaniola and Cuba on Tuesday, CNN meteorologists said. Forecasters expect Ana to wash South Florida in heavy rain as it passes through the Keys this week. There's a slight chance that Ana could regenerate into a tropical cyclone after it moves into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico this week, the weather service said.","Bill has sustained winds of almost 125 mph Tuesday evening .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Official results have yet to be published, but preliminary returns appear to show that the once-banned moderate Islamist party Ennahda has won Tunisia's historic elections, according to several political parties and Tunisian media outlets. On Tuesday night, victory celebrations erupted outside the modest office building in downtown Tunis where Ennahda is headquartered. A crowd of about a hundred party supporters gathered, singing the national anthem, clapping and chanting. Tunisians awoke Tuesday to the front page of El Maghreb newspaper, which featured a giant photo of Ennahda leader Rachid Ghanouchi next to a saluting member of the presidential guard, with the caption ""Ennahda close to the government?"" Meanwhile, the French-language daily Le Temps depicted a presidential throne on a pillar carrying the Ennahda logo, followed by smaller chairs atop two smaller columns labeled with the secular parties Congres pour la Republique (CPR) and Ettakatol. Boubaker Bethabet, secretary-general of the Independent High Authority for the Election, told reporters at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that preliminary results were available for five districts. Of the 39 seats available in those districts, Ennahda took 15, CPR took six and Ettakatol took four. Those results still must be certified, he said. Representatives from all three parties told CNN their own preliminary results showed that Ennahda captured first place, followed by CPR and Ettakatol. The parties were already looking forward to the possibility of establishing a governing coalition in the future 217-seat Constituent Assembly. ""It's possible ... I hope we can put a coalition of this type together,"" said CPR leader Moncef Marzouki, when asked about the possibility of establishing a coalition of the three apparent front-runners. Marzouki said Tunisians had demonstrated in the country's first free election in modern history their vision for the future of the country. ""Tunisians want centrist politics,"" he said. ""They want an Arab-Muslim identity (Ennahda) and also democracy and human rights represented by the two parties CPR and Ettakatol."" The vote was historic not only in Tunisia -- which, until now, hadn't had a national election since it became independent in 1956 and for 23 years was ruled by Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- but also in the region and the world. Since Ali was ousted in January -- a month after 26-year-old street vendor Muhammad Al Bouazizi set himself afire after a police officer seized his goods -- residents in several other Arab nations have similarly rallied for democratic reforms and against their leaders, many of whom held power for decades and allowed little dissent. Mohamed Kamez Jendoubi, the head of the country's election commission, said Monday that more than 80% of the North African nation's registered voters cast ballots Sunday. According to Tunisia Afrique Presse, 4,100,812 people registered to vote prior to the election in a country of more than 10 million. But Jendoubi said many unregistered voters -- ""mostly youth and women"" -- showed up Sunday for last-minute registration. As early as Monday night, top Ennahda party officials were already celebrating CPR and Ettakatol's expected second and third place finishes in the vote count. ""We're happy that the second and third party are serious parties that never resorted to scare tactics,"" said Moadh Kheriji, Ghanouchi's chief of staff. But the rise of a party closely identified with Islam sounded alarm bells for Tunisian secularists. Tuesday afternoon, a group of about 200 protesters gathered outside the headquarters of Tunisia's electoral commission to denounce the expected Ennahda victory. Some carried signs saying ""No to fraud."" Meanwhile, the mood was gloomy in Tunis' upscale neighborhood of Menzah, where patrons at a swish coffee shop were commiserating about Ennahda's apparent victory. ""We are scared about losing some freedom, some rights. Especially women are scared,"" said Zohra Marzouk, who works for a company that distributes beer. But in an interview with CNN, the daughter of Ennahda's leader insisted women like Marzouk have nothing to fear. ""I'm a Tunisian woman. I'd be the first concerned if there was a change. I'm a working woman, I'm active in civil society,"" said Soumaya Ghanouchi, an academic who lived in exile for 22 years until last January's revolution. ""I personally don't see any contradiction between Islam and ... women's rights."" Ghanouchi said that she hoped Ennahada would provide an democratic model to other Islamist political movements in the region, such as Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. ""That's the lesson Ennahada can give other Islamist movements in the region. Its how we work together with other political parties in spite of ideological differences. Its really a practical program of change.""","New: Ennahda supporters celebrate their apparent victory .

"(CNN) -- Roads ripped to rubble by floodwaters up to 10 feet deep, rushing at speeds of up to 30 mph. Shattered homes near others still standing upright. One person dead, two others missing. That's the harsh reality police, firefighters and residents were dealing with Saturday in Manitou Springs, a mountain community of about 5,000 people just west of Colorado Springs, after sudden, raging waters tore through the area. Under mostly sunny skies, crews spent the day looking for the missing and combing through wreckage wrought by floods triggered by intense rain. Locals such as Justin Blount, meanwhile, tried to make sense of what happened. He was in a Manitou Springs cafe, working on its owner's computer, on Friday when water suddenly, perilously started flowing in front of the building. He and others -- one of them wheelchair-bound -- heard the water rushing below them as they finally got in an elevator and crept up to safety. ""It was like a raging river, a black river coming down,"" Blount told CNN affiliate KUSA, dry after his 2ÃÂ½ hour ordeal the day earlier. ""... It was wild. I'm still in a little bit of shock."" His central Colorado town, at the foot of Pikes Peak, was one of several nationwide that have been impacted by wet weather and floodwaters in recent days. Showers and thunderstorms were expected from the Pacific Northwest to the Deep South. In addition to a pocket of Colorado, flash-flood warnings were in effect Saturday for parts of Washington and Oregon, as well as much of New Mexico. There were flood warnings -- which are issued when water levels in rivers and other waterways rise to precarious levels -- in Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri and South Carolina. Some communities bracing for wet weather were coping with the aftermath of earlier devastating floods. A flash flood watch was in effect through 9 p.m. (11 p.m. ET) in Manitou Springs, for instance, given the threat that could be caused by more heavy rains. The dangers there are exacerbated by last year's mammoth Waldo Canyon wildfire, which -- as Lt. Steve Schopper of the Manitou Springs Fire Department explained -- made the soil saturated, unstable, ""kind of waxy"" and little help in curbing rushing waters. ""It's like liquid cement,"" Schopper told KUSA, noting that those caught up in the rocks, trees and other debris have little chance to escape. ""... You're not swimming out of this. It will rip your clothes off."" Video of the mudslide showed cars sliding swiftly down an incline while others remained stranded in rushing, gray-colored water. One man was found dead beneath ""significant amounts of debris"" left on Colorado Highway 24, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office said. The search, meanwhile, continued for two others. In Oklahoma, floodwaters swept away and killed a man who was trying to save his daughter from a stranded vehicle early Friday. Vincent Brown was attempting to rescue his daughter who had become stranded in high water in her vehicle, Oklahoma City Police spokeswoman Sgt. Jennifer Wardlow said. Wardlow said Brown's daughter was wading toward her father. She turned to retrieve some items in her vehicle, and when she turned back around, he had been swept away by fast-moving floodwater that had rapidly appeared in Oklahoma City overnight. In South Carolina, Logan Dale Evans was found dead in floodwater on his family property Wednesday night near the town of Central, Pickens County Coroner Kandy Kelley said. Evans, 23, was found outside his vehicle, which ended up about a mile downstream, said Kelley, who added that Evans is believed to have drowned. At least two people were reported killed in Missouri this week, including a driver who was caught in rapidly rising water in McDonald County on Thursday, said Gregg Sweeten, the county's emergency management director. The woman, thought to be in her 60s, had been trying to drive over a bridge when the water overwhelmed her vehicle, Sweeten said. On Monday, Elijah Lee, 4, died after 6 inches of rain fell on Pulaski County, about 140 miles southwest of St. Louis. The boy was found in a vehicle swept up in floodwater that caught the community along Mitchell Creek off guard, said Sgt. Dan Crain, a Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Myriad Genetics, a Utah-based company, vowed Wednesday to ""vigorously defend"" itself against a legal challenge to its patents on two human genes linked to breast and ovarian cancers, its attorney told CNN. A lawyer in the case says patenting genes would be like patenting an eyeball removed from someone. ""Myriad strongly believes its patents are valid and enforceable and will be upheld by the courts,"" said Richard Marsh, the company's general counsel. The American Civil Liberties Union is suing Myriad, arguing that patenting pure genes is unconstitutional and hinders research for a cancer cure. Marsh said the company is aware the lawsuit has been filed but has not yet been served any legal documents. ""We do intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights,"" Marsh said. He noted a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision related to gene patenting that he said cleared the way for ""tens of thousands of genetic and genetic-related patents"" to be granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The ACLU, joined by the Public Patent Foundation, an organization affiliated with Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University, filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in southern New York against the Patent and Trademark Office, Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation.  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the lawsuit Â» . Myriad and the research foundation hold patents on the pair of genes -- known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 -- that are responsible for many cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. The ACLU says that patenting the genes limits research and the free flow of information, and as a result violates the First Amendment. ""Knowledge about our own bodies and the ability to make decisions about our health care are some of our most personal and fundamental rights,"" said ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero. ""The government should not be granting private entities control over something as personal and basic to who we are as our genes."" The lawsuit also challenges genetic patenting in general, noting that about 20 percent of all human genes are patented -- including genes associated with Alzheimer's disease, muscular dystrophy and asthma. ""It is absolutely our intent that upon victory this will rend invalid patents on many other genes,"" said Dan Ravicher, executive director of the Public Patent Foundation and a patent law professor at Yeshiva University's Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. ""We just had to pick one case as our case."" Ravicher offered an analogy to describe the plaintiffs' argument, saying, ""It's like saying if someone removes your eyeball ... just because you remove the eyeball and wash it off, that doesn't make the eyeball patentable. ""Now if they create another eyeball out of plastic or metal, then you can patent that."" More than 192,000 U.S. women get breast cancer diagnoses each year, and about 5 to 10 percent of those cases are a hereditary form of the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 -- short for breast cancer 1 and breast cancer 2 -- are involved in many cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, the institute said. ""A woman's lifetime chance of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene,"" according to the institute. Myriad's patents give it exclusive right to perform diagnostic tests on the genes, forcing other researchers to request permission from the company before they can take a look at BRCA1 and BRCA2, the ACLU said. The patents also give the company the rights to future mutations on the BRCA2 gene and the power to exclude others from providing genetics testing. The company also charged $3,000 a test, possibly keeping some women from seeking preventative genetic testing, the ACLU says. ""Women whose doctors recommend genetic testing should be able to find out whether they have the gene mutations linked to breast and ovarian cancer so that they are able to make choices that could save their lives, and these patents interfere with their ability to do so,"" said Lenora Lapidus, director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include several patients and more than a dozen universities, genetic specialists and medical associations, such as the Association for Molecular Pathology and the American College of Medical Genetics. At least one expert said the ACLU should focus more on getting the patents reversed than arguing whether they are constitutional. ""I doubt they're going to get far with an argument that the patent is unconstitutional,"" said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""A better argument would be that they were wrong when they granted the patent,"" he added, referring to the patent office. Caplan said patents are privileges, not ""carved in stone."" He said that the defendants may have identified the genes, but didn't actually work on them. So, the government could reverse the patents on the genes. ""It's like trying to patent the moon,"" he said. ""You didn't do anything to create it, just discovered something that already existed. You can't patent things that are publicly available, that anyone can find. You have to create something, make something, do something with the thing.""

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- The driver of a fire truck died Thursday while racing to fight a raging forest fire in eastern Spain, the fifth fatality among firefighters this week, authorities said. A firefighter walks around the area where a fire burns in Andorra early on July 23, near Teruel. The 44-year-old firefighter died while heading toward a fire in Teruel province, the regional Aragon government said on its Web site. Four firefighters died Tuesday while battling a forest fire in the eastern Catalonia region, not far from Teruel, CNN partner station CNN+ reported, citing local authorities. Those authorities said the fire, in Horta de Sant Joan in Tarragona province, had been under control at midday Tuesday, but winds revived it, trapping the four firefighters, CNN+ reported. By Thursday, the Catalan fire at Horta de Sant Joan remained out of control, a regional official said, while in neighboring Aragon region, six fires still blazed out of control. Some 8,000 hectares (nearly 20,000 acres) have already burned in Aragon, forcing the evacuation of more than 1,600 people. A dozen other fires in the region have been brought under control, the Aragon government said. Aircraft, including planes and helicopters, were being used in Aragon and Catalonia to battle the fires, along with hundreds of firefighters in the hilly terrain, much of it with difficult access. More than 800 Spanish troops are fighting numerous forest fires across Spain, the Environment Ministry said. Other forest fires in Spain on Wednesday afternoon forced an interruption of service of the bullet train between Madrid and Barcelona, affecting more than 6,000 passengers, the state railway authority said. By Thursday morning, service had been resumed on the route, used by many business travelers. Spain is plagued by forest and brush fires every summer, when extremely dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. In 2005, 11 people were killed when they were trapped by a fast-moving fire in Guadalajara province, east of Madrid. CNN's Al Goodman and Patrick Sung-Cuadrado contributed to this report.","Aircraft being used in Aragon and Catalonia to battle the fires .

"(CNN) -- You'll have to be doggedly clever to unlock Mike Linden's new iPhone 5S. Linden, 23, was fooling around with the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone he purchased Friday morning. He found it dull locking and unlocking it with his own finger, so he decided to find out what would happen if he programmed the front right paw of his pet Chihuahua, Hurley, into the gadget. How secure is your iPhone 5S fingerprint? Much to his surprise, the pawprint did the job. ""I thought this is never going to work, and it did!"" Linden told CNN iReport. ""The funniest thing is, it only works for the paw I programmed. It doesn't work for the other three."" Dogs aren't the only four-legged friends who can handle the sensor. TechCrunch found it has worked for cats, too. Linden, a musician in Burnsville, Minnesota, is an Apple fan: He was in line at Minnesota's Mall of America at 4:45 a.m. to be among the first to get the new iPhone. The phone has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Users must ""register"" their print with the device, after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button. But though he's been tickled by the finger (paw?) print sensor, Linden's not too pleased with the particular phone he bought. The sound from the phone receiver is muffled and he suspects he'll have to return it. When he does, Hurley might not be as cooperative. ""The more I do it the angrier he gets,"" Linden said. ""I've tried all the paws now and he put up quite a fight to get the back ones on there. I have to give him a lot of treats."" Hmm. Treats. Perhaps a new Apple marketing strategy?","iReporter Mike Linden finds new iPhone fingerprint sensor works for his dog .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama announced Monday his choice for surgeon general -- Dr. Regina Benjamin, a 52-year-old family practice doctor who has spent most of her career tending to the needs of poor patients in a Gulf Coast clinic in Alabama. Dr. Regina Benjamin holds advanced degrees in medicine and business administration. ""When people couldn't pay, she didn't charge them,"" Obama said. ""When the clinic wasn't making money, she didn't take a salary for herself."" He called Benjamin ""a relentless promoter"" of programs to fight preventable illness. Benjamin cited the toll of preventable illness as the reason her family was not with her at the announcement: Her father died with diabetes and high blood pressure; her older brother and only sibling died at age 44 of an HIV-related illness; her mother died of lung cancer after taking up smoking as a girl; her mother's twin brother could not attend because he is at home ""struggling for each breath"" after a lifetime of smoking. ""I cannot change my family's past, but I can be a voice to improve our nation's health for the future,"" she said.  Watch for more on Benjamin Â» . Benjamin received a bachelor's degree in 1979 from Xavier University of Louisiana, attended Morehouse School of Medicine from 1980 to 1982, and received a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1984. She completed her residency in family practice at the Medical Center of Central Georgia in 1987. Her medical training was paid for by a federal program, the National Health Service Corps, under which medical students promise to work in areas with few doctors in exchange for free tuition, one year of service for every year of paid tuition. Benjamin founded the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in 1990 in the fishing village of Bayou La Batre, Alabama, and has served as its CEO since. Like many of her patients, the clinic has suffered its own life-threatening challenges. It was heavily damaged by Hurricane Georges in 1998 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It also burned to the ground several years ago. But Benjamin rebuilt it after each setback and has continued to offer medical care to the village's 2,500 residents. Her commitment to them has meant making house calls during the rebuilding, mortgaging her house and maxing out her credit cards, Obama said. ""Regina Benjamin has refused to give up; her patients have refused to give up,"" he said. Many of her family practice patients are immigrants from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos who make up a third of Bayou La Batre's population, and many of them are uninsured. Benjamin's expertise goes beyond medicine; she earned a master's in business administration in 1991 from Tulane University. But her focus has not been on making money for herself, she said. ""My priority has always been the needs of my patients,"" she said. ""I decided to treat patients regardless of their ability to pay."" Benjamin said she has worked for years to scrape together the resources needed to keep the clinic doors open and found ""it has not been an easy road. ... It should not be this hard for doctors and other health care providers to care for their patients."" She praised Obama ""for putting health care reform at the top of your domestic agenda,"" and said she hopes, if confirmed by the Senate, ""to be America's doctor, America's family physician."" ""As we work toward a solution to this health care crisis, I promise to communicate directly to the American people, to help guide them through whatever changes come with health care reform. I want to make sure that no one falls through the cracks,"" she said. A call to the clinic, where Benjamin was working last week, found it in full swing. ""We are just packed in with patients right now, and I'm the only one at the front office,"" said a breathless woman who then hung up. Benjamin has served as the associate dean for rural health at the University of South Alabama's College of Medicine and as president of the State of Alabama Medical Association, from 2002-2003. She was the first African-American woman board member of the American Medical Association, and she just served a term as chairwoman of the group's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. The position of surgeon general, whose effectiveness is largely in its use as a bully pulpit, requires Senate confirmation.","Dr. Regina Benjamin is a rural family physician .

"(CNN) --   In 1974, when Edward Kennedy Jr., developed an aggressive form of bone cancer that at the time few survived, his father, the late senator, wasted no time snapping into action. Summoning a group of cancer specialists to his Virginia home, the senator and the doctors debated well into the night how best to treat the 12-year-old boy, according to Adam Clymer, author of ""Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography."" Sen. Ted and Victoria Kennedy in 1997 with his children Ted Jr. and  Kara, both cancer survivors. The team ultimately chose an aggressive -- and risky -- course of chemotherapy. Thirty-six years later, Teddy Jr. is alive and cancer-free. When the senator's daughter, Kara Kennedy, was told she had lung cancer in 2002, her father deployed a similar strategy, Clymer says. Doctors said Kara's tumor was inoperable and the 42-year-old mother of two young children might have less than a year to live. But Sen. Edward Kennedy refused to accept that prognosis, and instead consulted with other experts and found a surgeon willing to operate. Seven years later, Kara Kennedy is also alive and cancer-free. If you're thinking only Kennedy clout and Kennedy money can get that kind of care, think again. While you may not be able to summon medical experts from around the country to your kitchen table with the snap of your fingers, experts in patient empowerment say more and more people are carving out their own Kennedy-style health care. ""The power that Senator Kennedy had has now trickled down to all of us, who can virtually gather people in our living room,"" says Susannah Fox, associate director of the Pew Internet Project and co-author of a report on Internet use and health information. According to the Pew report, released in June, 61 percent of American adults look online for health information. Twenty-four percent have consulted rankings or reviews of doctors online, and 19 percent have signed up to receive updates about health or medical issues. Many consumers are going even further, finding top experts online and boldly engaging them directly via e-mail or through social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter. ""You can get quite far using your own keyboard to gather expert opinions. I've heard many times over the years that doctors and surgeons are surprisingly accessible,"" Fox says. ""You can gather the greatest minds in science. It's really powerful."" Dr. Mitchel Berger, chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, says he regularly receives e-mails from patients he's never heard of -- and he returns them. ""I think patients are very smart these days,"" says the neurosurgeon, who flew in for a meeting of experts Kennedy convened last year in Boston to discuss options for treating his brain cancer. Dr. Raymond Sawaya, chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, says he also returns e-mails from patients he doesn't know. ""Smart people write to the top four or five major centers in the country,"" he says. From stay-at-home mom to lung cancer expert . Through her own ingenuity, hard work, and determination, Karen Parles received Kennedy-quality care without his power or money. When Parles' lung cancer was diagnosed in 1998, the 38-year-old stay-at-home mother was told it was inoperable. ""They gave us no hope,"" her husband, Dr. James Parles remembers. ""They told her if untreated, her illness was generally fatal in six to 12 months."" Even with treatment, the doctors said she wouldn't live much longer than a year. Like the late senator, Karen Parles wouldn't accept a diagnosis of no hope. She reached out to the wife of a college friend who is a pulmonologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who in turn referred Parles to Dr. John Wain, a surgeon there. Dr. Wain removed her lung and chest wall lining. After several years the cancer recurred, this time to her liver and a rib. She had successful chemotherapy, but the cancer returned to her liver. To avoid the side effects of ongoing chemotherapy, Parles, a librarian by profession, then immersed herself in cancer research. ""She read a paper about this new procedure called radiofrequency ablation, and she wrote to the doctor who did the study, and asked him for the best place to go in the Northeast,"" says James Parles, a pediatrician in Smithtown, New York. The doctor returned her cold-call e-mail, and suggested she go Rhode Island Hospital, where Dr. Damian Dupuy performed the ablation procedure. Parles continued to suffer multiple recurrences of her cancer. After undergoing various therapies, she consulted with Dr. Corey Langer, then at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, whom she had met at a medical conference. He suggested an infusion of radioactive microspheres into her liver, another procedure she'd never heard of, to treat the liver tumors without chemotherapy. Parles received the infusion, but had to appeal to her insurance company to get it paid for, her husband says. She passed away in February 2009. ""She got 11 extra years of life because of her determination to get the best the medical establishment had to offer,"" her husband says, noting that most of those years were enjoyed in good health. ""Our kids were 8 and 7 years old when she was diagnosed with lung cancer. They were 20 and 18 when she died. She got to watch them grow up to be young adults because of her own tenacity."" How to get Kennedy-style health care . The first step to getting health care like a Kennedy is to go online and learn as much as you can about your disease, says Dave deBronkart, co-chairman of the Society for Participatory Medicine. ""It used to be that in order to get medical information, you had to be a member of what people call 'the priesthood,'"" he says. ""It was a very private and closed group that got its information through medical schools and medical societies. Now all that's changed because of the Internet."" Step two, he says, is to communicate electronically with people who have your disease. That's what deBronkart did in 2007 when he was found to have kidney cancer that had spread to his brain, tongue, arms, and legs. ""Initially, doctors told me the median survival time was 24 weeks,"" he says. Like Kennedy, deBronkart couldn't accept such a dismal prognosis. ""I joined the Association of Cancer Online Resources, and within 15 minutes of posting a question about where the best doctors were, I had an answer,"" deBronkart says. He says the third step is to contact experts in the field, as Kennedy and Parles did when they were stricken with cancer. ""Kennedy was a good role model in that he aggressively pursued finding out all the options that were available,"" deBronkart says. ""You could say he scoured the earth.""

"(CNN) -- Just when one might have thought that lunacy over gun policy in the U.S. cannot be exceeded, think again. In the wake of the Newtown massacre, Colorado adopted a universal background check system and a modest restriction on the size of high-capacity magazines. This was good news for everyone except gun sellers who don't want the sales to felons and the insane to dry up (and those who think what for most purchasers would be a five-minute background check is too much of an imposition). Since gun sellers call the shots at the NRA, the lobbying group launched an effort to punish Colorado legislators who stood up for public safety over gun seller profits. Now, two thoughtful Colorado legislators have been recalled and the NRA is crowing at having exercised its muscle once again. Other states are trying to up the ante. Only last week, Iowa highlighted the nonsense by offering concealed carry permits to blind individuals. State battles intensify on access to guns . This week in Missouri, by the thinnest of margins -- only 1 vote in the state Senate -- the legislature failed in its effort to make that state a haven for gun toting felons and lunatics by overriding the governor's veto of a bill designed to thwart any form of federal gun regulation, including background checks, and even trying to make it a crime for federal agents to enforce these laws. The claim that the state can unilaterally decide to nullify federal law is so preposterous that even the strongest of gun advocates with some understanding of Supreme Court precedent acknowledge its invalidity. Indeed, Robert Levy, who personally funded the litigation designed to convince the Supreme Court that the Second Amendment, which begins ""A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state,"" had nothing to do with a well-regulated militia has recently conceded that the Missouri stunt flouts the very Constitution that its supporters claim to uphold. Even Levy's concessions fall on deaf ears in the legislatures of Kansas and Montana, where the idea of state nullification of federal gun laws seems eminently reasonable -- despite the clear language of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, which states, the ""Constitution and the Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding."" While Iowa is merely highlighting the absurd laxity of gun laws in this country, the damage will be slight since most blind Iowans will have the good sense not to possess or discharge firearms. But the overheated rhetoric flowing from the NRA crowd during the Colorado recall and from Missouri (and similarly inclined states) is dangerous for at least two reasons. First, it undermines our democracy when voters act based on false and misleading views about the actual content of state and federal laws. Second, similar hyperbolic rhetoric after the passage of the federal background check system and the (now elapsed) federal assault weapons ban galvanized the unstable gun zealot Timothy McVeigh forward with his scheme to blow up the federal building in Oklahoma City. The NRA can succeed in its efforts to punish legislators who stand up for positions its own president once specifically advocated and push for clearly unconstitutional laws by recklessly fooling voters into believing that federal gun laws are tyrannical. In fact, federal gun restrictions are so lax that the U.S. overwhelmingly dominates the world in the number of guns held by private citizens -- and also among rich countries in its rate of gun deaths from murder, suicide, and accidents. Just the other day, a child killed herself with her father's gun while camping in Yellowstone National Park. Law-abiding citizens with guns have to recognize their obligations to prevent the types of tragedies that occur on a daily basis in the U.S. when lawfully owned guns are used, intentionally or inadvertently, to kill and maim others. One needs to accommodate the interests of legitimate gun owners if sensible gun laws are to be passed, but gun owners must also take responsibility -- first, by not being duped by NRA deceptions to advance the economic interests of gun merchants, and second, by taking every effort to ensure that their guns do not contribute to the mayhem. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John J. Donohue.","A controversial gun measure in Missouri failed to override veto by one vote .

"(CNN) -- Josep Guardiola hailed Bayern Munich's best Bundesliga performance this season after his side crushed Schalke 4-0 on Saturday to stay second in the league. Bayern joined Borussia Dortmund on 16 points, as the leading side could only draw 1-1 away to another Bavarian side, Nuremberg, and lose its 100% record. ""That was our best Bundesliga performance of the season so far. We totally dominated one of the strongest teams in Germany,"" said coach Guardiola. ""We did very well. I'm satisfied and proud of this performance and my players."" Schalke, like Bayern, had won in the opening round of the Champions League group stage in midweek but had no answer to the European and German champion. Vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger scored the opener on his return from injury, converting Arjen Robben's 21st-minute corner, and striker Mario Mandzukic made it 2-0 at halftime with a header from David Alaba's cross. Second-half goals from France midfielder Franck Ribery and substitute striker Claudio Pizarro sealed Bayern's 31st league match without defeat and ended the home side's run of four wins in all competitions. ""Four-nil at home is a hiding and not we wanted at all,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. ""We started very, very well, and had 20 very good minutes. But then we were hit by a double strike and we never recovered from it."" Dortmund, losing finalist in last season's Champions League, could not bounce back from a midweek defeat against Italian side Napoli. Nuremberg had not won in five previous matches, and went behind eight minutes before halftime to a free-kick by defender Marcel Schmelzer. However, Per Nilsson canceled that out six minutes after the break against a Dortmund side which had key players Robert Lewandowski and Henrikh Mkhitaryan on the bench, rested after their European exertions. One point behind the top two, Bayer Leverkusen also has five wins from six after winning 4-1 at Mainz. Australia striker Robbie Kruse scored twice and set up another for Lars Bender before Stefan Kiessling headed his fifth goal this season. Hannover stayed fourth after beating Ausgburg 2-1 at home thanks to a late penalty from Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti. Hamburg, which reportedly hopes to appoint former Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk to replace the sacked Thorsten Fink, slumped to a fourth successive defeat as striker Nils Petersen netted both goals in a 2-0 win for Werder Bremen. Another former Bayern striker, Ivica Olic, also scored twice to take his league tally to four as sixth-placed Wolfsburg beat Hoffenheim 2-1. The Croatian's double came after Anthony Modeste joined Kiessling, Mainz's Nicolai Muller, Stuttgart's Vedad Ibisevic and Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on a Bundesliga-leading five goals.","Bayern Munich joins Borussia Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga table .

"Madrid (CNN) -- A man suspected of being an Islamic terrorist has been arrested by Spanish police in Valencia, the Interior Ministry said Friday. The Moroccan suspect, Mohamed Echaabi, is considered a ""lone wolf"" who was planning targeted killings and other attacks in Spain and elsewhere in Europe, the ministry said. Echaabi is considered by police to have a profile similar to that of Mohammed Merah, the self-styled al Qaeda jihadist who authorities said killed seven people in Toulouse, France, in March 2012. After a 32-hour standoff, Merah was killed by police in his home. Echaabi, arrested Thursday, had been under surveillance for some time, the ministry said in a statement. He was recruited by terrorist networks and educated himself via the Internet, it said. He is alleged to have planned ""to commit terrorist actions against relevant personalities or other objectives in agreement with the doctrine of global jihad, as much in Spain as in other European countries. The ministry said that the man had attempted to acquire firearms and explosives. ""Echaabi underwent a process of radicalization in which he acquired firm, extreme convictions that led him to leave Spain and travel to Gaza in 2011 with the goal of carrying out an action of suicidal character against Israeli interests,"" it said. In an effort to hide their radical ideology and blend in with others, such individuals may not follow the precepts of Islam, ""which is why it is common that they wear Western clothes, don't have beards, drink alcohol, smoke or eat pork -- all with the goal of passing unnoticed and integrating in the society they want to attack."" That formula for carrying out terrorist attacks requires sophisticated intelligence efforts by international police services to uncover and is espoused by al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri, the ministry said.

"(CNN) -- The Japanese government has criticized former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's acknowledgment of a ""territorial dispute"" with China over islands in the East China Sea, with the defense minister going so far as to use the word ""traitor."" On his four-day private visit to China, Hatoyama told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday, ""The Japanese government says there are no territorial disputes (between the two countries). But if you look at history, there is a dispute."" The remarks contradict his own government's position of indisputable territorial sovereignty over the islands that it calls Senkaku and that China calls Diaoyu. ""If his (Hatoyama's) remarks have been politically used by China, I'm unhappy,"" Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said on television Thursday. ""At that moment, the word of 'traitor' arose in my mind."" Dangerous waters: Behind the islands dispute . The day after his controversial remarks, Hatoyama, 66, and his wife visited the Nanjing Memorial, which is for the estimated 300,000 people killed in a 1937 massacre by Japanese forces. He is the third former Japanese prime minister to visit the memorial, following predecessors Toshiki Kaifu and Tomiichi Murayama. The tribute for Chinese victims stands in contrast to visits by Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and predecessor Junichiro Koizumi, to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is dedicated to Japan's war dead, including war criminals. ""In the eyes of the Chinese public, (Hatoyama's) visit is very valuable and undermines those in China who argue that all Japanese suffer from amnesia about wartime misdeeds,"" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. ""I think this mission is an effort by him to introduce a different tenor into bilateral relations, to show it's not all about saber-rattling,"" he added. Chinese media extensively covered Hatoyama's ""apology for Japan's wartime crimes,"" with pictures of the Hatoyamas bowing and paying silent tribute at the site. On social media, the visit triggered wide discussions. According to an online poll by Phoenix Online (iFeng), 80% of the more than 222,000 people who voted said Hatoyama's visit did not have much political significance, as compared with German Chancellor Willy Brandt's kneeling before the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial in 1970. In another question, nearly two-thirds of 140,000 people surveyed said the visit by a former leader wouldn't set an example for a fellow Japanese politician. CCTV commentator Yang Yu, however, praised Hatoyama and urged the Chinese to ""remember the unusual kindness due to its scarcity,"" saying via Weibo, the microblogging site, ""We have reprimanded Japan too many times for not acknowledging the massacre."" The official account from Xinhua, China's state-run news agency, warned that the nationalism of people who ""scold any Japanese they see ... is in fact leading the country to distress."" An editorial by the government-run Global Times said that ""China shouldn't change its policy to Japan just because Hatoyama, a politician currently out of office, gave a few words of friendship."" Grievances over World War II atrocities added fuel to violent anti-Japanese protests in China in September, particularly on the anniversary of the 1931 Japanese invasion of China. And it is not a coincidence, Kingston said, that a Chinese plane entered airspace over the disputed islands -- prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets -- on December 13, the 75th anniversary of the massacre. It was the first time that the territorial dispute involved planes. ""The next day on the front page of the newspapers were the images of the (Nanjing) Memorial ceremony and the planes,"" Kingston said. The dispute over the islands stems from 1895, when, at the end of the Sino-Japanese war, Japan annexed them. China has said that the islands have been its territory for the last five centuries. CNN's Steven Jiang and Dayu Zhang in Beijing and Junko Ogura in Tokyo contributed to this report.","Hatoyama contradicts Japan's position of indisputable territorial sovereignty over islands .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in over five years, a run of more than 300 competitive matches, Barcelona had less possession than the opposition. For this to happen against an also-ran in the Spanish league was some surprise, but for Gerardo Martino it was no big deal. After all, the Barca team that he took charge of in July still notched a fifth successive La Liga win, beating Rayo Vallecano 4-0 on Saturday as Pedro grabbed a hat-trick. But it does herald a change in approach for a team whose intricate style of ""Tiki-taka"" passing has made it one of the most successful clubs in world football -- a success mirrored and surpassed on the international stage by Spain. The numbers weren't startlingly one-sided -- Barca had 49% of the ball compared to the home side's 51% -- but it was a big drop from the stats so customary under the guidance of previous coaches Josep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova. Martino, however, is his own man -- and he is trying to put in place a ""Plan B"" when in the past it looked like the reigning Spanish champion had none. ""Rayo pressed us and they made it difficult to play short passes. We had the alternative to play long and at times you have to do this in these types of matches in order reach other parts of the field,"" the Argentine said. ""I really liked the team in the second half. We didn't have defensive errors and, like the match against Ajax, we improved over the course of the match. We have the capacity to score a lot of goals."" Pedro was the main beneficiary of Barca's firepower, being set up by midweek hat-trick hero Lionel Messi, Cesc Fabregas and then Neymar to take his league tally to five this season. Fabregas wrapped it up in the 80th minute with a sumptuous strike, but keeper Victor Valdes also made a vital contribution against second-bottom Vallecano as he saved a first-half penalty soon after Pedro's opener. ""Valdes is playing at a fantastic level and all I can do is enjoy it as his manager. He had decisive saves and he saved a penalty,"" Martino said. The win put Barca top on goal difference, as Atletico Madrid also notched a fifth straight win in Saturday's late match. Second-half goals from Raul Garcia and Diego Costa earned a 2-0 victory at Real Valladolid, putting the top two teams five points clear ahead of Sunday's games -- when Real Madrid hosts Getafe and Villarreal travels to Celta Vigo. In Saturday's other games, Malaga drew 0-0 at Real Sociedad and Levante came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Almeria after the home side had Cristian Fernandez sent off for two bookings in a minute. In Italy, Chievo moved out of the bottom three with a 2-1 win at home to Udinese, while struggling Sampdoria snatched a 2-2 draw at Cagliari in which three of the goals came in the final four minutes. Genoa and Livorno drew 0-0 in the other game played Saturday.","Pedro scores hat-trick as Barcelona's 100% La Liga run continues .

"(CNN) -- Militants killed 18 soldiers and eight police officers in south Yemen Friday morning, security officials said. The attacks targeted installations in Shabwa province on Friday morning, the officials said. They said the attackers used car bombs and heavy artillery. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but officials at the Defense Ministry and in Shabwa said think al Qaeda was behind the violence. ""Though no one has claimed responsibility, the planning, timing and weapons used in the Shabwa attacks give us a strong indication that al Qaeda stands behind todays attacks,"" a Defense Ministry official said on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. ""All three attacks took place within an hour in three different locations. Only an organized network like al Qaeda could stand behind such attacks."" The attacks are likely in retaliation for recent U.S. drone strikes, one security official said. Twelve soldiers were killed at the Rothom district military compound, and six soldiers died in an attack near Mayfah district, the officials said. The Defense Ministry said a commander, Col. Nasser Tahih, was among those killed. A raid on a police compound in Azzan killed eight officers, the officials said. Azzan is suspected to be home for hundreds of al-Qaeda militants. In the Azzan attack, ""the militants took control of the compound and looted many of its belongings and property. Those who tried to fight the militants were killed,"" one local security official told CNN. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to news media. The official said other officers surrendered to the militants and were taken prisoner. At least nine explosions were heard at the compound, one of the officials said. No militants were known to have died in the attack, security sources in Azzan told CNN. The government deployed hundreds of troops to the area and tight security checkpoints were introduced. Earlier this week, Yemen's Interior Ministry called for tightened security and warned that al Qaeda might be planning attacks and suicide bombings.

"Designer Ross Lovegrove is known for his clean, organic designs with flowing lines seemingly effortlessly merged with function. CNN spoke to him about water bottles, bubble cars and his approach to design. CNN: How would you describe what you do? Ross Lovegrove: What am I? I'm a designer, but of course that's a loose term these days. And often when I meet people and say I'm a designer, they say, ""Oh, a fashion designer."" Which is not a bad thing I suppose, a bit groovy. But I'm a designer and I work with industry, so I suppose I'm an industrial designer. It's not as grimy, not as deep and dark as that sounds, 'cause industry these days is very different. I'm also a humanist and I'm a sort of evolutionist in some ways, because what I do conforms to the concept of evolution, progress, adaptation within the field of making objects that we use everyday. CNN: Why did you choose design as a career? Ross Lovegrove: This was the profession where you could converge invention with the art of drawing and communication. I'm involved in everything from highly progressive lighting systems to airline interiors. In the field of transportation I can go from the micro to the macro: architecture, transportation, industrial product design, right across the board. It's Russian dollism, because they all interrelate: one goes into the other. CNN: Tell us about some of your designs. Ross Lovegrove: I did the world's first commercial transparent product. It sounds a bit superficial but looking inside objects celebrates every aspect of them and that's a very beautiful thing. I did the world's first digitally generated global product, my water bottle [for Ty Nant]. I worked on the first Airbus A380 program. The world's lightest suitcase, the world's first bamboo bicycle, the world's first ceramic-bladed razor -- it lasts 25 times longer than a Bic -- the world's first solar-powered commercial light, ten years ago. See some of Ross Lovegrove's designs. CNN: Is design a profession that's always moving forward? Ross Lovegrove: That's a lovely question in terms of how one improves, in an incremental way, that which once existed: everyday objects that we think have been done. The beautiful thing about design today is that we're looking at the possibility of re-inventing things. Recently I worked on a pen, for example, which is made on a 3D printer, so if you've got one of these printers you can download my data and print yourself this amazing net-like pen. It is a very complicated thing, a very beautiful, very aerated art object. It's the idea that everyday objects could actually be revisited and improved in some way. Something like the water bottle is a perfect example of this. Why not celebrate it? Without water there's no life. It's a fundamental resource that needs to be held up in the public realm every day as something that's very important to us rather than being a disposable commodity. CNN: Tell us about the process when you design something. Ross Lovegrove: Take the water bottle again. You find a trinity between process -- how you make these bottles industrially and efficiently; material -- the material is nontoxic, doesn't leech into the water; and is beautifully optical; the ergonomic value that you get through the surface so it means everybody who engages with it has this sort of, ""Oh my goodness!"" and structure -- the new digital process -- you couldn't have done that years ago, it's a totally contemporary product. The bottle is a bit of a eureka because everything works in harmony. CNN: The sense of touch is so important to your work. Why is that? Ross Lovegrove: The world we live in is not purely visual. For me it's totally poly-sensorial so the tactile, sensual aspect of living in the work that I do is brought to the fore. CNN: Tell us about your relationship with nature. Ross Lovegrove: Nature is a very big part of my work and always has been. I've never seen it as a trend or a fashion. It absolutely can not be because it's fundamental to life. Nature has this magic to it. Things grow effortlessly, benignly without violence or heat. One of the clues towards our future survival is the concept of bio-mimicry, where we study nature, learn from its intelligence and copy it one way or another. Nanotechnology is beginning to do that; how we apply these things to be as succinct and economic as possible so there's no waste. CNN: What's your aim in life? Ross Lovegrove: I'm interested in developing an aesthetic for the 21st century which comes from the intelligent use of resources, materials and structures. I'm not interested in copying the past just 'cause there was a funky chair done in the 50s, I'm interested in absolutely brand new, newborn, virgin ideas for things: lightness, transparency, things that you see in nature. Nature is fat free, it's fit. You tell me what you see in society that's fit, in terms of objects, products, people often. CNN: Do you think that's changing? Ross Lovegrove: Maybe in the next 15 years we'll see a fitness coming through, we'll see blending of ideas into everyday objects where we've got to make everything go a bit further, work a bit better. We've got to challenge 20th century values, which shifted from need to desire. CNN: How do you see that happening? Ross Lovegrove: I think people need to be less passive. They need to voice their opinions more. Things are very different now because of the way we communicate through the Internet, so maybe those big changes will not come from corporations, which are steeped in other ambitions. Maybe the future is in the hands of individuals and smaller people. And now with the Internet, even if it's a small product you can sell a different way, rather than slogging away at large corporations. CNN: Your designs are extremely innovative. How do you persuade people in industry to take such brave steps? Ross Lovegrove: You sow the seeds in the hope that maybe somebody enlightened within the corporation would want to put their neck on the line to try to develop something which everybody would benefit from. CNN: Are people ready for groundbreaking designs like ""Car on a Stick""? Ross Lovegrove: Right now, we have this massive freedom in being able to buy and use and park without really thinking about the common collective consequences. I don't want to sound too stern about this, but in the future the city car has to become a democratic shared object. We can't all have a car. One man, one car and we're all dead. It's incredible the numbers we're talking about now in emerging cultures now like India and China. But this is not doom and gloom: this is an amazing opportunity for somebody to build fantastic new economies out of things that we need and are not going to go away. The world needs a sensible car. CNN: What's the next step for ""Car on a Stick""? Ross Lovegrove: The next step is to find an enlightened entrepreneur who likes the idea of building it. Prototyping it and showing it at an automotive show wouldn't be that expensive. The difference between sitting here and just looking at one, and sitting here and driving one, is only money. Only money and a will. I'd love to have one of these parked upstairs, it'd fit the studio perfectly. .................................... What do you think of Ross Lovegrove's work?

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Nairobi National Park is that rarest of things -- a conservation park in a city -- and it is now a physical manifestation of the front lines in Kenya's human-wildlife conflict. Like the nearby residents of slum housing, the wildlife of the park has become victim of the city's uncontrollable growth. A lack of planning in the capital has led to human encroachment onto the protected area, compromising the well-being of wildlife through an invasion of industrial waste and domestic pollution. To secure its future the M-Pesa Foundation, a charitable trust, and private investors have launched the Nairobi Greenline Project. It involves the planting of 300,000 indigenous trees in a 30-kilometer long, 50-meter wide forest boundary around the park, reinforced by a 32-kilometer electric fence. Read this: Maasai boy scares off lions with flashy invention . Dorothee Von Brentano, the Senior Human Settlements Officer at U.N. Habitat Kenya, says: ""The fence is a symbol and a sign, to draw attention to an issue that needs to be much more properly addressed."" This issue is what she calls an ""ill hunger for land,"" the driving force behind the intrusion of urban development onto the park. ""They (locals) see land as a commodity, rather than a resource,"" says George Onyiro, the Habitat Program Manager at U.N Habitat. Public space . Onyiro and his colleagues categorize the park as public space which is an essential component in healthy social and urban development. ""Public space is a really important part of any urban expansion,"" says Jeanette Elsworth, Public Information Officer at U.N. Habitat. ""In fact, cities like Manhattan that we think of as really dense actually dedicate 30% of the land to public space. Nairobi is operating at 10-15% which is far too low."" Not incorporating public space into city planning has created the inevitable challenge of urban growth that does not embrace and accommodate conservation areas. Elijah Ndegwa, professor of Urban Planning at the University of Nairobi, believes that ""infiltration into the national park reflects a society that has not accepted wildlife as part of the stakeholders in the development of the city."" He adds: ""When we plan Nairobi we should view the park as part and parcel of the city, not as an appendage that must be gotten rid of."" Read this: Maasai Cricket Warriors swap spears for bats . The value of the National Park has yet to charm local residents like Angelina, a Kenyan grandmother whose makeshift home is only a few miles away from the park. She recently received an eviction letter from the town council -- unrelated to the Greenline project -- and can do nothing but count down the days until she watches her home bulldozed away. 'I've been living here since 1972 and my home will soon be demolished but the home of animals is continuously protected', she says. Local support . Experts believe that this mentality needs to change for Nairobi to move forward. Axemite Gebre-Egziabher, the director of the Global Division at U.N. Habitat, says more participation from locals is crucial for the future. ""If the city is going to move into a sustainable, healthy, competitive arena then it is important to have urban planning enforcement, but together with all the stakeholders. Then you don't need a fence -- they are the fence, they are the ones who would protect it (the park),"" she says. Involving people like Angelina in planning decisions could help strengthen the sense of public ownership for areas like Nairobi National Park. And instilling in the minds of locals the importance of preserving the National Park could help it be appreciated as an integral component of Nairobi's future development.","Nairobi National Park is threatened by human encroachment .

"(CNN) -- A teen beauty queen in Utah and three others were arrested Saturday morning for allegedly making and throwing bombs that an explosives investigator says could have killed someone. Kendra Gill, Bryce Stone, Shanna Smith and John Reagh -- all 18 -- admitted to buying the materials for the explosives, making the devices and throwing them from a vehicle, according to a Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office probable cause statement that CNN obtained. Gill was crowned Miss Riverton in June, and was set to compete for the Miss Utah title, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. Investigators began getting calls late Friday night from Riverton residents who heard ""loud pops,"" said Capt. Clint Mecham of the Unified Fire Authority which is investigating the case. ""The adults who were arrested were driving around in a car throwing these devices at property and people,"" Mecham said. Authorities found plastic bottles that contained household cleaning chemicals and aluminum foil strewn in streets around the community, he said. ""Not only do you have to worry about shrapnel, these type of devices have chemicals"" that can cause burns, Mecham said. ""This is not your average kid blowing up a mailbox,"" he said. ""These devices, they have the power to create a fair amount of damage. They can maim or kill a person."" The teenagers allegedly throwing the devices could have been badly hurt, too, he said. ""They could have lost their lives, fingers, hands,"" Mecham said. ""It's not a very smart thing to do all around."" Authorities interviewed witnesses in two parts of town who described seeing a similar dark-colored vehicle whose occupants were throwing explosive devices, according to a probable cause statement. One of the witnesses identified Stone as the driver and gave investigators his address. Authorities went there and questioned Stone, who allegedly implicated the three other teens, saying they had been ""pranking"" with fireworks with friends, the probable cause document says. Stone allowed authorities to search his car, where remnants of water bottles with labels and sizes matching debris at the bombing scenes were recovered, according to the document. A roll of aluminum foil, toilet bowl cleaner and several water bottles containing multiple pieces of rolled-up aluminum foil were also found, the document says. Gill, Stone, Smith and Reagh were taken into custody for questioning, and they admitted to buying, making and throwing the explosives, according to the document. The teens were booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on 10 counts each of setting off an incendiary device, Mecham said. All the teens bonded out Sunday night for $50,000 each, said Cammie Scogg, a Salt Lake County sheriff's spokeswoman. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sam Gill told CNN on Monday that his office is waiting for a full report from authorities to decide on whether to file charges.","Kendra Gill and 3 other 18-year-olds accused of making, throwing explosive devices .

"Washington (CNN) -- From five continents to nearly three dozen states, the justices of the Supreme Court remain busy travelers, and relatively well off financially. Eight of the nine members of the high court released their annual financial disclosure forms Wednesday, showing book income for Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer, and some unusual gifts to Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Sotomayor reported two gifts from friends: fine china worth $1,400 and a ""translucent composite print"" from artist Robert Weingarten. ""During 2011 many people sent me gifts of books, art, jewelry and trinkets,"" explained Sotomayor in her form. ""I have no reason to believe that any of those items exceeded the $335 limit"" requiring separate, itemized reporting of their value. The justice, named to the bench in 2010, also was the only one to list a liability -- minor credit card debt. All federal judges are required to list on annual financial disclosure forms any out-of-town travel for speeches and other appearances that was paid for by private groups. Judges are required to release only ranges of investment income, including stocks, not the exact value. Breyer and Scalia, as usual, ran neck-and-neck in the category of most-traveled justice, with Breyer gaining the edge with 21 out-of-town destinations on expense-paid business trips. He went to Canada, the United Kingdom and France in addition to states such as Florida, Arkansas, and Colorado. He was among at least six justices to travel to California. Scalia was among them, attending a seminar last year of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. The 76-year-old justice also jetted to seven countries, including Australia, Switzerland and Ireland. Sotomayor visited El Salvador, while Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan went to Argentina, along with the retired Sandra Day O'Connor, for an international legal conference. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy conducted their separate annual summer teaching stints in Italy and Austria. Eight justices reported teaching income from universities, including lectures, which generally earned them about $15,000 for one or more days of extracurricular work. Most such stints occur during the court's three-month recess, scheduled this year to begin late next week, when the last of the session's rulings will be issued, including the much-anticipated health care decisions. Justice Samuel Alito did not submit his disclosure form on time, and asked for an extension into August. Thomas noted his wife, Virginia, had 2011 non-investment income as a columnist at the Daily Caller website, and at Liberty Consulting, a conservative advocacy group founded by her. The specific amount of income did not have to be listed. Twenty Democratic lawmakers last October formally asked the Justice Department to investigate the justice's appearances before conservative groups and his failure over the years to publicly disclose about $700,000 of his wife's income, as required under federal law. Thomas updated the income on an amended disclosure form, and said the lapse was inadvertent. Scalia reported $18,755 in book income, including for a new legal treatise out this month called ""Reading Law."" Breyer's 2010 book, ""Making Democracy Work: A Judge's View"" earned him more than $45,000 in royalties last year.","Justices Breyer and Scalia ran neck-and-neck in the category of most-traveled justice .

"(CNN) -- A Romanian princess and her husband are scheduled to appear in court Friday after they were arrested in an alleged cockfighting ring in Oregon. John Wesley Walker and his wife, Princess Irina Walker, the third daughter of Romania's exiled King Michael I, are among six people charged with operating an illegal gambling business, the Justice Department said in a statement. Those six are also charged, along with 12 others, with conspiracy to violate the animal Welfare Act by conducting unlawful animal fighting ventures on 10 occasions, the statement said. The arrests took place Thursday across various sites in Oregon and Washington. The Walkers are from Irrigon, in Morrow County, Oregon, according to the indictment. They and the others arrested in Oregon are scheduled to appear for arraignment before a federal magistrate judge in Portland on Friday afternoon. Each of the offenses carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to the Justice Department. It was unclear whether the couple has a lawyer.","Princess Irina Walker is the third daughter of Romania's King Michael I .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI will visit England and Scotland from September 16-19, Queen Elizabeth II announced. It will be the first state visit to the United Kingdom by a pontiff, the Foreign Office said, noting that Pope John Paul II's 1982 trip was officially a pastoral visit, while Benedict's is a ""papal visit."" The official announcement comes as the Vatican reels from accusations that it did not do enough to stop child abuse by priests, nuns and other Catholic authority figures across Europe for decades. Benedict is working on an official statement, or pastoral letter, to Catholics in Ireland, where a damning government-backed report into child abuse by priests prompted four bishops to resign last year. There have also been widespread accusations against priests in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. The queen will receive the pope at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, during his September visit, the Foreign Office said. Benedict will give ""a major speech to British civil society"" at Westminster Hall in London and will beatify the 19th-century theologian and educationalist Cardinal John Henry Newman at a public Mass in Coventry, England. Beatification is one step shy of sainthood. The pope's visit comes at a time of heightened tensions between Rome and the Church of England following the Vatican's outreach to disaffected Anglicans last year. The head of the Church of England, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, said the visit would be an opportunity to ""cement ties"" between the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian churches in the United Kingdom. ""I look forward particularly to welcoming Pope Benedict to Lambeth Palace on behalf of the Church of England,"" Williams said in a statement, referring to the archbishop's official London residence. Williams met Benedict in Rome in November, not long after the Vatican said it had worked out a way for dissatisfied Anglicans to switch allegiance en masse to Rome. Some observers said the move will shatter more than 40 years of efforts to reconcile the Catholic and Anglican churches. The process will enable groups of Anglicans to become Catholic and recognize the pope as their leader, yet have parishes that retain Anglican rites, Vatican officials said. The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, forerunner of the Anglican Communion. Williams was said to have been surprised by the move, which critics described as an end run around a long-established Catholic-Anglican dialogue. Catholic and Anglican theology and rites are broadly similar, but Anglicans have long allowed priests to marry and have children. In recent decades, the Anglican Communion has allowed women to become priests. The Episcopal Church -- the U.S. branch of the Anglican Communion -- has ordained openly gay bishops. Those developments have caused controversy within the communion, with more conservative parishes setting up alternative structures of authority. There are about 77 million Anglicans worldwide and about 1.1 billion Roman Catholics.","Pope Benedict XVI will visit England and Scotland from September 16-19 .

"(CNN) -- Chants of ""Shame on you"" rained down from a packed Michigan state Senate gallery Thursday as the state's lame-duck GOP legislature advanced legislation giving workers the right to opt out of union membership. Labor unions and Democrats in the state legislature, some of whom walked out on the vote, lambasted the rush move as a stealthy subversion of the public will in labor-heavy Michigan. ""Republicans who got defeated up and down the ballot are using this lame-duck legislature to try and jam through legislation that flies in the face of what the voters wanted,"" said Bob McCann, the spokesman for the state's Senate Democratic Caucus. ""It's a disgusting process and a disgusting result."" Michigan's house passed two bills and the state Senate approved one that would make Michigan a ""right to work"" state in which public and private workers could opt out of union membership and dues. The bills must be now voted on by the opposite chamber before going to Gov. Rick Synder, who supports the change. Twenty-three U.S. states have similar legislation, according to the National Right To Work Legal Defense Foundation. Republican supporters, including Gov. Rick Snyder, said the proposal would improve the state's economic competitiveness. ""Under freedom to work, Michiganders will have the freedom to choose whether or not to join a union,"" Snyder said. ""They won't be forced to pay union dues if they don't want to, and they won't lose their jobs because of it. And if they want to pay dues voluntarily, they have the freedom to do that, too."" Synder announced the surprise plan to reporters Thursday morning. Within hours, thousands of labor supporters descended on the capitol building in Lansing to protest, but were met by police who used pepper spray to keep some of them out of secure areas. Authorities arrested eight people and locked down the building, preventing thousands of protesters from getting in and drawing the ire of Democratic Sen. John Gleason. ""They're just ramming it through with no public involvement,"" he said. ""They locked the state Capitol down. Every way they could, they shut the people out of the process."" Police said they were not trying to limit protest rights but were fearful of a repeat of events last year in Wisconsin, where demonstrators occupied the statehouse to protest Republican Gov. Scott Walker's efforts to strip union rights from most state jobs. ""People have a right to protest but it will be done in an orderly manner,"" state police Inspector Jean Adamczyk told CNN affiliate WDIV. The building was locked down because its capacity had been exceeded, he said. Enough people had gotten in to fill the gallery. Gleason complained that Republicans used a legislative maneuver -- placing the provisions in an appropriations bill -- to prevent voters from having the opportunity to overturn the decision. ""If you dedicate funds to legislation, it can't be overturned by the public,"" he said. Lawmakers also skipped committee hearings that normally precede the final passage of legislation, McCann said. ""That's a complete subversion of how the legislative process is supposed to work,"" he said. ""They've just completely thrown that out the window."" McCann said it's likely Democrats would challenge the validity of the legislation in court if it wins final approval. State law requires the House to wait five days before considering the bill. Michigan, with its ties to the auto industry, has long been a stronghold for the labor movement; 671,000 residents of the state are union members. But the state has suffered economically in recent years and Synder said employers need the flexibility to compete with businesses in neighboring Indiana and other states with right-to-work laws. The proposal would not affect collective bargaining rights, except to eliminate the ability of unions to have companies fire workers who refuse to pay union dues, said F. Vincent Vernuccio, director of labor policy for the free-market Michigan think thank, the Mackinac Center. Synder, in a blog entry on his website, said he thinks Republicans weren't trying to destroy unions. ""We owe much to the labor movement -- the end of child labor, the 40-hour work week, safe working conditions in factories, and a guaranteed minimum wage,"" he said. ""The labor movement is an important part of Michigan's fabric, and nothing about this proposal eliminates it."" But Michigan State AFL-CIO President Karla Swift said the bill doesn't help workers at all. ""In the wake of this legislation, the only 'freedom' gained for Michigan workers will be the freedom to make less, the freedom to be disrespected at work, the freedom to struggle to pay their bills and the freedom to be left out of the American dream,"" she said. CNN's John Fricke, Dave Alsup and Michael Pearson contributed to this report .","NEW: ""Nobody should be surprised if there are some legal challenges,"" McCann says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- On April 29, 1992, the intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues in south Los Angeles became a flashpoint for one of the worst riots in U.S. history. It was the site where Reginald Denny, a white trucker, was savagely attacked by a mob after the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police officers charged in the beating of Rodney King, an African-American. When the rioting was over, more than 3,000 structures and businesses were destroyed, leaving $1 billion in property damage and 54 people killed. In the immediate aftermath of the riots, many considered south Los Angeles an economic wasteland. But John Hope Bryant saw an opportunity for economic empowerment. Bryant is the founder of Operation Hope, a financial literacy and small business development program formed after the riots. He led a convoy of bankers, businesses leaders, politicians and entrepreneurs on a bus tour Tuesday to survey the past and recognize economic progress in south Los Angeles 20 years later. While manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles have declined from 700,000 to 370,000 since 1992, according to the L.A. County Economic Development Corp., Bryant remains optimistic about future economic growth in areas hardest hit by the rioting. ""Over the 20 years since the 1992 riots, over $1 billion have been invested in our underserved communities in and around south Los Angeles,"" he said. In many areas where urban blight and hostility between the Los Angeles Police Department and mostly African-American residents contributed to the urban unrest in 1992, businesses and shopping centers have replaced entire corridors once reduced to ashes. Bryant has served as an adviser on economic empowerment to the past three U.S. presidents and is on President Barack Obama's Advisory Council on Financial Capability. He acknowledged that high unemployment and access to capital for small businesses has stifled the economic recovery but said there are visible symbols of urban renewal that offer optimism about a full recovery. ""We believe that you cannot have a rainbow without a storm first, and no doubt, 20 years later, while real problems remain to be solved in our underserved communities, south Los Angeles and its surrounding communities have made great strides from the chaos to becoming a community,"" he said. As part of the anniversary tour, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa dedicated an elementary school in honor of music icon Quincy Jones, who joined the bus tour. Speaking to a group of elementary students on the campus that once stood surrounded by ruins, Jones described the tour as a humbling experience. ""When I was growing up, we didn't have any role models,"" he said. ""When I was a child at your age, there was no way I could even dream about a school named after me,"" Jones said, adding that he grew up in a racially segregated section of south Chicago where gangsters once controlled the streets.","Many considered south Los Angeles an economic wasteland In the aftermath of 1992 riots .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly one of every 10 state prisoners is sexually victimized during confinement, according to a Justice Department study released Thursday. The Bureau of Justice Statistics examined data collected in surveys of former prisoners about their time behind bars. The officials found that most of the victims had been abused while they were in state prisons, but a small percentage were molested in local jails or halfway houses. The victimization rate of 9.6% is more than double the rate cited in a report on the subject in 2008. However, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the Justice Department, cautioned that the previous study was based on a survey of current inmates in both state and federal institutions. The nature of the sexual incidents did not change. Female prisoners were more than three times as likely to be victims of sexual abuse as male prisoners. Prison staff sexual misconduct was prevalent. The study noted nearly seven in eight such incidents involved perpetrators of the opposite sex. More than 75% of the former prisoners who reported staff sexual misconduct were male inmates who said they had interaction with female staff, the report said. Violence associated with the sexual incidents was found to be common. ""Among all victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual violence, a quarter said they had been physically held down or restrained, and a quarter had been physically harmed or injured,"" the report said. About 29% of the victims reported bruises, black eyes, sprains, cuts and scratches, but 23% reported more serious injuries, including stab wounds, internal injuries, and broken bones. In response, the Justice Department announced it is establishing rules ""to prevent, detect, and respond to sexual abuse in confinement facilities"" The steps include screening inmates for risk of being sexually abused or sexually abusive, and training prison employees. ""The standards we establish today reflect the fact that sexual assault crimes committed within our correctional facilities can have devastating consequences for individual victims and for communities far beyond our jails and prisons,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a written statement.","The victimization rate, 9.6%, is more than double that of a different 2008 study .

"(CNN) -- Hours after losing Victoria Azarenka to injury, organizers of the Dubai Tennis Championships were dealt another major blow on Wednesday when Serena Williams also pulled out of the event. The 31-year-old Williams, who became the oldest women's tennis player to be crowned world No. 1 on Monday, said she was forced out because of a back injury. ""I've just had some back problems the past couple of weeks,"" the American told an impromptu press conference. ""I thought it would get better as the week went on but it didn't. I don't want to keep pushing it and make it worse."" Williams took to the court to apologize to fans who had arrived for her second-round match with Marion Bartoli of France. The absences of both Williams and previous No. 1 Azarenka represent a severe dent to a popular $2 million tournament which had already been without the sport's two reported highest earners, Maria Sharapova and Li Na (according to Forbes magazine). It is also a blow to the Women's Tennis Association, which has worked hard to introduce incentives and regulations to reduce the number of withdrawals from its events. Wednesday's unexpected withdrawal follows that of second-ranked Azarenka, which ensured that Williams will hang on to top spot until the Sony Ericsson Open, which starts in Miami on March 18. Williams said her back also troubled her in last week's Qatar Open, where she was beaten in the final by the Belorussian, who withdrew from the Dubai championships with a foot injury. The 15-time grand slam winner added that, having returned to the pinnacle after two and a half years during which her life and career were threatened following a freak foot injury in 2010, being No. 1 is no longer her primary goal. ""OK, I have done it, let's focus on my next goals which are the grand slams,"" Williams said, admitting that she already had at least half an eye on the French Open in Paris, starting on May 26. ""I really want to continue doing really well in those."" After winning Wimbledon and the US Open last year, Williams' total of grand slam titles is only three fewer than Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who together are second on the all-time list behind Steffi Graf with 22. Williams' absence increases the chances of world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska making a successful defense of her title, which began with the Pole grinding out a 7-, 6-3 win over Yulia Putintseva, a promising 18-year-old wild card entry from Kazakhstan. Bartoli, who received a wild-card invite after making a late entry, will face former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals. The Dane, now ranked 10th and a winner of the tournament in 2011, progressed with a 6-0 6-1 drubbing of China's former Wimbledon semifinalist Zheng Jie. .","Serena Williams pulls out minutes before scheduled clash with Marion Bartoli .

"(CNN) -- Five people, including a child, died when their helicopter crashed in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, that county's coroner said. Three men and one woman also died, said coroner Tom Kukuchka. Authorities were still attempting to contact next of kin. Holly Baker, with the Federal Aviation Administration, said the helicopter was reported missing with five people on board Saturday. It departed from Greater Binghamton Airport in New York and was headed to Jake Arner Memorial Airport in Lehighton, Pennsylvania. The wreckage of the Robinson 66 helicopter was found Sunday afternoon in a wooded area, Baker said. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. CNN affiliate WNEP reported that controllers at Wilkes-Barre/ Scranton International Airport lost contact with the helicopter around 10:30 p.m. ET Saturday night during bad weather.

"London (CNN) -- Somalia's president appealed for support for his struggling country Tuesday, comparing it to a young sapling that needs help to get started. ""We need support; we need assistance and investment; and we need protection from those who try to knock us over,"" President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told delegates at a donor conference in London. The goal, he said, is for Somalia eventually to stand strong and tall on its own, a country ""at peace with itself and its neighbors and which poses no threat to the world,"" with a thriving economy, strong values and a good education system. ""People may ask why Somalia matters at this time but there is a huge amount at stake right now: the future of our country, the security of the region and the wider world, and the removal of the piracy stranglehold on the Gulf of Aden,"" he said. Delegations from more than 50 nations and groups, including the United Nations, African Union and International Monetary Fund, gathered for the meeting, hosted jointly by the UK and Somali governments. Somali ministers shared detailed plans for developing the country's armed forces, police, justice system and public financial management, as the African nation struggles to emerge from more than two decades of conflict. Speaking with CNN's Nima Elbagir in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, ahead of the conference, Mohamud said Somalia needed a financial commitment, technical support and diplomatic engagement from the world. ""We want Somalia to be treated as a normal country,"" he said. ""Unless we are treated as a normal country, Somalia will never become a normal country. That's what we are expecting from the world."" Mohamud, who took office six months ago, travels in an armored convoy but says he won't let the al Qaeda-linked Islamist group Al-Shabaab -- responsible for many terror attacks in Somalia -- dictate what he does. In his remarks to delegates, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Somalia's security matters to the entire international community. ""Why? Because when young minds are poisoned by radicalism, and they go on to export terrorism and extremism, the security of the whole world ... is at stake,"" he said. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said Somalia's people and government should be proud of the ""huge progress"" the country has made over the past year. ""A new parliament and government have been appointed in the most representative political process in a generation,"" he said in a statement. ""Al Shabaab has lost large areas of territory. The diaspora are returning and the economy is starting to revive. ""But this progress is fragile, and maintaining the momentum will require leadership in Somalia and support from the region and the international community."" Mogadishu attack . In a reminder of the security challenges facing the country, a suicide bomber on Sunday drove a car packed with explosives into a convoy carrying a Qatari delegation through the capital, killing at least eight people, authorities and witnesses said. Those killed were bystanders, authorities said, with no one in the convoy hurt. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bombing, and said six soldiers were killed and nine wounded. AMISOM, the African Union Mission in Somalia, is playing a key role in efforts to quell the militant group. Brigadier Michael Ondoga, of AMISOM, told CNN Tuesday that although Al-Shabaab was ""largely defeated"" in Mogadishu, there were still issues with its members ""melting into the population"" and taking advantage of the city's large size to hide. Mogadishu covers 640 square miles, and its population includes some 300,000 internally displaced people, he said. But Somali security forces have done a great job in pre-empting many suicide attacks and have arrested some of the Al-Shabaab operatives hiding among the capital's population. ""The situation is generally good at the moment -- the security forces are controlling it very well,"" Ondoga said. ""Here in the city now, the big guns are quiet, the streets are lit, many (in the) diaspora are coming back, new construction is going on, business is booming,"" he said. Somali and AMISOM forces have also won back territory extending a long way out from the capital, he said, leaving Al-Shabaab in control of only a few small areas in the west and some ports in the east. ""So there is great achievement that has been made between the national security forces and AMISOM, and we hope that this continues,"" Ondoga said. ""Eventually, national security forces should be able to man the streets of this country on their own."" Once security is stabilized across the country, piracy should no longer be an issue in the waters around Somalia, he added, since the pirates will no longer have a base to operate from. Somali pirates have been a threat to international maritime traffic for some years. 'Culture of impunity' International rights group Human Rights Watch called for the London conference to address ""widespread human rights abuses by all parties,"" which, it says, have been overlooked throughout the long years of conflict. ""The failure to address these abuses and the culture of impunity in which they have taken place has contributed to ongoing conflict and insecurity,"" the group said in a statement. ""A substantial improvement in the respect for human rights and accountability for serious abuses is now essential."" Delegates agreed on a package of support for Somalia on preventing sexual violence, the UK Foreign Office said. As part of this, a team of U.N. experts will deploy to Somalia in the summer. Somalia was subject to international condemnation this year over a case in which a woman and a journalist were sentenced to prison after she told him she was raped by security forces. She was subsequently acquitted on appeal, but the journalist's conviction was upheld, though his sentence was cut. Somali Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said via his Twitter account that the country's progress so far had defied the skeptics, but challenges remain. ""With the support of our friends and partners the progress must be made unstoppable. A bright future for #Somalia is within touching distance,"" he tweeted Monday. Somalia has lacked an effective central government since 1991, with portions of the Horn of Africa nation left lawless. In January, the United States granted official recognition to the new Somali government. READ MORE: Suicide bomber targets Qatari delegation in Somalia, 8 dead .

"(CNN) -- Four people -- including a 1-year-old child -- were killed when a turboprop plane slammed into a neighborhood in East Haven, Connecticut, authorities said Saturday. The chief medical examiner's office in nearby Farmington identified those killed as William Henningsgaard, 54, and Maxwell Henningsgaard, 17, both of Medina, Washington; and Sade Brantley, 13, and Madisyn Mitchell, 1, both of East Haven. Earlier, Blair Henningsgaard told CNN he believed his brother Bill and Bill's son were on board. East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. had also said two children, ages 13 and 1, were in a house during the crash and were presumed dead. The other damaged house was unoccupied. The Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B was registered to Bill Henningsgaard, who had worked for Microsoft for 14 years including as vice president of sales for the western United States, Australia and New Zealand. It took off from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport on Friday morning and crashed while approaching the southern Connecticut airport around 11:25 a.m., according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The pilot didn't indicate any problems before the aircraft slammed upside down into the neighborhood Friday, a federal investigator said Saturday. The pilot -- who had a certificate allowing him to fly the multi-engine plane -- told the control tower that yes, he could see the runway, and didn't hint at an emergency before transmissions suddenly cut off, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Patrick Murray said. It was raining at the time, though Murray did not say whether it's been determined if weather played a role. ""We don't have any preliminary indication that anything was wrong with that plane,"" Murray said. What they do believe is that the aircraft came in inverted and nose down at a 60- to 70-degree angle when it crashed into the side of a home about a half-mile from Tweed New Haven Airport. Before that impact, the plane approached at allowable altitude level for landing in that area, the investigator said. Murray stressed there's still much more to be done, including ideally piecing the aircraft back together and looking for on-board equipment that may provide telling details such as speed and altitude. The fuselage entered one of the homes, according to Malloy. The right wing of the airplane could be seen in the smoldering wreckage of one house, and the left wing was in another house. Video from CNN affiliate WTNH showed smoke rising from a heavily damaged house in East Haven, and what appeared to be the tail of a plane nearby. Fire consumed both houses, initially preventing firefighters from searching for victims, East Haven Fire Chief Douglas Jackson said Friday. Maturo said the children were in one house with their mother when the plane struck shortly before 11:30 a.m. The mother escaped, he said. ""It's ... total devastation in the back of the home,"" Maturo said. Plane crashes into Indiana neighborhood, kills 2 .

"Boston (CNN) -- After seven weeks of colorful witnesses and rancorous testimony, the jury began deliberations Tuesday in the trial of alleged crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Eight men and four women on the federal court panel have the monumental task of processing testimony from drug traffickers, extortion victims, gangsters, families of alleged victims and shooting victims, along with more than six hours of closing arguments. Bulger is accused of 19 killings and 13 counts of extortion and money laundering during a 20-year ""reign of terror"" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston. Jurors deliberated for six hours Tuesday before court was suspended for the day shortly after 4:30 p.m. ET. Deliberations are scheduled to resume Wednesday at 9 a.m. Jurors will have to decide if the government has proven its case and if Bulger is guilty of the alleged crimes ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""You must decide which evidence to believe and which witnesses are true. You can believe some, or all, or none,"" U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper told the jurors Tuesday, adding a cautionary instruction for government witnesses who have entered into plea deals for immunity and lesser sentences. Casper advised that jurors weigh the potential that these witnesses ""may have a motive to make up stories."" Simultaneously, jurors are advised not to draw inferences from a witness's guilty plea. Plea deals for gangsters . In their closing arguments Monday, defense attorneys attacked the credibility of gangsters who became star witnesses for the prosecution, testifying under immunity after they learned Bulger was an informant for the FBI for nearly two decades. Prosecuting attorney Fred Wyshak on Monday defended the government's unsavory plea deals with those gangsters, three of whom implicated Bulger in the 19 murders and various acts of extortion. ""The government didn't choose them, Bulger chose them,"" Wyshak said. ""The only thing worse than making a deal with (former hit man) John Martorano would have been not making a deal with John Martorano."" Wyshak said the government ""held its nose and made the deal."" Prosecutors called 63 witnesses during the course of the trial, with the defense bringing only 10 to the stand. Martorano testified for both sides, making a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days. As he presented his closing argument Monday, Wyshak called Bulger one of the most ""vicious, violent and calculating criminals to ever walk the streets of Boston."" The prosecution took close to three and a half hours for its closing. The defense took over two and a half hours to make its case, then the prosecution had the final word in a rebuttal. Defense attorney J.W. Carney summed up his case by questioning the credibility of prosecution witnesses, some of whom came to court with extensive criminal resumes and who had worked out deals with the government in exchange for testifying against Bulger. ""If you cannot say in your deliberation that I personally can believe (prosecution witnesses) beyond a reasonable doubt, then the government cannot prove its case about the alleged murders,"" Carney told the jury. ""The government is buying the testimony of these witnesses. The currency used here (is) how much freedom someone is going to get. What the government can pay the individual is the individual's freedom,"" Carney continued. Earlier, Wyshak said Bulger and his partner ""plotted, they schemed, they robbed they murdered together, they were also informants together."" Prosecutors contend Bulger was an FBI informant who used protection from rogue agents as he continued his life of crime. Defense attorneys have argued Bulger was not an informant, and that FBI bungling was key in the case. ""If there is one thing you heard during this trial, it's how secretive that relationship is,"" Wyshak said to the jury Monday. ""The last thing a criminal wants ... is for people to know he's an informant."" But he also said that it ""doesn't matter whether or not Bulger is an FBI informant when he put the gun to the head of Arthur Barrett and pulled the trigger."" Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett died after being shot in the head in 1983. ""It's not about whether or not the FBI in Boston was a mess,"" he said. ""... It's about whether or not the defendant is guilty of crimes charged in the indictment."" Families of the victims were in court every day of the trial. The wife of one of the victims shouted ""You're a coward!"" The defense rested its case Friday with no rebuttal from the government. In its weeklong presentation, Bulger's lawyers tried to cast doubt on who killed two of the 19 victims, both of them women. The defense also attempted to shift the blame onto the FBI, specifically agents who either did nothing or did too little to prevent several killings. Defense attorneys tried to convince the jury that Bulger was not an FBI informant, a notion prosecutors called ""ludicrous"" in light of his FBI informant card and a 700-page file loaded with ""tips"" on rival gang members. In closing arguments, defense attorney Hank Brennan told jurors why he thinks the government has made Bulger's informant status the crux of its case. ""Think about why it's so important. If it's not an issue, why do they keep bringing it up?"" Brennan asked. Brennan explained that other than to ""embarrass"" his client, the government using its claim that Bulger was an informant to cover up years of corruption. ""If he's not an informant, think of the liability,"" he said, recounting instance after instance in which government officials as high as strike-force attorneys in the Justice Department protected Bulger throughout his criminal career. A number of retired FBI agents and supervisors took the stand during the trial, many testifying that they believed Bulger should have been shut down as an informant because he wasn't providing any useful information. The agents said they never pressed the issue because apparently FBI headquarters felt Bulger was useful in taking down the New England Mafia. Grisly murders . It took prosecutors 90 minutes to detail the 19 murders Bulger is accused of, showing photos of each of the victims and the crime scenes. Bulger is not charged with delivering the fatal blow in all of the murders, but is charged with participating as part of a racketeering conspiracy. Wyshak called Bulger ""the leader of a very wide-ranging, broad organization,"" who is culpable for his co-conspirator's crimes. But Wyshak made clear Bulger was the alleged triggerman in some cases, recalling testimony from Bulger's partner, Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi, about the murder of John McIntyre, whose remains were exhumed from a shallow makeshift grave in 2000. McIntyre had begun cooperating with the government on the shipment of weapons to the Irish Republican Army and 36 tons of marijuana imported into Boston Harbor. ""It's Arthur Barrett all over again, held at gunpoint, chained to the kitchen chair, interrogated,"" Wyshak said. Flemmi said he was holding McIntyre's body while Bulger was trying to strangle him with a rope, but the rope was too thick. After that didn't work, McIntyre practically begged for a bullet after Bulger asked him if he would ""like one in the head,"" according to Flemmi. Flemmi testified as one of the government's star witnesses, and he said that he saw Bulger strangle the two women. The defense team, however, presented evidence that Flemmi had the greater motive to kill the women -- his girlfriend and his stepdaughter. Bulger's attorneys release photos designed to show his softer side . The girlfriend, Debra Davis, was about to leave him for another man. The defense recalled Martorano, who testified that Flemmi admitted he ""accidentally strangled"" the 26-year-old woman. Flemmi acknowledged he lured Davis to a home but says Bulger strangled her because she was talking too much and had become a liability. Wyshak recalled testimony that Bulger always needed to take a nap after strangling or shooting his victims to death. In talking about the murder of Paul McGonagle, Wyshak said Bulger's former cohorts testified that whenever they passed the Neponset River, where McGonagle's remains were exhumed in 2000, Bulger said, ""'Drink up, Paulie.' That's the level of humanity that this defendant is operating at. ... And every time he goes by there it's 'Drink up, Paulie.'"" Victim's mother warned FBI about an impending murder . 'Bulger: I didn't get a fair trial' Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, after a crooked FBI agent told him in December 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The FBI tracked him down and arrested him 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias. Bulger never took the stand, despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. In fact, Bulger seemed to want to testify, and when questioned about it by the judge, Bulger called his decision a ""choice made involuntarily."" He claimed he had been given immunity for his crimes by the former head of New England's Organized-Crime Strike Force, Jeremiah O'Sullivan, now deceased. Bulger, who lost his temper several times during the trial, appeared angry, shaking his finger at the judge and claiming he was ""choked off from making an adequate defense."" ""I didn't get a fair trial. This is a sham. Do what ya's want with me,"" Bulger said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department and attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the $11 billion merger of American Airlines and US Airways, saying the combination would lead to higher prices and less service for consumers. The merger, which would create the world's largest airline, would ""substantially lessen competition"" for commercial air travel, contends the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. The carriers said in a joint statement that they would mount a ""vigorous and strong defense"" of their deal and pursue all legal options to move it forward. ""We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our merger. Integrating the complementary networks of American and US Airways to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together. Blocking this procompetitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices,"" the companies said. Opinion: Why American-US Airways deal is good . US Airways shares slid more than 9 percent on Wall Street. American is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A top concern is local markets, the Justice Department said. It cited the example of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where the combined airline would control 69% of takeoff and landing slots, and 63% of the outbound nonstop routes. The Justice Department also said in its complaint that if the two airlines were allowed to merge, there would be higher fees for baggage and flight changes. The states that joined the antitrust lawsuit are: Texas, where American's parent company AMR Corp. is based; Arizona, home base for US Airways; Florida; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; and Virginia. The lawsuit comes as somewhat of a surprise. In recent years the Justice Department has allowed other big airline mergers -- Delta gobbled up Northwest, and United absorbed Continental -- in part because the airline industry was losing so much money and the mergers were seen as necessary for survival. But airlines are now making billions of dollars, not only from higher fares but also from $6 billion in fees they collected in 2012 alone, for baggage and seat selection and other things that used to be included in fares. Minority businesses would fight any US Air merger . American and US Airways had touted their combination as one that ""joins two highly complementary networks with access to the best destinations around the globe -- offering you increased choices, improved efficiency and better options"" under American's Oneworld alliance. The Justice Department lawsuit cites internal documents from the airlines to show that the merger isn't needed and in fact would lead to cuts in programs that benefit travelers. An example is US Airways' Advantage Fares discount program, which executives said would likely be eliminated after the merger, according to the Justice Department. Without the merger, antitrust officials said, other airlines would be forced to continue to match US Airways' discounts to compete. American has been in bankruptcy protection since 2011 and has been working to get approval from antitrust authorities and shareholders for the merger so it can emerge from court protection. The companies had hoped to complete the deal by the end of September. The European Union this month cleared the merger with the condition that the airline give up slots to allow new competition in the Philadelphia-to-London route. CNNMoney's Chris Isidore contributed to this report.","The merged American Airlines-US Airways would be the world's largest airline .

"(CNN) -- I hate the Dallas Cowboys. No, I don't dislike them. I flat out cannot stand anything about the Dallas Cowboys. The year they went 1-15, I was ticked they won that one game. When they played in those three Super Bowls in the '90s, I rooted hard for the opposition. Hell, I hate them more than the Ku Klux Klan! That's why I take great pleasure in seeing the transfer of power in the Lone Star State, where the football greatness has moved from Dallas to Houston. For decades, all of the talk has been about the Cowboys, that damn star, and lately, the monstrosity of a football palace built by owner Jerry Jones. But with the NFL playoffs kicking off this weekend, the only football they'll witness at Cowboys Stadium is Kansas State and Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. Another opinion: Why the Cowboys still rule in Texas . But 250 miles south of Dallas, the Houston Texans will take on the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC wild card game. For Cowboys fans, it's over. No longer can you talk supremacy over Houston. The expansion Texans is the talk of the state, and all the Cowboys fans can do is complain about Tony Romo and Jerry Jones. And they might as well get used to it. The Cowboys are truly a has-been team. Those five Lombardi trophies? Well, you better keep watching NFL Films. That will be the only way to see Dallas raise that again. The Texans are a young and talented team that could have done better than 10-6 had we not been hit with injuries to our top three players. We are about to see a tremendous run by the Texans, and when it comes to pro football in the state, no one will be talking about the bumbling Cowboys. America's Team? Hell, you're barely Arlington's team with the rise of the Texas Rangers in back-to-back World Series. You don't even have the best-looking cheerleaders in the NFL (I'll vote for the Miami Dolphins). Houston has always been a world-class city, and one satisfied with being a Texas town. Dallas? It's always desired to be another Los Angeles and New York. Just get your own identity and stick with it. Sure, Dallas will talk a lot of smack about being the Texans' big brother, and before that, the Houston Oilers. But I don't care. I was a ""Luv Ya Blue"" fan before Bud Adams bolted to Tennessee, and now I'm a season ticket holder for the Texans. I would continue, but I need to pack for my flight Friday to Houston for the game. All the Cowboys fans will be packing is a bunch of Haterade for the new King of Football in Texas: the Houston Texans.","Roland Martin says he can't stand the Dallas Cowboys .

"(CNN) -- In hiding, they listened carefully. To gunshots and explosions. To friends and strangers hiding with them. With their lives at stake, they spoke quietly and tried to decide: When do we run for it? Sara Head of Washington hid in a stairwell. Uche Kaigwa-Okoye's place of refuge was a stall in a ladies' restroom. Zulobia Kassam was in the back of a supermarket. Each was lucky enough never to see any of the gunmen who killed dozens in the upscale Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, on Saturday. But not seeing their attackers was itself part of the terror. Stuck between floors . Head, along with a business colleague and a driver, fled from the parking lot after the shooting started. Her group ran into a stairwell, thinking they would go up one level and find a safe exit. But they could hear more gunfire and backed down, winding up with a group of strangers cowering on the stairs between floors. Keep up with the latest developments in Kenya . ""We heard lots of shots at first, then none for a while -- maybe 15 minutes more -- then more,"" Head said. ""We didn't go want to go up or down,"" she said. Head saw two people in the stairwell bleeding from minor wounds. People talked on their cell phones -- she contacted her husband and the American embassy -- but then a stranger said the talking might attract the attackers. Those with smartphones whispered reports of hostages taken and grenades going off. ""No one really knew what was going on,"" she said. Safety: Can the attack happen again? Crowding in the ladies' room . Kaigwa-Okoye thought he heard a table fall over, ""and then it happened repetitively, and it got really loud."" Soon people started screaming and Kaigwa-Okoye joined many who ran outside. But they heard gunfire outside, too, so Kaigwa-Okoye went back inside. Still unable to see any attackers, they thought they were backing away from danger. But when they reached a corner, shots were fired -- shots that seemed to be in their direction. They fled to a ladies' restroom, where 20 people soon were hiding. ""We were really scared,"" he said. ""Every sound sounded scary. We couldn't make out sounds, and they had grenades. It was really, really loud ... They must have passed our corridor several times. We heard gunshots down our corridor."" Some people ventured out but quickly returned, saying it was unsafe. Near supermarket gunfire . Kassam had just finished coffee when she entered a supermarket in the mall. ""We entered and the lights went off,"" she said. She waited for the generator to kick in, but instead she heard gunshots and saw people running. ""We rushed to the back and hid ourselves,"" Kassam said. ""We heard random shots from everywhere -- upstairs, downstairs ... we even heard shots 30 feet from us,"" she said. ""People were petrified, crying, praying,"" she said. Surviving the mall massacre: 'Just lucky' 'The lights came on' Head had been in the stairwell 90 minutes when a door from the supermarket opened. ""The lights came on in the stairwell, and people went out. I was very, very hesitant because ... there was no information to tell me it was safe to exit,"" she said. ""It was just that the people in front of me were exiting."" ""People were saying be quiet,"" she said. She saw drops of blood on the floor as they walked through the hardware section and a cereal aisle and then through the storeroom to get outside. Still they walked quietly until it seemed safe to make noise. Then they ran, she said, not stopping even when they reached crowds of onlookers and photographers. Tear gas, then rescue . Kaigwa-Okoye heard firing but then realized police had arrived on the floor where he was hiding in the restroom. They were firing tear gas. Officers told them to walk out single file and made them throw away their bags. Kassam had been hiding in the back of the supermarket for more than two hours when a security person arrived and said it was safe to flee. She and others walked through a storage area.

"(CNN) -- Some 20,000 text messages, 25 photographs including nudes, and alleged secret meetings have prompted prosecutors to rescind a plea offer and request that bond be revoked for Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt, charged with felonies in a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl, according to court papers. Hunt, who turned 19 last Wednesday, was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of a then-14-old schoolmate went to authorities in Indian River County saying Hunt had a sexual relationship with their daughter. After the case gained nationwide publicity, Hunt was offered a plea deal in which she would not face jail time, nor would she have to wear an ankle bracelet or have to register as a sex offender. But Florida Assistant State Attorney Christopher Taylor told CNN Monday that since learning about Hunt's alleged contact with the victim in this case, the state has taken the deal off the table. Texts, photos and meetings would violate a no-contact court order issued in February as a condition of Hunt's being out of jail while awaiting trial. Prosecutors now say in court papers that also in February, Hunt gave the girl an iPod. The device was used to receive and send about 20,000 text messages between the two, according to the court papers. Hunt also is accused of sending photographs and videos to the girl, with the court papers saying ""These photographs are explicit and depict the defendant nude ..."" Prosecutors included examples of texts they say Hunt sent to the girl, including: ""(N)o matter what if they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts."" The texts are proof that Hunt was ""consciously and intentionally violating the court's order,"" prosecutors said in the papers. Prosecutors also say that the younger girl told a detective that Hunt would drive her to ""a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact."" The court papers claim that the most recent meeting took place two weeks ago. The Hunt family refused to comment and their attorney has not responded to CNN's request for an interview. The case gained national attention when Hunt's family went public on Facebook after she was charged, detailing their daughter's case and essentially accusing the victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay. The victim's family said that isn't true and that they were only trying to protect their teenage daughter. A judge will decide Tuesday whether Hunt's bond should be revoked and if that happens, she could be jailed.","Kaitlyn Hunt faces felony charges from her relationship with a female classmate .

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt has won a third consecutive world 200m title at the world championships in Moscow. The Jamaican sprinter powered home in a time of 19.66 seconds at the Luzhniki stadium to take his tally of world championship gold medals to seven. His compatriot Warren Weir took the silver in 19.79 seconds while U.S. sprinter Curtis Mitchell claimed the bronze in a time of 20.04 seconds. Bolt may not have been at his blistering best at these championships but has still put clear daylight between himself and his fellow sprinters when it matters most. The 26-year-old was run close by South Africa's Anaso Jobodwana in Friday's 200m semifinal but effortlessly stepped up a gear in the final. Running in lane four, Bolt powered around the bend leaving the field trailing in his wake. Weir chased gamely and was closing on Bolt as he crossed the line but the result, as always, was never in doubt. Bolt will look to add a eighth gold medal to his world championship collection on Sunday when he goes in the 4x100m relay. Six other gold medals were up for grabs on Saturday with Russia having a good day both on the track and in the field. Svetlana Shkolina won the women's high jump for Russia going clear at 2.03 meters to beat U.S. rival Brigetta Barrett (2.00m) who took silver. Shkolina's teammate Anna Chicherova shared bronze with Spain's Ruth Beitia. Russia's women also pipped the U.S. to gold in the 4x400m relay as Antonina Krivoshapka held off a challenge from Francina McCrory of the U.S. on the anchor leg. Great Britain and Ireland took the bronze. But there was better news for the U.S. in the 100m hurdles with Brianna Rollins recovering from a poor start to take gold in 12.44 seconds ahead of 2011 world champion Sally Pearson from Australia. Great Britain and Ireland's Tiffany Porter took bronze. In the men's marathon, Stephen Kiprotich added world gold to the Olympic title he won in London last year.

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- A military judge plans to announce Wednesday morning what sentence she'll give Pfc. Bradley Manning, the U.S. Army intelligence analyst who stands convicted of what prosecutors believe was the biggest leak of classified materials in Army history. The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, reconvened the sentencing phase of Manning's court martial Tuesday morning, and noted the soldier has 1,293 days -- or 3 1/2 years -- of detention credit to consider. Manning's defense attorney previously argued that his client deserves additional consideration for the harsh conditions he suffered during part of that detention. Lind's deliberations officially began after court recessed Tuesday morning. Later Tuesday, she told both sides that she intends to announce a sentence at 10 a.m. ET Wednesday. Manning's lawyer: He should not 'rot in jail' Prosecutors have said Manning acted as a ""determined insider"" in leaking classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and should be locked up for at least 60 years. Manning's lawyer contends he can be rehabilitated and should not ""rot in jail."" Manning faces up to 90 years behind bars. Lawyers for both sides wrapped up their sentencing arguments Monday. ""There may not be a soldier in the history of the Army who displayed such an extreme disregard"" for his mission, Capt. Joe Morrow, the prosecutor, said Monday. Manning's arrogance, Morrow said, meant that he ""felt he alone was knowledgeable and intelligent enough to determine what information was to be classified."" Judge explains verdict . Morrow asked that Manning, 25, serve a minimum sentence of six decades behind bars, saying his actions created grave risk, disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives. Defense attorney David Coombs did not ask for a specific sentence, but said that his client was an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and that he should not be left to ""rot in jail."" ""Perhaps his biggest crime was that he cared about the loss of life that he was seeing and couldn't ignore it,"" he said of Manning's decision to turn over the explosive information to WikiLeaks. ""This is a young man capable of being redeemed,"" Coombs said in final remarks. ""The defense requests, after the court considers all the facts, a sentence that allows him to have a life."" Lind convicted Manning of numerous counts at his trial in July, including espionage-related charges. He avoided a potential life sentence when Lind rejected charges that his actions aided the enemy. In addition to prison, prosecutors also want Manning to forfeit pay and benefits and pay a $100,000 fine. Officials indicated a single sentence would cover all of the guilty counts.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced an American citizen to 25 years in prison for conspiring to sell missiles, rifles and other weapons to the Taliban, the U.S. attorney's office for Manhattan announced. The sentence for Alwar Pouryan -- which includes 10 years of supervised release after he leaves prison -- comes the month after he and a co-defendant were found guilty following a two-week bench trial by U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald. ""Alwar Pouryan was an American who was all too willing to do business with the Taliban -- agreeing to provide that narco-terrorist organization with lethal, military-grade weapons that would have put countless innocent lives at risk,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. ""The sentence handed down today is a just and appropriate penalty for an individual who so callously sold out his country."" According to the Bahara's office, the 38-year-old Pouryan and his co-conspirator Oded Orbach began communicating in fall 2010 with a person they believed represented the Taliban -- but who actually worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In conversations by phone, e-mail, Skype and in person in Ghana, Ukraine and Romania, Pouryan and Orbach offered specifics about what types of arms they'd sell and for how much. The weapons discussed included anti-tank missiles, grenade launchers and M-16 assault rifles, not to mention ammunition. Pouryan and Orbach were told surface-to-air missiles were especially needed to protect Taliban-run heroin facilities in Afghanistan from U.S. helicopter attacks, according to the federal prosecutor's office. Evidence presented during the trial included e-mails from Orbach to third-party weapons suppliers, asking about obtaining some of the items. Feds: 7 men charged with conspiring to supply Taliban . After hashing out price lists and other details, the two sides reached a deal: more than $25 million worth in weapons, ammunition and training, of which Pouryan and Orbach would pocket $800,000 in commission. Until, of course, the plot unraveled with the two American men's February 2011 arrest in Bucharest, Romania. Pouryan and Orbach were extradited more than three months later to the United States, where they stood trial. Five other men tied to the plot -- all of whom coordinated with the same undercover agent, some of whom worked directly with Pouryan and Orbach -- were arrested in Liberia and likewise brought to the United States. Four of them allegedly agreed to oversee a shipment to Benin of Taliban-owned heroin, which the Taliban could profit from after it was eventually flown to the United States, the U.S. Justice Department stated in 2011. All five consented to sell the Taliban cocaine that the Afghanistan-based Islamist group could then sell for a profit, according to the agency. The 55-year-old Orbach, who is currently being held in New York according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, is set to be sentenced on November 1 by Judge Buchwald.","Alwar Pouryan and a co-conspirator were found guilty in August .

Resident Robert Cole didn't need any further encouraging to get out of the way of the blaze, dubbed the Beaver Creek Fire, that swelled significantly -- and dangerously -- over the course of the day. ""I've seen enough disaster in my life... But never any fire that threatened my home,"" Cole said, looking toward a glowing ridge. Photos: 'Wall of fire' threatens homes . Somewhere in that area, he knew firefighters were working to save homes . ""I hope like hell they are safe,"" Cole said. The fire grew from 64,000 acres on Friday to nearly 93,000 on Saturday, pushed in large part by strong winds, low humidity and dry brush, according to the U.S. multi-agency fire response website InciWeb. Firefighters have been unable to corral the blaze that was ignited by a lightning strike on August 7 northwest of the town of Hailey. It was just 9% contained by Saturday evening -- up slightly from the 6% containment it had been for most of the day -- said Meghan Stump of the fire information office.

""Firefighters are making a valiant stand,"" she said. The fire has destroyed at least one home and damaged several others, according to InciWeb. It also destroyed a bridge that had connected the Idaho communities of Ketchum and Fairfield, according to Stump. As of Saturday evening, there were no reports of injuries stemming from the blaze, she said. Still, the danger is real, which is why the Blaine County Sheriff's Office said Saturday afternoon there was a ""high probability"" of even more evacuations to come in West Ketchum. Residents of the cities of Ketchum and Sun Valley -- home to a well-known ski resort -- are under a pre-evacuation notice. ""Begin preparations now so that you can leave immediately should conditions deteriorate,"" the sheriff's office warned.

Authorities said Highway 75 was intermittently closed due to fire, smoke and firefighting operations. The Idaho National Guard also has been called in to help, . Gov. Butch Otter has issued a disaster declaration and ordered the Idaho National Guard to provide support for firefighting efforts. The governor warned people to obey the evacuation orders. ""Those folks' job is to fight fire, not rescue people, and evacuate them after they were told to do it, and refused to do it,"" Otter told KTVB. ""I understand you want to protect your property.

"(CNN) -- The body of a man swept away while swimming in a rain-swollen creek in western North Carolina was found Sunday, authorities said. The body of a child who was dragged away by the swift currents was recovered Saturday evening. The drownings happened after 4 inches of rain fell over five hours in North Carolina's Piedmont region, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in Catawba County. First responders stayed busy racing to save people stuck in fast-moving waters and closed dozens of roads Saturday because of major flooding. Delilah Lovett, 10, of Charlotte and Juan Alberdi, 48, of Huntersville -- members of different families who were visiting the area together -- were both swimming in what is known as the ""bathtub"" on Wilson's Creek in Caldwell County around 6:15 p.m. Saturday, the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office said. Rain, which had already stopped, raised Wilson Creek 2 feet above normal levels and created ""very swift currents,"" according to a statement from the sheriff's department. Kayakers found Delilah's body nearly an hour after she disappeared, it said. Search and rescue crews found Alberdi on Sunday, about a quarter mile north of where they were first told he went into the water, according to LouAnne Kincaid, a spokeswoman for Caldwell County. Catawba County officials reported 10 swiftwater rescues for residents needing help getting out of their homes and vehicles Saturday afternoon, said Mark Pettit, an emergency official in the county. Some 52 roads in the inland county had been closed at that point, six of which might not see any traffic for as long as three months, according to Pettit. Lincoln County -- which is just south of Catawba County and about 35 miles northwest of Charlotte -- saw 8 to 10 inches of rain in 12 hours, county emergency management spokesman Dion Burleson said. First responders had done as many as five rescues by late Saturday afternoon, Burleson said, though things appeared to be on the upswing. The spokesman said the water rescue operation had been demobilized because waters were receding.","NEW: Search crews find body of a 48-year-old swimmer from Huntersville .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Diving into the clear blue water off Havana Friday, Penny Palfrey began her quest to swim from Cuba to the United States. The Australian-British dual citizen is swimming without a shark cage, snorkel, flippers or wet suit. Palfrey estimated the journey would cover 103 miles (166 kilometers), much of it through shark infested waters. ""I am excited, a little nervous,"" she told reporters Friday while slathering one last coat of thick sunblock on herself. ""I got about six hours of sleep last night, which is pretty good for the night before."" The swim could take anywhere from 40 to 60 hours, she estimated. Open-water swimming: Tips from the pros . If successful, Palfrey, 49, would surpass the record that she set in 2011 for the longest unassisted swim. Palfrey swam over 67 miles from Little Cayman island to Grand Cayman island. In 1997, fellow Australian swimmer Susie Malroney completed a Florida-to-Cuba swim but while inside a shark cage. In 2011, long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad twice tried but failed to complete the same journey. Nyad was waylaid by asthma attacks and stings from Atlantic box jellyfish. A Lycra suit will provide Palfrey some protection from the jellyfish, she said, and long cables called ""shark shields"" will be strung from the kayaks and boats around her to ward off larger predators. ""They emit an electric field through the water which, when a shark comes within five meters, it picks up the sensors on the snout but they don't like it. They swim away,"" Palfrey said as she prepared for the swim. Palfrey, who is a mother of three and grandmother of two, said she hopes that swimming in the wake of Tropical Storm Debby will provide her with calm seas. Diana Nyad abandons Cuba to Florida swim . A crew of 15, including medical personnel and meteorologists, will shadow her from boats and kayaks. She will stay nourished and hydrated by consuming a carbohydrate-rich drink every 30 minutes, she said. Even though she has completed long-distance swims of the English channel and a round-trip crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar, the waters between Cuba and the United States present unique hazards, she said. ""Each swim comes with its own challenges, this is a really big challenge; 103 miles is further than I have ever swum before,"" Palfrey said. ""I expect it to be very challenging but I am very excited."" Asked what would be the first thing she would want to do once she arrives in Florida, Palfrey didn't hesitate. ""IÃÂ¹ll want to get out of the water,"" she replied. Jellyfish, currents cut Nyad's second attempt short .","Australian Penny Palfrey, 49, is trying to swim from Havana, Cuba, to the Florida Keys .

"(CNN) -- Organizations today would never think of not investing in high growth markets like China and India. Yet they are still dragging their heels when it comes to investing in women, despite it being a win-win situation for the global economy, organizations and women themselves. This is not just a human rights issue -- it makes absolute business sense. Research conducted throughout the world shows gender balance in top positions contributes to improved competitiveness and better business performance. In Europe this week, issues around women's advancement and empowerment have been high on the agenda. The European Parliament's economic affairs committee voted down the nomination of Luxembourg's Yves Mersch to the European Central Bank board, calling for his candidacy to be withdrawn. It was a protest over the lack of women in top EU posts. Also, the EU's Justice Commissioner, Viviane Reding, who is intent to impose an EU-wide quota for women on supervisory boards, looks likely to have to go with a watered down proposal to be presented mid-November. Debate on these issues is important precisely because it puts the issue of gender inequality on the table. It draws attention to the danger of having so few women at the top and encourages focus on the improved business benefits of engaging women, for individual organizations and the economy as a whole. But business leaders cannot afford to be complacent and must demonstrate real progress. That's why I set up the CEO Champions initiative with our CEO, Jim Turley, and the Women's Forum for the Economy and Society. Change needs to be driven from the top of organizations, and peer groups like CEO Champions are so important because they are designed to create and gradually expand a group of leaders to act as champions of women's empowerment, helping to achieve what I like to call ""visibility with teeth."" What makes our peer group unique is our ability to take a strong leadership role in the broader global business community and form powerful coalitions. Looking ahead, we have much to learn from other successful initiatives like the 30% Club in the UK and Male Champions of Change in Australia. It is only through engaging with other groups and establishing greater visibility for CEO Champions that we can drive real change. What is clear is that business leaders must commit to champion change -- to be transparent about their goals for change, to align their incentives systems to drive the change, and to make sure their work environments are flexible in a way that allows men and women who choose to work to be able to achieve all of their potential. If they don't champion that change, they will be doing so at their own peril and quotas will be a public policy hammer of last resort. Over the next decade, the impact of women on the global economy -- as producers, entrepreneurs, employees and consumers -- will be at least as significant as that of China's or India's one-billion-plus populations, if not greater. If women's economic potential can be successfully harnessed and leveraged, it would be the equivalent of having an additional one billion individuals in business and in the workforce contributing to the global economy. It's for this reason that Ernst & Young has been involved in the Third Billion global campaign, which unites governments, NGOs, corporations, youth and others to partner toward ensuring women's access to legal protection, education and training, finance and markets. Just recently, Booz & Company published new data outlining compelling evidence that women can be powerful drivers of economic growth. Their estimates show that if female employment rates were to match male rates, overall GDP would grow significantly in the U.S. by 5%, in Japan by 9%, and in developing countries like Egypt by a massive 34%. The World Economic Forum also published their annual Global Gender Gap report -- the data suggests a strong correlation between those countries that are most successful at closing the gender gap and those that are the most economically competitive. Some companies are already investing in women and thereby betting on a brighter future -- for a workforce just waiting to blossom, for emerging economies whose development depends on this new talent, and, of course, for their own financial growth. In the current economic climate there really is no longer any excuse to not be investing in one of the largest untapped economic engines. You cannot flick a switch overnight but the private sector has a tremendous opportunity and responsibility to lead on these issues.","In Europe this week, issues around women's advancement and empowerment high on the agenda .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- Mike Steenkamp still wakes up in the morning expecting a phone call from his niece. That call never comes. ""It hasn't really sunk in to my way of thinking,"" he said. Steenkamp and his daughter Kim Martin told CNN this week that they aren't focusing on why Reeva Steenkamp is gone. She was shot and killed just three weeks ago by her boyfriend, Olympian and South African track star Oscar Pistorius. They are trying to avoid the speculation and debate that swirl around whether Pistorius intentionally shot and killed his 29-year-old girlfriend or whether he mistook her for an intruder. He's been charged with premeditated murder. Former lead detective on Pistorius case resigns . Mike Steenkamp said the family has no plans to attend Pistorius' trial. ""We won't be present, I can tell you that now,"" he said. That's because the family wants to focus on Reeva. ""I have to concentrate on her,"" Kim Martin explained. ""I know that sounds crazy, but that's how I get from day to day. ""It's easier to deal with it if you don't concentrate on anything else other than the fact that Reeva's not here, and at the end of the day, she's not coming back."" Kim Martin and Reeva Steenkamp were like sisters, she said, sharing every detail of their lives. Reeva frequently stayed at her cousin's Cape Town home where Mike Steenkamp says he can still picture Reeva in the kitchen, helping prepare dinner. Yet Martin said she only met Pistorius once, at a seaside cafe. She and Steenkamp chatted, catching up on their lives, as Martin settled her kids. Her interaction that day with Pistorius ""wasn't long enough to form an opinion on his personality."" ""What I saw of him ... he did seem like a nice guy,"" Martin said. Before Reeva Steenkamp started dating the man nicknamed ""Blade Runner"" for his lightning-fast prosthetic legs, she was famous in her own right. A law school graduate with a vibrant personality, she had a slew of modeling gigs under her belt and the striking, platinum-haired beauty had been gearing up for her reality television debut. Her growing exposure brought more opportunities. She served as a presenter for FashionTV in South Africa, was an FHM cover girl and was the face of cosmetics company Avon. FHM described her as a ""beautiful, intelligent and warm-hearted woman"" who had a ""wicked"" sense of humor. ""She was the kindest, sweetest human being; an angel on earth,"" said Capacity Relations, the agency that represented her. Yet, despite her fame, she was still her mother's baby girl, Mike Steenkamp recalled. Reeva's uncle told the story of when Oscar and Reeva were driving on a highway and Oscar, prone to fast cars, was supposedly speeding. ""(Reeva) phoned her mum and said ... 'Mum, Oscar's speeding,'"" Steenkamp recalled. ""So June took the phone and said, 'Let me speak to Oscar.' And (she) said to Oscar, 'Hey listen, that's my precious, and my only daughter ... she's my angel. And you'd better slow down or I will get the mafia onto you afterwards.' And Reeva said afterwards, 'Mum, he slowed down.'"" Now, Pistorius, 26, is free on bail as he awaits trial. His next court date is scheduled for June 4. Prosecutors say the track star killed his girlfriend after a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. Pistorius case brings attention to South African gun culture . Pistorius and his attorneys insist he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He says he fired in a fit of terror before realizing Steenkamp was inside. ""I'd like to ask Oscar why he didn't lean over and touch my cousin first... and say 'are you okay?' 'keep quiet,' 'I'm coming now,'"" Kim Martin said, shortly after her cousin's death. As for what happens to Pistorius, Mike Steenkamp said it doesn't matter. Nothing will bring back their beloved Reeva. But he does want one thing: a chance to meet with Pistorius and forgive him. ""That way, I can find more peace with the situation,"" he said, fighting back tears. Steenkamp says it's his Christian faith that prompts him to want to offer forgiveness. And he wants to do it face to face, not through the media. ""Whatever the outcome, I feel with my belief (that) if Christ could forgive me when he died on the cross, why can't I?""

"London (CNN) -- It sits in the ancient heart of Rome and is an emblem of the city's imperial history as well as an icon of Italy. But plans to restore Rome's nearly 2,000-year-old Colosseum are causing rumblings among heritage workers and restorers, compounded by reports in December that small amounts of powdery rock had fallen off the monument. The current $33 million (25 million euro) restoration plans to restore the Flavian amphitheater, which once hosted spectacular shows and gruesome gladiatorial battles, are being sponsored by Diego della Valle, of luxury Italian brand Tod's, in exchange for advertising rights. Restoration of the monument, which attracts up to two million visitors a year, is due to go ahead in March and will involve cleaning of the travertine exterior, the restoration of underground chambers, new gating, the moving of visitor service stations to an area outside of the building itself and increased video security. But members of the Restorers Association of Italy are unhappy about the plans, which they believe has sidelined them in favor of non-specialist restorers and which ""run the risk of causing irreparable damage to the monument,"" according to the group's President, Carla Tomasi. ""Having some of the best restorers in the world in Italy and yet turning to general enterprises is a choice that we do not share, and embarrasses both our work and the image of our nation in the world, in addition to causing risks to the monument,"" Tomasi said. A ruling given late December 2011 by Italy's Council of State in favor of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities is however allowing the restoration plans to go ahead. ""Italian law states that restorers can restore things like statues, ceramics, mosaics and decorative surfaces but not architecture,"" said Rossella Rea, Director of the Colosseum, adding that the workers employed to do the restorations are in fact ""specialized in architectural restoration, they're not just ordinary workmen."" Rea was also quick to stress that the reports of the Colosseum crumbling were false and that only 8cm of tuff -- a porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash -- had come off, something ""that happens all the time to monuments."" But she also added that the Colosseum has suffered in recent years from underfunding caused by government cuts and that the revenue from ticket sales only covers the yearly upkeep of the city's ancient sites, which include the nearby Forum and Palatine. Sponsorship, though difficult to obtain owing to sponsors having to pay VAT on donations, is much-needed. Sneska Quaedvlieg-Mihailovic is Secretary General of Europa Nostra, an organization dedicated to protecting cultural heritage in Europe. She said, ""We at Europa Nostra and anyone dealing with heritage would say that it's wonderful to have private companies and individuals wanting to support heritage at a time when public budgets are being cut."" But she also warned against governments across Europe loosening restrictions on restoration work in the current economic climate, and of privately funded restoration plans not complying with strict guidelines. And while the current Colosseum project aims to improve visitor services in addition to cleaning and restoring the amphitheater, Quaedvlieg-Mihailovic believes that its underlying problems also need to be addressed -- the main one being the car traffic that surrounds the site and causes the exterior to be tarnished with pollution. ""You can do wonderful restoration works but you haven't yet tackled the things that will continue to cause damage and this is an issue at the level of the urban management of the city,"" she said. ""It's a problem that's been discussed with the City of Rome for many years,"" said Rea, adding that she hopes that with the building of a new subway stop near the Colosseum, the roads around the site will be closed to cars -- though heritage workers have long complained that vibrations from the nearby subway trains are also damaging the building. It's an ongoing struggle, Rea said, but one she hopes will eventually be successful. After all, it's only been 60 years since people parked their cars inside the amphitheater.","Plans to restore ancient Roman Colosseum meet with anger from Italian Restorers Association .

"(CNN) -- It was early evening when Lee Ferrero got in his car to make the trip home from a meeting for work. He'd done the trip many times over the years, and he looked forward to the drive. Several hours later he found himself in open farmland in unfamiliar territory. He pulled over, brought out a book of maps, and realized he'd driven two hours past the turnoff to his home in Los Osos, California. ""It was terrifying,"" he remembers now. ""I thought, I didn't mean to come here. How did this happen? I just zoned out."" But he wasn't just zoning out. A visit to the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, showed Ferrero was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's disease, a form of dementia. ""That car ride was a real wake-up call,"" he says. After his trip to Mayo, Ferrero's wife insisted he get a professional driving evaluation to make sure he was safe to drive. His driving was fine -- the only problem was that he might wander off again down the road. It has been five years since that fateful car trip. The disease forced Ferrero, an Air Force veteran, to retire from his position as president and CEO of the Private Industry Council of San Luis Obispo County. Now 64, he doesn't want to sit home all the time, and still drives and walks around. To decrease the chance he'll wander again, Ferrero writes down exactly where he's going so he can refer to it later, and he wears an ID bracelet with a 24-hour emergency response number. He hasn't had another wandering incident, but knows he might at some point as his disease progresses. ""I forget things I never used to forget and I know it's only going to get worse,"" he says. November is National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month and Family Caregiver Month. About 60% of the nation's 5 million Alzheimer's patients will wander, according to Beth Kallmyer, senior director of constituent services at the Alzheimer's Association. ""This is such a big worry for families,"" she says. ""We tell them their loved ones can wander off at any time, even when you just go into the kitchen for a minute to start dinner."" Kallmyer advises families that there's no way to keep an eye on someone 24-7, but that there are some steps they can take to decrease the chances their loved one will wander. 1. Keep wandering top of mind . Sometimes families are surprised when their loved one wanders. Lawrence Schonfeld, an Alzheimer's expert, has noticed sometimes families forget that wandering is a huge risk because they're so overwhelmed with other aspects of Alzheimer's disease. That can be a fatal mistake. ""Families are worried their loved one will leave the stove on in the kitchen, or they're annoyed when their loved one asks the same question over and over again,"" he says. ""Wandering isn't always their major concern."" 2. Pick up on the red flags of wandering . Wandering can happen at any time, but it's more likely in certain situations, such as when someone with dementia is in unfamiliar surroundings. People with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia often leave clues that they're about to wander. If your loved one says, ""It's time to go to work,"" she might truly be headed out the door in a few minutes. ""I want to go home"" might mean he's about to go in search of his childhood home, and you have to stop him. 3. Distract them . Don't say ""Dad, you haven't worked in 30 years,"" or ""Mom, you're already at home."" Reasoning won't work. Instead, distract. ""If they say they want to go to work, tell them 'OK let's go see if we can find your shoes,'"" Schonfeld suggests. ""By the time they get their shoes on they'll have forgotten about going to work."" 4. Block (or disguise) the exits . For safety reasons, you should never lock or trap a person with dementia in a home alone. If someone is there with them you can block the doors. There also are screens you can buy that look like, say, library books, so your loved one won't realize it's in front of a door. You can also put a lock toward the bottom of the door; Kallmyer says people with dementia won't think to look for a lock in such an unusual place. Another idea: Put a mirror or a stop sign on the door, or you can try putting a dark rug in front of the door. People with late-stage dementia might think it's a hole and won't go near it. 5. Label your rooms . Sometimes people with dementia will go wandering off in search of the bathroom or a glass of water and get distracted and actually leave the house. The Mayo Clinic suggests putting a picture of a toilet on the door to the bathroom or food on the door to the kitchen, so they can more easily find what they need. 6. Keep them busy . ""Sometimes people wander out of boredom, or because no one's paying attention to them,"" Kallmyer says. ""Spending a lot of time watching TV isn't good. Have them wash dishes with you, or fold clothes."" You can also enroll your loved one in an adult day care program so they'll have interesting activities. Seniorresource.com and Eldercare Locator have search tools for finding a program near you. 7. Take a walk . ""Have them take a walk or exercise with you,"" Schonfeld suggests. ""They may be so tired afterwards they'll want to sit for a while."" Even if they're not tired, the social engagement of the walk might be enough to keep them from wandering in search of company. 8. Provide safe wandering . Create a path through the rooms of your house as a place for your loved one to wander, or a circular trail through a fenced backyard, the Mayo Clinic advises. 9. Consider technology . Some devices alert you if a door is open in the house. Others tell you if your loved one has wandered beyond a certain area. You can even attach a GPS to your loved one and then go online to find him on a map; the GPS might be on a bracelet or in a shoe. The Alzheimer's Association has an overview of electronic devices that can help keep track of Alzheimer's patients, and the association also has information about the ComfortZone and other safety products it sells. American Health Assistance Fund has a partial listing of companies that sell safety products. These devices can be expensive and some have a monthly service fee. 10. Find the right facility . Many families aren't sure they can safely keep their loved one with dementia at home. The Alzheimer's Association has a guide to determining what kind of care you need, and a guide for finding nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Schonfeld recommends you check out a facility to see whether it has any complaints against it, especially those that involve wandering. The National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center has a list of state ombudsmans' offices, which can help you find the complaints. Be sure to ask the right questions. ""Is the door monitored, either electronically or by staff?"" Schonfeld says. ""Do they have electronic devices to keep track of people who wander? And ask about their strategy for what they do if someone does wander off."" Aaron Cooper and John Bonifield contributed to this report.","November is National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month .

"(CNN) -- Drew Manning thought he had the body of the ideal man: 6 feet 2 inches of tanned musculature, sculpted arms and washboard abs that narrowed to a firm, 34-inch waist. His perfectly chiseled body was hairless due to regular ""manscaping."" People assumed he worked out three hours a day, seven days a week, but the 31-year-old personal trainer said nutrition was really the key to his dream body. As for working out, he indulged in his favorite activity for only about 45 minutes a day, four to five days a week. Then, Manning's once impressive muscles softened to pounds of bloated fat -- on purpose. Manning, a personal trainer, decided to gain nearly 70 pounds so he could better understand how his clients feel. He then planned to lose the weight to show that no matter the numbers they faced, others could get fit, too. He called it his ""Fit 2 Fat 2 Fit"" campaign, and documented it on a blog, and a book that debuts in June. He expected some physical discomfort, but the emotional struggle -- and judgment from others -- surprised him. As he loaded sugary cereals and soft drinks from his cart at the local grocery store one day, he caught three women staring at him, then sliding their eyes to the food he was buying. ""'I'm doing this as an experiment! I used to be a fit guy, not the fat guy,'"" Manning wanted to turn around and explain. ""I'm a lot more self-conscious now. There was a total lack of confidence in the way I felt in public because I wasn't the fit guy anymore."" The female form has long been the topic of discussions about self-esteem, but what about men? Their ideas about weight, body image and self-esteem have been largely swept under the ambiguous rug of masculinity. Meanwhile, changing standards about the ideal male form can leave them overwhelmed and exhausted by the chase for perfection, too. Men don't talk about it as much, health experts say, but that doesn't mean they're not thinking about it, whether they're ultra-fit or kind of fat. ""Men are still taught as boys that the body is something that is designed to be a perfectly performing machine, not something to be cared for and nurtured,"" said Michael Addis, professor of psychology at Clark University and author of ""Invisible Men."" ""But men base self-esteem on body image and weight."" Inside the man in the mirror . As a professor for 17 years and counting, Addis has observed how the male college students in his classes have changed and adapted to shifting cultural norms. In recent years, more of them spend time in the gym, focus on their appearance and monitor body mass. Most aren't trying to lose weight -- they're documenting their physique, he said. It's a far cry from the male celebrities of the 1950s -- think Spencer Tracey or Robert Mitchum -- who wore their heftiness as a sign of financial success or a way to demonstrate masculinity, Addis said. He attributes the change to shifting gender roles. ""As women gain more financial power in society, men are expected to bring more to the table,"" Addis said. ""In addition to being financially successful, they need to be well-groomed, in good shape, emotionally skilled in relationships and the emphasis on looking good is just part of the bigger package -- the stakes have been raised."" Some psychologists and trend watchers said the male muscle obsession only grew during the last few years. As the economy struggled, men were sent looking for aspects of their lives they could define and control. Body image is, at times, the only thing. ""Men can't control how much money they make or their employment situation, but they can control how they look. It can create this obsessiveness,"" said Sarah Toland, senior health editor for Men's Journal. James Mahalik, a psychology professor at Boston College, said some men develop powerful, physically intimidating bodies as a display of masculinity in face of threats. But becoming a father pushes some men to lead healthier lives -- and as a consequence, develop a healthier-looking body, too. ""One very important role for men, in terms of how they're masculine, is their role as fathers,"" Mahalik said. ""You can make health more salient to men and connect it to their sense of masculinity by appealing to fulfilling the role of being a father."" But in a world of changing ideals and rising obesity rates, what is it they're all idealizing? The new physical ideal . Lately, big and bulky has been pushed to the wayside, and the swimmer's physique reigns supreme, editors of men's magazines and websites say. The male silhouette landing on magazine covers and action flicks is tall, lean, agile and fit. It's a physique that's more attainable for most men than the beefy-torso-and-chicken-leg look of the past. ""Our readers want the concept that this body is natural,"" said Toland. ""A body that is inspired by nature, rather than machine, supplement or wealth to be able to buy you that body."" ""Our ideal male wants to look like he is healthy and confident, but not perfectly coiffed or manicured,"" said Sandra Nygaard, senior fashion and grooming editor of Men's Health. ""He wants to look well-maintained. ""That's the real ideal: They want to look great, but they don't want to look like they spend too much time on it -- but they know they need to spend time on it."" Nygaard points to actor Ryan Reynolds as an example of making the effortless look like an art form -- always the right amount of scruff and perfectly tousled hair, even if they use a beard trimmer to shave down scruff and pomade for the slept-in look. Actors like Ryan Gosling, Zac Efron and Justin Timberlake are constantly seen sporting tailored suits. Rather than the clothes themselves, it is the fit that displays the effort they put into their appearance, and this is showing up in the workplace as well. This is the result of what some call the ""'Mad Men' revival"" -- the return of pomade, polish and of the perfectly cut suit. It stays within the boundaries of masculinity while offering men the option of looking their best. ""Men are seeing grooming not as an extra, but an essential,"" Nygaard said. Current trends might make topics like health and grooming more approachable for men while promoting a healthier ideal, but psychologists Mahalik and Addis don't expect body image to become a big topic among guys. But Drew Manning has been hearing plenty about it. As he put on 70 pounds as part of his experiment, he said he often received e-mails from ""typical American men,"" former high school and college athletes who stopped caring for their health and bodies after school or marriage. Manning said he believes they fell prey to the ""masculine marketing"" of fast food and beer. ""At one point in their life, a majority of men were fit, whether it was in elementary school or high school,"" he said, ""Then life gets busy."" He said he realizes now how obsessed he was with a physical ideal, and what it feels like to be so many pounds away from it; Manning is still taking the weight off. His friends, family and wife understood he wouldn't be overweight forever. But he has gained empathy for his personal training clients, and a new understanding of strangers who stared at a man approaching 265 pounds. ""Maybe I was on the other side of it before,"" Manning said. ""Maybe I was more judgmental before I went through this whole thing.""","The new male ideal does not reflect the typical American male .
A revival of standards is making men more comfortable with their appearance and masculinity .
The swimmer's physique, a long, lean look, is becoming the new ideal ."
"(CNN) -- A young boy in a photograph holds a cigarette while sitting cross-legged on a dirt road. We don't know his name, but it's clear by his face his life is full of pain and struggle. In another picture, a mother sits on a rock clutching a barefoot child. Their faces offer a stark contrast: She looks away, concerned and distraught while he stares at the camera with an inquisitive gaze, trying to make sense of it all. A third dramatic image is striking. With laser-like focus, a boy who looks to be about 6 wearing a bright red sweater shoots the photographer a hardened look. It's the face of someone older than his years. These photographs -- depicting the lives of Mideast street children -- were taken by children. It's part of a unique project dubbed Capturing Neverland. Founder Sara Khazem has learned that these young photographers' own lives are not that different from the children they photograph. A photographer herself, Khazem launched Capturing Neverland in Lebanon when she was just 22 years old, fueled by her passion for photography and her inspiration to helpÂ underprivilegedÂ children. While growing up in Beirut, she would see street children cleaning the windshield of her parents' car and would wonder, ""Why am I so different from them?"" Eventually that question spurred her desire to help street children by teaching them a skill: photography. ""I realized I can give them a camera and hopefully that will impact their lives -- just like the way camera has impacted my life when I received a camera from my mentor,"" Khazem, now 26, told CNN via Skype. ""Being young has really helped me get through to the kids, they feel that we are close in age and that makes them a lot more comfortable with me, which ultimately gets them more responsive in the workshop."" In a nutshell, Khazem's 10-day workshop teaches photography skills toÂ underprivilegedÂ street children and orphans. The project offers an escape from their stressful concerns of street survival andÂ a rare opportunity to develop their artistic talents. For many of these children, this is their first time even holding a camera. One of the program's teaching exercises involves taking at least 100 photos of a single object. This forces the young students to think about differentÂ perspectivesÂ and varied styles of shots. And it pushes them to see the subjects of their photos more creatively. ""I gave one a guitar once,"" Khazem said. ""I gave one a cross. I gave one an egg .... they broke the eggs."" They are -- after all -- still kids. Khazem decided to conduct her first workshop in Egypt where, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration in Cairo, there are an estimated 2 million children living on the streets. Several are subjected to begging, human trafficking and drug abuse before even reaching age 14. Worldwide, exact statistics are difficult to come by, but the United Nations has estimated the number of street children in the tens of millions -- perhaps around 100 million. The children of Capturing Neverland range from eight to 16 years old. Most of them, Khazem said, have been found either living in shelters run by non-governmental organizations or on the streets. Many have been abandoned by their parents, and some don't even know who their parents are. Some were born into their lives on the streets, and have never had a place to call home. ""I dealt with a couple of kids that were actually second generation off the street and that was really different,"" Khazem said. At the conclusion of the workshop, a gallery of the children's work is set up to display their once-hidden talents. The experience of having their images seen and appreciated by the public is entirely new for these young artists. ""I love being a photographer who can show the world what I see,"" wrote one of the children. ""They might not listen to me, but they can see like me when they look at my photos."" The conclusion of the workshop doesn't necessarily mean the children will end their exploration of photography. They return to their shelters and caregivers with their shiny new cameras in hand to continue learning about their craft. In a few cases, the program has paved the way to future employment. Some of Khazem's former students are now getting jobs working as freelance photographers. Another was shortlisted in a photography competition for children hosted by National Geographic. Related: Help for Syria's children . The program is ongoing. Last March Khazem conducted her sixth workshop -- this time in Marrakesh, Morocco -- working with another nongovernmental organization like her own that helpsÂ underprivilegedÂ children. Thirteen children participated in that two-week project. Several discovered a new outlet for their creativity. ""They learned the importance of photography, not just as an art but as a tool to self-expression,"" Khazem said. ""They have also gained self-confidence as the gallery provides a space for them to be acknowledged by the audience for their artistic talent."" That's evident from what some of the children said after finishing the program. ""I learned that saying what I think or feel is a good thing -- not bad thing,"" one child wrote in an e-mail. ""I also learned that I can tell a story with one picture. I cannot write very well, but I can now take photos and tell stories.""

"(CNN) -- Singer Usher Raymond's ex-wife is asking a judge to give her custody of their two children after the oldest suffered a ""near-death accident."" Five-year-old Usher Raymond V nearly drowned ""in a swimming pool and is currently hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital,"" Tameka Foster said in an emergency motion filed Tuesday in a Fulton County, Georgia, court. Her son ""is doing much better,"" according to a Twitter posting by Foster on Wednesday afternoon. The mother has been with him at the hospital since she learned of the accident Monday, her lawyer told CNN. A hearing is set for an Atlanta courtroom Friday afternoon for the motion, her lawyer said. The other child, Naviyd, is 4 years old. In a statement released Wednesday, Usher said: ""I am blessed and fortunate to say that my son Usher V is doing well and is recovering. I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of prayers, love and support for my family's well-being."" The singer did not address his ex-wife's allegations or the upcoming hearing. Usher won primary custody of the children last year after a bitter court fight in which Foster accused the singer of being an absentee father. Foster renewed her arguments based on Monday's accident, contending the singer ""continues to excessively travel, utilizes third-party caregivers to supervise the minor children rather than personally exercising parenting time and providing supervision for the minor children."" Usher is ""not capable of providing daily caregiving and supervision for the minor children of the parties as petitioner is preparing to film a movie in Panama and has ongoing commitments that require his presence in Los Angeles, New York and various other cities for the Voice and his upcoming album."" Her motion alleges that Usher is away from Atlanta -- where she and the children live -- ""in excess of 85% of each month."" He refuses to let her see the children when he leaves town, saying he ""would rather the nanny raise the children,"" Foster contends. Foster also complained that her ex-husband does not talk to her about issues affecting the boys, ""including school enrollment and summer activities."" The private school in which he just enrolled them is more than an hour from her home, she said. And, Usher has not given her the phone number to the home he moved to with the children in June, she said. Foster's tweets posted Wednesday read: ""Cabin fever.. But I'm so happy to say that my son is doing much better. Talking & asking for food. Thank you for ur well wishes & prayers."" and ""....And no I haven't gone anywhere or done anything. #Relax"" Foster blames the swimming accident on ""the negligence and failure to properly supervise"" the children. Usher's aunt was in charge of the children when the oldest son ""suffered a near-death accident while left unsupervised in a swimming pool,"" the motion contends. ""I need an ambulance,"" his aunt, Rena Oden, told an emergency operator in a call to 911. ""My nephew was in the pool, and I couldn't get him, I tried to get him."" A recording of the call was made public by police Tuesday. The aunt, a housekeeper and another woman were ""unsuccessful in pulling the victim from the pool drain,"" but two men who were installing sound equipment in the home rushed to help, the report said. ""They're doing CPR on him now,"" Oden told the operator. ""Is he coming around? He's breathing!"" Sound technician Eugene Stachurski rescued the child from the drain and used CPR to revive him on the side of the pool, the police report said. About five minutes into the recording, Oden told the operator that paramedics had arrived at the home and had taken over. The child was ""conscious, alert and breathing"" when the ambulance took him to a hospital, where he was kept overnight for observation, the police report said. Usher's former stepson -- also Foster's son -- died in a watercraft accident on a north Georgia lake last year. CNN's Tory Dunnan and Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report.","NEW: Usher says his son is ""doing well and is recovering""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an ""unprecedented"" federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said Thursday. A three-judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by December 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if California does not report on its progress every two weeks, Thursday's ruling said. California has the nation's largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding. The case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. When plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three-judge court panel in November 2006, California's prisons were at 202% of design capacity. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a three-judge federal panel's determination that California's medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding. The Supreme Court in 2011 found that California's shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in ""needless suffering and death"" and recognized the federal court's prison reduction order was ""of unprecedented sweep and extent,"" Thursday's ruling said. The high court affirmed that order in full in 2011. On Thursday, the three U.S. District Court judges expressed impatience with California officials, the defendants in the case. ""The history of this litigation is of defendants' repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system,"" the order said. ""It is defendants' unwillingness to comply with this Court's orders that requires us to order additional relief today."" The three-judge panel added that the plaintiffs' request for a court order to show why California shouldn't be held in contempt ""has considerable merit."" ""Our first priority, however, is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the California prison system,"" the three judges said in their ruling. ""We will therefore DEFER ruling on plaintiffs' motion, and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants' prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order."" Court documents also show that ""DEFER"" was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face.","Gov. Jerry Brown will seek a stay of what he calls ""unprecedented"" court order .

"(CNN) -- Several of them suffered property losses in Superstorm Sandy. One is the daughter of a man who helped write New Jersey's lottery law. All are feeling extremely lucky. Sixteen New Jersey co-workers who jointly held one of three tickets that won last week's $448 million Powerball jackpot came forward publicly Tuesday. Dubbed the ""Ocean's 16"" -- they work for the Ocean County vehicle maintenance facility -- the group claims $86 million, or one third of the jackpot's cash-option value. After federal and state taxes, each group member will get $3.8 million. One is Darlene Riccio, who told reporters that last year's monster storm forced she and her daughter to move from their rented home of five years in Brick, New Jersey, to an apartment above a storefront. The first thing she's going to do: ""Buy me and my daughter a home and bring my dog back home."" ""It has been an extremely rough year,"" Riccio said at the group's news conference in Toms River. ""When we lost everything, this whole group here -- and everybody I worked with -- really pulled together and helped me through. This has been like a great family for me. We have a bond now."" Several others raised their hands when asked whether they suffered losses in the storm, which the federal government has said is expected to rank as the second-costliest tropical cyclone on record, after Hurricane Katrina. Another winner, Barbara Jo Riivald, is a daughter of the late state Sen. John Brown -- ""the father of the New Jersey Lottery,"" as state lottery Executive Director Carol Hedinger put it. Riivald's father, who died in 2011, sponsored the law that led to the debut of the state lottery in 1970. ""When we actually hit this lottery, not even in my mind did I remember my father was the father of the lottery,"" Riivald said. ""When I called my sister to tell her, she said, 'Oh my gosh, Barb. Dad is just smiling down.' She said, 'It's his lottery.' ""The only thing I wanted to do that next morning was pick up the phone and call him and call my mom (who also died recently). And then I realized I couldn't do that,"" she said. ""But this is a really special moment."" Sixty people work at the Toms River facility, though only the 16 pooled their money together. Group members said they bought lottery tickets together for about five years, but only when jackpots were big. Lisa Presutto bought 48 tickets for the group last week, purchasing them at an Acme Market in Little Egg Harbor. As she checked the winning numbers with her coffee Thursday morning, she ""immediately started shaking"" when she saw one of her tickets match. She needed someone to check it. ""I ... had to wake my poor husband up -- who was no longer poor,"" Presutto said. All 16 returned to work after winning. But one co-winner, Joseph Odoardo, raised his hand Tuesday when asked whether any of them are going to retire now. ""After 34 years and almost retiring last year, this happens, and you just don't have another choice,"" he said. Co-winner William Seeley wore a ""Duck Dynasty""-themed T-shirt and rather looked and talked like the A&E show's stars. Wearing a long beard, he said he was ""Happy, happy, happy"" in the style of the program's patriarch, Phil Robertson. Seeley said he lost his mother to cancer last year, and his dad is suffering from it now. ""That's ... the first place I stopped, was Pop's house. Started crying in front of him and told him I loved him and you got nothing to worry about now except getting better,"" Seeley said. The other winners are: Ralston Chalfant Jr.; Peter Cherkos; Joseph D'Angelo; June Delgado; Robert Heinen; Dorothy Kulina; Tabitha Long; Brian McCarthy; Susan Nickel; Eleine Sanchez; and Donna Cinque-Stasse. An electrical engineer in Minnesota came forward on Thursday to claim his one-third stake. The holder of the other ticket -- also sold in New Jersey -- has yet to come forward. The all-time largest U.S. jackpot was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs $2.","16 co-workers at N.J. vehicle maintenance facility hold one of three winning tickets .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of Russians hit the streets of Moscow on Sunday, rallying to promote peace and equality in response to a rash of ethnic violence and unrest, state-run media reported. The ""Moscow for Everyone"" demonstration in Pushkin Square drew about 1,500 participants, according to RIA Novosti. ""People who came here do not intend to put up with the events that occurred in Moscow on December 11 and 15,"" said Viktor Shenderovich, one of the event's organizers. ""I believe the riots in Moscow were caused by pus that burst out."" Police officers set up metal detectors around the square, checking for knives and other weapons in a bid to avoid a repeat of street violence earlier this month. The turmoil began in southern Moscow, with the death of Yegor Sviridov, 28, a Kyrgyzstan migrant who authorities said was killed in a brawl with migrants from Russia's North Caucasus region on December 6. Five days later, about 5,000 nationalists and ""football hooligans"" clashed with Moscow police as an unsanctioned nationalist-tinged mass memorial for a fellow supporter turned violent, according to state media. The confrontations took place in Manezh Square, outside the Kremlin, and led to the arrests of 65 Spartak Moscow fans for ""disobedience,"" Moscow police spokesman Viktor Biryukov said, according to the official Russian news agency Itar-Tass. The head of the Spartak Moscow fan club has told RIA Novosti that the showdown had nothing to do with sports but, instead, was rooted in problems in Russian society. Then, on December 15, police arrested more than 200 people in downtown Moscow four days later and seized weapons in a bid to prevent clashes between ethnic Russians and members of Caucasus ethnic groups, Russian news agencies reported. Ilya Kubrakov, suspected of being the riots' ringleader, and three others were arrested December 17 for their role in Sviridov's death, a Moscow court announced, according to RIA Novosti. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has blamed the rash of ethnic violence on investigators who released suspects in Sviridov's death, the news agency reported. Medvedev called on authorities to take measures to punish those responsible for the crime.","About 1,500 people attend the ""Moscow for Everyone"" rally, state-run media reports .

"Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) -- Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mahatma Gandhi. They're names you might associate with protest and peace ... less so skateboarding. But the faces of all three can be found gracing the boards created by South African Kent Lingeveldt. The boards are part of the ""Local Legends"" series produced by Lingeveldt from his Cape Town workshop -- with Gandhi included alongside Mandela and Tutu because of the years he spent in South Africa campaigning for the rights of its Indian population. And Lingeveldt says that when he presented the Tutu board to the man whose face adorns it, the Nobel Peace Laureate was so taken with the gift that he decided to hang it inside his office. Bringing boards to life . Lingeveldt specializes in making longboards -- a lengthier variant of the traditional skateboard. Completely self taught, he has gained fame for bringing customized decks to life. As founder of Cape Town-based brand Alpha Longboards, he's equipped scores of local and international riders with distinctive personalized boards. Working together with local illustrators, who decorate the boards with their eye-catching artwork, Lingeveldt prides himself on customization. No two boards are the same, as each creation is tailored to the specific needs of each client -- taking into account everything from their height and shoe size to their skating ability and personal goals. Read this: Artists take epic Africa road trip . ""I can't make a board for someone I don't know,"" he says from inside his small workshop in Woodstock. ""I want clients to come to me and then I actually customize something right for you. I don't want you to walk out of a shop with an Alpha Longboard and be like, 'oh, this isn't what I need.'"" 'Shedding new light' But Lingeveldt has also found success through his other great passion, photography. ""First and foremost I would imagine myself to be a street photographer,"" says Lingeveldt, who first started experimenting with taking pictures when he was 18. ""I look for stories in movements and people's reactions and responses and just how we all work together."" Read this: Hollywood classics get photographic remake . Always carrying his camera with him wherever he went, Lingeveldt decided a few years ago to begin shooting images professionally. Since then, his striking street images have been shown in exhibitions both at home and abroad. ""I won the Market Photo Workshop's Social Landscapes Contest last year, and I was like, wow, look at this,"" he says. ""You know, someone who didn't have any training to win probably the most prestigious photo school in the country, which is cool."" Skating with ease between longboarding and photography, Lingeveldt is making the best of the two worlds. ""When I skateboard I see the world differently,"" he says. ""Like you see the small finer details of the streets, of the city and I'm like, 'wow.' I see so many different things that other people don't necessarily see,"" adds Lingeveldt.

"(CNN) -- A judge ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit from a former member of Lady Gaga's entourage who alleges the pop star failed to pay her overtime wages can move to trial. Judge Paul G. Gardephe of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York set the trial date for November 4. In her lawsuit, Jennifer O'Neill says that she worked ""24/7"" as Gaga's personal assistant. O'Neill was employed in early 2009, and again from February 2010 to March 2011. After she was rehired, she was told her annual salary would be $75,000. O'Neill is seeking to recover more than $350,000 in unpaid wages.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is expected to make a statement Thursday on the partisan standoff over how best to extend the expiring payroll tax cut, according to the White House. Obama will be joined by ""Americans who would see their taxes go up if the House Republicans fail to act,"" the White House said. Some of those people have participated in Obama's social media campaign highlighting what a $40 loss to a paycheck can mean to the average American. Wednesday, the president called House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to discuss the impasse, the White House said. A two-month extension passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support by the Democratic-controlled Senate ""is the only option to ensure that middle class families aren't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full year solution,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. Earlier in the day, Boehner, R-Ohio, and House GOP negotiators urged Democrats to restart talks on the matter, with the goal of an immediate one-year extension. ""We're here. We're ready to work,"" Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill. ""We can resolve these differences ... and give the American people a real Christmas present."" During their phone call, Boehner told Obama that House Republicans were ""elected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year,"" an aide to the speaker said. At stake: A tax cut for 160 million Americans, as well as extended emergency federal unemployment benefits and the so-called ""doc fix,"" a delay in significant scheduled pay cuts to Medicare physicians. All three measures are currently scheduled to expire December 31. Despite mounting pressure on House Republicans to give in and pass a short-term extension, a well- placed House GOP source indicated his side would not consider an end-game to the standoff until next week, just days before the deadline for taxes to go up. White House: Congress inaction a threat to the economy . A growing number of political observers believe Democrats hold the political high ground in the struggle, and that Republicans are in the midst of squandering their long-held advantage on the tax issue. On Saturday, the Senate voted 89-10 to approve two additional months for all three programs. The idea, leaders have repeatedly said, is to buy more time to hammer out a longer-term deal. The conservative House GOP caucus, however, revolted against that blueprint, calling it an inadequate patchwork plan that will create more economic instability and do little to create jobs. On Tuesday, the House voted 229-193 on a virtual party-line basis to express its disagreement with the Senate plan and call for the creation of a House-Senate conference committee to resolve the matter -- something already ruled out by Reid, D-Nevada. The $33 billion ""bipartisan compromise that was reached on Saturday is the only viable way to prevent a tax hike on January 1,"" Obama said after the House vote. ""It's the only one."" The House also approved a separate resolution supporting a year-long extension of both the payroll tax cut and emergency unemployment benefits, along with a new, two-year doc fix. There is no indication, however, that congressional negotiators would be able to reach a bipartisan agreement by the end of the year. Further complicating matters is the fact that the Senate has adjourned for the year. Most House members also left Washington after Tuesday's vote. Dispute creates GOP split between House and Senate . Boehner released a public letter to Obama Tuesday urging him to order the Senate back from its holiday break to take part in further talks -- a gesture immediately rejected by the White House. In a symbolic move, Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Democratic leadership, walked onto the floor of a virtually empty House chamber Wednesday morning to call for the House to hold a direct, up-or-down vote on the bipartisan Senate plan. Boehner prevented a direct vote on the Senate bill Tuesday, signaling that House GOP leaders may lack enough Republican support to defeat it in the face of unrelenting pressure from the White House, congressional Democrats and some Senate Republicans. The Wall Street Journal -- always a critical sounding board for conservatives -- blasted Boehner and his House GOP colleagues in an editorial Wednesday, arguing that they had ""achieved the small miracle of letting Mr. Obama position himself as an election-year tax cutter."" ""At this stage, Republicans would do best to cut their losses and find a way to extend the payroll holiday quickly,"" the paper's editorial writers said. ""Then go home and return in January with a united House-Senate strategy that forces Democrats to make specific policy choices that highlight the differences between the parties on spending, taxes and regulation. ... The alternative is more chaotic retreat and the return of all-Democratic rule."" Asked to respond to the editorial, Boehner insisted that the GOP remains ""the party of lower taxes for the American people."" Boehner's response did not appear to stem a rising tide of criticism from his Senate counterparts. ""The House Republicans have painted themselves into a corner. They are on their own,"" a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN Wednesday. ""This is a lose-lose situation for us. (House Republicans) let the Democrats get the messaging advantage and, more specifically, we've turned one of our key issues on its head. The Republicans look like they are the ones blocking tax relief."" ""When you are arguing process, you are losing, by definition,"" the aide said. ""We are arguing process while they've got politics on their side."" A number of Republicans have said the party should have declared victory after winning an agreement by Obama -- as part of the payroll tax cut package -- to make a decision within the next 60 days on whether to proceed with the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Republicans and some Democratic union leaders say the controversial pipeline will create thousands of new jobs; critics question its environmental impact. According to House Republican sources, their strategy is now to generate as much news coverage as possible of their eight appointed conferees in coming days to keep the pressure on Democrats to negotiate.

"(CNN) -- NBA star Derrick Rose has spoken out about gun crime in his hometown of Chicago and identified poverty as its root cause. The Chicago police department recorded 506 murders in 2012 -- with estimates that about 80 percent were gang related, while there have been 185 murders on record up until July 3rd this year. ""It all starts out from poverty,"" Rose, who grew up in the city's impoverished South Side district of Englewood, told CNN. For Chicago, 7 weekend homicides represent progress . ""People are just surviving. People are just really trying to get out. ""If you look at the world we're living in today, everything's just getting faster. You want success faster, you want internet faster, and everything is getting faster, so of course, you being human, you want a lifestyle even faster. ""You see people being famous off YouTube; you think you could be that next person, so that creates havoc."" Rose's family shielded him from trouble as a young boy, having recognized his burgeoning basketball talent. After a stellar High School and college career as a point guard, Rose was the first pick for the Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA draft. He went on to be named the NBA rookie of the year in 2009 -- an honor shared by former Bull Michael Jordan. The 24-year-old Rose recognizes part of his responsibilities as a successful sportsman is to be a role model for the next generation growing up in difficult circumstances. ""I'm young, but for some reason, people tend to listen to me, especially the younger kids,"" Rose, who exudes a shy but friendly demeanor, continued. ""Just knowing where I grew up and what I had to go through to get where I'm at today. Being a role model, of course, that's what I try to do. ""I try to stay positive, just really trying to bring hope to my city, where of course, we're going through so much stuff with crime. ""I'm just trying to bring that positive energy back, bring that excitement back, so that we can get it back on the right track."" Presidential problem . President Barack Obama has also spoken with concern about the problems of gun crime and poverty in Chicago -- home to his private residence. The problems were brought into sharp focus in January when 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was shot dead in Chicago just a week after taking part in the President's inauguration ceremony. The death came as Obama's administration has been focused on reducing gun violence, especially the killing of children, after the December 14 elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Pendleton was killed in Hyde Park neighborhood near Obama's Chicago home. Career criminal charged with killing 6-month-old baby . A recent study by the Pew Research Center study found U.S. gun homicides have leveled out the past 20 years. While political solutions can take a long time, Rose -- who is on the road promoting basketball and meeting his fans on a world tour of Europe and Asia as he recovers from knee surgery -- has been focusing on what he can do to help the situation in his home city. ""For me, all I could do is, like I said, stay positive, know that it's people watching me -- young kids looking up to me,"" Rose said. ""Just give them a reason to go out there and work hard and know that the reason they're working hard is to help people.""","Chicago gun crime ""starts out with poverty,"" says NBA star Derrick Rose .

"(CNN) -- Issues with its planes' emergency exit slides prompted Allegiant Air to put most of its fleet out of service Friday, wreaking havoc with its flight schedule as the carrier rushed to shuffle passengers and gets its aircraft in compliance. In a press release, Allegiant explained that a ""compliance issue"" on its MD-80 planes prompted it to order the ""immediate inspection and overhaul"" of most of its emergency slides. That left all 52 of Allegiant's MD-80 planes out of service at one point, though by late afternoon 18 of those aircraft plus its six Boeing 757 jetliners and three Airbus A319s were operational. This forced Allegiant to juggle its schedule, pushing back 16 flights to Saturday, canceling two altogether and causing various delays, according to airline spokesman Brian Davis. After all this,103 of Allegiant's 121 flights Friday eventually headed to their destinations. The headaches began Monday, when smoke detectors went off on an Allegiant flight destined for Peoria, Illinois, as it was taxiing from the terminal to the runway at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport. The pilot decided to evacuate the 144 passengers and six crew members using the aircraft's emergency exit slides -- something that they did successfully, said Davis. When reviewing this incident, Allegiant officials noticed a discrepancy between its practice of overhauling its MD-80 slides every three years with the manufacturer and Boeing's recommendations -- which Allegiant views as requirements -- that it happen every year. ""That meant we were not in compliance, so we took every aircraft out of service,"" Davis said, insisting there was never an indication any slides were unsafe or not working properly. This process began overnight Thursday. Initial checks revealed that 14 of the company's MD-80s were compliant (because they had gotten new slides, four for each plane, within the past year) and could fly, according to Davis. By Saturday -- typically a light day for Allegiant, which caters largely to leisure travelers going to and from mid- and small-sized airports to vacation destinations like Florida, California, Arizona and Hawaii -- 22 MD-80s should be operational. ""Our best guess is that ... by the end of the month, everything will be back to normal,"" said Davis. ""But passengers will not see disruptions sooner than that, hopefully."" In fact, the airline spokesman says all flights should head off fine Saturday, as Allegiant uses its full available fleet as well as aircraft contracted from other carriers. But that may not be the case Sunday and Monday, two of the airlines' busiest days of the week. Any passengers affected then or on any other day by the issue (including Friday) will get compensated with anything from a $100 voucher for delays under four hours to a refund and $200 voucher for those on rescheduled flights. CNN's Travis Sattiewhite contributed to this report.","A smoke detector goes off an an Allegiant flight, and all use slides to evacuate safely .

"(CNN) -- He may hate the attention off the track, but it's hard to avoid the media glare when you've been driving as well as Kimi Raikkonen this season. The Finn is currently Sebastian Vettel's nearest rival in the Formula One drivers' championship, trailing Red Bull's triple world champion by 38 points thanks to a succession of star turns for his team Lotus. With a win in Melbourne and five second-place finishes so far this year, Raikkonen will be seeking more podiums as F1 returns to action after a four-week summer break. This weekend, the 33-year-old will be hunting down a fifth career win at the Belgian Grand Prix in Spa -- a track he told Formula1.com was his ""favorite place"" and ""the greatest racing circuit in the world."" Since returning to the sport in 2012, Raikkonen has been a model of consistency finishing in the points a record 27 times in succession -- he overtook Michael Schumacher's mark of 24 at the British Grand Prix in June. ""He's driving better than he ever has,"" Ed Foster, associate editor of Motor Sport magazine, told CNN. ""That run of finishes is amazing because even if you are driving brilliantly, to have the luck as well, to have nothing break on the car. It's a testament to Lotus for building a car that is so reliable."" It's a view which was recently echoed by Raikkonen's team boss Eric Boullier. ""I would have to give Kimi 10 out of 10,"" Boullier told Formula1.com. Interactive: CNN F1 circuit guide . ""He's done a terrific job right from the beginning of the season and his remarkable run of 27 consecutive points finishes speaks for itself. No matter what happens he's always there, as we saw in the final few laps at Monaco."" Raikkonen scrapped his way to tenth place on the French Riviera and battled his way to ninth two weeks later in Montreal. But two podiums in the last three races before F1's summer break have set him and Lotus up nicely for the remaining nine races of the season. ""He is playing a big part in pushing the team forwards, and of course having such a popular character in the seat has its advantages too,"" Boullier told Formula1.com. Infographic: Billion-dollar deals on wheels . Boullier is optimistic that he can keep hold of his star man despite other teams warming to the task of signing the ""Iceman"" when his Lotus contract expires later this year. Red Bull was considering Raikkonen as replacement for F1 retiree Mark Webber, but the Finn's manager Steve Robertson said Monday that a deal couldn't be reached. ""The negotiations with Red Bull were not successful and ended some time ago,"" Robertson said, according to the Finnish newspaper, Turun Sanomat. Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo is now widely tipped to take his Webber' s place. Raikkonen has also been linked with a return to Ferrari in recent days, according to another Finnish newspaper, Ilta-Sanomat. But the claim has been denied by Ferrari and Foster thinks a move to Italy unlikely. ""I just can't see him going back there after the way they parted last time,"" Foster said. Raikkonen, who won the world championship with Ferrari in 2007, was released from his contract a year early in 2009 to make way for Fernando Alonso. Of course, it may be that Raikkonen opts to stay put. ""The Lotus team has one thing going for it in terms of PR and the media side of things. They don't overwork Raikkonen and he's obviously very happy there,"" Foster said. ""There are all these things bubbling around about Lotus' financial situation and whether or not they can afford him. ""But one thing Raikkonen isn't really that motivated by is money. Everyone is motivated by money to a certain extent but he's not as bad as some of the other drivers."" The famously reticent Raikkonen will no doubt be relieved to find the spotlight on Lewis Hamilton in Belgium following his victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix at the end of July. The Briton's maiden win for Mercedes has set up a potentially thrilling battle in the second half of the season. ""It's quite nicely poised. Vettel pretty much looked on the way to his fourth world championship this year but now with Hamilton's win in Hungary it's suddenly up for grabs between the two,"" Foster said. Twelve months ago, Ferrari was providing the resistance, but Foster doesn't see that happening this year. ""They have lost quite a lot of ground with the front runners and I can't see them making that up. With the massive rules changes next year, unless you're definitely in the title hunt most teams are going to switch their focus to 2014 much sooner than usual,"" Foster said. ""It's still too early but you have to say it's between Hamilton and Vettel, I would have thought."" Hamilton currently lies fourth in the standings, 48 points behind championship leader Vettel and will be hoping for a repeat run of 2010 when he took the checkered flag for his old team McLaren. ""I wonder whether Mercedes has turned the corner?"" Foster asks. ""You can't tell off the back of one race, but Hamilton was just untouchable. If they are very strong in Spa as well then you have to say that Hamilton has got every chance to catch Vettel in the championship.""","Kimi Raikkonen has been a model of consistency for Lotus this season .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly a year later, Benghazi remains a flashpoint in Washington for two very different reasons: indefensible pre-attack policy decisions and irresistible post-attack politics. The Obama White House, from the president on down, complains of ""phony"" Republican-led congressional investigations. Yet the administration's own reluctant, and at times inaccurate, responses to congressional inquiries have contributed to the GOP charge that the administration, at a minimum, has been less than transparent. ""We need to get to the bottom of what happened that terrible night, why it happened, and how we can prevent similar tragedies in the future,"" House Speaker John Boehner said last week in serving notice the House Benghazi investigations would continue into the fall, and include new subpoenas for documents and testimony if necessary. There are legitimate questions about why repeated and specific warnings about the Benghazi security situation were undervalued or ignored. Both lawmakers and intelligence professionals point to this weekend's unprecedented wave of Middle East and Africa embassy closings as, at least in part, a lesson learned from the September 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Embassy closures extended after al Qaeda message intercepted . Republicans, however, have at times undermined their own claim to be interested only in legitimate congressional oversight, not what Democrats often label a partisan witch-hunt. Boehner, for example, has at times privately urged lawmakers leading the investigations to focus on what the evidence shows -- and not let their partisan instincts allow their public rhetoric to get out ahead of the facts. Exclusive: Dozens of CIA operatives on the ground during Benghazi attack . Also undermining the GOP effort: fund-raising e-mails and videos from Republican and conservative groups asserting a Benghazi cover up orchestrated by President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""You've got a very valid point,"" Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the committee leading the House Benghazi review told CNN in an interview for ""The Truth About Benghazi,"" a one-hour program looking at the attack and at the lingering policy and political questions. ""I would prefer that fund-raising by outside groups stay away from the hard work of Congress. ""But it isn't going to happen."" Issa demands more State Department documents on Benghazi . Early 2016 jockeying also factors into the politics. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul says Clinton is responsible for the sub-par security in Benghazi even if, as she says, the stream of warnings and requests for more personnel never reached her desk. ""That's precisely her culpability,"" Paul told CNN. ""When you lead the State Department, decisions in one of the most dangerous countries in the world should rise to your level. That's your job to make sure those messages get to you."" GOP strategist Kristen Soltis Anderson understands the GOP effort to use Benghazi to tarnish Clinton's image, but describes her as the most ""formidable"" Democratic 2016 hope and adds, ""I don't know that Benghazi alone would sink a Clinton candidacy for president."" And if the attacks now are somehow designed to discourage Clinton from running, veteran Democratic strategist and Clinton ally Paul Begala suggests an opposite reaction. ""She's never been a person to back to down to a bully,"" Begala said in an interview. ""Hillary is the type of person to be motivated by that. To stand up and fight back."" Benghazi politics often get more attention because of the personalities involved. But there is also a policy divide. Republicans say they do not yet have a full picture of three critical issues: . Ã¢â¬Â¢ Why the warnings didn't reach the point where the State Department either sent more security help or ordered the Benghazi mission closed. Ã¢â¬Â¢ Why, especially given the weeks of threat warnings, there was no viable military option to assist the State Department personnel at the Benghazi mission and the predominantly CIA-run annex that came under attack later same evening and where two of the four Americans were killed. Ã¢â¬Â¢ And why, nearly a year later, no one has been brought to justice. New FBI Director James Comey is being pressed to update Congress on the investigation within a month of his officially beginning work next month. Lawmakers press FBI on Benghazi . On the military response question, the Pentagon now says it is making significant improvements in its contingency planning for responding to embassies in danger zones. But former Pentagon brass told Congress there was no viable option that night, with then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta saying the military ""should not be a 911 service capable of being on the scene within minutes."" The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, calls Benghazi a tragedy but labels continued GOP questioning a witch hunt. ""The bottom line is there was not a force available that could get there in time,"" Smith told CNN. ""So I don't think these questions need to be asked again."" GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, however, says that his classified briefings have included information that convince him more could have been done. ""How is it that we have a man down, in this case four men down and an injured person, and the cavalry never comes over the hill,"" Chaffetz said. On the first question, the administration's official review, by what is known as the Accountability Review Board, found a series of State Department bureaucratic failures at several levels, but found no negligence. ""A whitewash,"" is how Issa describes that analysis. That process was led by veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations. Pickering defended the integrity of the review in the weeks after its release. He several times, however, canceled scheduled interviews with CNN and ultimately said his attorney had advised him not to speak to the network. Now, House investigators are pursing documents the review board used in its review and this is likely to be one fall focus. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden, the retired Air Force general and a veteran of many Washington dramas, said GOP talk of a cover up is ""a loaded word."" But he says there is, nearly a year later, a lack of full clarity in determining where the biggest security related mistakes were made. ""This is team ball,"" Hayden said. ""There are a lot of people who now look back and say, 'I should have done that. I could have done that. Maybe I could have prevented this.'""","White House complains of investigations but its reluctant responses contribute to GOP charge .

"(CNN) -- At least 25 people have died after Typhoon Usagi slammed into the coast of southern China, state media reported Monday. Bringing strong winds and heavy rain, Usagi forced the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the closing of a major shipping lane. ""Usagi has devastated the eastern part of Guangdong,"" where it made landfall late Sunday, the state-run news agency Xinhua said. The storm trashed construction sites, damaged hundreds of homes and cut off power and water, the news agency reported. Twenty-five people have so far been confirmed dead, it said. At one point the most powerful storm so far this year, Usagi has menaced the region for days. It left at least two people dead and three others missing in the Philippines and at least nine people injured in Taiwan. The typhoon weakened Sunday as it got nearer to the Chinese coast, but was still packing sustained winds of around 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph) when it hit land. By Monday afternoon, it had faded to become a tropical depression. The densely populated financial center of Hong Kong, which had appeared to be in the storm's path before it began to track in a more northerly direction on Sunday, avoided the worst of its fury. Seventeen people in the territory sought medical attention, eight of whom were admitted to hospitals, authorities said. Flights disrupted . Usagi, which means rabbit in Japanese, also wreaked havoc on transportation, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights at Hong Kong International Airport, according to airport officials. With thousands of passengers stranded, airlines and airport authorities were scrambling to deal with the backlog as flights resumed Monday. Major Chinese airlines, including China Southern Air, canceled flights into the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, Xinhua reported. In preparation for the storm's arrival, four of six reactors at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in Shenzhen reduced their operating capacity, Guangdong authorities told Xinhua. A total of 226,000 people were relocated in Guangdong, the news agency cited the local civil affairs bureau as saying. The typhoon severely damaged or destroyed 7,100 houses, it reported. In neighboring Fujian Province, more than 80,000 people were evacuated and 50,000 disaster-relief personnel were deployed, Xinhua reported. A major shipping lane between Guangdong province, Hong Kong and Taiwan was closed Saturday in anticipation of the storm's arrival. More than 22,000 fishing boats in Fujian and another 48,000 in Guangdong have been ordered into port, authorities told Xinhua. East Asia is buffeted for several months a year by heavy storms that roll in from the Pacific. At its peak, Usagi eclipsed Super Typhoon Utor, which hit the Philippines and South China last month, as the strongest storm of the year so far. About 50 people died as result of Utor in China, and 11 people were killed in the Philippines. CNN's Anjali Tsui, Jethro Mullen and Pamela Boycoff contributed to this report.","Typhoon Usagi damaged hundreds of houses in Guangdong province .

"London (CNN) -- British architect Marcus Lee is sat on a deck chair outside his family home in east London as a steady queue of strangers casually wanders in and out, taking photographs, pointing at various items of furniture and systematically inspecting every last bedroom, bathroom and cupboard. ""I've spotted someone peering into my underwear drawer, but that's fine,"" he says. Lee is the brave owner of one of many hundreds of private homes, workplaces and municipal building scattered across London that opened their doors to the viewing public over the weekend for the capital city's annual ""Open House"" event. Watch Daniel Libeskind on Great Buildings . The initiative, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this year, is designed to highlight some of London's most architecturally significant buildings -- the majority of which would otherwise be closed to the general public. ""It's the best way to get under the skin and become more knowledgeable about the capital's architecture,"" explains Victoria Thornton, founding director of Open House. It's also the best way for the city's nosiest neighbors to have a jolly good snoop. While Lee's remarkable home -- built from a pre-fabricated timbre frame of frost-hardy Siberian larch -- has won numerous architectural awards, that's not the only reason it has drawn a crowd.

""But, I have to admit, I also love looking at the photo albums on the wall, the book collection and all the stylish art works."" Lee's home is a new-build, incorporating the latest in rainwater capture systems and sustainable building methods. But just a few minutes down the road, in the trendy east-London borough of Hackney, is one of the city's most historic residences. Sutton House was built in 1535, when King Henry VIII ruled over England and this part of London -- now busy with cars and tower blocks -- was set against miles of open grassland. See more: Heritage sites in peril . One of the first Tudor homes to be made from brick, many of its original features -- including a vast stone fireplace and a wall of intricately carved dark wood panels -- remain to this day. ""I think [Open House] is great for engaging local people with the architectural heritage of their community,"" says Robyn Finne, custodian of Sutton House on behalf of the UK's National Trust organization. Finne explains that the building is part Tudor, part Georgian and part Victorian. ""In its time it has functioned as a home, a church, a school and even a squat ... it embodies the changing face of London,"" she said. While many people are keen to immerse themselves in the hidden heritage of their hometown, others are simply looking for inspiration and a few DIY tricks. Over the entire weekend, James Wright was giving scheduled tours of his converted Victorian home. Though distinctive for its sleek, minimalist interior, the conversion is exceptional for its application energy-saving and environmentally friendly materials. ""I'm participating in Open House because I want to inspire people to do the same with their home,"" he said. During his tour, Wright explained in detail how to install evacuated solar water heating tubes and how best to insulate period sash window frames without diminishing their appearance. But it wasn't enough. As soon as he'd finished talking, Wright was inundated with queries. In a typical exchange, an elderly man asked Wright if the paint he had used throughout was chemical free. Before he could answer, another lady demanded to know: ""And is it easily wipeable?"" On the buses and trains in between venues, fellow Open House attendees were identifiable by the conspicuous green guidebook in their hands. ""Even though you're being welcomed in, it sill feels a little bit naughty"" said 29 year-old Londoner Becky Stevens, on her way to catch a glimpse from the top of the iconic ""Gherkin"" tower -- Norman Foster's elliptical skyscaper in London's financial district.

"(CNN) -- Russia's top diplomat Sunday accused the United States of ""blackmailing"" Moscow into backing tough ground rules for Syria's chemical disarmament that would include the threat of force if Syria balks. Syria has agreed to give up its arsenal of chemical weapons under international pressure and delivered an inventory of its poison gas stocks to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons over the weekend. But U.N. Security Council members are still trying to hammer out a resolution to outline the process, with Russia and Western powers at odds over the language. In a Sunday interview on Russian television, Lavrov said Washington was threatening to sink the deal unless the resolution was drawn up under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, which would authorize the use of force against Syria if it doesn't comply. As Syria's leading ally, Russia has opposed threats of military action. ""The U.S. partners are blackmailing us,"" Lavrov told the state-owned Channel One network. ""They say they will quit the work at the OPCW in The Hague if Russia does not back the resolution based on Chapter VII at the U.N. Security Council."" Lavrov said the Americans ""are interested in proving their superiority, and this is absolutely not the objective that drives us -- to solve the problem of chemical weapons in Syria."" Russia on Syria - No more 'nyet?' Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior U.S. State Department official responded that Washington isn't focused on words, ""but actions."" ""What our team at the U.N. is focused on right now is working through the details of a U.N. Security Council resolution with the strongest possible enforcement mechanism,"" the official said. ""We're not going to litigate the details of a potential resolution in public."" Syria is 2 1/2 years into a civil war that has already left more than 100,000 dead, according to the United Nations. The United States and several of its allies, particularly France, began calling for military action against Syrian government forces after an August 21 attack outside Damascus that they said involved the use of chemical weapons against civilians. U.N. weapons inspectors reported Monday that the nerve agent sarin had been used in the attack. Though the inspectors did not assign blame, Washington said details of the report pointed toward troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as the perpetrators. Syria's government denies unleashing chemical weapons, and Russia said Syrian rebel forces may have been behind the August 21 attack. Lavrov and his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State John Kerry, laid out a framework for Syria's disarmament on September 14. Kerry and Lavrov spoke again Sunday to reiterate ""the importance of working together on implementation of their agreement in Geneva,"" the senior State Department official said. The plan calls for Syria to submit a comprehensive declaration of its chemical arms within one week. The OPCW said Saturday it had received the list from Syria. The plan then calls for international inspectors in position to secure that arsenal no later than November. Veteran weapons inspectors have said securing and destroying the Syrian stockpile could take huge numbers of people, including hundreds of inspectors and thousands of troops to provide security. But Lavrov said Sunday that he didn't see the need for a large contingent of troops to back up the inspectors, and said Moscow was ready to stand guard ""along the perimeter of areas where the experts will be working."" ""We are ready to assign our servicemen and military police on this mission,"" he said. ""I do not think there is a need for deployment of large contingents. I believe that military observers would be enough."" In Syria, meanwhile, a Russian Embassy official said two people were hurt when a mortar shell struck the Russian mission in Damascus, the state news agency RIA Novosti reported. RIA Novosti quoted the unnamed official as saying the strike was ""apparently an accident.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tensions rippled through Pakistan's tribal region Saturday as three drone strikes killed 18 people and the government continued to block a NATO supply route into Afghanistan. Pakistani intelligence officials said 10 people died in one drone strike targeting a militant hideout, four people died when a vehicle was struck, and four others were killed when another hideout was targeted. All three occurred in the Data Khel area of North Waziristan. The intelligence officials did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. While the United States is the only country in the region of Pakistan and Afghanistan known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes. Saturday's attacks come amid an uptick in drone strikes in Pakistan as insurgents fighting in Afghanistan have taken refuge across the border. At Torkham, the main border crossing in Pakistan's Khyber district, queues of trucks and tankers formed at the border crossing, officials said. The supplies are all-important for the NATO-led war effort in Afghanistan. Pakistan halted the convoys Thursday after officials blamed cross-border NATO helicopter fire for the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers. A senior Pakistani government official in Khyber told CNN on Saturday that NATO supplies are still not allowed to enter in Afghanistan and doesn't know when the main route for supplying 152,000 U.S. and NATO forces will open again. ""We were asked by our seniors to block these supplies until further orders and we can't allow it to go until we receive orders from our seniors,"" the official said. A senior security official in the northwestern city of Peshawar also confirmed that convoys were suspended for third day but said negotiations to solve the problem continued. NATO said aircraft had entered Pakistani airspace Thursday in self-defense and killed ""several armed individuals"" after the crews believed they had been fired at from the ground. It was the fourth such strike this week by NATO helicopters pursuing militants into Pakistani territory in actions that have been condemned by the government. The Pakistani government said it was investigating Thursday's incident in the Kurram district of the northwestern tribal belt, which Washington has branded as a militant hub.","NEW: Pakistan continues to block the border crossing .

"(CNN) -- Not in my lifetime have I witnessed a pope who has so quickly succeeded in making more Catholics, and non-Catholics, hyperventilate than Pope Francis. Indeed, some are ready to jump off the bleachers. They all need to calm down. Pope Francis is delightfully frank, and that is what makes him positively engaging. He is also provocative in the best sense of that word. He seeks to challenge us and shake us out of our comfort zone. But he is not about to turn the Catholic Church upside down and inside out. Such talk is pure lunacy. In a three-part meeting in Rome with Catholic journalists last month, Pope Francis offered his thoughts on a wide range of subjects; they were published Thursday by America magazine, the Jesuit weekly. Everyone should read it for themselves. There is nothing new about ripping what a famous person said out of context, and that is exactly what is going on now with Pope Francis. The breaking news alert by The New York Times is titled, ""Pope Bluntly Faults Church's Focus on Gays and Abortion."" In the Times alert, it says the pope discusses how ""the Roman Catholic Church has grown 'obsessed' with preaching about abortion, gay marriage and contraception,"" and that he has been criticized for doing so. It also quotes him saying the Catholic Church should be ""home for all"" and not a ""small chapel"" that is ""focused on doctrine, orthodoxy and a limited agenda of moral teachings."" Regarding the pope's statements on abortion and gay marriage, here is what he said: ""We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. This is not possible."" He also said, ""when we speak about these issues, we have to talk about them in a context."" What the pope said makes eminently good sense. For example, when I became president of the Catholic League 20 years ago, I visited the chapters around the nation and found that many were single-issue entities. Some focused exclusively on abortion; others were obsessed with homosexuality; still others demanded we just concentrate on medical ethics. I shared many of their concerns, but I also told them we are an anti-defamation organization and should not become preoccupied with other matters, no matter how noble. The pope is right that single-issue Catholics need to rise above their immediate concerns. He did not say we should avoid addressing abortion or homosexuality; he simply said we cannot be absorbed by these issues. Or any others. Laurie Goodstein's article in The New York Times on the pope's comments says U.S. bishops will feel the pinch of these remarks as they often appear ""to make combating abortion, gay marriage and contraception their top public policy priorities."" This is inaccurate. It is not the bishops who have made these issues front and center -- it is the Obama administration. It would be more accurate to say the pope would find fault with the bishops if they did not resist these state encroachments on the religious liberty rights of Catholics. The Times alert was wrong to characterize the pope's ""small chapel"" remark as a criticism of focusing on ""doctrine, orthodoxy and a limited agenda of moral teachings."" In the previous paragraph, he speaks about ""the sanctity of the militant church."" In the following sentence, the pope says, ""[W]e must not reduce the bosom of the universal church to a nest protecting our mediocrity."" Excellent. Then, in the same paragraph, he cites the ""negative behavior"" of priests and nuns, saying their conduct is that of an ""unfruitful bachelor"" and a ""spinster."" He most emphatically did not say what the Times attributed to him. Pope Francis unequivocally rejects abortion and gay marriage. Elsewhere, he has said, ""[T]he moral problem with abortion is of a prereligious nature because the genetic code of the person is present at the moment of conception. There is already a human being."" Similarly, he says, his opposition to gay marriage ""is not based on religion, but rather on anthropology."" Pope Francis wants us to oppose abortion. He also wants us to reach out to women who are contemplating one, and to help women who have had one to find peace with God (that's why the Catholic Church has Project Rachel). He wants us to oppose same-sex marriage. He also doesn't want us to reject lesbians and gays because they are homosexual. This is sound Catholic teaching. Kudos to Pope Francis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Donohue.","William Donohue: Pope Francis seeks to provoke and shake us out of our comfort zone .
Donohue: But he is not about to turn the Catholic Church upside down, inside out .

"(CNN) -- A derby match between Besiktas and Galatasaray in the Turkish city of Istanbul was abandoned on Sunday as one of Europe's most fiercely contested football rivalries descended into violence and chaos. Hundreds of fans invaded the pitch, throwing chairs and clashing with security personnel and riot police at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium, where a crowd in excess of 76,000 had gathered. A red card for Galatasaray's Brazilian midfielder Felipe Melo in the 92nd minute was the catalyst for the scenes of havoc after Ivorian striker Didier Drogba had scored twice to give the visitors a 2-1 lead over Besiktas. Defeat would have been the first of the season for league leaders Besiktas. Reports suggest the violence was sparked by clashes between riot police and Besiktas supporters. ""The Eagles' Turkish Super League game against Galatasaray at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium was suspended by the referee in injury time,"" read a statement on Besiktas' official website. ""Besiktas JK Executive Board will soon make an announcement on the subject."" A similar statement on Galatasaray's website added, ""how the proceedings will continue will be announced later by the Turkey Football Federation (TFF)."" In recent years Turkish football has also had to deal with the scourge of match-fixing. Fenerbahce, another Istanbul-based team, were banned from European football for two years for manipulating the results of matches en route to the 2011 Turkish Super Lig title. Violent clashes in Istanbul have been a common sight in the past six months. Anti-government protests swept through the city's streets in June and July, with tear gas and water cannons used by the police to halt demonstrators. The TFF was not immediately available for comment.","Istanbul derby match between Galatasaray and Besiktas ends in violence .

"Boston (CNN) -- They were partners-in-crime for more than two decades: Reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger and his henchman, Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi. In the course of three days on the witness stand in Bulger's federal trial, Flemmi has described in great detail the murders he says he witnessed Bulger commit and he has portrayed himself as a lackey following orders and getting rid of physical evidence -- pulling victims' teeth to avoid identification and disposing of bodies. On Tuesday, Bulger's lawyer, Hank Brennan, tried to reverse the image and portray Flemmi as a man who knew how to kill people independently of Bulger. He focused in on Flemmi's common-law stepdaughter Deborah Hussey. Not only did Flemmi molest her when she was 17 (an act Flemmi maintains happened twice and was consensual), he also lured her to her death at age 26 after first taking her shopping. ""That murder could have been prevented by one word from Bulger,"" Flemmi said. ""All he had to say was p-a-s-s, pass. I would have been happy."" Flemmi testified he watched and did nothing as Bulger strangled the troubled girl with his bare hands. After she was dead he removed her beige sweater, pulled-out her teeth, and then buried her in a basement floor, he testified. ""You murdered your stepdaughter,"" Brennan charged. ""In the eyes of the law, yes,"" Flemmi responded, ""but physically no."" Bulger's lawyer then continued to portray Flemmi as a pedophile, whose actions contributed to his stepdaughter's drug addiction. Flemmi became unnerved, pointing at Bulger who sat just eight feet away, snapping, ""You want to talk about pedophilia, right over there at that table."" He then referenced a trip Bulger made to Mexico with a 16-year-old-girlfriend. Lawyers for Bulger, who is charged with 19 murders, extortion and racketeering, also questioned Flemmi about the murder of Flemmi's girlfriend, Debbie Davis. Flemmi said in earlier testimony that Bulger strangled the 26-year-old beauty because she knew the name of a rogue FBI agent who had recruited Bulger and Flemmi to work as informants. ""In Bulger's eyes that was a serious offense,"" Flemmi testified. Brennan asked about dinner meetings Flemmi had with Connolly at Flemmi's parents' home and wondered why they weren't killed. Flemmi called the question ""ridiculous"" and said, ""All my mother knew was how to cook and she was a very good cook. She didn't know John Connolly from a hole in the wall."" Bulger's lawyer pointed out Davis was murdered after Flemmi learned she was involved with another man. And he tried pointing out inconsistencies in Flemmi's prior testimony about exactly where the woman died in the house she had been lured to, upstairs or after Flemmi and Bulger carried her to the basement. ""I'm not a doctor. She looked dead to me. She felt dead. She was dead,"" said Flemmi, who testified earlier that Bulger strangled Davis upstairs. He also said her death was ""such a distasteful act, it's a guilt trip I've been on all these years."" In an attempt to show Flemmi was his own man, Brennan led Flemmi through a series of murders and crimes he committed before he met Bulger. Flemmi contended as part of a criminal gang, he couldn't back out or say 'No' once the gang had made a decision. ""You don't understand the underworld at all,"" Flemmi hissed at Bulger's lawyer.""You don't know nothing. That's the real world. That's the world I was involved in."" The trial resumes Wednesday with Flemmi still on the stand.","Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi was ""Whitey"" Bulger's partner and henchman .

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast says it will not transfer former first lady Simone Gbagbo to the International Criminal Court, and plans to try her in a domestic court instead. Gbagbo is accused of crimes against humanity following postelection violence in 2010. Her husband, former president Laurent Gbagbo, is in the custody of the Hague-based court awaiting trial over similar charges. Government officials said they plan to file a motion to dismiss an arrest warrant against her. ""The councils' decision is to judge Mrs. Gbagbo in Ivory Coast, by the Ivorian courts which have now been restored and even to guarantee her a fair trial with the rights to a defense,"" the government said in a statement Friday. Officials said they will inform the international court of the decision. Alleged crimes against humanity . The former first lady is accused of crimes against humanity in the aftermath of her husband's election defeat in 2010. Laurent Gbagbo, then the incumbent president, refused to step down after Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of the two sides, leaving thousands dead. The ICC warrant issued last year alleges that as a member of the president's inner circle, his wife was an ""indirect co-perpetrator."" She attended meetings where plans were discussed and carried out to persecute Ouattara supporters, according to the warrant. Her husband surrendered to the ICC in December of that year, and is currently awaiting trial at The Hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths. Both have denied the charges. Backlash against the ICC . African governments have accused the Hague-based court of unfairly targeting the continent. The African Union plans to hold a meeting next month to discuss withdrawal of member nations from the ICC to protest what it describes as ""hunting"" of leaders from the continent. Its planned meeting comes as Kenyan deputy president, William Ruto, is undergoing trial at the court on charges related to postelection violence in 2007. Kenya's parliament voted to leave the ICC this month, days before the deputy president's trial started. So far, all cases before the ICC are against Africans in eight countries. They include Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Libya, Ivory Coast and Mali. Some of the cases such as Ivory Coast were supported by their respective governments.","Ivory Coast officials want arrest warrant against Simone Gbagbo dismissed .

"(CNN) -- Fifty-three determined men and women will sport Nigeria's green and white colors during the London Games -- the second-biggest Olympic team hailing from Sub-Saharan Africa -- carrying the nation's hopes for the first gold medal in 16 years. Amongst those bidding for Olympic glory is canoeist Johny Akinyemi, the first athlete to paddle for Nigeria at the world's major sport event -- the 23-year-old enters the race on July 29, just two days after the Games' opening ceremony. Born and raised in the UK to a Nigerian father and a British mother, Akinyemi's path to the 30th Olympiad has been as winding as the whitewater courses he navigates. He first started canoeing aged 12 in northern England and in 2006 he emerged as the junior British national champion. But a year later he gave up his top ranking in the country of his birth to compete for the country of his heritage following a visit to his father's homeland -- a trip he describes as a ""baptism of fire."" ""It was just such a great experience,"" remembers Akinyemi of his time in the West African country. ""Just to see where your roots are, to see your heritage and what makes you a person -- there's a Nigerian boy within me and there's a British boy within me, I've only seen the British side of things until I went back to Nigeria and saw my Nigerian heritage and that's something I'm proud of."" Read more: Weymouth -- Olympic sailing on Jurassic Coast . Akinyemi says people in Nigeria ""welcomed him with open arms,"" making it easier for him to embrace his roots and change his Olympic allegiance. ""It made a lot of sense to me because there's always been questions about my identity which has been unanswered until I started to look into my family and my family history and stuff like that and gone back to my roots."" A talented athlete, Akinyemi wants to leave his mark in this year's Olympics. In 2008 Akinyemi came agonizingly close to going to the Beijing Games but missed out on qualification by a single place. That failure made him more determined to train even harder to improve his power, technique and speed and be able to compete at the top level in the physically demanding sport of canoeing. In February this year his Olympic dream finally came true when he made Nigerian history by winning the 2012 African slalom championships and securing a place for London. Akinyemi says he will never forget that moment in time. ""It was such a great feeling getting an Olympic spot because I worked so hard for it -- it took so long coming after the 2008 Olympics,"" he explains. ""It's just such a good feeling that you actually achieved what you wanted to go out there and do."" Read more: Art of the Olympic Games . Akinyemi's victory in this year's African slalom championships came after he beat Benjamin Boukpeti, a household name in canoeing who is also a dual citizen competing for a faraway country. Boukpeti, a bronze medalist at the Beijing Games, was born and raised in France but has chosen to represent his father's home country of Togo. ""Most people didn't think I would beat Benjamin but to go out and do it was such a good feeling. I surprised myself a little bit even with that one,"" says Akinyemi. ""It's really good to have such high competition in Africa,"" he adds. Read more: Legendary athlete nurtures Kenyan youth . Now, just days before his quest for Olympic success gets underway, Akinyemi admits he is ""pretty nervous"" but adds that he is looking forward to his first Olympiad. He says he's determined to give his best and try to win for his country and make his father proud. ""If I won a medal it would mean everything, all the hard work would be worth it,"" he says. ""My dad would be so proud because he was proud of me for qualifying for the Games and he spent a lot of time in Africa helping me get to where I am today. So I think it would be really good, it would almost be winning it for him."" But win or lose, Akinyemi, who is also studying to be an accountant after his sporting career is over, wants to make sure that Nigeria stays on the canoeing map. He says there is a lot of potential in Nigeria for the sport and many more athletes can follow in his footsteps. ""We need to now push it to develop more canoe slalom athletes, to develop the canoe slalom world in Nigeria,"" he says. ""I just think we have so much potential. It's deep rooted in Nigerian culture. We just need to get the kids and the youngsters into a competitive environment, into the right types of packs and canoes so they can race.""","Johny Akinyemi, 23, is Nigeria's first Olympic canoeist .

"(CNN) -- Germany's voters will cast their ballots this weekend to decide who will lead the country through a challenging time as it grapples with its leading role in the Eurozone crisis. But just as the world has changed over the four years since the last election in Germany, so too has the way election issues are discussed. So, ahead of the polls, CNN invited the country's six leading parties to take part in a social media debate. Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein . Journalists from across Europe have posed a series of tough questions via 15-second Instagram video clips, challenging representatives from the parties to respond to them -- and to each other -- in the same short, sharp and shareable way. And while the questions have featured a range of hot topics such as Syria, Turkey and green energy, as on the campaign trail, it is the economy which has dominated the discussion. Christoph Teuner, of German television channel n-tv, asked whether German taxpayers would get the short end of the stick from costly attempts to fight the crisis in the Eurozone. Volker Berkhout of the Pirates Party, sounded a gloomy note: ""There will be a rude awakening. The financial crisis is threatening democracy in Europe. We want owners and creditors to be liable for the losses... losses should not be socially mutualized any further."" But Norbert Barthle of the ruling Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), insisted: ""Germany and its people are benefitting considerably from the euro. The risks are manageable and transparent. It would only be a rude awakening if the opposition pushed through their plans for the mutualisation of debt."" Andrea Nahles of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) disagreed: ""The truth is not being told. Another rescue package is due for Greece. The question is what we are spending the money for. Mrs Merkel is one-sided in her focus on saving, and that will not bring the Greek economy back on its feet."" While Roland Klaus of the new anti-euro party Alternatives for Germany (AfD) offered a prediction -- and a potential solution: ""After the election, Greece as well as Ireland and Portugal will need further billions, without this being of any help to people in those countries. That's why we're calling for a separate currency for the crisis countries, allowing them to recover using their own strengths."" Under the rules of the debate, each question is set first thing in the morning; the parties have until midnight to post their responses via Instagram. If they wish, they can also offer rebuttals to their opponents' responses. Peer Steinbrueck: The man who stirred up German politics . Viewers watching the clips are asked share them online, and to pick their favourite -- and least favourite -- answers. Peter Bale, vice president of digital at CNN International said the innovative debate format reflected the fresh new ways in which information and conversations were being shared online: ""Short video is the medium of the moment, as Instagram and Vine are demonstrating. ""We think this experiment in Germany offers a chance to try a new approach in this exciting area. We're always keen to innovate in story-telling and this was a great opportunity to try something new. ""And just as the decisions made by German voters on Sunday could have a lasting impact on the future of the eurozone, so CNN's 15 Second Debates could offer a glimpse of the way political discussions are carried out in the years to come.""

"(CNN) -- [Breaking news alert, 9:12 a.m. ET Tuesday] . A 46-year-old Colorado man who had been presumed dead in the aftermath of the Colorado flooding has been found alive, authorities said Tuesday. The man says he managed to climb out of a window before his home was swept away by floodwaters, authorities said. [Previously published story] . The body of a 79-year-old woman was found this past weekend in the aftermath of the Colorado flooding, Larimer County authorities said Monday. The body of Evelyn Starner, of Cedar Cove, was discovered on a bank of the Big Thompson River, the sheriff's office said. It is the first confirmed fatality in the county due to the floods, and it brings the storm-related death toll in the state to eight. One other person in the county is currently listed as missing and presumed dead. A man previously listed as presumed dead checked in with authorities and is alive and well, the sheriff's office said. One other Cedar Cover resident, a 60-year-old woman, is still missing and presumed dead. Vice President Joe Biden visited Colorado on Monday and took a one-hour aerial tour to view the damage. He also checked on recovery efforts. ""Once all these cameras are gone, once these press conferences are done, FEMA and the Red Cross are still going to be here until we make you whole. Until we make it right for you,"" Biden told Colorado residents. Biden said the federal government had approved $35 million thus far for road rebuilding and other projects. He said those funds wouldn't be affected by a possible government shutdown. Torrential rains fell September 12 in mountainous areas north of Denver, and such downpours persisted for several more days, adding up to 18.1 inches in parts of Boulder County and 15.6 inches in Adams County, Gov. John Hickenlooper said. The heavy rainfall spurred flash floods that turned picturesque canyons into funnels that deluged towns downstream and left hundreds stranded. More than a week later, many remained marooned -- cut off from the rest of the world thanks to floodwaters that wiped out roads and bridges. Tune strikes a poignant chord amid deluge in Colorado .

"(CNN) -- In the quiet world of German politics, outspoken Social Democrat leader and Angela Merkel's main challenger, Peer Steinbrueck, is causing something of a storm. First there was the Italian blooper: he referred to Beppe Grillo and Silvio Berlusconi as the ""two clowns who have won the Italian election."" Ja, wir koennen! Can American-style campaign work in Germany? Admittedly one of the two, Grillo, had been a successful comedian before turning to politics. But still, the comment caused Italian president Giorgio Napolitano to cancel an official engagement in Germany. Then there was the interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, in which he claimed the German Chancellor's salary was too low for his liking -- which may not be the wisest comment if you are running for the post. Interactive: Who is running in German election? He then raised eyebrows even further by claiming Angela Merkel was getting extra political points for being female. And finally, there was that photograph: a portrait of the nation's would-be leader, raising his middle finger to the camera. On the cover of the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, one of Germany's most widely-read newspapers. Peer Steinbrueck's nicknames range from ""Problem-Peer"" to ""Peerlusconi."" Still, they signal an improvement from the early days of the election campaign, when only a few would have recognized him at all. Although he had served as a federal minister in the past, he is currently a rank-and-file MP. And when you're trying to get noticed, even bad publicity is better than none. Could euroskeptics spoil Angela Merkel's election party? An economist by trade, Steinbrueck grew up in Hamburg and joined the political ranks shortly after graduating from university. He is an accomplished politician, having served as Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, before moving into the federal sphere. Merkel, his rival in the election race, was once his boss: he served as finance minister in her first government, from 2005 until 2009: as Lehman Brothers collapsed and the Eurozone crisis started to bite, his political star rose. A sharp critic of the shadow banking system, he was responsible for Germany's bank rescue plan. ""He has a reputation as an efficient manager of the fiscal crisis,"" writes researcher Michael Miebach. That, however, may not be viewed entirely positively by potential voters. ""He does not define himself by making overly empathetic social statements,"" Miebach writes. ""Quite the contrary, many social democratic activists regard him as a cold-hearted, pro-business technocrat."" Is Germany playing beggar-my-neighbor with the eurozone? In the SPD election manifesto, he does promise to establish state-wide minimum wage and increase tax rates for top earners -- proposals rejected firmly by Merkel. But his critics argue that his promises don't come across as particularly honest, and he lacks popularity. ""His public persona is [one of] perceived arrogance and [a] lack of connection with low-income households,"" says political scientist Patricia Hogwood. That is not good news for his party, the SPD. With a leader perceived by many as conservative, more voters appear to be shunning the SPD in favor of the more ""radically"" socialist party, Die Linke. Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein . Observers say that throughout the campaign, Peer Steinbrueck has been everything Angela Merkel is not: cheeky, spontaneous, impulsive. But women in particular are not amused by his style, with 70% of female voters finding the middle finger incident ""very bad,"" according to a Forsa Institute poll. Steinbrueck and his wife Gertrud, a former teacher (the couple has three children), have given joint interviews in an effort to boost his image among women. Moreover, his coalition past and image as a hard pro-business economist might deter the voters who are otherwise attracted to his personality. With polls predicting his party will secure just 26% of votes, he cannot afford to lose any more support thanks to further gaffes.","Social Democrat leader Peer Steinbrueck is Angela Merkel's main rival in the election race .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- China is poised to become the world's largest economy within a decade, according to some economists. Rising giant India already has a middle-class population that is larger than the entire United States population, according to others. Such nuggets fuel an industry of prophetic warnings of decline, exemplified by the phrase ""How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented"" in the subtitle of Thomas Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum's recent best-seller. The rapid growth of China and India and other Asian tigers does not mean that the United States has ""fallen behind,"" however. It takes a panicked perspective to even ponder the point. China and India have immense economies, each with state-of-the-art technological centers that put others to shame. But they are also ranked 125th and 162nd, respectively, in GDP per capita (according to the CIA's World Factbook), lacking clean water and safe food for too many citizens. Both face massive environmental and infrastructural challenges within the next decade. Neither country is in range of providing an American level of services to its citizenry, much less the comfortable level typical of flourishing Northern European economies. And if we consider the deeper cultural dimensions of globalization and innovation, one could go so far as to argue that the globalization game is and will remain rigged in America's favor, with other nations not being able or even willing to catch up. In truth, many societies in East and South Asia are confronting ambivalence and resistance to developments that we might see as progress but that their traditionalists see as moral and social decline. Iran and Pakistan are just two examples of nations whose rapid modernization was undercut by underlying reactionary cultural forces. For related reasons, the various proud Asian tigers are not on an unbendable trajectory. Current trends are not destiny; it is more accurate to say that culture is destiny. Western academics may deride the ""unoriginal"" thinking of Chinese or Indian students, but this critique is based on an entirely different (some would say culturally imperialistic) worldview. Lao Tzu's ""Tao Te Ching,"" still proudly full of wisdom today, stands as a reminder that disruption, individualism and innovation are inherently heretical in many traditional societies -- and if they occur in one area of a traditional society, a backlash typically follows in another. Gandhi's spirit, with its vigorous opposition to consumer capitalism, is hardly extinct. Meanwhile, America is the best at being America, because America is the closest thing to a society that unambivalently enjoys being American. The United States has cultural and demographic traits that remain unique -- for better and worse. American culture is peculiarly tilted toward valuing disruptive new ideas and welcoming the immigrant who brings such ideas into its society. An individualistic, heterogeneous, novelty-seeking American culture, strengthened by a critical mass of interdisciplinary American research universities that draw the world's best minds, represents a considerable edge in social and economic innovation. For today's emerging economies to become long-term giants, rather than variations of prerevolution Iran and the Soviet Union, they must become more economically and socially integrated. And to become economically integrated, they must become culturally integrated, which means a host of conflicts are on the horizon regarding varying societal views on change, tradition, materialism, social mobility, openness, patronage and so on. It will not be easy, and success is not inevitable. Many emerging nations are like a young child on the precipice of a tense and unpredictable adolescence. Eastern nations may in time become better than the West at the freewheeling socioeconomics that America and the rest of the West invented, but not without considerable social turmoil. A true taste for innovation and adaptation will result only from a vigorous clash between individualistic impulses and communitarian ones -- clashes that will take decades to play out, with uncertain outcomes. Americans may block their own path and sabotage their own cultural tilt toward innovative growth if political dysfunction continues. But with even some sensible reform of the political system, a resilient, forward-thinking and forward-moving economy should result. America was the key force in popping open the Pandoran box of commercial and cultural globalization, with all the attendant anxieties and unintended consequences. But the globalization game is an inherently American game, and it will take a great deal of luck, strategy and determination for someone else to play the game better than Americans are able to play it.

"(CNN) -- Eight people were injured in an explosion at a naval weapons station's boathouse in New Jersey Tuesday morning, the U.S. Navy said. The blast at Naval Weapons Station Earle happened at about 9 a.m. while personnel were performing maintenance on a vessel, the Navy said in a news release. Seven sailors and a Department of Defense civilian firefighter were injured. Though all eight were taken to hospitals, none had life-threatening injuries. By Tuesday night, the Navy said seven of the eight had been treated and released after suffering minor injuries, mostly from smoke inhalation. One sailor remained hospitalized and underwent surgery for a broken arm, the Navy said. ""The situation is stabilized. We are investigating the accident,"" Navy spokesman Mike Brady said. Information on what exploded wasn't immediately available. Authorities are investigating what caused the blast, the Navy said. The workers' names were not immediately released. ""The damage from the explosion was contained within the boathouse area,"" the Navy's release said. Naval Weapons Station Earle, which supplies ordnance to the Navy's Atlantic fleet carrier and other groups, is south of Middletown, New Jersey. CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","NEW: One sailor remains hospitalized, the Navy says .

"(CNN) -- Visiting a particle accelerator is like a religious experience, at least for Nima Arkani-Hamed. Nima Arkani-Hamed, a leading theoretical physicist, thinks the universe has at least 11 dimensions. Immense detectors surround the areas where inconceivably small particles slam into one another at super-high energies, collisions that may confirm Arkani-Hamed's predictions about undiscovered properties of nature. Arkani-Hamed is only in his mid-30s, but he has distinguished himself as one of the leading thinkers in the field of particle physics. His revolutionary ideas about the way the universe works will finally be put to the test this year at Switzerland's Large Hadron Collider, which will be the world's most powerful particle accelerator. The accelerator, estimated to cost between $5 billion and $10 billion, could provide answers to questions physicists have had for decades. Thousands of scientists from around the world are collaborating on the project at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN. If the results confirm any of Arkani-Hamed's predictions, they would be the first extension of our notions of space-time since Albert Einstein. ""We're essentially guaranteed that there's going to be something surprising,"" Arkani-Hamed said of the Large Hadron Collider, which will operate inside a 17-mile circular tunnel.  See what's planned for the collider Â» . Regarded as a ""gem,"" Arkani-Hamed is ""opening our minds and creating a new world of ideas that challenge deep-grained preconceptions about spacetime,"" said Chris Tully, professor of physics at Princeton University, who is working on the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. ""From the point of view of the big experiments at the LHC, there is no amount of money or craftsmanship that would produce the kind of insight that comes from sharing LHC data with a true visionary like Nima Arkani-Hamed,"" Tully said. Formerly a professor at Harvard, Arkani-Hamed currently sits on the faculty at the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where Einstein served from 1933 until his death in 1955. ""He was lured from Harvard to the IAS; I'm sure that's considered quite a coup,"" said Daniel Marlow, a physics professor at Princeton who is also collaborating on the CMS experiment. Arkani-Hamed has had a hand in explaining how the world can operate according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the universe on a very large scale, and at the same time follow quantum mechanics, laws that describe the universe on a scale smaller than the eye can see. Some of the key mysteries that stem from these clashing theories include why gravity is so weak, relative to the other fundamental physical forces such as electromagnetism and why the universe is so large. These issues come up because on an inconceivably small scale, the particles that make up our world seem to behave completely differently than one might imagine. For example, if you are driving a car, your GPS tells you where you are, and your speedometer tells you how fast you are moving. But on the scale of particles like electrons, it is impossible to know both position and speed at once; the very act of trying to find out requires incredible amounts of energy. If it takes so much energy just to try to pin down a particle, then, in theory, all particles should have temporary energy changes around them called ""quantum fluctuations."" This energy translates into mass, since Einstein famously said that mass and energy are interchangeable through the equation E=mc2. ""It makes it extremely mysterious that the electron, or indeed, everything else that we know and love and are made of, isn't incredibly more massive than it is,"" Arkani-Hamed said. A theory that has emerged in recent decades that claims to bring some relief to physics mysteries like these is called superstring theory, or string theory for short. Previously, scientists believed that the smallest, most indivisible building blocks of our world were particles, but string theory says the world is made of extremely small vibrating loops called strings. In order for these strings to properly constitute our universe, they must vibrate in 11 dimensions, scientists say. Everyone observes three spatial dimensions and one for time, but theoretical models suggest at least seven others that we do not see. Arkani-Hamed proposed, along with physicists Savas Dimopoulos and Gia Dvali, that some of these dimensions are larger than previously thought -- specifically, as large as a millimeter. Physicists call this the ADD model, after the first initials of the authors' last names. We haven't seen these extra dimensions because gravity is the only force that can wander around them, Arkani-Hamed said. String theory has come under attack because some say it can never be tested; the strings are supposed to be smaller than any particle ever detected, after all. But Arkani-Hamed says the Large Hadron Collider could lead to the direct observation of strings, or at least indirect evidence of their existence. In fact, by slamming particles into one another, the Large Hadron Collider may detect particles slipping in and out of the dimensions that Arkani-Hamed has worked on describing. Particle collisions should begin at the Large Hadron Collider in August or September, according to the US/LHC Web site. Evidence of theories such as the ADD model could be discovered by 2009, Marlow said. Data reflecting Arkani-Hamed's work on large extra dimensions ""would really provide the first confirmation in this very profound way we might think about nature,"" Marlow said. Arkani-Hamed always had a great love of the natural world as a child. Though his parents are also physicists, he considers it his ""act of teenage rebellion to become one too,"" as his mother wanted him to become a doctor. He remembers being impressed around age 14 that Newton's laws could enable him to calculate such things as the minimum speed that a space shuttle had to attain to escape the Earth's gravitational field. He'd wondered whether scientists had reached the figure of 11 kilometers per second by trial and error, shooting things in the air until the right speed emerged, until he could calculate it himself. ""When I figured out how to do that for myself, I just thought it was just the coolest thing, that little old me, scratching away on my piece of paper, could figure this out,"" he said. ""From about 13 or 14, I knew that this is what I wanted to do.""","Nima Arkani-Hamed, a theoretical physicist, predicts large extra dimensions .

LHC results may change ideas of spacetime for the first time since Einstein .

"Washington (CNN) -- United Airlines plans to resume flying the 787 Dreamliner in May, the carrier told CNN in anticipation of regulatory approval of Boeing's remedy for battery problems that forced the jetliner's worldwide grounding. While United is the only U.S. carrier that flies the wide body, a signal from the world's biggest carrier indicates that others are also likely making plans to resume service in coming weeks. For the first time in months, it also indicates a clear time line for Boeing to return the aggressively promoted but troubled jetliner to the skies after it was grounded by regulatory authorities globally in January. United said it plans to start flying 787 again on May 31. Final battery test on Dreamliner 'straightforward' ""We are in the process of formulating our domestic flying plans and will be making additional schedule changes as we gain visibility to the time line for certification and modification work,"" Christen David, an airline spokeswoman said. United said it will fly the plane on both domestic and international routes. Boeing modified the 787's lithium-ion battery system after fires in Boston and in Japan prompted aviation authorities globally to ground it. It completed new test flights last week. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will review the test data and must sign off on the redesign. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has said the Dreamliner will not be allowed back in service until Boeing proves the new design is safe. Boeing has placed a huge bet on the lightweight, mostly carbon-composite jetliner. Only 50 Dreamliners were flying worldwide at the time of its grounding, but the world's largest aircraft manufacturer has orders for several hundred in the pipeline.","United Airlines is only U.S. carrier that flies the 787; 50 in service worldwide .

"(CNN) -- A gun found during a traffic accident investigation two months ago has been linked to a 2012 double slaying that police are investigating in connection with Aaron Hernandez, law enforcement sources said Tuesday. After a June 21 four-vehicle crash on Interstate 91 in Springfield, Massachusetts, Jailene Diaz-Ramos, 19, was taken to a hospital. During a search of her vehicle -- which is customary when a car is towed from a crash scene -- Massachusetts State Police found a firearm and several rounds of ammunition, according to the incident report. The gun's ballistics match the markings on the bullets found after two men were killed outside a Boston bar last year, two law enforcement sources said. The evidence has been presented to a grand jury hearing details of the double homicide, a law enforcement source said. Investigation turns to Hernandez's fiancee . Diaz-Ramos was not licensed to carry the weapon and was charged with possession of a firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without a license and improper storage of a firearm, the incident report said. When asked, the teenager told police the .38-caliber weapon belonged to her boyfriend and that ""he was the last one to use the car to visit a football player,"" according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case. It's unclear if she named the football player. Hernandez, a former New England patriot tight end, is being investigated in connection with the double killing in Boston's South End, law enforcement sources said. Diaz-Ramos' connection to Hernandez is unclear, but she and her boyfriend are both from Bristol, Connecticut, Hernandez's hometown, police say. The teenager was released on bail after her initial appearance at Springfield District Court, according to police. Search warrant: Hernandez stored guns in box . In June, law enforcement sources said they believe Hernandez, 23, rented a silver SUV with Rhode Island registration that was linked to the scene of the double homicide. Police searched for the vehicle for almost a year before locating and impounding, the source said. Separately, Hernandez is accused with the killing of friend Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player whose body was found in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. CNN's Darius Walker, Lawrence Crook and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","A gun found during a traffic investigation has been linked to a double killing, police say .

"(CNN) -- As regional fears of a spillover from Syria's civil war increase, Israel plans to build a fence along the border with the embattled country. The announcement came Sunday during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's weekly Cabinet address, in which he cited the construction of a 230-kilometer (143-mile) fence along Israel's southern border with Egypt. Read more: Scavenging for food, Syrian children witness war . ""We intend to erect an identical fence, with a few changes based on the actual territory, along the Golan Heights. We know that on (the) other side of our border with Syria today, the Syrian army has moved away, and in its place, global jihad forces have moved in,"" Netanyahu said, according to a transcript of his remarks. ""Therefore, we will defend this border against both infiltration and terrorism, just as we are successfully doing on the Sinai border."" Syrian opposition and government sources have reported that the extremist al-Nusra Front, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda in Iraq, has taken part in some of the fighting in Syria. Watch: Syrian refugees dig in for the winter . Netanyahu also said the Syrian government is ""very unstable"" and expressed concerns about the possible use of chemical weapons. Israel seized the Golan Heights, along with the West Bank, Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, during the 1967 war. The Sinai has since been returned to Egypt. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by Syria, which still claims the land. Chaos from Syria's civil war has already spilled into Turkey and Jordan. Read more: Al-Assad says enemies of Syria 'will go to hell' Last month, shells and bullets landed in Jordanian territory because of fighting between government and rebel forces in western Syria. One Jordanian soldier was wounded, Jordan's armed forces said. And last week, U.S. troops started arriving near the Turkish-Syrian border to man Patriot missile defense batteries, which are intended to intercept any Scud missiles that might cross into Turkey from Syria. The move was made after Syria launched Scud missiles at cities near the Turkish border. The batteries began arriving Monday, video showed. ""The deployment, which will take place over the next few weeks, will be defensive only,"" NATO stressed in a statement Monday. ""It will not support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation. Its aim is to deter any threats to Turkey, to defend Turkey's population and territory and to de-escalate the crisis on NATO's southeastern border."" In October, five Turkish civilians were killed when errant Syrian artillery shells struck the Turkish border town of Akcakale. The Syrian government: Talk of reform leads to heavy skepticism . Syria's prime minister called Monday for Cabinet members to convene and decide how to implement measures announced by President Bashar al-Assad, state-run TV reported Monday. No date was announced for the meeting. In his first public speech since June, al-Assad outlined a plan Sunday to resolve the Syrian crisis. His plan includes national dialogue and a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum. But there's a major caveat to the plan: Al-Assad said he refuses to deal with ""terrorists,"" a term the government often uses to describe the opposition. Similarly, opposition members have said they will not work directly with al-Assad's ""criminal"" government, nor will they accept any solution that doesn't involve al-Assad's departure. So the deadly impasse continues. World leaders slammed al-Assad's speech, with British Foreign Secretary William Hague calling it ""beyond hypocritical."" ""Deaths, violence and oppression engulfing #Syria are his own making, empty promises of reform fool no one,"" Hague tweeted. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that he was ""disappointed"" by the speech, saying ""it does not contribute to a solution that could end the terrible suffering of the Syrian people."" At least 71 people, including seven children, were killed Monday in fresh violence, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said. More than 60,000 Syrians have been killed in the past 22 months, according to the United Nations. The chaos started in March 2011, when peaceful anti-government protesters were met by a fierce government crackdown, which spiraled into an armed opposition movement and a civil war.

"(CNN) -- My head is still spinning from excitement and disbelief at being chosen for what I know is going to be a life-changing adventure. Just five weeks ago, I found myself in Atlanta for the Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge kickoff weekend. As the weekend progressed, I tried to remember every piece of advice we received from the trainers and everyone at CNN. Thankfully, the opportunity to spend some time with Fit Nation alumni was part of the plan. They shared with us the wisdom of their own experiences. One bit of advice that I have clung to daily is, ""Schedule, schedule, schedule!"" I have always overextended myself. There are a lot of things that I like to do, and even more that I want to do. I also have a hard time saying ""no."" Getting fit for the family I love . After decades of raising three kids and taking care of other family members, my husband and I have found ourselves in a place we have never been before: one with free weekends. We are now able to go fishing, boating and camping, attend concerts, visit kids and grandkids, go to movies, go shopping, walk the dogs. Maybe because it is still a novelty we try to fit all that into just a couple days a week. There are a couple of obvious downsides to living this way. The first is that my plate generally isn't just full -- it's spilling over. Secondly, when I spread myself too thin, the end result is never the quality it would have been if I'd devoted my full time and energy. Now, in addition to everything else that I am committed to, I have to fit training for a triathlon into my life. The only way I will be successful is if I take seriously the advice to schedule. The late and great Dr. Steven Covey once said, ""To become a master of your time, you need to first be aware of your priorities in the larger context of your life."" Scheduling is not a novel idea or rocket science, but sometimes I just need to hear the right message at the right time in order for it to click in a meaningful way. Once I looked at the big picture from this perspective, life got a lot less complicated. From the very moment I found out I had this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I committed to taking full advantage of it, giving it my all. The athlete I used to be . Thankfully for me our coach, April Burkey, is giving us a huge head start. Each week, she puts our daily workouts on a calendar on the TrainingPeaks website. The time of day we do them is up to us, and we can even rearrange the days if need be. At the beginning of every week, I compare my work schedule with my training schedule. On a day that I need to go to the correctional facility where I work for the 5:45 a.m. roll call, an evening strength training workout makes the most sense. On a normal 8-to-5 day, I can easily fit in a 5:15 a.m. spinning class or a morning run. The pool I swim in does not open until 6 a.m. and is not available in the evenings or weekends. So far this has been the biggest scheduling challenge. But I haven't missed a workout yet, thanks to Presidents' Day and a bit of flexibility in my schedule. Once I see the workout on my calendar, it is not something I should do, or even have to do. I can honestly say that I look at it as something that is a priority for me so that I can accomplish my long-term goal of finishing the Nautica Malibu Triathlon on September 8! That doesn't mean that I bounce out of bed at 4 a.m. on the days that I go to the local YMCA for the spinning class, that I haven't wanted to stay in bed on a cold, snowy morning instead of heading across town to do swim drills. Make your workout go by faster . What it does mean is that these types of thoughts are fleeting, and that picturing myself crossing the finish line has helped me to get up, get ready and get started. Last weekend I did something I still can't believe: I actually ran a 5K. And I owe it all to scheduling! I also owe it to the encouragement and support of my co-warden, Angel Medina, and the support of my running partner for the day -- my youngest daughter, Lacee. When I shared my news about being on the Fit Nation team with Angel, he immediately told me about a local 5K. I didn't say it out loud, but my inside voice was telling me that I would not be ready to run 3.2 miles by March 5. To be perfectly honest, I was counting on Coach April to agree with me when I told her about the race. Yet a couple of weeks later, that 5K was my scheduled training for the day. Like I said earlier, once it's on my calendar... I set two goals for the race. The first was to finish, and the second was to run for the entire distance. The reason I knew these goals were both attainable is that I had already accomplished them in my scheduled training runs in the weeks before. All I can say is, ""Wow!"" I can't wait to see what I can accomplish during the next six months of prioritizing and scheduling!

"Rome (CNN) -- More than 100 people suspected of Mafia involvement were arrested Friday in Italy as police launched two separate operations near Rome and in the country's southern Calabria region. Police made 51 arrests in Ostia, a coastal community on the outskirts of the capital, for alleged crimes connected to the Sicilian Mafia, known as Cosa Nostra, police said in a statement. An additional 65 people were detained in a separate operation in Calabria, where those arrested are suspected of links to the powerful 'Ndrangheta Mafia. The operation in Ostia is one of the largest ever carried out against organized crime in the Rome area, a police news release said. More than 500 police officers, as well as maritime and dog units, were involved, police said. The alleged crimes under investigation in Ostia range from extortion to murder, to international drug trafficking to illegally controlling the slot machine market and business activities related to the beach, police said. Police say their operation has delivered a ""mortal blow"" to the leadership of the Mafia organization in the capital. Entire Mafia clans have been hit by the arrests, they say. Among those detained are alleged Mafia boss Carmine Fasciani. Members of another Mafia clan, Vincenzo Triassi and his wife, have been arrested on the Spanish island of Tenerife thanks to coordination with Interpol, another police statement said. They are being held in a Spanish jail awaiting extradition proceedings, police said. Politicians, businessman, lawyers, doctors and even members of the prison police were arrested in the second operation, which targeted Mafia leadership around Lamezia Terme, a city in Calabria, another police news release said. Those arrested are accused of crimes including murder, criminal association and extortion, it said. Every year, the release said, the criminal gang made millions of euros through a system of insurance fraud, with the funds used to finance the acquisition of arms and drugs. ""We are particularly satisfied with the investigation,"" Rodolfo Ruperti, police chief of the city of Catanzaro, whose force carried out the Lamezia Terme operation, told CNN by telephone. He said the inquiry shone a spotlight on the ""gray area"" of relations among politicians, businessmen and Mafia groups suspected of carrying out dozens of murders in past years.","Police launch two large-scale anti-Mafia operations in Italy .

"(CNN) -- Judging from the yells and sounds of breaking glass, security guard Richard Shanley thought there was a fight at Summer Bay Resorts' building 104 on Sunday night. Then he listened a little closer. ""I hear people coming out and hollering, 'The building is coming apart!' At that time, I looked down the breezeway, and I could literally see the building coming down in pieces,"" Shanley recalled to CNN on Tuesday. That's when Shanley, who'd been flagged down by one of the guests, hustled door to door, waking guests up to ensure everyone left the building's 24 vacation villas as windows cracked and parts of the building separated. Sinkhole eating family out of house and home . Later that night, much of the three-story structure collapsed into a sinkhole at the central Florida resort near Walt Disney World. The sinkhole -- 110 to 120 feet wide and about 15 feet deep, according to an on-site expert -- swallowed a number of rooms and, with them, clothing and other belongings that the harried guests left behind. But no one was injured, earning Shanley praises from managers of the resort in Clermont, near Orlando. ""I'm proud of his quick thinking and responsiveness,"" the resort's executive vice president, Juan Barillas, told reporters Tuesday morning. One end of the building -- which had held two-bedroom, two-bathroom villas -- still stands, but the rest has become a heap of debris. A guest in another building, Ben Warrick of Des Moines, Iowa, caught the collapse on video camera, showing part of the structure, already cracked and separated from the rest, falling with a loud rumble in the dark of night. Most of the resorts' hundreds of other guests were unaffected -- two other structures were evacuated as a precaution, and the power and gas service that had been cut in some other villas was restored by Tuesday morning. The other bit of relatively good news? There weren't any noticeable changes between Monday and Tuesday, Doug Yovaish, an expert hired by the resort, told CNN around 5 p.m. Tuesday. Still, many of the evacuated guests were without important belongings, such as passports -- items that resort officials say probably won't be recovered. The Red Cross was helping 17 families who were staying at the resort with food and clothing through gift cards. Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . Two buildings evacuated as a precaution are expected to reopen by week's end, a resort executive said. And some guests who left behind their belongings in the most heavily damaged structure will be able to get them back. Others, though, will not. ""They will become part of the demolition,"" said Barillas. The resort is working with county and other officials to ensure foreign guests get new passports and will make sure no guest suffers a financial loss, said the resort president, Paul Caldwell. Caldwell, addressing a reporter's question about whether anyone had seen signs the building was in distress before the evacuation, said the security department had no record of any complaints. Shanley told CNN someone flagged him down around 11 p.m. Sunday, just a few minutes into his shift. He said he banged on guests' doors, waking some of them up. ""I said, 'Get out to the stairwells as quick as you can. Don't worry about grabbing your stuff. Just get out!'"" recalled Shanley, who started working at the resort about two months ago. An interior breezeway connecting parts of the building ""actually started collapsing right after I got there on scene to get the guests out,"" he told reporters in a news conference Tuesday morning. ""I was in the corridors of the breezeway, and the ceilings were actually coming down,"" he said. A couple and their infant escaped through a window because a door frame had collapsed, witness Maggie Ghamry told CNN affiliate WFTV on Monday. ""He, his wife and an infant, he had to break the window so they could escape,"" said Ghamry, who said she escaped with her three children but lost the belongings she'd had in her room. Some guests tossed their luggage over their balconies, WFTV reported. Julian Moreno of San Antonio said he heard strange noises after he was told to evacuate. ""The center balcony, (there was) a lot of noise like popcorn and (banging), like a sledgehammer hitting a concrete block,"" Moreno told WFTV.","NEW: The situation hasn't changed noticeably since Monday, an expert says .

"(CNN) -- Grappling with the fact that his father was a convicted rapist and kidnapper was difficult enough. Throw in the glare of the national media, a burglary and his father's suicide, and Ariel Anthony Castro's life became surreal. Now, the younger Castro is speaking out about his struggles in an essay for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. He wants to set the record straight: ""I'm not my father."" ""I'm still shell-shocked from the way these past several months unfolded. Instantly, my father became one of the most hated men alive,"" he wrote. ""In no time, reporters from around the world demanded to know who this man was and what kind of background he came from. Just like that, my father went from captured to convicted to imprisoned to dead."" He described hiding at a friend's house ""because I was shaken to the core, and I didn't want to be forced to grieve with cameras and microphones pointed at me."" When Castro eventually returned to his home, he noticed someone had broken in, ransacked it and carved an expletive into the front door. He said he's still disgusted and angry about the crimes his father committed. Castro's house demolished . ""He deserved to pay for his actions, every day of those 1,000 years he could possibly serve,"" Castro wrote. ""My anger with him kept me from visiting him in prison, even when he was moved to a facility just 20 minutes away from my doorstep. Coping would have to come before any possibility of a change of heart. But after mere weeks, that window slammed shut."" After his father committed suicide, Castro said he had to deal with reporters who tried to get his ""knee-jerk reaction, wanting to know the whereabouts of my father's remains, waiting for me outside the Franklin County coroner's office."" But he's trying to cope with all the horrible surprises of the past year. ""I learned long ago that it's not worth the effort to actively hate someone who will always be in your life,"" Castro wrote. ""Instead of bidding goodbye and good riddance to Ariel Castro, the question should be, now what? If my father's life and death can lead to changes in how we deal with sexual predators, domestic violence, mental illness and, yes, prison safety, then we should have those discussions. If we can prevent a repeat here or anywhere, then justice truly will have been served amid all the broken pieces my father left behind.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia judge Friday dismissed an emergency motion filed by the ex-wife of music mogul Usher Raymond seeking temporary custody of their son. The judge ruled that even though the 5-year-old child was injured in a swimming pool accident this week, it was not an emergency or crisis situation requiring that Usher's two children be taken from him. The child, Usher Raymond V, remains hospitalized but is doing ""much better,"" his mother posted on Twitter. ""What happened here was an awful accident and... I'm not certain that had any single person been at the poolside that one person could have done any better than Ms. Oden. And Ms. Oden did impress me as a capable caregiver,"" Fulton County Superior Court Judge John Goger said, referring to the boy's aunt, Rena Oden, who was caring for the child at the time of the accident. ""Based on the evidence I heard, not one person could have done any better than Ms. Oden,"" the judge added. The judge then addressed Usher's ex-wife, Tameka Foster Raymond: ""Your standards for caregivers are rather high,"" Goger said, pointing out that most people have been watched by a grandmother or aunt. The judge instructed Usher to keep his ex-wife informed about his whereabouts and who's taking care of their two children. At Friday's emergency custody hearing in Atlanta, Usher, as he is known in his career as a singer and actor, testified that he waited an hour to inform his ex-wife that their son had nearly drowned in a swimming pool accident because ""the first thing to do was to respond to the emergency... My son was hysterical and in the back of an ambulance."" His ex-wife testified earlier that she does not trust the childcare of Raymond's aunt who was present when their son fell into the pool. Foster Raymond also said Usher does not keep her informed about who is taking of their children or the doings in the children's lives. ""They come home with bags of medicine. I don't know why or what illness or who's taking them to the doctor... he doesn't confer with me regarding anything, nothing,"" she told the court. Foster Raymond became extremely emotional after the 911 call made by Usher's aunt was played in court. ""I don't know if my son is going to have a brain defect. I don't know if his heart is operating correctly. I don't know if my son's going to be 100% the boy he was before this incident,"" Foster Raymond said. Foster Raymond said Usher's aunt is incapable of keeping up with the two children. In reference to their other son jumping into the pool to help Usher V, Foster Raymond testified: ""He can't even swim, he was trying to save his brother. That's chaos, that is chaos, that's chaos."" She kept repeating ""that's chaos"" as she wiped her eyes, and the judge told her to get off the stand. Usher testified he's notified Foster Raymond on several occasions about changes to the children's caregivers, contrary to her earlier claims. He also said he's scheduled to be in Atlanta for the remainder of August. The children's activities are outlined in a weekly e-mail, according to Usher. He said he tells Foster Raymond about doctors' visits, summer camps, or travel, including the aliases used to book hotel rooms, in the rare event he travels with the kids. When one attorney tried asking why Usher doesn't update Foster Raymond on his travel plans, the judge jumped in: ""An emergency means life and death -- that these kids are in danger and need to be somewhere else."" The judge told the attorney to move on with her questions. At another point in testimony, the aunt took the stand. Oden said she's disabled because of her back, but she can swim and attends therapy sessions in water. The aunt also said she knows CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, though she needs to be recertified. When asked by Foster Raymond's attorney if she can pick up more than 25 pounds, Oden said: ""Sometimes, it just depends on how my back is feeling. ""I know how to take care of children,"" Oden added. Five-year-old Usher Raymond V is recovering from Monday's accident at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital, according to the lawyer for Foster Raymond. A breathing tube inserted after the accident has since been removed, attorney Angela Kinley told CNN. Usher, won primary custody of the couple's two children, Usher V and 4-year-old Naviyd, last year after a bitter court fight in which Foster Raymond accused the singer of being an absentee father. Foster Raymond filed in May for a custody modification. That case hadn't been heard by the time the swimming pool accident happened Monday, so Foster Raymond filed Tuesday for an emergency hearing on the matter. Timeline: Raymond v. Raymond . Usher's former stepson, also Foster Raymond's son, died in a watercraft accident on a north Georgia lake last year. CNN's Alan Duke reported from Los Angeles, and Rich Philiips reported from Atlanta. Michael Martinez wrote from Los Angeles, and Melissa Gray contributed in Atlanta.","NEW: Judge says babysitting aunt is ""a capable caregiver""

"(CNN) -- The Westgate Mall siege in Kenya has claimed the lives of more than 60 people including the Kenyan president's nephew, at least one Canadian diplomat and American, British, French and Chinese nationals. Al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia, Al-Shabaab, has claimed responsibility for the siege and it has been reported that a number of the militants involved in the attack may have been foreign jihadists from Western nations. Read more: Sources say gunmen still inside Kenyan mall . If true, does the phenomenon of Westerners killing Westerners in Kenya represent a victory for al Qaeda and is this representative of the future of the group's transnational jihad? Does the radicalization of Muslims in the West pose a substantial threat to global security and what can be done to stop it? Al Qaeda has looked to inspire Western Muslims to commit such atrocities for years with help from Anwar al-Awlaki's online sermons and the group's magazine, ""Inspire,"" which has often praised the actions of Western Islamists in their own countries and abroad. Most notably, it commended the Tsarnaev brothers, the alleged Boston bombers as well as Roshonara Choudhary, the young girl from Newham, east who attempted to murder her local parliamentary representative. However, Western Muslims fought in the Afghanistan jihad against the USSR that originally gave rise to al Qaeda as well as in other conflicts in Bosnia, Chechnya, Iraq and Syria. Watch: Did al Qaeda magazine inspire Tsarnaevs? In reality, the numbers of Western Muslims abandoning their lives in the United Kingdom or the United States of America to go and join Al-Shabaab in Somalia is very small. In order to best analyze this phenomenon, they should be separated into three distinct groups: converts to Islam, Western Muslims, such as Abu Usama al-Britani -- a Briton believed to have been killed in Somalia -- and members of the Somali diaspora in Western countries. Read more: American jihadi reportedly killed in Somalia . Converts to Islam are particularly vulnerable to extremist ideologies and narratives because of exploitation by charismatic recruiters. Failures of moderate Muslim communities to welcome converts due to ethnic or regional differences or to answer the political or theological questions that many new converts have often led to their adoption by radical groups such as al Muhajiroun and its offshoots, that invariably have links to Islamist groups present in hot conflicts. Under these radical wings, new converts to Islam are taught a highly politicized version of Islam that invariably focuses on current conflicts around the world, spun with an Islamist narrative that exaggerates the importance and benefits of violent jihad, the need for action against oppressors, or the moral degradation of Westerners and their societies. Read more: Group hails 9/11 'Magnificent 19' These recruits are considered perfect for al Qaeda's future goals as, due to the fact that they are often not targeted for racial profiling and have greater access in their home countries, they can pass between borders relatively risk-free. With an estimated 40,000 Westerners currently living in Kenya, many more visiting as tourists each year, and an area of limited policing on the Somalia-Kenya border, Western members of Al-Shabaab constitute a potentially large threat to the country's security. However, Somalia is not a particularly attractive destination for Western jihadists. When assessed in terms of cohesion and integration, Al-Shabaab is one of the weakest al Qaeda regional affiliates. Due to existing tribal hierarchies and fault lines, Al-Shabaab has significant infighting and is renowned for not being accepting of foreigners. Western Muslim minorities, predominately from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds, therefore face similar issues to white converts when it comes to joining the jihad in Somalia. The recent killing of Abu Osama al-Britani and Abu Mansoor al-Amriki (Omar Hammimi), who had purportedly fallen out with Al-Shabaab's leadership reveals the extent to the lack of cohesion in the group. Read more: American jihadi reportedly killed in Somalia . However, for Islamist groups such as Hizb ut-Tahrir and al-Muhajiroun, this conflict is a well-established part of the radicalizing narrative, in much the same way that Afghanistan, Bosnia and Iraq have been, and will continue to attract Western Islamists with jihadist aspirations. In reality, Al-Shabaab are fighting a more nationalist struggle, clothing it in pseudo-religious garments and will continue to fail to engage significant numbers of Westerners. The Somali expatriate community numbers more than 100,000 in the United Kingdom, 78% of whom reside in London, according to the Office of National Statistics. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates more than 20,000 Somalis reside in the Netherlands and about 89,000 in the U.S. According to Canada's 2011 National Household Survey, more than 44,000 Somalis live within its borders. This is the most likely group of Western Muslims to be making trips to Somalia, and, if Islamists, are those most likely to be accepted by Al-Shabaab. As communities that are often criticized for their lack of integration within Western societies and with some radical community leaders among them, members going to fight in Somalia has long been a concern for Western security services. Of greater immediate concern, however, is the Somali diaspora in Kenya, whom the Kenyan authorities will undoubtedly target in the coming weeks. Al-Shabaab has shown itself to be exceptionally capable, both operationally and in terms of its use of secrecy, and increasingly extreme. According to our sources, while previously with limited operations outside of Somalia, Al-Shabaab conducted the preparation for these attacks months ago and had considerable surveillance in the shopping mall, and is likely delivering retribution against Kenya for its aggressive pursuit of Al-Shabaab in recent years. In whichever way the Western contribution to Al-Shabaab will be depicted by the group for propaganda purposes, its lack of cohesion will continue to curb its effectiveness. The radicalization of Westerners is a significant problem that must be addressed in the United Kingdom and jihadist tourism is an issue in which security services are rightfully investing considerable resources; Somalia is simply the latest destination and not a particularly fashionable one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Russell.","More than 60 people have died in a siege at a shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya .

"(CNN) -- There's always something strange about bumping into an ex. Sometimes it can be satisfying -- perhaps they're looking a bit shabby, or have obviously fallen on hard times. Maybe they've shacked up with someone new who, frankly, isn't much of a looker. Other times the reverse is true -- it's that day you're late for work and haven't had time to shower, or maybe the time you've had a drink too many and end up saying something embarrassing. But most confusing of all is when, in spite of the knowledge of everything that went wrong in the past, that surge of mutual longing just wells right up again. Before you know it you're meeting for a drink and, well, you know the rest. The problem for Chelsea, as for any serial daters, is that their exes are simply everywhere. After rattling through 10 managers in 10 years, barely a month goes by without some awkward encounter to set the mind wondering what might have been. Of course we all know what happened this summer. Fresh from ending a relationship with Rafael Benitez that, while doomed from the start, seemed to be developing into something a little more substantial, Chelsea were confronted with the newly single big love of their lives. We've all seen it happen: two people who seemed so perfect together, but parted in haste, and suddenly they're both available. The outcome is inevitable, and so it was at Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho moved all his stuff back in, started re-arranging the furniture and publicly re-affirming his undying love for the blue part of west London. Now here we are, barely six weeks into the new season, and this time around it seems a little different. Mourinho is as suave as ever, of course; witty press conference quips and a debonair touchline demeanor go a long way to making everything in the garden look rosy. But there's something oddly listless about his team. To begin with, there's the question of the midfield. Juan Mata, the darling of fantasy football league managers everywhere, has been the lynchpin of so many good things about Chelsea since he signed; but from the moment Mourinho took charge the former Valencia maestro's place has looked in doubt. Meanwhile, fellow attacking midfielders Oscar and Eden Hazard, while outrageously gifted, seem to pose more questions than answers. How do they play together? Do they have the physical stature to impose themselves on more abrasive opponents? Add in the return of another attacking midfielder, the exciting Kevin de Bruyne, loaned out successfully to Werder Bremen last term, along with the addition of buccaneering wide man Andre SchÃÂ¼rrle, and there is a wealth of riches in the middle of the park. Odd then that Mourinho chose to gazump one of Chelsea's most recent and perhaps bitter exes, Tottenham Hotspur boss Andre Villas Boas, and divert -- you guessed it -- yet another attacking midfielder, Willian, to Stamford Bridge. How to fit any combination of these together into a usable whole, not least in the mayhem of England's rough and ready Premier League, is quite a conundrum. Right now Mourinho's first choice midfield is anyone's guess. Then there's the front line. The football jury returned a verdict on Fernando Torres some time ago, and few would describe his time at Chelsea in anything more than tepid terms at best. The fact that Mourinho has kept him on may owe more to an absence of realistic suitors than a desire to be the one who finally made things work with the Spaniard, but keep him he has. Demba Ba has also struggled somewhat since joining from Newcastle, but while reports suggested he might have been off elsewhere, possibly to Arsenal, he has also stuck around. Blog: Are Manchester United still the team to beat? Romelo Lukaku, another fantasy league favorite after a prolific season at West Bromwich Albion, seemed like the kind of rough diamond, with more than a little of Didier Drogba about his physique, that Mourinho could make shine. But after an agonizing missed spot-kick at the end of 10-man Chelsea's spirited Super Cup final defeat against Bayern Munich, he will now be lining up in the blue shirt of Everton this season. With another former Chelsea man, Daniel Sturridge, setting Merseyside alight with his goals, it seems odd to let such potential go. Competitive Premier League . Then there was the pursuit of Wayne Rooney. Yes the Manchester United striker had frustrated former boss Alex Ferguson and needled his club's own fans more than once with his apparent desire to flee Old Trafford, and new manager David Moyes offered mixed messages about the forward's future. But there always seemed something slightly implausible about the idea of the Red Devils letting Rooney join one of their title rivals. And like Arsenal's myopic lust for Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, Chelsea's pursuit of Rooney seemed to become an obsession, while other possible targets such as Edinson Cavani and Falcao slipped through the Blues' net. Finally, veteran striker Samuel Eto'o put pen to paper. While it is fair to say the 32 year old was unlikely to have been at the top of Mourinho's summer shopping list, he brings formidable experience and undoubted talent to the front. Whether the flesh matches the mind and spirit will become clear in time, but this has not been the impact signing one would usually associate with a Chelsea summer. None of this may have mattered much a few years ago, when the strength of this squad would probably have been enough to see the team through to a top two berth. But the Premier League is quite a different place to the one Mourinho left. In fact it's fair to say it's a pretty different place to one of even a year ago. Yes, Alex Ferguson's departure may yet have a negative impact on United, who haven't exactly handed Moyes the keys to the vault; but while Manchester City also have major changes to absorb, they look fiercely competitive on paper. Elsewhere a resurgent Liverpool, a surprisingly effective Arsenal, and an intriguing Tottenham mean this year's race is a tough one to call. Chelsea are in the mix, of that there is no doubt; but after their worst start to a Premier League campaign since owner Roman Abramovich took over it is difficult to cast them as favorites. Ancelotti and Benitez . Perhaps the most interesting element in all of this is the performance of two other Chelsea exes. Carlo Ancelotti, fresh from a triumphant season in France in which Paris Saint-Germain cruised to the Ligue 1 title and very nearly sprung a shock against Barcelona in the Champions League, has taken the helm at Real Madrid with steely assurance. Three wins from four La Liga games and a crushing 6-1 Champions League victory over Galatasaray in Istanbul mark a team that looks well on track. Ancelotti's departure from Chelsea was perhaps the most difficult to comprehend of all of this most capricious of clubs' break-ups. Given his record he looks more than capable of delivering the success Real fans crave. Meanwhile, down in Italy's Campania region, Rafael Benitez's start at Napoli -- with a markedly changed team -- has been hugely impressive. The Azzurri appear to have gelled immediately, as a series of dynamic and passionate performances fired them to the top of Serie A with a 100% start. And that was before they dismantled a supremely talented Borussia Dortmund side in their first Champions League tie. Benitez -- the most unloved of former Chelsea partners -- looks to have found his perfect match in the shadow of Vesuvius. As a bewildered looking Chelsea side left the field on Wednesday after their shock 2-1 home Champions League defeat to Basel, it was hard not to wonder if -- in the heat of the moment -- they had fallen back into the arms of the wrong ex. That sensation was only compounded when the Portuguese accused his team of lacking ""emotional maturity"" in a post-match interview. He was quick to shoulder the blame for the defeat in later exchanges, but there was a sense of alarm bells quietly ringing, especially with the news that Abramovich had joined his manager in the home dressing room for the post-match post-mortem. After a fractious, draining and unfulfiling 2012-203 season with Real Madrid, which Mourinho himself admitted was the ""worst of his career"", was a rekindled romance with a past love, however heartfelt, simply chasing a passionate affair that had already run its course? Early days it may be, but it will be interesting to see whether chapter two of this great romance evolves into another bitter divorce or a case of happily ever after.","Jose Mourinho watched his Chelsea team lose 2-1 to Basel on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Police have arrested four men in connection with a Chicago shooting that wounded 13 people, including a 3-year-old boy, authorities said Tuesday. Two of the four suspects -- Tabari Young, 22, and Bryon Champ, 21 -- fired shots in the incident, Chicago police said. All four have been charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, police said. Young is accused of firing an assault-style rifle used in the shooting. Police say Champ also fired a gun during the incident. A third suspect, Kewane Gatewood, 20, is accused of supplying the assault weapon, and Brad Jeff, 22, was allegedly the lookout during the shooting, police said. ""Our officers and our detectives have worked tirelessly in partnership with the community, to solve this case and hold the criminals who committed this senseless act of violence responsible for their actions,"" Chicago Police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy said in a statement. In all, 13 people were shot Thursday at the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. The shooting victims included 3-year-old Deonta Howard and two 15-year-olds. All the victims survived. 'It's got to stop,' Grandmother says after 3-year-old shot in Chicago . Deonta's grandmother made a plea to those fueling violence in Chicago. ""Y'all out here killing these innocent people, kids, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers: It's got to stop. You need to stop,"" Semehca Nunn said. An assault-style rifle with a high-capacity magazine was used in the shooting, which appears to be gang-related, McCarthy has said. One of the alleged shooters, Champ, is a documented gang member, police said. Chicago bans some semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines and restricts handguns. The FBI's annual crime report last week showed Chicago had 500 homicides in 2012, up from 431 in 2011 and more than any other American city. Chicago officials have said homicides this year are below the 2012 pace. Still, Chicago does not have the highest homicide rate in the United States. That distinction belongs to Flint, Michigan, with one homicide for every 1,613 residents, according to the FBI data. Detroit is close behind, with one killing for every 1,832 residents. In 2012, the number of violent crimes increased by 0.7%, compared with the previous year, according to the FBI figures. For Chicago, 7 weekend homicides represent progress . CNN's Mariano Castillo and David Simpson contributed to this report.","NEW: Four arrests are made, including two alleged shooters .

"(CNN) -- Angela Merkel has come a long way. Once dismissed by hard-core conservative critics as ""the divorced, childless, Protestant woman from former East Germany"", the German chancellor's landslide victory in Sunday's Bundestag elections has reinforced her position as the uncontested political leader in Germany and the rest of Europe. For a few hours Sunday night, Merkel's center-right CDU/CSU parties seemed even within striking distance of an absolute majority of seats, a feat only West German CDU ""Uber-Chancellor"" Konrad Adenauer achieved in 1957. Under the rules of Germany's complex electoral system, the Conservatives received 41.5% of the vote but 49.3% of the seats (five members short of an absolute majority in the 630-strong Bundestag). Above all, Sunday's elections have confirmed that a vast majority of Germans are supportive of Berlin's handling of the European sovereign debt crisis -- and specifically, Germany providing financial backing in return for structural and fiscal reforms in crisis-hit Eurozone countries. In contrast to other major Western leaders who are struggling at home, Merkel's calm, disciplined and unpretentious approach to governing resonates with many German voters who feel confident she will protect them against the uncertainties and crises abroad. By firmly occupying the German political center (""Die Mitte"") Merkel has successfully marginalized the SPD/Green opposition parties (she even decided to phase out nuclear power). Add to that Germany's strong economic performance and low unemployment figures and you have the secret recipe behind the success of Angela Merkel. Even CDU/CSU party insiders were surprised at the magnitude of her election victory (an increase of 7.7 percentage points compared to 2009), especially since successive bail-out packages, the European Central Bank's aggressive bond buying, as well as the European Stability Mechanism fund have increased Germany's Eurozone liability exposure to hundreds of billions of Euros. In late August, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, a close Merkel ally, caused some political consternation within the center-right camp when he alluded to the possibility that Germany may need to sign off on a third bailout package for Greece. Schaeuble's comments, while politically risky, seemed to confirm what many economists have suspected all along: namely that the Greek drama is not over, that Athens will ultimately need significant debt forgiveness to regain its footing, and that there are other Eurozone countries -- ranging from Portugal to Ireland, Slovenia and Cyprus -- that will soon be asking for more (German) money. Yet Sunday, even the resurgent anti-Euro ""Alternative for Germany,"" or AFD, party missed the 5% threshold needed to enter parliament, thus providing relief among international investors that Berlin is not beginning to pull the financial plug on the rest of Europe any time soon. Quite to the contrary, since the demoralized pro-business FDP party failed to enter the Bundestag for the first time since 1949. Merkel will now have to find a new coalition partner and could theoretically either join forces with the Social Democrats, known as the SPD, or the Greens. Both opposition parties have frequently criticized the outgoing center-right government for putting too much emphasis on austerity rather than on growth measures to kick-start the fledgling Eurozone economies. The SPD and Greens are also strong supporters of the controversial Eurobonds that have been categorically rejected by Merkel for fear they would remove all incentives for individual European countries to get their fiscal and economic houses in order. While Merkel is going to stand firm in her opposition to Eurobonds a new German government with either the Social Democrats or the Greens on board would be more open to making concessions on the planned European banking union, especially regarding the proposed single resolution authority mechanism to be placed within the European Central Bank. Pretty much everything will depend on the internal horse-trading during the upcoming coalition talks between CDU/CSU and SPD and Greens, respectively. Ultimately, most political observers agree that Merkel's next government (and her last since she has already said she won't run again in 2017) will probably be a relaunch of the Grand Coalition with the SPD that she led during 2005-2009. While the SPD is rather reluctant to enter into such a deal (after all, it scored its worst post-war result in the 2009 elections), the party knows full well that a Grand Coalition is the preferred option for a majority of German voters. In theory, getting the SPD on board should also help Merkel break the political gridlock that has gripped German politics since the opposition SPD, Green and Left parties retain control of Germany's upper chamber (the Bundesrat), which nowadays needs to approve about half of all German laws. From an American perspective, the re-election of Angela Merkel is definitely good news and promises a certain stability and continuity in an otherwise rather weak and fluid European political leadership landscape. In principle, the Chancellor's commitment to free trade should also provide valuable political cover for the planned U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership at a time when protectionist sentiments are running high, especially in France and the Southern European countries. That being said, as evidenced by the Syria crisis, a future Merkel administration that includes either the SPD or the Greens would probably be even more reluctant to use military force abroad than the outgoing center-right coalition government. Merkel's victory in the 2013 Bundestag elections is of historic proportions. Political commentators are already speaking about ""the era of Merkel"" and note that the woman who spent well over half of her adult life in East Germany is even beginning to eclipse her one-time mentor Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the father of Germany's reunification in 1990. The next four years will determine whether Merkel's leadership and handling of the Eurozone crisis will keep the European project together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ulf Gartzke.","Angela Merkel's parties scored big victories in Sunday's Bundestag elections .

"(CNN) -- Mobile gaming has become a staple for casual gamers looking for fun with friends or just a quick match while killing some time. Now, one hardware company thinks hard-core gamers are ready to take their action on the move, too. Razer revealed a dedicated gaming tablet called Edge on Tuesday, the official opening day of the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Calling it ""a tablet, a PC and a console,"" Razer is convinced games like ""Battlefield 3"" now have a place on mobile devices. The company has filled the new tablet with a Windows 8 operating system and hardware based on suggestions from fans and consumers. After the idea was announced at last year's CES as Project Fiona, designers asked more than 10,000 people what specs they wanted and how much they would be willing to pay. The end result for Edge is a third-generation Intel Core processor, NVIDIA GeForce graphics and more memory than any other tablet currently on the market. The tablet will be offered in two different versions, the basic Edge and the Edge Pro. The basic Edge will feature an Intel Core i5 processor, NVIDIA GT640M LE graphics and 64 GB of storage. The Pro upgrades the processor to an Intel Core i7 and boosts the storage to 128 GB or 256 GB, depending on the consumer's desired configuration. But Razer wasn't satisfied with just a traditional tablet. Saying that gamers want flexibility in how and where they play, Razer will offer optional accessories to allow players to customize their gaming experiences through hardware attachments. A keyboard dock with mouse port turns the tablet into a more traditional PC setup. A Gamepad controller attachment can turn the Edge into a hand-held console capable of playing PC games that allow joystick and button configurations. The tablet fits inside the Gamepad with a joystick and buttons on the right and another joystick with a directional pad on the left. Review: Razer Blade gaming laptop sleek, powerful, pricey . Finally, there is a docking station allowing for multiple controllers (looking very much like Xbox controllers) as well as USB ports and an HDMI port for hooking up to a television and treating it like a home console. Both tablet versions as well as all the optional accessories will be available online during the first quarter of 2013. A bundle package featuring the Pro model and the gamepad controller is headed to retail stores. Now the big question -- the cost. During the crowdsourcing, Razer said, gamers indicated they would be willing to pay from $1,300 to $1,500 for a dedicated gaming tablet capable of playing PC games. The company announced at CES that pricing will begin at $999 for the basic Edge tablet, but did not indicate costs for the Pro or accessories. Will hard-core gamers be willing to shell out more than $1,000 just to take their PC games with them when they travel? Brian Jang, a marketing manager at Razer, said during the pre-release briefing: ""With more than 10,000 people in just three months telling us what they want in a tablet, we knew we were onto something. If just 1,000 people had responded, we probably wouldn't have made it.""","Razer calls its new product ""a tablet, a PC and a console""

Blaze's inventor, Emily Brooke, a physics student turned product designer, came up with the idea while she was studying at Brighton university. ""While studying I knew the problem that I wanted to tackle very clearly: sideswiping or blind spot incidents where vehicles turn across a cyclist's path."" Incidences of cycling fatalities remain a problem in most major capitals around the world. As more and more commuters travel to work on two wheels rather than four, a myriad of new safety equipment, infrastructure and road rules are being introduced to keep cyclists out of harm's way. In many cities in the U.S. and beyond, cycling is on the rise. According to statistics published by Governing Data, cycling has grown exponentially in most major U.S. cities since 2006. In London cycling has more than doubled in the last decade and in many cities in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, cycling now accounts for more than 20% of urban trips. In spite of a gradual decline, urban cycling also remains hugely popular across China. Brooke says that her primary motivation for inventing the Blaze was to improve cyclist safety: . ""Last year over 3,000 people were killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads alone. We have over half a million people cycle in London every day and the fatality statistics are really terrifying. Over a hundred people were killed last year. The fact that I really wanted to focus on was the 79% of cyclists hit were travelling straight ahead and a vehicle turned into them so that was the one cyclist that I really focused on in designing Blaze,"" Brooke says. Blaze is a front-mounted light powered by bright LEDs that also projects a green laser image of a bicycle onto the road to let motorists know a cyclist is coming. The aim is to help prevent vehicles from turning across a cyclist's path of cyclists by increasing their 'footprint' on the road. It is one of a new crop of tech products aimed at improving cyclist safety. The annual Interbike conference, which opens next week, will showcase a large number of new products including a device that emits high frequency audio signals to keep pursuing dogs at bay. Also being launched soon is a set of 'smart handle bars' fitted with LED lights that adjust to your environment and speed. They will also track your bike via SMS if it is stolen. Pure Fix Cycles have a glow-in-the-dark bike frame to light up your entire bicycle at night. Dr Graham Hole, a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Sussex, says that increasing visibility could be critical to keeping cyclists safe: ""Brooke's invention could be a major aid to detecting cyclists. It gives the driver advance warning of a cyclist's approach ... it has the potential to make a significant difference to cyclists' safety on the roads."" Read more: 12 amazing designs from the past 100 years . Carlton Reid, editor of BikeBiz agrees that products that aim to increase cyclist visibility could be useful in preventing accidents: ""Anything that increases conspicuity has got to be a good thing, although in the UK cyclists and motorcyclists have a saying about those motorists who knock into us. We call such collisions: SMIDSYs -- 'sorry mate I didn't see you.'"" Many cyclists believe that rather than developing new technology, safe cycling requires changes in the attitudes and behaviors of road users. Andy Clarke, President of the League of American Bicyclists says: ""Clearly, better bike infrastructure encourages more riders, makes things safer for both cyclists and motorists, and encourages better behavior by riders -- all of which are good things. ""But perhaps more fundamental than any road design or technological fix attached to cars or bikes is an improvement in operator behavior! Getting drivers to pay attention and be a little more patient (with everybody, not just cyclists) would make the world of difference out there. Distracted, drunk, drugged, drowsy and just plain poor driving is a real scourge -- especially if you are on foot or on a bike.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Three suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal region killed at least 21 suspected militants Friday, Pakistani intelligence officials said. All three strikes occurred in the Khyber Agency, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The attacks come as the strikes are expanding into new areas of Pakistan for the first time, and they may signal an extension of the hunt for terrorists along the border with Afghanistan. Two Pakistani intelligence officials said the first attack was on a militant hideout in Sippah village, in the area of the Tirah valley, where seven people died. The second was on a militant hideout in the village of Nakai, where eight more were killed. In the third strike, two missiles were fired on a militant training center in the village of Sangana in Tirah Valley, killing six suspected militants, the two intelligence officials said. The strikes targeted a local militant group, Lashkar-e-Islam (Mangal Bagh group) in Khyber Agency, the officials said. Ali Marjan, an important local commander of Lashkar-e-Islam, was killed in the first strike. The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes, but the United States is the only country known to have the ability to launch missiles in the region from remote-controlled aircraft. In the past, the strikes have focused on North and South Waziristan, but the intelligence officials said many militant leaders have been pushed out of those areas by the drone activity, relocating to areas further north like Khyber. On Thursday, a Pakistani Intelligence official confirmed the first drone strike in Khyber, where a suspected drone fired two missiles and killed 7 militants. Based on a count by the CNN Islamabad bureau, Friday's strikes bring the total for the year to 106 this year, compared to 52 in all of 2009.

"(CNN) -- Tanzanian police have arrested 15 suspects following the latest acid attacks on the island of in recent months. Most of the suspects arrested Tuesday had acid in their possession and experience working with it, said Mussa Ali Mussa, a local police commissioner. Attackers hurled acid at a Catholic priest as he was leaving an internet cafe last week, the third such unprovoked assault in two months. The Rev. Joseph Anselmo Mwagambwa, who was attacked Friday in Zanzibar, is undergoing treatment at the mainland city of Dar es Salaam. Last month, two British teenagers were walking unaccompanied when men on a motorcycle threw acid on their chests and hands in Zanzibar, officials said. Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup, both 18, were attacked in Stone Town, the island's historic center. They had been working as volunteer teachers on the island. In another incident in July, a businessman who had built a mall close to the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam was also injured in an acid attack, Tanzanian media reported. The attacks occurred at a time when Islamist extremism is escalating in the area, which has a Muslim majority. The government has said it will consider regulating the purchase of acid and other related products, and warned such attacks will damage the island's tourism industry.

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Thousands of apparel workers clashed with police in Bangladesh, demanding higher pay on Monday, police and officials said. The workers are demanding a minimum monthly pay of $104 revising the present $38 a month. Police said violence mostly erupted in Gazipur and Savar, on the outskirts of capital Dhaka, where there are hundreds of apparel factories producing clothes for leading global brands from Europe and America. The workers fought pitched battles with police and set fire to vehicles and part of some apparel factories in Gazipur, forcing the owners to shut down all factories in Gazipur district and its adjoining areas. Factories face inspections after safety deal . Several thousand workers also took to the streets in capital Dhaka, but they were dispersed by police and did not appear to commit any violence. A cabinet minister Shahjahan Khan after a meeting with the factory owners and representatives of the workers called for calm and asked the workers to return to work. 16 days buried in the rubble . Khan himself led a huge rally of the apparel workers in the capital on Saturday, demanding $104 as minimum monthly wage for the workers. The recent unrest began Saturday when workers were denied leave from the factories to join Khan's rally. Inside a Bangladesh garment factory . Khan, however, at a news briefing on Monday said the unrest might be linked to outsider involvement, but did not give any details. ""Additional forces will be deployed to maintain law and order in the industrial districts,"" said Khan, also a transport labor leader. Promise of a new start after recovery efforts in building collapse . The government recently constituted a wage board for fixing minimum wages for apparel workers, but the board was yet to come to a final decision, while the owners offered a 20% rise. Bangladesh earns about $20 billion a year, 80% of the total export, by selling clothes to European and American brands.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Slathered in a thick coat of sunscreen, Australian endurance swimmer Chloe McCardel leapt into the waters off Havana on Wednesday in her bid to swim the Straits of Florida. If successful, McCardel will set a world record for the longest unassisted swim. She said she expected her marathon swim through shark- and jelly fish-infested waters to take 60 hours. ""I think it will all work out well,"" McCardel, 28, said Wednesday minutes before diving into the calm waters off the Cuban capital. ""It will be tough though; it's not going to be an easy ride. But we will get through it as a team."" The attempt has cost around $150,000 to finance, McCardel said earlier. She said she hopes to raise money for cancer research and try to improve U.S.-Cuba relations. Each stroke the Australian swimmer takes will be monitored by teammates in two boats escorting her and by scientists at three universities in the United States. But other than liquid meals handed to her in a bottle every half-hour by a kayacker paddling near her, McCardel said she would not receive help during the long-distance swim and not use any swim aids such as flippers or a wet suit. In 1997, fellow Australian Susie Maroney swam the straits from inside a shark cage. Since then, several high-profile attempts to cross the Florida Straits without a shark cage have been attempted. All have failed. McCardel said she would use ""a shark shield"" device that emits an electromagnetic pulse to keep away hungry predators. She also possibly will be exposed to jellyfish stings as she is forgoing a full-body suit that would offer some protection. Such a suit would also offer her warmth during the marathon swim. But McCardel, who has completed six solo crossings of the English Channel, said she doesn't think water temperature will be a major factor. ""I have been sweating swimming here,"" she said. McCardel said she thinks her greatest advantage will be a team of scientists who have studied the lessons of previous failed attempts and will be in constant touch with people on the boats accompanying her, supplying weather and ocean current updates. ""We can turn a negative situation into a positive one,"" said Bob Olin, McCardel's boat captain who has participated in four previous attempts by swimmers to cross the Florida Straits. ""We can't afford a negative; we can't go backward."" Despite the technology and people assisting her, McCardel will ultimately be alone with her thoughts in the water as she struggles for hour after hour to reach the Florida Keys. ""If I ever get frustrated, I think about something positive to help propel me forward,"" she said. ""I visualize the finish, what it will be like when I walk up on shore.""

"(CNN) -- The linguists have spoken and they have decided -- ""Occupy"" is 2011's word of the year. Members of the American Dialect Society came out in record numbers to vote Friday night at the organization's annual conference, held this year in Portland, Oregon. ""Occupy"" won a runoff vote by a whopping majority, earning more votes than ""FOMO"" (an acronym for ""Fear of Missing Out,"" describing anxiety over being inundated by the information on social media) and ""the 99%,"" (those held to be at a financial or political disadvantage to the top moneymakers, the one-percenters). Occupy joins previous year's winners, ""app,"" ""tweet,"" and ""bailout."" ""It's a very old word, but over the course of just a few months it took on another life and moved in new and unexpected directions, thanks to a national and global movement,"" Ben Zimmer, chair of the New Words Committee for the American Dialect Society, said in a statement. The Occupy Wall Street movement began in September in Lower Manhattan, before spreading to communities around the country and the world as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth and other issues. Founded in 1889, the American Dialect Society is made up of ""academics, linguists, anyone involved in the specialization of language,"" according to Grant Barrett, the society's vice president. Barrett, who also co-hosts ""A Way with Words,"" a public radio program about language, said the annual conference provides an opportunity for linguistics professionals and graduate students to share information and research. But Barrett says the word of the year vote, now in its 22nd year is, ""light-hearted and whimsical."" Nominations for the word of the year are submitted by society members in attendance at the annual conference, but can also be submitted by the community at large. ""Occupy"" may have taken top honors, but several other words and phrases received recognition. ""Mellencamp,"" a woman who has aged out of being a ""cougar"" (after John Cougar Mellencamp), and ""kardash,"" a unit of measurement consisting of 72 days, after the short-lived marriage of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, were both recognized in the ""Most Creative"" category. Barrett said many of the nominated words that have significance now likely won't stand the test of time. For instance, ""Tebowing"" and ""9-9-9"" were quite popular in 2011, but Barrett doubts they'll last very long. Some words are just outright unnecessary -- like Charlie Sheen's ""bi-winning,"" a term he used to describe himself pridefully, dismissing accusations of being bipolar, and ""amazeballs,"" a slang form of amazing. In the most outrageous category, ""deather"" -- one who doubts the official story of the killing of Osama bin Laden -- was recognized. While all in good fun and a chance for ""good-natured intelligent people to let their hair down,"" Barrett hopes the word of the year vote conveys two important messages to even the purist of linguists: ""Language change is normal. Language change is interesting.""","The word occupy ""took on another life"" in 2011, American Dialect Society member says .

"(CNN) -- Country singer Randy Travis remained under heavy sedation and in critical condition Friday, two days after surgery relieved pressure on his brain after a stroke, his publicist said. ""His family continues to ask for prayers and support,"" publicist Kirt Webster said in a statement. His stroke was ""a complication of his congestive heart failure"" for which he is being treated at The Heart Hospital at Baylor Plano in Texas, Webster said. The singer was initially hospitalized Sunday at Baylor Medical Center at McKinney, Texas, with a presumptive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Travis, 54, was transferred to The Heart Hospital at Baylor Plano in Texas on Monday. Travis' illness is related to his ""recently acquired viral cardiomyopathy,"" one of his doctors said. Viral cardiomyopathy is a disorder where a virus attacks the muscles of the heart, causing the heart to beat slower, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website. In some cases, the heart can stop, it said. Opinion: Randy Travis taught me country . Travis had a tough year in 2012 with arrests for assault and public intoxication, which earned him probation. Travis was at the forefront of the ""New Traditionalist"" movement in the 1980s and 1990s, but he faded as the '90s wore on. He made a comeback after turning to gospel music in 1999.

"(CNN) -- Brits abroad might sometimes garner a reputation on a par with ""ugly Americans,"" yet they rarely elicit a reaction as strong as one coming out of Greece this week. Following the killing of a young British tourist on Crete last week, the Greek island is considering setting up segregated nightlife zones for tourists -- and other tourist hot spots in the country may follow suit. Tyrell Matthews-Burton, a 19-year-old Londoner, was stabbed in a brawl outside a bar in the Cretan resort of Malia on July 23 while celebrating his birthday. The death comes in the wake of news that three British women have reportedly been raped in Malia in the past week. Debauched . Young British tourists, often abroad for the first time, form the bulk of visitors to Malia, as they do to resorts notorious for debauched behavior on other Greek islands. Closely followed by Germans, Britons outnumber any other nationality visiting Greece. Matthews-Burton's death has lent impetus to Malia's consideration of plans to establish tourist ""ghettos"" in a strip outside the town, following increasing complaints from islanders. New planning laws would allow clubs, bars and quad-bike racecourses to be established in a closely monitored enclave away from the town center, the Guardian reports. ""We are considering ... setting up special zones outside the town ... for young visitors who insist on behaving like this and locals who want to go on hosting them,"" said Zacharias Doxastakis, mayor of the town Matt Barrett, author of one of the most popular online Greek travel guides, Greecetravel.com, says has become like the Bahamas ""with moussaka."" Island summit . Malia's plan is attracting interest from other Greek islands flooded by pleasure-seeking tourists in the summer high season. The mayors of Zakynthos, Crete, Corfu, Rhodes and Kos are to hold a mini-summit in Athens later this year, where the issue of riotous tourists will be discussed. ""As we all face similar problems, we will meet in October to discuss taking further measures to deal with them,"" Doxastakis said. Greece faces a dilemma in implementing measures such as Malia's proposed tourist zone, which would in effect punish some travelers to the country. With its sunny weather, beautiful beaches and widely appealing cuisine, Greece -- especially its thousands of islands -- has long presented a paradise to tourists from colder, grayer northern European climes. Package tours . With the explosion of package tourism in the 1960s and 1970s, Greece became accessible to young people who previously wouldn't have been able to afford foreign travel. Tourism some time ago surpassed shipping as the country's largest industry and is responsible for 20% of its income. The Greek economic crisis makes imposing sanctions upon tourists difficult, but the country's dependence on the industry has long had a flip side. Escaping home has often meant escaping its moral restraints, especially for young, relatively inexperienced travelers. Increasingly popular all-inclusive holiday packages, including free drinks, in many Greek resorts exacerbate the tendency to wildly licentious behavior -- ""Brits being bad abroad,"" in shorthand. ""Tour operators [and] commission-seeking reps"" even encourage such behavior on Crete and other islands, according to the Observer. However, it seems that, despite the money, some Greeks have had enough. ""Greece can't go on being a playground for everyone to live out his or her desire,"" Doxastakis told the Guardian. Will it work? Would Malia's plan for a tourist ""ghetto"" work? The island needs ""to train their police to deal with all possible situations,"" Matt Barrett tells CNN, ""plus hold individual clubs accountable for the behavior of their patrons. ""Sending young people off to some party ghetto where they can do whatever they want is not going to make them behave responsibly. It just sends the message that anything goes in these areas.""","Stabbing of British teen spurs resort's plans for tourist 'ghetto'

"(CNN) -- For the first time, Saudi Arabia sent two women to the Olympics -- Wojdan Shaherkani and Sarah Attar, who will compete in judo and track and field. But their participation is far from a groundbreaking step for Saudi women. It was touch and go whether one of the Saudi women, Shaherkani, would even participate this year when the president of the International Federation of Judo said women wearing headscarves would not be allowed to compete for fear of choking and injury. The issue has been resolved and she will participate in a form of headgear that complies with Saudi's strict Islamic dress codes for women. But if Shaherkani had withdrawn, it would not have been a setback for Saudi women because her inclusion was not a sign of advancement. The presence of Saudi women is the result of several months of pressure by the International Olympics Committee on Saudi Arabia to include women competitors or face being banned from participation. The situation for female athletes in Saudi Arabia is bleak. Saudi women in general are denied the right to practice sports. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that prevents girls from taking part in sports in government schools. Physical education is allowed only in private schools. Women are not allowed to play in official sports clubs or even watch matches in stadiums. Girls' football, volleyball and basketball games in private schools and colleges are held secretly. Because of this ban, finding women with Olympic level training was a kind of mission impossible. Only a few days before its July announcement that the two women would attend, the Saudi National Olympic Committee said it could not find a woman qualified enough to compete. Most Muslim-majority countries have sent female athletes to compete in the Olympics for decades. More Muslim women are competing in sports today than ever. But even when women are included, competition remains a challenge, particularly because of athletic dress codes. In 2007, the International Federation of Association Football issued a ban on the hijab or headscarf. But this year, FIFA has lifted the ban after testing new hijabs specifically designed for athletes. In sports and in daily life, women have few rights in Saudi Arabia. The country, according to a Human Rights Watch report, has one of worst records on women's rights in the world. Women are treated as legal minors and often must have a man's permission to leave their homes, seek medical care, participate in public life, study, go to government offices and courts or even make decisions for their children. The genders are strictly segregated. Women cannot drive. It would be tempting to see the Saudi's decision to include women in the Olympics as a big step forward. But as Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said: ""An 11th hour change of course to avoid a ban does not alter the dismal and unequal conditions for women and girls in Saudi Arabia."" The signs of change for Saudi women are yet to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jocelyne Cesari.","Jocelyne Cesari: It's not an advance that Saudi Arabia sent two women to the Olympics .

"Athens (CNN) -- German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble is visiting Athens on Thursday for the first time since Greece received its first bailout three years ago, hours after the Greek parliament voted through a bill paving the way for thousands of public sector jobs to be cut. His visit also comes a day ahead of a European Union deadline for Greece to meet targets before it gets its next round of bailout money. Germany, seen as the driving force behind international creditors' insistence on austerity and reforms, has been the focus of much anger among Greeks suffering as a result of the country's debt crisis. Newspaper headlines Thursday reflect that sentiment. The newspaper Avgi says ""Ave Schaeuble, those about to die salute you,"" a reference to a phrase attributed to Roman gladiators as they greeted their emperor. A headline in another paper, To Pontiki, refers to ""the exterminator"" and shows Schaeuble about to run over civil servants on a rail track. While in Greece, Schaeuble has meetings scheduled with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras. The measures that were voted through early Thursday had to be approved in order for Greece to receive the latest 6.8 billion-euro slice of international bailout funds -- needed to keep the country afloat. The bill scraped through, with just 153 lawmakers out of the 293 present in the 300-seat parliament voting in favor. There were protesters outside the parliament building late into the night while the vote was taking place. Greek police banned public gatherings and marches in much of central Athens from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday for security reasons, applying similar restrictions to those imposed during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in October. But Greece's main opposition party, the Coalition of the Radical Left, Syriza, issued a statement calling for a rally Thursday evening ""against the architect of the bailout austerity policies"" at a square near parliament. In its statement, Syriza said that ""if the government is not hesitant about issuing dictatorial decisions banning gatherings, then the people must show that they have no fear for them."" 'Better days will come' Under the new legislation, 4,000 civil servants, including teachers, could be out of work this year. Another 25,000 will be on a ""mobility scheme"" by the end of the year. This will allow them an eight-month period to look for re-employment while receiving 75% of their salary. If by the end of that period they have not found work in a different department, they could lose their job. A total of 15,000 are expected to be out of work by the end of 2014 to comply with the requirements of Greece's lenders, the International Monetary Fund, European Union and European Central Bank, which are asking for a slimming down of Greece's inflated public sector. But for ordinary Greeks, who are facing unprecedented unemployment raging above 27%, the fear is that if they lose their job, they will not be able to find another in the Greek market. Only hours before the vote, Samaras announced Greece's first tax cut since the crisis began nearly four years ago. He said Greece ""will not relax"" in its efforts, adding, ""We will continue climbing up the hill, we will reach the top, which is not far, and better days will come for our people."" The cut in the value-added tax in the food service sector, from 23% to 13%, had been an issue in negotiations with Greece's lenders for months. The timing of the announcement could be seen as a signal of the government's willingness to boost the private sector, while downsizing the bloated public service. Many Greeks believe the private sector has suffered a disproportionate amount during the crisis in order not to shed public sector jobs. On Tuesday, Greek unions called the country's fourth general strike of the year so far, bringing many public services to a halt. At least 16,000 protesters joined a peaceful march and protest held to coincide with the strike, Athens police said. Greece, the first country to receive a European Union bailout, in May 2010, is struggling to bring its huge public debt under control. The country is in its sixth straight year of recession, and unemployment stood at 26.8% as of March of this year, according to official figures. The jobless rate among young people in Greece has soared to nearly 60%. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou reported in Athens, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","NEW: Security is high during Wolfgang Schaeuble's visit, but opposition party calls for a rally .

"(CNN) -- Selena Gomez is ready to show off a new side. She's starred in a TV movie sequel to her hit Disney series, ""Wizards of Waverly Place,"" and the edgy, R-rated drama, ""Spring Breakers,"" and this month the former teen queen is celebrating her 21st birthday, releasing her fourth studio album and rehearsing for her first arena tour. With the release of her new LP, ""Stars Dance,"" the world is getting a glimpse of a more adult Gomez. CNN sat down with the multi-hyphenate on the morning of her birthday, and she opened up about how much she's grown since leaving teendom behind. ""The past year and a half has been really transitional for me, just personally, as well as transitioning into becoming a woman,"" she said. ""I still feel like I'm 15 sometimes and then other times, I'm wanting to feel comfortable in my body and my skin."" For this album, Gomez drew inspiration from her favorite pop star, Britney Spears, as well as from her good friend Taylor Swift for a more mature sound. The former ""Mouse House"" starlet revealed she is most proud of this album because it is the first time she was able to dedicate herself fully to her music. ""I was able to have full creative control over it. Before, I would have maybe a month or two to record an album, and I'd have to do my series at the same time and tour on the weekends. I wasn't in the right mindset to fully give my all."" Gomez began acting professionally at a young age, nabbing roles in children's programs such as ""Barney and Friends."" As more former child stars are seen heading down dark and destructive paths, Gomez has always made a conscious effort to keep from falling down the same rabbit hole. The secret? It all comes down to the company you keep. ""I truly believe that you are who you surround yourself with. To me, it's that easy. I have a great family, I have great friends, and my mom is like my mama bear. She's the one that's going to tell me 'no' when everyone around me says 'yes.' It's a good thing to have a tight group that will keep you in check."" ""Stars Dance"" is a very personal album, Gomez said. Expectations for the disc are high, following three Top 10 debuts from her previous albums. ""Come and Get It"" marked Gomez's first single to break into the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. With a 64-date arena tour on the horizon, the performer is determined to strike while the iron's hot. ""I really just want to give it my all. I've never been this tired. Dancing so much, singing constantly, just getting it tight. We want the show to be really big. I want it to be big, but in a grand way, just having my dancers and just bringing it to life."" Despite her hectic schedule and speculation about whether she'll rekindle her relationship with Justin Bieber, Gomez said she has no plans for a break in the near future. In fact, it may not be long before fans will be treated to album No. 5. ""I'm already in the studio now. I actually started working on new stuff and creating a whole fun, different vibe. It's constantly evolving. I'm super-stoked with where this is, and hopefully it will continue to just get better.""","Selena Gomez has high hopes for new album, ""Stars Dance""

Whether you embark on a business trip, a weekend getaway or an exotic overseas vacation, phone apps exist to help make virtually every element of the experience far easier and more enjoyable. Travel apps have only been so robust in the last couple of years, but it already seems hard to remember how we managed to get anywhere without them. In some instances, though, there are almost too many choices available. Dozens of apps exist for getting around, say, Europe, and many others are at the ready to help make a packing list. Want to monitor the status of a flight? You'll need to select from a host of frustratingly similar apps first. Sifting through everything can feel more onerous than navigating the security maze at LAX. Finding the right apps shouldn't add stress to travel, so we identified ten that are intended to aid every stage of a trip. Postagram . Remember postcards? Postagram brings back the old snail-mail staple, but with a high-tech twist.

A personalized postcard will appear in their actual mailbox within a few days. For iOS and Android, the app is free, postcards are 99 cents for each U.S. delivery and $1.99 for international addresses. Dcovery . Organizing pre-trip research can be a challenge.

The app also provides estimated wait times for security lines and last-minute deals on rental cars. The app free for iOS, Android and Windows . Scout . Lots of GPS apps offer traffic updates and voice-guided, turn-by-turn navigation to help you get to your destination. Scout, however, helps find things to do once you get there.

Flip through categories, such as dining or directions, to quickly find the correct expression. And if you come across a new foreign phrase, you can record it to use later. The basic version of the app is free for iOS, but full versions of languages require in-app purchases. Departures: Travel gadets for the New Year . LocalEats .

"(CNN) -- ""Constantly searching for a needle in a haystack"" is what Brent Brisben says he does for a living, and on days like Saturday, the payoff makes the work worthwhile. Brisben owns the 1715 Treasure Fleet Queen's Jewels salvage company. This weekend, he and his crew of three found quite a few ""needles"" in their oceanic ""haystack"" -- 48 gold coins that date back 300 years, to be exact. The coins, called escudos, were part of the treasure aboard a fleet of 11 Spanish galleons wrecked by a hurricane off the Florida coast on July 31, 1715. It was this famous shipwreck that gave this part of Florida its nickname, The Treasure Coast. The coins appear to be in good condition, and still have some legible dates and markings. The oldest bears the date 1697; the youngest is dated 1714. The 48 coins have an estimated value of $200,000 to $250,000, said Brisben. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the expedition is that the coins were found just 100 feet from the shoreline, in only six feet of water. Ancient coins could change history of Australia . Though Brisben admits his work is exciting, he says it's not like you see in the movies. ""You may expect to see a big galleon on its side with treasure chests overflowing, but it's not like that at all,"" he said. ""With shipwrecks that old, most of the organic material like the actual wood of the ship is gone, due to deterioration. What's left are mostly metals and pottery... china, silver buckles, bronze cannons and gold coins."" The coins will be sold to private collectors and the money raised from the sale will finance further searching of the wreckage site, Brisben said.

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Andrea formed in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, marking the first storm of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm was about 270 miles west-southwest of Tampa, Florida, and moving north at 6 mph, said the National Hurricane Center. It had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the west coast of Florida, from Boca Grande, north of Fort Myers, to the Ochlockonee River, south of Tallahassee, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch was issued for the U.S. East Coast as well, from Flagler Beach, Florida, up through Surf City, North Carolina.

"(CNN) -- They had only played one competitive match of the new season but already the knives were out at Arsenal. Despite boasting of the financial muscle at their disposal they had failed to sign one player or spend a single pound before the new English Premier League campaign kicked off. And when they were beaten at home on Saturday by Aston Villa -- who narrowly avoided relegation last season -- a predictably poisonous atmosphere resulted. Fans vented their fury not only at their under-performing stars but also manager Arsene Wenger, and especially the board, for the lack of new faces. But Wenger's beleaguered squad lifted the storm clouds, for now at least, with a decisive 3-0 victory over Fenerbahce in the first leg of a critical European Champions League playoff Wednesday. Entry to the lucrative competition was seen as vital if they are to attract some big-name signings before the transfer window shuts on September 2. And Arsenal made light work of their assignment in the Turkish city of Istanbul, as goals from Kieran Gibbs, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud all but sealed their progress. In truth, Arsenal were far superior to Fenerbahce, who could have be expelled from the competition even if they were to progress in the tie. The Turks are awaiting the outcome of an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport challenging a ban from European competition handed down to them by UEFA on match-fixing charges. But after Gibbs turned home a cross from England international Theo Walcott on 51 minutes Fenerbahce's threat was limited. Ramsey doubled the Gunners' lead with a powerful strike from outside the area and Olivier Giroud converted a late penalty after Walcott was adjudged to have been brought down in the area. After the game Wenger told Sky Sports: ""We could have be a little bit shaky after what happened on Saturday so it was important to start on the right foot."" As for the possibility of making some signings before the transfer window shuts he added: ""A lot will happen in the last ten days."" Elsewhere, Greek side PAOK Salonika, who were reinstated to the competition after Ukrainians Metalist Kharkiv were thrown out on match-fixing charges, drew 1-1 with Schalke in Germany. Jakub Kosecki's equalizer helped Polish side Legia Warsaw to a 1-1 draw with Steaua Bucuresti in Romania while Austria Vienna won 2-0 away at Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. Two goals from Mohamed Salah helped Swiss club FC Basel to a 4-2 victory over Ludogorets Razgrad in Bulgaria. In the English Premier League, Jose Mourinho made it two wins from two games as Chelsea beat Aston Villa in a controversial clash at Stamford Bridge. The home side took the lead when Eden Hazard's shot cannoned off Villa's American goalkeeper Brad Guzan and into Antonio Luna, propelling the ball over the line. But Villa equalized when Belgian international Christian Benteke grabbed his third goal of the season, finishing a smart move at the near post. Branislav Ivanovic was perhaps fortunate not be sent off when he appeared to elbow Benteke and he proved to be the match winner, heading Frank Lampard's free kick home with 17 minutes left. After the game Mourinho told reporters: ""That was very hard, I've missed that about the Premier League. This is what I like. Villa probably deserved a point.""","Arsenal beat Fenerbahce 3-0 in their Champions League playoff tie first leg .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The hot-button issue of illegal immigration erupted in the California race for governor Wednesday as a Mexican housekeeper once employed by GOP nominee Meg Whitman alleged that she had been ""exploited, disrespected, humiliated and emotionally and financially abused"" by the former eBay CEO. Nicky Diaz Santillan, who worked for Whitman for nine years, was fired in June 2009 ""for what appeared to be political reasons involving Ms. Whitman's decision to run for governor,"" famed attorney Gloria Allred claimed in a news conference. The Whitman campaign immediately shot back, providing  immigration and IRS forms it said Santillan signed stating she was a legal resident of the United States when she first applied for employment as a housekeeper in 2000. The campaign included a copy of a Social Security card and California driver's license it said Santillan had given Whitman. Whitman, in an interview Wednesday afternoon, said she relied on the employment agency that provided Santillan to verify she was a legal resident. ""As soon as we found that she was an illegal immigrant, we did what we had to do as an employer, which was to let her go,"" Whitman said. ""But all of the documentation that we had said that she was legal."" Allred alleged that Whitman should have known Santillan was an undocumented worker, because several letters, dating back to 2002, were sent to her about the maid's ""mismatched"" Social Security number. A copy of that letter will be released to the news media Thursday, Allred said. ""Nicky also alleges that for several more years, Ms. Whitman continued to receive the letters from the Social Security Administration Office regarding the mismatch in the Social Security numbers,"" Allred said.  ""She also alleges that she saw these letters after they were thrown into the trash."" Allred claimed that back in August 2000, Santillan ""was sent by an employment agency to interview with Meg Whitman for a job as a housekeeper. ... Nicky alleges that Ms. Whitman never asked if [she] was here legally,"" Allred said. ""The inconvenient truth of the hypocrisy of Meg Whitman as illustrated by her employment of an undocumented worker and her exploitation of her was going to be revealed, because Nicky wanted to be legalized,"" Allred said. ""Nicky was terminated in a sudden, cruel and heartless way,"" she added. Allred said Santillan intends to file a claim for unfairly denied wages. ""When I met with Meg Whitman on June 20, 2009, I asked her for assistance,"" Santillan said. ""I explained to her why I came to the United States. I explained that I was married and our economic situation in Mexico was very bad. We had no job, no food, no place to live and for that reason we made the decision to come here."" ""Ms. Whitman just laughed,"" Santillan said. Whitman, Santillan claimed, also blamed herself for failing to previously ask for any documentation. Whitman, according to Santillan, indicated four days later that she couldn't help the former housekeeper. ""She said, 'I cannot help you and do not say anything to my children. I will tell them you already have a new job and that you want to go to school and from now on, you don't know me and I do not know you. You have never seen me and I have never seen you. Do you understand me?'"" Allred also outlined what she said were abusive labor practices by Whitman, including not reimbursing the maid for mileage when she ran errands and not allowing her maternity leave. ""When Nicky indicated to Ms. Whitman in March 2005, that she needed to take a medical leave of absence for pregnancy, she alleges that she was told that unless she herself obtained someone to replace her, that her job might not be there for her when she returned."" Whitman has previously beat back allegations she was involved in a 2007 shoving altercation with an employee at eBay's California headquarters after the Silicon Valley chief felt unprepared for an upcoming media interview. The incident reportedly led to a $200,000 settlement. Responding to the press conference, Whitman campaign laywer Tom Hiltchak told reporters that, when hired in 2000, Santillan gave Whitman false documentation, including IRS forms, a Social Security card, a California drivers license, and Department of Justice immigration forms in which the stated she was a lawful alien. When Santillan told Whitman in 2009 that the documents were false and she was illegal, Whitman ""immediately suspended and then terminated"" Santillan's employment, according to the campaign. Rob Stutzman, a senior advisor to the campaign, told reporters that Whitman ""is very sad and has deep sorrow"" over the incident. ""She was, in many ways, a member of our extended family and  I feel badly for her,"" Whitman said.  ""She's being manipulated."" Whitman spokeswoman Andrea Jones Rivera ripped Allred, claiming the high-profile attorney is merely attempting to smear the California Republican. ""With the polls tied, it comes as no surprise that the morning after a successful debate for Meg that the sleaze machine of the political left is now focused on the politics of personal destruction. Gloria Allred is a shameful manipulator and the timing of today's news conference so close to the election should serve as a warning to Californians that they are witnessing dirty political smears at their worst,"" Rivera said in a statement. Stutzman said it was ""curious"" that Santillan would bring forward allegations against Whitman a mere 35 days before the election. It's even ""more curious,"" he said, that the news conference featuring the former housekeeper was being orchestrated by Allred, who has a ""clear relationship"" with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jerry Brown. A CNN check of Allred's political contributions showed she has donated extensively to Democratic candidates. The allegations are part of a ""post-debate smoke bomb"" to try and obscure Brown's ""bizarre behavior"" after Tuesday night's debate against Whitman, Stutzman claimed. It is part of the politics of ""personal destruction,"" he said. With a sardonic laugh, Stutzman asked reporters, ""What's a California governors race without Gloria Allred inserting herself into it?"" Whitman is currently neck and neck with Brown in the polls. The issue of immigration looms large in California, as in other states along the Mexican border. Whitman has come out against Arizona's controversial new anti-illegal immigration law, as well as California's controversial Proposition 187. However, she supports tough crackdowns on employers who hire illegal immigrants, requiring employers ""pay a fine and have their business license suspended for 10 days"" for first-time offenses, with steeper fines and penalties for repeat offenders.","NEW: Whitman says she relied on an employment agency to verify housekeeper's status .

"(CNN) -- Randy Travis suffered a stroke and underwent surgery to relieve pressure on his brain Wednesday evening, his publicist said. ""Mr. Randy Travis is out of surgery and in critical condition,"" the hospital website announced Wednesday night. The stroke is ""a complication of his congestive heart failure"" for which he is being treated at The Heart Hospital at Baylor Plano in Texas, Kirt Webster said. ""We will have updates as they become available,"" Webster said.Â  ""His family and friends here with him at the hospital request your prayers and support."" Word of his setback came just hours after his doctors said Travis had ""stabilized and he has shown signs of improvement."" The country singer was initially hospitalized Sunday at Baylor Medical Center at McKinney, Texas, ""with a presumptive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure,"" Dr. William Gray said. Travis, 54, was transferred to The Heart Hospital at Baylor Plano in Texas on Monday, Dr. Michael Mack said. ""We determined together in a joint decision that a higher level of specialized care was appropriate, and therefore we transferred him to The Heart Hospital,"" Mack said. Doctors implanted a device in his heart to help blood flow. The singer ""underwent the placement of an Impella peripheral left ventricular assist device for stabilization prior to transferring hospitals,"" Travis spokesman Kirt Webster said in a written statement Tuesday. Opinion: Randy Travis taught me country . The Mayo Clinic's website described the device as ""an implantable mechanical pump that helps pump blood from the lower chambers of your heart to the rest of your body."" Travis' illness is related to his ""recently acquired viral cardiomyopathy,"" Webster said. Travis had recently been on the road, performing in Detroit on June 28 and Chicago on June 29.Â  He was set to do a show in Deadwood, South Dakota, on Wednesday. He appeared well during business meetings on Friday and Saturday, Webster said. Â ""Then on Sunday, it hit him."" Viral cardiomyopathy is a disorder where a virus attacks the muscles of the heart, causing the heart to beat slower, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.Â  In some cases, the heart can stop, it said. Travis had a tough year in 2012 with arrests for assault and public intoxication, which earned him probation. Travis was at the forefront of the ""New Traditionalist"" movement in the 1980s and 1990s, but he faded as the '90s wore on. He made a comeback after turning to gospel music in 1999. His song ""Three Wooden Crosses"" won song of the year in 2003 from both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. As one of country music's top-selling artists, Travis has won seven Grammys, 10 Academy of Country Music awards and 10 American Music Award statuettes. His best-known songs also include ""Forever and Ever, Amen,"" ""Diggin' Up Bones"" and ""Deeper Than the Holler.""","NEW: ""Randy Travis is out of surgery and in critical condition,"" the hospital says .

"(CNN) -- A Kansas company is recalling about 50,000 pounds of ground beef products over fears of E. coli contamination. The National Beef Packing Co. products, which were shipped nationwide, may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Wednesday. There have been no reported cases of illness. In an online statement Wednesday, National Beef Packing Co. reported ""a voluntary recall for NatureSource Natural Beef, Naturewell Natural Beef and National Beef commodity ground beef."" It said the meat was produced on July 18 and has a use by/freeze by date of August 7. ""We are working closely with authorities to investigate this matter and are contacting our customers who have purchased this product,"" the company said. The meat was ""shipped in 40 to 60 pound cases to retailers, wholesalers and food service distributors nationwide,"" the USDA said in a news release. Salad mix blamed for cyclospora outbreak in Nebraska, Iowa . It's unclear whether it was sold at a retail level. The product carries the USDA mark of inspection, bearing the establishment number ""EST. 208A."" The possibility of contamination was raised in a routine Food Safety and Inspection Service inspection. The recall is the second incident this summer for the company, which recalled 22,000 pounds of beef in June over concerns about E. coli contamination. E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium found in recent years in various food products, including raw beef and prepackaged greens, such as spinach and salad mixes. The USDA warns that it causes ""bloody diarrhea, dehydration and in the most severe cases, kidney failure."" Approximately 76,000 people are infected with E. coli every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"(CNN) -- A skydiving instructor on a tandem jump in Mississippi died and his student was critically injured after their parachutes failed to open, the Lamar County sheriff said Sunday. The body of James ""Jimmie"" Horak, Jr., 66, was found Saturday in heavy mud in a swampy wooded area about a mile from the airport in Lumberton where they planned to land, Sheriff Danny Rigel said. The other person, whose name was not released, was in critical condition with broken bones and head injuries. Horak and the student were with a group of three others who jumped from the plane at the same time around midmorning Saturday, under sunny skies, Rigel said. Horak and the student were the only ones doing a tandem jump. The others noticed that Horak had had some kind of equipment trouble -- perhaps a problem with his lines -- but didn't appear to realize how serious it was until after they landed at the airport and the pair didn't emerge from the woods, Rigel said. Horak and the student landed on leased hunting land, and a hunting club member who knew the jumpers were missing then found them, Rigel said. Deputies had to carry Horak and the student for a ""considerable distance"" to get them out of the woods, and the student was then airlifted to Forrest General Hospital in nearby Hattiesburg, Rigel said. The Federal Aviation Administration will inspect the parachutes to determine if they were properly rigged by a qualified parachute rigger, and if the parachute operation was in compliance with federal regulations, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said. Local authorities will investigate the event and determine probable cause, she said. Horak's cause of death won't be known until after an autopsy, likely to take place Monday, Rigel said. Horak, of Pensacola, Florida, is listed as an instructor with the Emerald Coast Skydiving Center in Elberta, Alabama, just across the Florida-Alabama state line. A different skydiving company, Gold Coast Skydivers, is based at the airport in Lumberton where Horak was supposed to land. It wasn't immediately clear who organized Saturday's jump. Neither company could be reached for comment Sunday. Woman on first date plunges to her death off 17th-floor balcony .

"(CNN) -- ""Dear World: My fingers and wrists are sore, for the past few days all I could do was punch the letters on the keyboard ... "" These were the words of one Turkish man in Africa who spent days scouring the Internet for news on the Turkish protests that he could share. People from all over Turkey and beyond poured out their feelings after what some say has been a heavy-handed police response to protests in Turkey. CNN alone received more than 1,000 iReports from Turkey in less than a week from Turks compelled to document, protest and demand their voices be heard. The protests began over plans to replace an Istanbul park with a new development, but spread nationwide after a heavy-handed crackdown by police. Erdogan has defended his government's handling of the protests, saying Friday that the government has ""no problem in terms of democratic demands."" He also acknowledged, again, that police may have used excessive force last week, and said he had ordered an investigation. ""To the Rest of the World: This is the first time in my 30 years that tears well up for what is happening just up the road from where I write these words. ... ""People from all ages and races, all political viewpoints are coming together to fight. Notify your local and national media, and tag them on twitter to make them speak the truth about what is happening. This is ... for humanity, no less,"" wrote iReporter ""ateloco"" in a post that spread rapidly through social media. Why Taksim Square matters to the Turks . Turkey as a nation is quite savvy about social media. At least 2 million tweets with hashtags related to the Turkish protests were sent in just eight hours on May 31 when protests gathered steam, a study by New York University revealed -- around 90% of them from Turkey. In comparison, Egypt's main protest hashtag was tweeted less than 1 million times throughout the country's entire revolutionary period. And those in Turkey like to talk on the issues -- 57% of those using social network sites say they do so to share their political views -- a far higher percentage than in many European nations, according to the Pew Research Center. The arrest this week of 25 social media users on accusations of spreading false information about demonstrations, according to the country's semi-official Anadolu Agency news service, has sparked concerns from human rights groups about the right of freedom of expression. But while documenting and disseminating information on the protests can be an arduous task, for many on social media it became a way of holding authorities to account. ""I don't know when it will end, but I already feel like a robot whose main role is to click the share button on Facebook,"" one activist, Istanbul resident Yelin Bilgin, told CNN after days of protests. She described the protests as her moment of ""resurrection."" Although she wasn't involved in organizing them, she felt she could help the cause by sharing information. She wants the protests to lead to more self-examination on all sides. ""We shouldn't stop, but we should act more consciously. We have to write, we have to share our thoughts."" Turkish media in crisis over protests . Renc Korzay is not currently living in his homeland, but working for a construction company in the West African nation of Gabon. His heartfelt letter on iReport opened this story and continues: . ""I was guilty for letting my friends get gassed and arrested in the name of freedom without me. I was guilty for not being able to keep my colleagues company as they march to Taksim Square straight off work. I was guilty for not being able to give the people my apartment to shelter, my food to eat, my water to drink and my vinegar to ease off the reaction from the chemicals sprayed on their bodies."" He hoped that by writing and collecting information -- even from far away -- he could be of some help. ""I was no longer in Africa and I was no longer guilty. I became a reporter with quotes, cameraman with videos, photographer with images, a 24-hour news channel with everything I posted on social media,"" he said. Istanbul writer Arsevi Zeynep Seyran was in the western coastal city of Izmir when protests began. Describing herself as a ""pot and pan hitter"" after the noisy protests she recorded one night, her thoughtful essay summed up the energy of the protests for many. If people are silent about the what is happening in Turkey, the protesters ""are afraid that as a society things will go backward,"" she said. By shining a spotlight on the situation in the country, she hoped authorities would be less likely to retaliate against those involved in the protests, she said. Ultimately, it may be too soon to tell what effect the protests will have on Turkey, its government and those who flooded the streets of Istanbul, Ankara and other cities. But one thing is certain; those who have been feverishly tweeting, posting, blogging and documenting will not be inclined to stop any time soon. ""For the first time in a long time,"" Seyran said, ""Turkey has much reason for pride.""","More than 1,000 submissions flooded CNN iReport over the Turkey protests .

"(CNN) -- A Lion Air Boeing 737-900 collided with a cow when landing on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. The plane, on a domestic route that started in Jakarta, landed at Jalaluddin Airport in Gorontalo on Tuesday evening and hit one of three cows wandering on the runway. The aircraft skidded off the runway and the cow was killed, though none of the 110 passengers on board were injured. Several flights were canceled and the airport was temporarily closed on Tuesday due to the accident. Operations were resumed on Wednesday. Gorontalo governor Rusli Habibie told the Jakarta Post the airport suffered from inadequate fencing. ""Lion Air management has just told me that animals, particularly dogs, are often seen on the runway,"" said Habibie. ""This problem should be immediately resolved."" Government administrators are due to meet with the National Transportation Safety Committee and Jalaluddin Airport officials to discuss ways to prevent similar events in future.

"(CNN) -- For CNN, Tiananmen Square was a watershed story -- a seminal moment in the network's history. Beijing bureau chief Mike Chinoy, producer Nancy Lane and Moscow bureau chief Steve Hurst . Only nine years old in 1989, CNN was the only 24-hour news station on the air at the time. But staffers say the network suffered an inferiority complex when comparing itself to the major players in American television, who had dismissed the new upstart for years as ""Chicken Noodle News."" Enter Tiananmen Square. Change the face of television news. Take your place in the big leagues.  ""It put CNN on the map,"" said Mike Chinoy, CNN's Beijing bureau chief during the crisis. ""It was the first time an upheaval in a previously isolated, distant, inaccessible location suddenly was available on television sets in living rooms and foreign ministries around the world. It was a pivotal moment for television."" And it was an accident too. Foreign reporters had flooded Beijing to cover the historic visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Suddenly, they found themselves covering a very different story. For CNN, it all started in early April when Alec Miran, CNN's special events producer for the Gorbachev visit, went to Beijing to propose an ""outlandish idea"" to the Chinese authorities -- bringing in the network's own transmission equipment to beam live television pictures from China. ""It was unprecedented,"" said Miran. Before that, networks would feed their material from CCTV (Chinese Central Television), who would monitor -- and censor -- everything that was sent out. ""Our own transmission was a scary idea to them,"" said Miran. But he says he thinks the Chinese eventually agreed -- after much back and forth -- because, above all, they wanted international coverage of Gorbachev's visit. The Chinese gave CNN permission to bring in their own ""flyaway"" satellite dish and additional microwave gear to be able to transmit live -- a permission unheard of at the time in closed, Communist China. CNN was granted exactly one week's permission, timed to coincide with the Soviet leader's visit.  See photos of the CNN team in Tiananmen Square in 1989 Â» . CBS was also granted permission to transmit live, but because CNN was on the air 24 hours a day, the permission it was granted turned out to be much more significant. ""On the first day of the Gorbachev visit, we not only had our own satellite transmission, we also had a live camera overlooking the square,"" said Miran. ""We were really well set up."" But the situation was deteriorating rapidly for the Chinese leadership. Huge groups of students demanding reform had occupied Tiananmen Square and had launched a hunger strike just days before the Soviet leader's visit was about to begin. CNN's live camera, at the Gate of Heavenly Peace overlooking the square, showed the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who had gathered in Tiananmen Square where Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was due to greet Gorbachev at the Great Hall of the People. ""On the day of the big meeting, we waited, and waited, and waited, watching the signal from CCTV,"" said Miran. ""No picture. We called our contact at CCTV to see if there were technical problems. Nope."" ""They couldn't take Gorbachev in the front door of the Great Hall of the People because there were more than a million people in the square asking for reform,"" said Cynde Strand, CNN's cameraperson in Beijing at the time. ""The students upstaged Deng in one of his biggest moments, his big rapprochement with the Soviet Union."" And the massive crowd -- as well as the non-appearance of Deng welcoming Gorbachev at the Great Hall of the People -- was all captured live on CNN. Soon afterwards, the Chinese informed CNN they could no longer maintain their live position overlooking the square, a position that had become vital for the network's coverage. Entire shows anchored by Bernard Shaw had been taped there. Miran and Chinoy huddled and decided that although the Chinese had forbidden further transmission from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the network still had permission to use its portable microwave transmitter. So for the next few days -- always looking nervously over their shoulder -- CNN continued live transmissions using their microwave transmitter, both from their bureau at the Sheraton hotel -- but also from the middle of Tiananmen Square. ""Everywhere you looked, there was a great picture,"" said Miran. ""Soldiers would be on the steps of the Great Hall of the People and students would go up to them, offering flowers or to read to them. There were long staring contests between the armed soldiers and the students. It was riveting television."" On the night of May 19, after the network had gotten word that troops were moving towards Beijing, Shaw and Moscow correspondent Steve Hurst broadcast from Tiananmen Square for several hours -- in the dark. The students in the square were edgy and had asked them to turn off their lights. ""I don't remember what we were able to show people that night,"" Miran said, ""little flickers of light."" The next morning, Chinese authorities arrived at CNN's bureau and ordered the network to cease transmitting -- before its week-long permission had expired.  Watch a Chinese official order CNN staff in Beijing to stop broadcasting Â» . Again, the entire exchange between CNN and the Chinese officials was captured on live television.  Watch the moment when CNN stopped transmitting Â» . ""You get almost numb to it now,"" said Vito Maggiolo, CNN assignment editor on duty in Beijing at the time. ""But that live capability -- people watching events as they happen -- was truly special at that time."" ""It was our first big live moment,"" said camerawoman Strand, now director of coverage for international news in Atlanta. ""And it became our signature, what we did very well."" At one point in the live stand-off, while CNN tried to buy time before pulling the plug on itself, Marin gave out his telephone number for the Chinese authorities to call him -- an attempt to squeak out just a few more minutes of air time. The phone rang. It was a woman from Minnesota, a viewer who had been watching the events unfold in China from the comfort -- and safety -- of her living room. ""You're doing a great job' she said to me,"" Miran recalled. ""Everybody's watching. And we're rooting for you."" ""It was all just momentous,"" Miran said. ""I felt like we had actually made a difference. And if people hadn't heard of CNN before, they had certainly heard of it then.""

"(CNN) -- A San Francisco Giants fan who threw a banana that landed near Baltimore Orioles centerfielder Adam Jones during a weekend game said the incident was not racially motivated, but an act of frustration at his team's poor performance. Alexander Poulides told the San Jose Mercury News that he's embarrassed and shocked, but most of all apologetic for his ""indiscretion."" Poulides said he was unaware of the uproar until Monday morning when he turned on the news. His heart sank when heard the outcry over an unidentified Giants fan who threw a banana at Jones, who is African-American. ""Oh, my God,'' Poulides said. ""I threw a banana on my way out."" That's when he contacted the newspaper to claim responsibility. ""I'm embarrassed and shocked by the outcome,'' he said. ""In hindsight, I wish I didn't do it and I apologize. I'm very sorry."" Poulides grabbed the banana from a catering cart, tossing it on the field, he said. The fruit became a projectile of disgust during the ninth inning of a blowout loss on Sunday to the Orioles at AT&T Park. The team's front office said it's continuing to investigate. ""The Giants have a zero tolerance policy against this type of behavior, which results in immediate ejection from the ballpark,"" a statement from the team said. ""While we have been investigating the matter since we learned of the situation, unfortunately we have been unable to identify the person responsible. ""We would like to extend our sincerest apologies to Adam and the entire Orioles organization for this unfortunate incident. ""The inappropriate actions of this individual in no way reflect the values of our organization and our fans."" Jones took to his official Twitter account to express his displeasure. ""I want to thank whatever (expletive) threw that banana towards my direction in CF in the last inning,"" he posted. ""Way to show ur class u jackass.""

"(CNN) -- It's time to pay up, America. The era of free news is rapidly coming to a close. The Washington Post, one of the last holdouts among major newspapers, will probably begin charging for online access next year. And the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News announced Monday that they will launch separate paywall sites early next year. We're all spoiled by the illusion that we can get whatever we want on the interwebs without having to pay a dime. Fire up the Google, troll the Twitter, see who's got the most tantalizing links. We all do it, and we all take it for granted. But you can't have a media ecosystem in which everyone is aggregating, summarizing and retweeting content from everyone else. At some point there have to be actual human beings making phone calls and attending events and pawing through public documents. Watch: No more free lunch -- time to pay for news, America . And these people -- known as ""reporters"" -- need to put food on the table. Newspapers and magazines are partially to blame for this state of affairs. For many years they gave away their wares to anyone with a modem, anxious to avoid being left out of the burgeoning world of online commerce. Readers thought nothing of subscribing to a paper that landed on their doorstep but balked at paying for news on their computer screens and mobile phones. The result, as we all know, has been widespread carnage in American newsrooms. Some papers, such as the Rocky Mountain News and Seattle Post-Intelligencer, have folded. Others, such as The New Orleans Times-Picayune, have cut back to three times a week. The Cleveland Plain Dealer just announced it is slashing a third of its newsroom. Even The New York Times, which has made fewer cuts than most papers, said last week that 30 jobs will be lost to buyouts. Watch: Karl Rove benched: When gasbags get it wrong . There were several rounds of buyouts when I worked at The Washington Post, where the newsroom has shrunk significantly and the new editor, Marty Baron, warns that more cuts are in store. In an overdue move, the paper now says it will likely move to a metered paywall, charging readers after they get a certain number of free articles each month. The Times was among the pioneers of this movement in March 2011 and now has nearly 600,000 digital subscribers. It also helps to have an affluent expense-account crowd, which is why The Wall Street Journal's pay site has always thrived. The Post has a unique problem in that it is a national brand online, but a local newspaper in terms of circulation. So the out-of-towners who might want to read political analysis by Dan Balz and Chris Cillizza don't have the option of subscribing to the ink-on-paper version. Yet the lucrative print ads that reach consumers in D.C., Maryland and Virginia are worth far more than the modest rates that can be charged for digital ads. So the paper badly needs another source of revenue. Watch: Did Bob Costas go too far in pushing gun control? The Daily Beast, where I work, is also considering a metered paywall, now that the parent company is folding the print edition of Newsweek, which led to substantial layoffs last week. Of course, readers have no august responsibility to pay for anything. And Big Media got too fat and happy in the days of easy money. The Google era is all about disaggregation -- that is, you can search for only the information you want about Medicare or Meryl Streep or Miami without the packaging of a publication. You can get your fix from Facebook friends. With new apps you can be your own editor, selecting the stories that suit your needs. So this is not a plea for charitable support. Increasingly, the name of the game online is providing something that is so unique or compelling that readers feel it's worth reaching for their credit card. But it is a reminder that we are hollowing out the business of newsgathering. This is a particular problem at the local level, where no one else is going to investigate decaying schools or the mayor steering contracts to his cronies. Sadly, the shriveled staffs of many local papers are less able to do this kind of distinctive reporting, and will have a hard time persuading readers to pay for meager coverage with an overlay of local sports. It's also true that there is less original reporting nationally on the environment, health care, criminal justice, finance and other vital areas. The Washington Post, where I was once New York bureau chief, has shut down its bureaus around the country. The slow stampede toward paywalls will prompt a shakeout in which some publications survive by proving their worth and others head for the graveyard. Some early signs are discouraging: Rupert Murdoch's iPad magazine The Daily, which never had a clear identity, folded last week, and Arianna Huffington's hugely successful site couldn't get people to pay a modest fee for a monthly digital magazine. Hey, if folks don't think a paper or magazine or online venture is worth the weekly equivalent of a frappuccino, that's their choice. But man does not live by buzz alone. In the end, we get the journalism we deserve. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: Washington Post, other news outlets, may soon charge for online access .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- An in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway at San Francisco International Airport, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. The first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash and a second was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact, Deborah Hersman said. The news came as the NTSB began to wrap up its investigation at the airport, where officials have begun cleaning up the debris left by the crash. Investigators turned over the runway, which had been shuttered since Saturday's crash, late Wednesday, Hersman said. The investigation is slowly shifting back to NTSB headquarters in Washington, where authorities will work to find a more definitive answer about what led to the crash that killed two 16-year-old Chinese girls and injured more than 180 of the remaining 305 passengers. How does an air crash investigation work? It will likely take a year before it establishes a cause for the accident, Hersman said. But, she said, it considers the investigation a priority and can make safety recommendations before its final report if necessary. The NTSB has declined to give a preliminary finding of cause, but investigators have said the Boeing 777 came in too low and too slow. The cockpit recorder shows there was no discussion of the flight's speed during final approach to the airport until nine seconds before it crash-landed, Hersman said. A preliminary review of the 777's flight data recorders shows engines and wing flaps responded as they were expected to as the plane made its descent into one of the country's largest airports, Hersman said. The NTSB chief spent several minutes during a news conference on Thursday clarifying reports that have shown up in South Korean media, including one where the pilot flying the plane reported being temporarily blinded by a flash of light. Hersman said the pilot at the controls of Flight 214 told investigators that at about 500 feet before crash landing, he briefly saw a bright light ""that could have been a reflection of the sun,"" but he wasn't sure. The pilot told investigators he did not believe the light affected his ability to fly the plane, as it didn't affect his vision and he could see inside the cockpit, she said. Did passengers ignore safety messages? Additionally, there was no indication that personal electronics, such as mobile phones, aboard the 777 played a role in the accident. When asked about reports, citing 911 calls from frantic passengers and onlookers, that emergency personnel were slow to respond, Hersman said the investigation was ongoing. ""We are looking at all of that information. We have, really, mountains of information to go through,"" she said. Shortly after Asiana Flight 214 crash-landed, passengers and witnesses pleaded with 911 responders to send help -- some frantically, some insistently. ""I'm reporting an airplane crash at SFO (San Francisco International Airport),"" an early witness said in calls released by the California Highway Patrol. ""An airplane crash at SFO?"" a dispatcher asked. ""Yeah. We were hiking on a trail outside Pacifica, and we heard a giant explosion, and ... an airplane had crashed right there at SFO."" Another caller dialed 911, thinking the response was taking too long. ""We still don't see any firemen or anything,"" another witness said. ""We are responding, trust me,"" the operator responded. Did pilot have enough 777 experience? Moments before, the 777's main landing gear slammed into a seawall between the airport and San Francisco Bay, spinning the aircraft 360 degrees as it broke into pieces and eventually caught fire. First responders were on the scene two minutes after the crash to tend to the injured, Hersman said Wednesday. About a minute later, there were firefighters equipped to douse the flames. Those who could do so poured out of the plane in the aftermath, dialing for help as they escaped. ""We are at the San Francisco airport, and our airplane just crashed upon landing, and we think we need someone here, someone here as soon as possible,"" a passenger said. The dispatcher asks: Which runway? ""I don't know what runway. We just literally ran out of the airplane."" Girls killed in crash were headed for camp . Flight attendants hailed as heroes . CNN's Mike Ahlers reported from San Francisco, and Chelsea J. Carter and Ed Payne reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Kyung Lah also contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigation will likely take a year, NTSB says .

"(CNN) -- Jon Hamm has to have throat surgery, but it doesn't sound like it will keep the actor down for long.

"(CNN) -- The carnage began early in the afternoon on Saturday at Nairobi's Westgate Shopping Mall, with gunshots shattering the calm of a popular weekend meeting spot where Kenyans and expatriates shop for groceries, grab a coffee or catch a movie. The ensuing hostage standoff left dozens of people dead and hundreds more wounded. Two days later, the Kenyan authorities claim to have regained control of the complex, but the stories of those who escaped paint a terrifying picture of how the attack unfolded: . Ben Mulwa: Caught in parking lot . It was about 12:50 p.m. when Ben Mulwa, a Nairobi County politician, and a friend pulled into the multilevel parking garage attached to the five-story mall. Mulwa, who was at Westgate for a lunch meeting at the Java House, was parking the car when he heard a gunshot, he told the NTV television channel. His first thought: It's a robbery. Then came the rapid gunfire. He said he got out of the car and hid near the main entrance of the parking lot. That's when he saw some of the attackers -- four men wearing checked head scarves and carrying ""very long rifles."" They didn't cover their faces, he said. He could hear them but couldn't understand them. ""It sounded like a variation of Swahili,"" he said. Then they turned their guns in Mulwa's direction, taking aim at a security guard hiding near him. ""He was shot in the head, and he died instantly,"" he said. Then they fired at him, aiming for his head. A bullet grazed him in the head, he said. He also suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. The gunmen then calmly turned and walked into the mall, Mulwa said. By all accounts, more gunmen were making their way into the mall through other entrances. Not seeing the attackers was part of the terror . Bendita Malakia: Refuge in a store . It was shortly after noon when Bendita Malakia of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, made her way into the mall to have lunch with a friend when the attack began, she told CNN affiliate WAVY via Skype. Malakia, who moved to Nairobi in July to work with a financial company, was in the middle of lunch on the mall's terrace when the gunmen stormed the area, throwing what she believes were hand grenades and firing assault rifles. ""We stood up and started to turn, and we heard machine guns. Then, we started to run and there was a second explosion, which knocked us on the ground,"" Malakia told WAVY. Malakia and her friend got up and ran to a store where dozens of people had taken refuge. Once inside, the store manager pulled down a metal gate at the store's entrance to try to prevent the gunmen from coming in, she said. But it didn't block out the sounds of the gunmen. ""While we were back there, you could hear them methodically going from store to store, talking to people and asking questions,"" Malakia said. ""They were shooting, screaming. Then it would stop for a while and they would go to another store."" Four hours later, Malakia and her friend were rescued by security forces. Malakia believes she was ""completely lucky"" because she was on the ground floor when the assault began and where she was hiding was easily accessible to her rescuers. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Kenya attack . Andrew McLaren: About to leave Kenya . Andrew McLaren and his wife, Kathy, were at a coffee shop near the mall entrance of the Nakumatt Supermarket, one of Kenya's biggest chain grocery stores, when the attack began, his mother told TVNZ. The couple, who had been in Kenya for work, were enjoying one of their last weekends in Nairobi before returning to their native New Zealand. The two dropped to the ground for cover, according to Elaine McLaren-Crawley, who recounted a conversation with her daughter-in-law. But the gunmen sprayed the cafe with gunfire. ""... Andrew was shot through the back as he and Kathy lay on the floor of the coffee house,"" McLaren-Crawley said. It wasn't immediately clear from the report how the McLarens escaped the mall. McLaren was listed in stable condition at the Aga Khan hospital, his mother said. Safety: Can the mall attack happen again? Uche Kaigwa-Okoye: 'We were really scared' Uche Kaigwa-Okoye was sipping coffee when he heard what first sounded like a fallen table, then the continuing rat-a-tat of gunfire. As the gunshots became louder, screaming crowds headed for the exits. He joined 20 people who took shelter for about five hours in a women's bathroom cubicle. ""We were really scared,"" he said. ""Every sound sounded scary. We couldn't make out sounds, and they had grenades. It was really, really loud ... They must have passed our corridor several times. We heard gunshots down our corridor,"" he told CNN. Some people ventured out but quickly returned, saying it was unsafe. Kaigwa-Okoye heard firing but then realized police had arrived on the floor where he was hiding in the restroom. They were firing tear gas. Officers told them to walk out single file and made them throw away their bags. Zulobia Kassam: 'Random shots from everywhere' Zulobia Kassam had just finished a cup of coffee at a cafe when she made here way toward the mall entrance to the Nakumatt Supermarket to pick up a few items. ""We entered and the lights went off,"" she said. She waited for the generator to kick in, but instead she heard gunshots and saw people running. ""We rushed to the back and hid ourselves,"" Kassam told CNN. ""We heard random shots from everywhere -- upstairs, downstairs ... we even heard shots 30 feet from us,"" she said. ""People were petrified, crying, praying,"" she said. Kassam hid for more than two hours when a security person arrived and said it was safe to flee. She and others walked through a storage area. ""We saw lots of blood, sandals and shoes,"" she said. She made it outside to the main road. And even at what seemed a safe distance, she again heard shooting in the distance. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . Sara Head: 'I thought it was a car accident' American Sara Head told CNN she had just parked after leaving a meeting a few blocks from the mall when she heard three shots. ""I thought actually, it was a car accident, I thought someone had been rear-ended. Then I saw people running and my colleague, who worked elsewhere, recognized the sound of gunshots and she yelled at me and we and other people in the parking garage began crawling underneath cars and behind cars and we heard more shots so we began running."" Head, her colleague and their driver followed several other people into the stairwell of the garage. ""We had gone down into the parking garage so I thought when I entered the stairwell that I would just go up one level and I would be able to exit -- and that was not the case,"" she said. ""There were two people in the stairwell with me who were superficially wounded from gunshots. When we initially entered the stairwell we kept going up and then we heard shots above us so we ended up staying there for about an hour and a half."" The door to the supermarket then reopened, the lights came on and people began exiting, she said. ""I was very, very hesitant because there was no information to tell me that it was safe to exit. It was just that the people in front of me were exiting, Head said. ""I was sort of a sheep following everyone else in front of me and I was very eager of course to get outside and as far away from the situation as possible.""

"New York (CNN) -- Toyota Motor Corp. has subpoenaed Sean Kane, an auto safety advocate and outspoken critic of the company, asking that he hand over his communications with the media, Congress, government agencies and individual Toyota drivers inquiring about sudden unintended acceleration. Toyota said the subpoenas issued this month to Kane and two of his companies -- Safety Research and Strategies and the Vehicle Safety Information Resource Center (VSIRC) -- ""were a routine part of the litigation process."" Read the full subpoena (PDF) Toyota is facing about 200 lawsuits arising over claims that its vehicles suddenly accelerated out of control, injuring or even killing passengers, according to court records. Those lawsuits have been brought under a single federal procedure known as multidistrict litigation, and a trial, if any, would not begin until 2013. Toyota has denied all claims in the conjoined federal lawsuit. Toyota has requested and been granted confidentiality during pretrial proceedings. This means that no documents generated in pretrial motions, whether favorable or unfavorable to Toyota, can be made public before any trial. Kane, a longtime auto safety advocate, has investigated incidents of sudden unintended acceleration as well as automobile fires and unexplained electronic interference from remote smart keys. He testified before Congress in 2010 during the height of public concern about unintended acceleration amid a massive recall of Toyota vehicles for a variety of reasons, including possible unintended acceleration. On its website, Safety Research and Strategies posts several accounts of Toyota owners complaining about what they believe are incidents of sudden unintended acceleration. ""Mr. Kane's allegations about unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles have never had any credible scientific basis and have been thoroughly debunked by exhaustive NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and NASA studies,"" Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons wrote in an e-mail to CNN. In the end, NHTSA ruled out electronic interference as the cause of the sudden intended acceleration, blaming instead floor mats, stuck gas pedals and driver error. In a statement to CNN, Kane called the subpoenas ""another attempt to harass and intimidate us, the scientific community, the media and Toyota's own customers who have complained about unintended acceleration."" The subpoenas also seek all of his communications stretching back to 2001 with government agencies such as NHTSA and the National Academy of Sciences. The subpoena also seeks any communications between Kane and the news media, including CNN. ""Any and all documents provided by you or VSIRC to CNN, ABC, The Huffington Post or any other news or media outlet or internet site regarding subject vehicles, subject vehicle systems and/or unintended acceleration, including but not limited to documents made available to NHTSA for review and/or presented to NHTSA,"" the subpoena reads. Clarence Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said the subpoena was ""clearly an attempt to chill Sean Kane's work."" ""This is just a flat-out heavy-handed approach,"" said Ditlow, whose agency was founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader in 1970. In March, CNN obtained a Toyota internal engineering memo written in 2006 in Japanese. According to two translations commissioned by CNN, the document confirms that engineers found a problem described as a ""malfunction that caused the vehicle to accelerate on its own"" in one translation or ""sudden unintended acceleration"" in the other. The memo was written to document pre-production testing of a prototype of a model later sold only in Japan and in Europe. The company refused to provide CNN with its own translation of the document. Toyota vehemently denied the memo showed any forward movement of the test car. The company says the problem was corrected before any vehicles were sold. Toyota spent weeks urging CNN not to publish or broadcast its reporting. Toyota suffered from several quality and safety problems that came to light in the fall of 2009, eventually leading to the worldwide recall of more than 8 million vehicles for a variety of safety issues, including possible unintended acceleration and problems with anti-lock brake software. The company was hit with more than $48 million in civil penalties related to the recalls for a variety of issues, including its failure to notify U.S. agencies about accelerator pedals that could become stuck by floor mats and its handling of the recall of 5 million vehicles with the so-called ""sticky pedals."" This year, Toyota is ""finally showing signs of shaking off the lingering effects of its recall crisis,"" with the launch of 19 new or redesigned vehicles for 2012, according to Fortune magazine, which ranked Toyota No. 4 on its list of most admired automobile manufacturers for 2012.

"(CNN) -- Former Icelandic Prime Minister Geir Haarde was convicted Monday of negligence related to the collapse of his nation's banking system, but he was cleared of three other charges and will face no punishment, a court official said. Afterward, Haarde insisted that he'd been acquitted on the most serious charges that deal most directly with the origins and handling of the crisis. He characterized the lone conviction as relatively inconsequential and ""ridiculous."" ""I have just followed the traditions of all my predecessors as leaders of the Icelandic Cabinet have practiced throughout the decades. And maybe I'm just taking a hit for all of them,"" Haarde said. ""But the point is that this (conviction) has nothing to do with the financial crisis."" Politicians in Europe and beyond have been harshly criticized and, in some cases, forced out of office in the wake of a wave of economic woes, including governments and banks' role in contributing to debt and other crises. Yet even in all the financial chaos, Iceland has been exceptional -- and only partly because its leader was the first to be criminally charged and, on one count, convicted. Once one of the world's wealthiest countries per capita, Iceland took a huge hit in 2008 when its banking system collapsed spectacularly, wiping out billions of dollars in savings. The ripple effect was felt far beyond the island nation, particularly in Britain and the Netherlands. Those two nation's governments came up with more than $5 billion to bail out its citizens who'd put their money in Iceland-based banks. That prompted a bitter dispute when those countries demanded that Iceland compensate them, as required by a European Union directive. The International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $2.1 billion in November 2009, at which time it made repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments a requirement of the loan. That same year, Harde was ousted as prime minister. And last month, after a judge had thrown out two additional charges, his trial began on four counts: failing to ensure that a financial stability group delivered the required results, failing to take action to reduce the size of Iceland's banking system, failing to verify the move of accounts from Landsbanki bank's Icesave program, and failing to focus more Cabinet meetings on the crisis. Haarde called the first three charges, of which he was cleared, ""substantive"" in that they were allegations that tied into his and his government's role in the crisis. He described the one charge he was convicted of, meanwhile, as ""purely formulaic: Did we discuss or not discuss (the financial crisis) enough?"" The former prime minister acknowledged that he, like others, had ""made mistakes"" but said he's not to blame for what happened. There were a host of reasons, he said, including Iceland's reliance on what he described as a flawed European financial regulatory framework and the danger posed by ""the free flow of capital across borders unless there are certain preventive measures in place."" ""There was a lot of irregular stuff going on within the banking system, and of course ... there was an international financial crisis,"" Haarde said. ""We didn't see that coming."" He added that ""nobody has been complaining about the way we handled the crisis, which has been described as very successful by a lot of people."" In fact, the IMF has forecast economic growth of 2.5% for the island nation in 2012, and the ratings agency Fitch has raised Iceland's long-term debt back to investment grade. ""In many ways, we are ahead of the curve,"" Haarde said, comparing Iceland with Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, which also received bailouts. ""We are moving faster out of the crisis than these countries are."" CNN's Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","NEW: Geir Haarde calls his lone conviction ""ridiculous"" and inconsequential .

"(CNN) -- For sailing fans, boxing references don't immediately spring to mind when describing the thrills and spills of their sport -- even if it is the biggest race of all: The America's Cup. At one stage Oracle Team USA were flat on the canvas facing the referee's count as they went 8-1 down in this year's competition against a dominant Emirates Team New Zealand. Read more: Miracle on the water still possible . Then suddenly it was ""rope-a-dope"" on the high seas. This year's hosts of the 163-year-old race had come to their senses -- with a little help along the way from a British Olympic legend -- staggered to their feet, then struck back to level the series at 8-8. While there's no suggestion this was a deliberate ploy to take the sting out of their opponents by taking a beating first, as Muhammad Ali famously did against George Foreman, the boxing great would have approved all the same. Even if you're not a sailing fan it's hard to beat this race for drama. ""This is as exciting as #sailing gets, ever. 8-8,"" CNN.com Sports Editor Ben Wyatt posted on Twitter. Larry Ellison, the billionaire technology titan who bankrolls the U.S. team, even bailed from his keynote address at Oracle's annual conference on Tuesday to greet his crew in San Francisco Bay. Plaudits . The team's exploits have put this event in the spotlight like never before, with stars from other sports taking to Twitter to heap praise on Jimmy Spithill's crew. ""Incredible comeback by the oracleteamusa boys in the @americascup marked by 7 straight victories ..."" tweeted IndyCar racer JR Hildebrand. Fellow driver Dario Franchitti posted: ""Fantastic recovery by @OracleTeamUSA @JSpithill and the boys!!!"" It was an altogether different vibe on the other side of the world where the America's Cup is the next best thing for New Zealanders after Rugby Union and the beloved All Blacks. Auckland-based sports journalist Guy Heveldt, made a cheeky reference on Twitter to the ""outside help"" employed on the Team USA boat: ""A Kiwi, an Aussie and an Englishman walk into a bar... And walk out with the America's Cup!"" He was of course referring to the likes of skipper Spithill, an Australian, British Olympic sailing champ Ben Ainslie and Simon Daubney, a New Zealander. 'Massacre' But others struck a more sombre tone, intent on penning obituaries for Dean Barker's team, even before Wednesday's winner-takes-all decider. ""This is a massacre. I hope the country does not tear Barker apart. But I fear it will happen. This could be worse than the public blood-letting post Rugby World Cup defeats,"" New Zealand sports broadcaster, Tony Veitch, posted on Facebook. ""We've been sitting on match point for over a week. There's real heartbreak and despair here. Hard to know where this will go,"" TVNZ reporter Paul Hobbs told CNN. ""This was meant to be a Disney finish -- a happy ending. Now it's turned into a Stephen King novel -- a horror show."" ""Emirates Team New Zealand aren't just battling for the America's Cup now. They may be fighting for their very existence,"" wrote Paul Lewis in the New Zealand Herald. He suggested the team's CEO, Grant Dalton, and main backer, Matteo de Nora may walk if they do lose. Lewis added that two lost campaigns in recent years ""raises the issues in sponsors' minds of throwing good money after bad."" And expensive it is -- Ellison spent an estimated US$100 million on winning the famous old trophy, known as the ""Auld Mug."" ""But (Darth) Vadar likely poured money and effort into the Death Star. People cheered when that blew up, too,"" observed San Francisco-based journalist Joe Eskenazi sardonically. Lost faith . With a race to go, the American comeback has left most people in New Zealand and beyond very nervous -- even a former prime minister. ""Hard to know what to say: Team New Zealand 8, Oracle 8 at America's Cup in San Francisco. All hangs on next race,"" tweeted Helen Clark, who was premier in Wellington between 1999 and 2008. ""Looks like New Zealand is about to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory after losing another race this morning in the #AmericasCup,"" posted Australian television presenter Lisa Wilkinson. Ominously, New Zealand bookmakers appear to have lost faith in their crew. The TAB has reduced its odds on a win for its boat as more people start to place bets on an American win. Even with the increased potential payout for a New Zealand victory ""no-one is interested"" in betting on the Kiwis, bookmaker Kieren McAnulty said, in quotes carried by stuff.co.nz.","Oracle Team USA fights back to tie series 8-8 after being 8-1 down .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Gunmen broke into the house of a women's rights activist in the volatile northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Thursday and beheaded her, police said. Iraqi Interior Ministry troops conduct inspections at a checkpoint in the southern Iraqi city of Basra in May. The victim was identified as Nahla Hussain, the leader of the women's league of the Kurdish Communist Party. She was alone in the house at the time of her death. It is not known what the circumstances were that led to the attack. Violence against women has been an ongoing problem in Iraq. The killing comes ahead of next month's provincial elections, a post-Saddam era watershed event that's generating an uptick in civil unrest and political infighting. Twenty-four officers from the interior and defense ministries were arrested this week accused of facilitating the activities of former Baathist regime members, the Iraqi prime minister's media spokesman said Thursday. The arrests appear to have been politically motivated, a senior U.S. military official told CNN Thursday. The official said Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is believed to be behind the arrests. Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said the detained officers have links to the al-Awda party, an underground successor to Saddam Hussein's Baath party, . The Baathist movement ruled Iraq for 35 years but was banned after Hussein was overthrown in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The arrests, which were made inside and outside ministerial offices, were carried out by an elite force that reports directly to al-Maliki, according to an Interior Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Al-Maliki's media spokesman, Yasseen Majeed, denied that report and said the arrests were made by Iraqi security forces acting on judicial arrest warrants. Majeed, al-Maliki's military office, and Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, spokesman for the Baghdad Operations Command told Iraqi State TV that reports of a planned coup are incorrect. Majeed said the arrests were precautionary measures. He said investigations are continuing into the suspects, who are accused of facilitating the activities of ""terrorists"" and ""outlaws."" Initial reports listed arrest tolls that ranged from 20s to the 30s and said the arrested were all from the Interior Ministry, which oversees policing, border enforcement and internal security. The ministry has been criticized by Iraqi and U.S. officials for inefficiency, corruption and infiltration by Shiite militia groups during the Sunni-Shiite violence in 2006 and 2007. According to the Interior Ministry's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf, the highest-ranking person taken into custody was a brigadier general, and the others were low-ranking officers. He said 23 officers were detained and judicial authorities were questioning them. The Interior Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said at least 32 ministry employees were arrested between Monday and Wednesday. That official had no information on the reasons behind the arrests. He said at least two generals were among the arrested, and identified one as Gen. Ahmed Taha Abu Ragheef, head of the ministry's Internal Affairs Department. Khalaf said Ragheef was not among those arrested, and Ragheef himself appeared on state TV to issue a denial. He said he took part in the investigation that led to the action. It is not yet clear how many Sunnis and Shiites were arrested in the case, but Saddamists tend to be Sunnis. Al-Maliki is a Shiite, and the government is dominated by a Shiite bloc, called the United Iraqi Alliance, and a Kurdish bloc. One knowledgeable Iraqi politician told CNN he believes this and other discord at present in Iraq, such as attacks, arrests and political infighting, stems from internal conflicts between political parties ahead of the January 31 provincial elections. The voting -- to be held in 14 of Iraq's 18 provinces -- has been much anticipated by U.S. and Iraqi officials, who hope the election of local government officials can empower grass-roots Iraqis and give alienated Sunni Arabs more political clout. Sunnis, who had more power under Saddam than they do now, feel they have been marginalized in Iraq's new political system, where the majority Shiite population and the Kurds have emerged as powers. Elections won't be held in Tameem province, where political disputes in the city of Kirkuk have yet to be resolved, and in the three Kurdish autonomous region provinces. As for the Interior Ministry, a September 2007 report assessing the status of Iraq's security forces slammed it and the National Police, which it operates. The report by the Independent Commission on Security Forces in Iraq, called Interior ""a ministry in name only"" and said it was ""widely regarded as being dysfunctional and sectarian, and suffers from ineffective leadership."" It said the National Police force has been ""operationally ineffective"" and ""sectarianism in its units undermines its ability to provide security; the force is not viable in its current form. The National Police should be disbanded and reorganized."" The Defense Ministry oversees the military. The 2007 report had promising words for the Iraqi army, special forces, navy and air force, describing them as ""increasingly effective"" and ""capable of assuming greater responsibility for the internal security of Iraq."" CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Leader of Kurdish Communist Party women's league killed in home .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is asking the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to look into additional questions about unintended acceleration of Toyota cars. Citing unidentified whistle-blowers critical of ""too narrow"" federal investigations, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the NHTSA in a letter to look into the phenomenon of ""tin whiskers"" -- or crystalline structures of tin -- that theoretically could lead to the unintended acceleration. The whistle-blowers also provided Grassley with documentation about the investigations by NHTSA and NASA into the Toyota vehicles, including one NASA report that stated: ""Because proof that the (electronic throttle-control systems) caused the reported (unintended accelerations) was not found does not mean it could not occur."" Grassley's letter to the safety agency's administrator, David Strickland, asks the agency to provide the committee with all information relating to tin whisker testing and for the agency's position on tin whiskers' possibly causing the unintended acceleration. Strickland and his agency didn't immediately respond Thursday to a CNN request for a comment. A Toyota spokesman told CNN Thursday that ""so-called 'tin whiskers' are not a new phenomenon and do not represent a mysterious or undetectable problem in a vehicle's electronics."" Last year, a federal investigation into possible causes of the unintended acceleration in Toyota cars found no fault with the automaker's electronic throttle-control systems, the Department of Transportation said. So far there are three known causes of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles: improperly installed floor mats, sticky pedals and driver error. Toyota spokesman Brian Lyons said Thursday that ""all the scientific evidence"" confirms there's no problem with the electronic throttle-control systems in Toyota vehicles. ""Indeed, no data indicates that tin whiskers are more prone to occur in Toyota vehicles than any other vehicle in the marketplace,"" Lyons said in an e-mail to CNN. ""Further, no one has ever found a single real-world example of tin whiskers causing an unintended acceleration event, nor have they put forth any evidence of unintended acceleration occurring in a Toyota vehicle because of tin whiskers forming inside an accelerator pedal position sensor,"" Lyons said. ""Toyota's systems are designed to reduce the risk that tin whiskers will form in the first place and multiple robust fail-safe systems are in place to counter any effects on the operation of our vehicles in the highly unlikely event that they do form and connect to adjacent circuitry,"" Lyons said. In Grassley's letter dated July 12 and released publicly Thursday, the senator asks Strickland why his agency relied on NASA engineers and whether the agency lacks ""the sufficient expertise to conduct such investigations and why."" Said Grassley in the letter: ""This is a serious issue. From 2000 to 2010, NASA concluded there were 9,698 identified UA (unintended acceleration) customer complaints and NHTSA concedes that this is likely only a fraction of the actual incidents of UA: 'NHTSA assumes that not all incidents are reported and that, accordingly, each complaint represents a greater number of unreported real-world failures.'"" Grassley asks the agency how many of the 9,698 vehicles were inspected for tin whiskers. In March, CNN reported that Toyota engineers found an electronic software problem that caused ""sudden unintended acceleration"" in a test vehicle during pre-production trials, according to a company engineering document obtained by and translated for CNN. The 2006 document, marked ""confidential,"" recounted the results of an adaptive cruise-control software test in a model internally designated the 250L, a vehicle later sold as the Lexus 460 in Japan and Europe. The document says a ""fail-safe overhaul"" would be needed for another model in production, internally designated the 180L, which the company says was later sold as a Toyota Tundra. In response, Toyota asserted that the document shows no such thing, and the company continues to deny that any sudden unintended acceleration in any of its vehicles was caused by electronic systems. The Japanese-language document said that Toyota engineers recorded a ""sudden unintended acceleration"" in the 250L's adaptive cruise control, which was designed to slow the vehicle if sensors detected an object ahead and accelerate the vehicle when the obstacle clears, according to a Tokyo-based translation house with expertise in automotive and technical matters that CNN retained to independently translate the document. Toyota insisted the translation was inaccurate. Despite multiple requests, the company didn't provide its own translation of the document. Neither the test vehicle nor the adaptive cruise-control system cited in the document has been sold in the United States, Toyota said. Grassley set a July 26 deadline for the NHTSA to respond to his eight sets of questions. CNN's David Fitzpatrick contributed to this report.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner's former spokeswoman sued him for sexual harassment Monday, calling Filner unfit ""to hold any public office"" and adding a new dimension to the scandal he faces. Irene McCormack Jackson said she and other women were subjected to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching by Filner. She said she resigned as Filner's communications director in June after deciding that the mayor would not change his behavior. ""I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots,"" Jackson said. She said Filner asked her to work without underwear and made repeated sexual advances toward her. ""He is not fit to be mayor of our great city. He is not fit to hold any public office. A man who lacks character makes a mockery of his ideas,"" she said. Filner has been battling allegations of sexual harassment for several weeks, but none of the women leveling those claims had come forward before Jackson filed suit in a state court Monday. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, called on Filner to resign, telling reporters, ""Apologies alone will not take care of this injustice."" In a statement issued Monday evening, Filner said he was ""saddened"" by the accusations, but ""I remain committed to the people of San Diego and the work that needs to be done."" ""Once due process is allowed to unfold, I am certain there will be a better understanding of this situation,"" he said, adding, ""I humbly ask that through this vicious storm of controversy, people take a moment and temper their rush to judgment."" Filner said last week that he believes he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts."" But he has also acknowledged, ""I need help,"" and added, ""I'm clearly doing something wrong."" ""I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them,"" Filner said in a statement earlier this month. ""It's a good thing that behavior that would have been tolerated in the past is being called out in this generation for what it is: inappropriate and wrong."" Jackson's lawsuit names Filner and the city as defendants. San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said his office will defend the city but not Filner, who he said has hired his own lawyer. Asked whether his office would urge Filner to resign, Goldsmith said, ""There's enough legal issues to keep us busy. I'm not getting into the political ones."" The 70-year-old Filner served five terms in Congress before being elected mayor in 2012. Rep. Susan Davis, a San Diego-area congresswoman who served alongside Filner, joined calls for his resignation on Monday. ""Despite his inclusive vision for San Diego, Mayor Filner has lost the confidence of San Diegans to lead,"" Davis, a fellow Democrat, said in a written statement. ""He has taken advantage of the trust the voters placed in him and lost both the promise and capacity to ignite positive change. His behavior, if not illegal, is reprehensible."" Davis said she and Filner ""have never had a smooth relationship,"" but she ""respected his passion for our city and his interest to change the way business is done."" ""But all of that is now lost because he did not have enough passion for the city to curb his incomprehensible and unacceptable behavior,"" she said. Another Democrat, former City Councilwoman Donna Frye, and two attorneys who say they represented accusers had leveled allegations against the mayor before Monday. Jackson said her decision to resign was clinched after Filner's deputy chief of staff resigned in June. Filner ""refused to listen to someone he had known for 35 years, and who told him explicitly, during a senior staff meeting, that his behavior with women was terrible and possibly illegal. Filner ""laughed it off,"" she said. She said Filner challenged her to provide one example of improper behavior; when she brought up his comments about wearing underwear, ""He had no comeback,"" she said. The San Diego Sheriff's Department has established a hotline for accusers, who are allowed to remain anonymous under California law. Since the phone number was announced Friday, the department has received calls, spokeswoman Jan Caldwell told CNN on Monday. No further details were given.

"(CNN) -- Efforts continued Friday to cope with fallout from flooding that''s rocked the Rocky Mountain state -- including more airlifts of stranded residents, discoveries of oil spills and a plea to one town's residents to stay away until E. coli is cleared from their tap water. The number of confirmed dead throughout Colorado from the flooding that began last week stood at seven Friday, just as it was a day earlier. Another three people are presumed dead in Larimer County, which straddles the Wyoming border. Another 82 people there were still unaccounted for as of Friday afternoon, county sheriff's office spokesman John Schulz said. Then there's the sizable toll flooding has had on buildings, roads and bridges, as well as the natural surroundings that in many ways define Colorado. ""We're about to embark on a rebuilding effort that is truly epic in scale,"" Gov. John Hickenlooper said Thursday. This includes oil and gas that leaked in lakes, rivers, streams and more as the floods rolled in. Colorado's Oil and Gas Association, the industry's trade association, said no fracking operations were underway when the floods hit -- meaning ""no fracking fluids, no chemicals associated with fracking, nor equipment were on sites at the time of the flooding."" Yet as of Friday morning -- at which point about 70% of the impacted area still hadn't been assessed -- state authorities were tracking 11 locations with a sheen or other evidence of leaked oil and gas. This is in addition to at least five sizable releases of oil, including two recently confirmed into the South Platte River near Evans, state Department of Natural Resources spokesman Todd Hartman said Friday. Four of these instances (the other is still being assessed) involved the release of about 22,000 gallons of oil, according to Hartman. Moreover, production equipment at one PDC energy location was ""largely washed away,"" though authorities don't yet know how much fuel went with it. And a Colorado Oil and Gas Conversation Commission aerial survey conducted on Thursday found as many as two dozen fuel tanks overturned. Tap water has been turned off for Lyons, a town of about 2,000 people located some 17 miles north of Boulder that was decimated by the floods, after tests showed the bacteria Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. While most E. coli strains are harmless and live in healthy humans and animals' intestines, the bacteria can cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other illness when passed through contaminated water or food, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There has been a breach, and we don't want you using any of the water,"" Lyons town administrator Victoria Simonsen said at a public meeting Thursday. ""... It's critical we get that back up and get it disinfected before we would ... want any of you to be back."" Such environmental issues, as well as the personal impact on thousands of families, stem from a torrential rains that fell September 12 in mountainous areas north of Denver -- more than nine inches, in some places. Such downpours persisted for several more days, adding up to 18.1 inches in parts of Boulder County and 15.6 inches in Adams County, Hickenlooper's office said. The heavy rainfall spurred flash floods that turned picturesque canyons into funnels that deluged towns downstream and left hundreds stranded. More than a week later, many remained marooned Friday -- cut off from the rest of the world thanks to floodwaters that wiped out roads and bridges. Rescuers resumed airlifts Friday to pluck out those stuck in their homes, according to Schulz. He didn't have a number of those flown out for the day. But on Thursday, Nick Christensen -- also with the Larimer County Sheriff's Office -- said nearly 1,200 people had been airlifted out of the mountains, with nearly 200 more choosing to stay put. More than 5,300 people total have been evacuated by floods that impacted nearly 2,000 square miles across 17 countries, Colorado's emergency management office announced in a Friday update. And, according to preliminary estimates, nearly 1,900 homes have been destroyed and another 16,000 suffered damage. Floods also taking a toll on 50 bridges and 200 miles of road; the cost to start repairs on these have been estimated at $135 million. Hickenlooper signed an executive order Friday authorizing $20 million in state funds -- on top of $6 already OK'd -- to help deal with the many issues brought about by the floods.

"(CNN) -- It must have been a terrifying sight. Two stories up, a baby, legs dangling, clutching the black metal edge of the fire escape with his little hands. And then, the even more terrifying sight of a child in free fall. But what could have been a horrifying tragedy turned into a celebration Wednesday when Montessori school teacher Cristina Torre -- daughter of the former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre -- caught the 1-year-old after he bounced off an awning. ""I honestly did not feel his weight,"" she told CNN Thursday. ""It was effortless. He felt light as a feather."" Torre was hailed as a hero for catching the child, who police say had crawled out onto the fire escape after pushing aside a piece of cardboard covering a hole next to the second-floor apartment's air conditioner. The boy's parents, however, weren't receiving quite the same reception. They were awaiting arraignment Thursday on child endangerment charges. Three other children in the apartment, ages 2, 3 and 5 -- were placed in the custody of Child Protective Services. Their 1-year-old son, whose name has not been released, was discharged from Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn hours after the incident, a hospital spokeswoman said Thursday. It wasn't immediately clear where he was Thursday. Torre said she was passing by the apartment building when she looked up and saw the baby's precarious situation. She got on her phone and called 911 while she maneuvered herself into position under the boy. She told CNN's Alina Cho, ""I saw the baby, kind of straddling (a) pole ... and I started talking to him, as I'm talking to 911, and saying, 'Please stay up there, please.' "" ""The minute he let go, I just hoped for the best and had my arms out waiting for him,"" she said. Torre said the boy was crying and bleeding from the mouth after hitting something on the way down, but otherwise seemed to be all right.

"(CNN) -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, 38, has never lived a day in which his father Moammar didn't rule Libya -- as its undisputed leader inside the country and an enigmatic, controversial voice for the world. And yet, as the Libyan government faced a stiff popular uprising, it was Moammar Gadhafi's second eldest son -- and not the Leader of the Revolution himself -- who was first to talk to the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it. The speech, made early Monday on Libyan state television, does not mean that Saif Gadhafi has usurped power from his father: Senior U.S. officials said there's no indication the elder Gadhafi is losing his grip. Still, many were left thinking: Why did Saif speak? There was no public explanation why his father, who state-run TV showed repeatedly being showered with support as his limousine rolled down a packed Tripoli street or in a crowded hall, didn't talk. One way to explain the choice, said David Schencker of the Washington Institute for Near East Affairs think tank, is Moammar Gadhafi is ""consistently inconsistent"" -- meaning, his decisions are famously hard to understand or predict. Still, experts say, what may make Saif stand out most is that, among his relatives, he seems the polar opposite of his father. ""I don't think Saif is a hated figure,"" said Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank. ""He has seemed to have some good intentions."" Whereas Moammar Gadhafi years ago launched a program to ""destroy imported ideologies, whether they are Eastern or Western,"" his son speaks fluent English, earned his PhD from the London School of Economics, written an op-ed in the New York Times and has been a frequent go-between in talks with international officials. Moammar rarely goes anywhere without a distinctive tribal dress and an ornate Bedouin tent. The well-traveled Saif, meanwhile, addressed the Libyan nation early Monday in Western business attire: a suit and tie. While the father runs a nation, his son's main job -- at least before his 2009 appointment as General Coordinator, a position like many in the nation's government with few guidelines -- was heading a charity, the Gadhafi Foundation. Thus, instead of calling Islamic militants ""mad dogs"" and ""terrorists,"" Saif's charity last week engineered the prison release of 110 members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. And lastly, while the elder Gadhafi is known for his heavy-handed rule in Libya and its restrictions on civil rights and more, Saif Gadhafi has fashioned himself as a human rights advocate and pushed for democratic and institutional reforms that could give more power and freedoms to the people. Still, the sputtering of Saif Gadhafi's public pro-democracy and pro-rights agenda suggest the real limits on his authority. While some long banned non-governmental organizations and media were allowed into Libya for the first time in recent years, access was tightly controlled and the movement's momentum stalled. ""Periodically, his father has given him a bit of leash and (Saif) has gone out and talked about creating a constitution"" and similar reforms, said Schencker, a former U.S. Defense Department official. ""But then these things get reined back."" In fact, until Monday, many experts felt the most powerful Gadhafi outside of Moammar was Saif's brother, Mutassim, Libya's national security advisor. Saif's rights-centered focus and Western outreach put him at odds with the country's old guard. Thus, his Monday speech notwithstanding, Dunne said she didn't think it was a precursor to Saif taking his father's place. ""Right now, my gut tells me it's unlikely that Saif would emerge,"" said Dunne, who is also editor of the Arab Reform Bulletin. ""He's rather weak."" And Dunne said Saif's gambit, proposing a major political reforms if the uprising ends, isn't likely to end in a deal. Beyond the fact there's little indication that anti-government demonstrators will give up their fight, Libya has shown little inclination to liberalize or democratize in the 42 years under his father. Moreover, for all their differences, Saif's standing in the world is still largely defined by his father's role in Libya. Even while some may see the son as more open to change, there's little question that his loyalty remains first with Moammar and that his father has given little indication publicly that he's ready to let go and calls the shots. ""Those promises have much less credibility than what they might have in other Arab countries,"" she said. ""People have no faith in the family.""","Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, 38, gives Libya's first public speech acknowledging unrest .
There's been no public indication why he, and not his father Moammar, talked .
As Western-educated and reform-minded, Saif has differences with his father .
An expert says that, his speech notwithstanding, it's unlikely Saif will rise to power ."
"Washington (CNN) -- Toyota engineers found an electronic software problem that caused ""sudden unintended acceleration"" in a test vehicle during pre-production trials, according to a company engineering document obtained by and translated for CNN. The 2006 document, marked ""confidential,"" recounted the results of an adaptive cruise-control software test in a model internally designated the 250L, a vehicle later sold as the Lexus 460 in Japan and Europe. The document says a ""fail-safe overhaul"" would be needed for another model in production, internally designated the 180L, which the company says was later sold as a Toyota Tundra. Toyota insists that the document shows no such thing, and it continues to deny that any sudden unintended acceleration in any of its vehicles was caused by electronic systems. But three translations of the report, including two commissioned by CNN after Toyota's objections, found that engineers raised concerns that the adaptive cruise control system would start the car moving forward on its own. Read the original document and English translations here . ""The cruise control activates by itself at full throttle when the accelerator pedal position sensor is abnormal,"" states the document, written in Japanese, translated into English. Software glitches were an early suspect in the rash of reports of sudden, unintended accelerations reported in Toyota vehicles in 2010, some of which caused severe accidents and several fatalities. But both Toyota and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration concluded that electronics were not at fault, instead blaming bad floor mats, sticky accelerator pedals and, in some cases, driver error. Toyota has never conceded that an electronics or software problem could be responsible in any way for sudden acceleration in its cars and trucks. ""This looks like an example of electronics causing a car to suddenly accelerate,"" said Michael Pecht, director of the CALCE Electronics Products and Systems Center at the University of Maryland. Pecht, a mechanical engineering professor, was assigned to look into the sudden acceleration of Toyota vehicles as a consultant for Congress. He said the document should have been included in any investigation, and he questioned why it wasn't shared with the NHTSA, NASA -- which assisted the highway safety agency's review -- and Congress. Toyota said it did not share the document with the NHTSA because ""the test and the document had nothing to do with unintended acceleration, or a defect, or a safety flaw of any kind."" Toyota electrical engineer Kristen Tabar said the sequence described in the test memo ""takes place in a fraction of a second."" ""This is a case where the vehicle is under test,"" said Tabar, a manager at the Toyota Technical Center near Ann Arbor, Michigan. ""Again, we input an abnormal signal. The vehicle reacts appropriately to that signal and releases the brake, just as we would expect it to do and want it to do. This has nothing to do with sudden unintended acceleration at all."" Toyota says that the test vehicle ""did not physically move forward"" and that the experiment led to ""an adjustment and refinement"" of the cruise control before it went into production. The issue has never occurred in any Toyota vehicle sold, the company said. The company says the document was meant to alert other engineers to the pre-production problem, so lessons learned could be shared. Neither the test vehicle nor the adaptive cruise-control system cited in the document have been sold in the United States, Toyota said. The engineering document was originally provided to CNN in Japanese, with an English translation (PDF). When Toyota complained about what it said were inaccuracies in the original translation (PDF), CNN retained a Tokyo-based translation house with expertise in automotive and technical matters to independently retranslate the document. That translation backed up the first, finding that Toyota engineers recorded a ""sudden unintended acceleration"" in the 250L's adaptive cruise control, which was designed to slow the vehicle if sensors detected an object ahead and accelerate the vehicle when the obstacle clears. But Toyota again said the translation was inaccurate (PDF). ""The exact translation is not 'sudden unintended acceleration,' "" said Tabar, who does not speak Japanese. ""This is a test referring to adaptive cruise control, so the literal translation is, 'it can begin or start by itself,' which is consistent with what you would expect from a cruise control, or in this case, an adaptive cruise control system."" When Toyota argued that both translations were in error, CNN commissioned a third translation (PDF) by another firm in the United States with expertise in automotive and engineering translations. According to the third translation, Toyota's engineers stated that a test was conducted on the 180L ""to prevent the accelerator malfunction that caused the vehicle to accelerate on its own"" in an earlier test of the 250L. Despite multiple requests, Toyota did not provide its own translation of the document. Neil Hanneman, an independent automobile safety engineer based in California, examined all three translations of the document at CNN's request and concluded that in 2006, Toyota did in fact have an electronics issue. ""This is a tangible, repeatable, fixable issue that they've identified in this vehicle,"" Hanneman said. ""It's related to software issues, which is something Toyota has said is infallible in their systems."" Another analyst who reviewed all three translations, Clarence Ditlow, reached a similar conclusion. ""What the memo tells me is that there was an electronic problem that caused unintended acceleration in an earlier-model Lexus -- the 250 -- and they wanted to avoid the same problem occurring in the 180,"" said Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a watchdog group founded by Ralph Nader. ""And they identified a failure mode."" But Toyota officials said that in this instance, engineers ""intentionally and artificially produced an inappropriate sensor signal as a test of the electronic failsafe system."" Toyota said that the test ""merely identified an unacceptable electronic sensor sensitivity threshold"" and that the vehicle did not physically move during the test. Toyota spokesman John Hanson emphasized that the problem was fixed before the vehicle was put into production. He called the document obtained by CNN ""evidence of Toyota's robust design process."" In a letter to CNN, Toyota said, ""It is ironic and disheartening that a document that is actually evidence of Toyota's robust vehicle design and pre-production testing to ensure safety is the apparent centerpiece for CNN's broadcast."" Read the full letter (PDF) The Toyota and NHTSA conclusions on the cause of the 2010 rash of unintended acceleration problems in the U.S. were backed up by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. In a January 18 report, the research council called those findings legitimate but warned that the NHTSA could face difficulties in examining increasingly complicated electronic systems unless it adds more electronics expertise to investigation teams. In 2011, motorists reported 331 incidents of sudden acceleration to the NHTSA, according to data compiled by Safety Research and Strategies Inc., a consulting firm that has in the past advised consumers who have filed lawsuits against Toyota. Safety Research and Strategies has recently filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking documents and videos of one such incident, in a 2004 Prius.","Translated Toyota report describes a cruise-control system test .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ted Cruz says he wasn't elected to the Senate to stay quiet. And his refusal upon entering Congress to observe its protocol to sit back and learn like a freshman, as expected, rubbed some of his more senior colleagues the wrong way. And while he has angered much of his party over his crusade against President Barack Obama's health care law and the government shutdown it could cause, Cruz says he's standing for the same principles that got him elected. On Tuesday, he took that edict to the Senate floor in support of his plan to defund Obamacare, saying he would speak ""until I am no longer able to stand."" And on Wednesday morning, he was still talking. As the hours dragged on, Cruz addressed his daughters, apologized for not being home to read them a book, and read to them from the Senate floor. After reading Dr. Seuss' ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" he said it was applicable to Obamacare. ""President Obama and Senate Democrats told the American people just try Obamacare. Just try it,"" he said. Cruz will have to stop talking soon. His marathon appearance is not an official filibuster. It will not do anything to block Obamacare funding because a key procedural vote on the issue was already scheduled for Wednesday. His efforts will have to awkwardly come to an end when the vote he is fighting against is called. A senator -- usually a freshman is tasked with the duty -- always has to be presiding over the Senate during session. And a displeased Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, tweeted his annoyance after walking into the Senate chamber for his midnight two-hour shift. ""Walking into Capitol to take 11-1 shift presiding over the Senate for this pointless fairy tale non-filibuster,"" he tweeted. Critics are questioning Cruz's motives: Is this about his principles or about presidential aspirations? CNN political analyst Gloria Borger said his Republican detractors think Cruz is putting his political career above all else. ""While many others have, no doubt, come to the Senate in the past as a springboard to the presidency, it's hard to recall someone who has created as much controversy within his own party,"" she said. Cruz has been in Washington for less than a year, but his short stint has been an effective lesson in partisan politics. Only history will tell, however, if his tactics will be worth repeating. The Texas Republican's counterparts in the House of Representatives have tried 42 times to roll back Obamacare, but their efforts have gone nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Cruz has upped the ante. His latest battle to disrupt Obamacare is tied to funding the government in the new fiscal year that starts on October 1. The House passed the measure last week. But Senate Democrats are not about to allow the health care bill to be unraveled, therefore putting at risk a government shutdown. Cruz's refusal to give up the fight has rankled many of his fellow Republicans, widening divisions in a splintered party. Democrats, meanwhile, are sitting back and watching the intraparty fight. Who is this guy? His effectiveness at political debate has landed Cruz in many successful places. He was elected to the Senate in 2012, after rebuking the Republican establishment and winning the Republican primary, paving the way to a general election victory. Previously, he was the youngest solicitor general of Texas and has argued multiple cases before the Supreme Court. He got his start at Princeton as head of the debate team and then honed his skill at Harvard Law School. What's his fight? Cruz did not take his Senate responsibilities lightly. As a freshman, he refused to stand on the sidelines until he gained a measure of seniority, a common tradition in Washington. Instead, he was loud and opinionated. ""I find it amusing that those in Washington are puzzled when someone actually does what they said they would do,"" Cruz told CNN in February. ""At the end of the day, I was elected to represent 26 million Texans and to speak the truth. You know, I think a lot of Americans are tired of politicians in Washington in both parties who play games. Cruz was elected, promising to shrink government, especially the new health care law. That battle has been embraced by most Republicans in Congress, but his latest tactic has frustrated many. Political novice? New York Rep. Peter King has been an outspoken critic of Cruz's latest crusade Ã¢â¬â at one point calling him a ""fraud."" ""Whether it's Custer, whether it's kamikaze, or whether it's Gallipoli or whatever, we are going to lose this,"" the New York Republican said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" last week. And Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee tweeted that he ""didn't go to Harvard or Princeton"" but that he ""can count"" that Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Senate. But Cruz said to let his critics talk. ""If you get outside of Washington, D.C., there is a frustration with Washington that is palpable. When you ask your constituents what are the problems you're facing, over and over again, the answer that comes back is Obamacare is killing jobs, is taking away my health insurance, is driving up my premiums, is causing small businesses to shrink, to go out of business. If we listen to the American people, that should be our priorities,"" he told CNN this week. Still, Republicans are frustrated by his insistence on fighting a divisive, losing battle. 'Don't break filibuster' ""We are giving Obama the escape out,"" Republican strategist Ana Navarro said on CNN's ""AC360."" ""Instead of now focusing on the problems with Obamacare, everybody's focused on the civil war in the Republican Party."" Navarro also noted the numerous polls, including CNN's latest poll, that said while citizens are concerned about Obamacare, they don't support shutting down the government over it. ""If you want to fix Obamacare or repeal it or fix it or change it, the best way to do it is to elect more Republicans. And the political cost of a government shutdown is really going to affect any -- any possibility of electing more Republicans,"" Navarro added. Or political genius? While Cruz is ruffling the feathers of his colleagues in Washington, he is mobilizing the grass roots outside the Beltway. Conservative groups are praising him. ""Senator Cruz came to Washington to advance conservative policies, not play by the same old rules that have relegated conservatives, and their ideas, to the back bench,"" Michael Needham, president of Heritage Action, recently said about Cruz. His group helps activate grass-roots Republicans for conservative candidates and political causes. And Republican candidates running against Republican incumbents in the primaries are using Cruz's crusade in their races. Matt Bevin, who is running for Senate to replace top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, said in a statement that he would support ""conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz in his fight to defund Obamacare."" Obamacare: Can it be stopped? Bevin bashed McConnell for coming out against Cruz's effort to shut down the government in order to stop Obamacare. Like so many other crucial fights, Mitch McConnell has caved to (Senate Majority Leader) Harry Reid on Obamacare and is refusing to fight to defund this disastrous legislation."" And longtime Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming came out in support of Cruz. He is facing Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, in a contentious primary. Will Cruz be scarred or be a star? Cruz could alienate his colleagues to a point where he becomes marginalized and completely ineffective in Washington. He has also hinted at a possible presidential run in 2016. If he has no Republican Party support, he risks being cut off from its financing and other resources. On the other hand, Cruz's principled stand could help to grow a movement of disenchanted conservative voters. If a groundswell of conservative grass-roots activists grows between now and 2016 -- and their financial support grows, too -- Cruz could have carved out a path to the Republican nomination. ""I think what Senator Cruz understands is that he has more to gain from adhering to his principles, staying in touch with the grass roots here and around the country, than he does being friends with other senators,"" said Brendan Steinhauser, a leading Texas tea party activist who worked to get Cruz elected. Cruz calls for backup plan .","Ted Cruz doesn't follow Senate rules, irritating traditionalists on both sides of the aisle .

"(CNN) -- Four wildfires were burning in Yellowstone National Park on Tuesday, the 25th anniversary of a devastating day in 1988 when massive wildfires in the park suddenly grew by tens of thousands of acres. The fires now burning in Yellowstone, all of them in Wyoming's corner of the park, are minimal compared with those of 1988, which ended up affecting almost 800,000 acres -- or 36 percent -- of park territory. The largest wildfire Tuesday was the 4,500-acre Alum Fire, burning near the center of the park near Mud Volcano. The lighting-caused fire was discovered last Wednesday and grew quickly over the weekend, but it had limited activity Tuesday, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. The Alum Fire forced a temporary road closure from Canyon Village south to Fishing Bridge, but all other roads leading into and through the park, along with all campgrounds and services, were open, the park said. There were no imminent evacuations for any part of the park. Massive Yellowstone geyser puts on a surprise show . The most activity Tuesday was with the Alder Fire, another lightning-caused fire that was at 3,000 acres and growing. It was burning on a peninsula at the south end of Yellowstone Lake, however, so it is hemmed in by water on three sides and by a recently burned area to the south, InciWeb said. Two other fires in Yellowstone, also caused by lightning, were modest by comparison: The Snake Fire, burning near the park's south entrance along the boundary with Grand Teton National Park, was at 200 acres; and the Druid Fire, near the park's northeast entrance, was at 100 acres. A much larger fire was burning Tuesday in California in the Stanislaus National Forest, just east of Yosemite National Park. What to know about wildfires . The Rim fire measured more than 10,000 acres and was 0% contained Tuesday, InciWeb reported. It was burning in inaccessible and steep terrain, hampering firefighting efforts. The fire recently moved south over Highway 120, in the southern part of the forest, forcing the closure of part of the road and evacuations in the nearby town of Buck Meadows. No westbound traffic was being allowed out of Yosemite because of the fire. In the summer of 1988, more than 50 wildfires -- most of them caused by lightning -- burned at Yellowstone, marshaling the largest firefighting effort ever seen in the United States up to that time. No humans died, but about 300 large animals were killed. The first fire that year began June 14, and new fires popped up every week, if not every day. August 20 was the worst single day of that summer; warm and heavy winds helped the fire burn more than 150,000 acres on a day later known as ""Black Saturday."" Snow and rain finally fell Sept. 11 of that year, marking the beginning of the end of Yellowstone's worst summer of fires. Former Marine finds home at Yellowstone .

"(CNN) -- Not guilty. That's the verdict jurors reached this weekend in the trial of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The decision might have capped the criminal case, but for Zimmerman and others, it also marked new chapters in their lives. Protests erupted in a number of U.S. cities, and reactions to the verdict poured in from all sides Sunday, including from the nation's highest office. The response was outsized because the case has come to represent something greater than the sum of its parts. It's become a forum for debate about gun laws and race in America. Donna Brazile: Doing what's right not just about law . ""The whole world was looking at this case for a reason. ... We'd be intellectually dishonest if we didn't acknowledge the racial undertones,"" said Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump. ""So we have to have very responsible conversations about how we get better as a country, and move forward from this tragedy, and learn from it."" Here's a look at how the case got started, the trial and what could happen next: . How did we get here? On the night of February 26, 2012, Martin was walking back to the house of his father's fiancee after going to a Sanford, Florida, convenience store. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, spotted the teenager and called police. A 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman that officers were on the way and not to follow Martin. Zimmerman got out of his car, later telling police he'd wanted to get a definitive address to relay to authorities. Sometime after that, Zimmerman and Martin got into a physical altercation. Fast facts and timeline of the case . Attorneys aired competing theories during the trial about that fight. Who was the aggressor? Did Martin see or reach for Zimmerman's gun? The exact sequence of events was not clear. Initially, no charged were pursued against Zimmerman, who identifies as Hispanic. Martin was African-American. Demonstrators demanding Zimmerman's arrest rallied around the country. Even President Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy, saying about a month after Martin was killed that the incident required national ""soul-searching."" Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder on April 11, 2012. Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death . The verdict . His case was decided by a six-person, all-female jury. Five of the women were white; one was a minority. They deliberated for 16 1/2 hours before delivering their decision late Saturday night. The jury had three choices: to find Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder; to find him guilty of a lesser charge of manslaughter; or to find him not guilty. They opted for the latter. Five things that led to Zimmerman's acquittal . None of the jurors wanted to talk to the media, and they have indicated they won't speak in the future. ""Jurors were given packets of letters from the media containing interview requests. They expressed no interest at this time,"" a court spokeswoman tweeted after the verdict. Reaction across the country . Just steps away from the courthouse where the jury decided Zimmerman's fate, protesters vowed their fight wasn't over. Rallies were held in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, New York and other cities. Protesters waved signs in Dallas that said, ""Justice system is a joke,"" CNN affiliate WFAA reported. Family members on both sides also spoke out. Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., told CNN that the ""facts spoke for themselves."" ""I think we should really take a step back, respect that verdict, respect those six women -- an all-women jury, who had to make a really tough call and had to look at this outside all the emotions that were stirred up, and all of the racial innuendo that was stirred up, and just kind of look at the facts,"" he said. Trayvon Martin's father said his heart was broken but his faith was not. ""God blessed Me & Sybrina with Tray and even in his death I know my baby proud of the FIGHT we along with all of you put up for him GOD BLESS,"" Tracy Martin wrote in a tweet. ""Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY."" Likewise, Obama weighed in on the case, urging ""calm reflection."" At the same time, he stressed that ""we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken."" He called Martin's death a tragedy for America. ""I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher,"" Obama said. ""I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. ""We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis,"" the president said. Opinion: Case echoes issues of race, guns . What's next in this saga? Zimmerman's next steps are a question mark. Robert Zimmerman Jr. said his brother ""is going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life."" ""He has to be very cautious and protective of his safety because there is still a fringe element who have said, at least in tweets and everything else, that they want revenge -- that they will not listen to a verdict of not guilty,"" defense attorney Mark O'Mara said. And even though the Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty, a court could still hold him accountable for Martin's death. That could happen in two ways: A civil lawsuit or a civil rights suit. A civil suit allows a party to seek monetary damages against another for causing physical or emotional harm, regardless of the outcome of a criminal trial. Trayvon's dad: My heart is broken, my faith is not . A civil rights suit involves criminal charges for violating someone's civil rights, which are protected under federal law. So far, members of Martin's family have only said they want the public to respect the Florida court's verdict. But the NAACP is pushing the U.S. Department of Justice to file a civil rights suit. The rights group accuses Zimmerman of racial profiling that led to Martin's death -- an allegation that Zimmerman, his family and his supporters have denied. The Justice Department did not respond directly to the NAACP demand. It has an ongoing separate federal investigation. Analysis: The race factor in Zimmerman's trial .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this year, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning $1 million or more, a higher threshold than the $250,000 dividing line backed by President Obama. Eventually, Schumer and Pelosi declared their support for the president's position. But the $1 million proposal might serve as the basis for a bipartisan agreement. A number of Republicans, led by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, have called for raising tax revenue by capping deductions at $50,000, a proposal that would leave virtually all middle-income households untouched while substantially raising average tax rates on households in the top 2% of the income distribution. A deduction cap is expected to raise roughly $800 billion in revenue above current policy, which is only half of the $1.6 trillion the Obama administration hopes to raise from high-earners. It is, however, an amount that many congressional Republicans appear to have deemed acceptable. Politics: The road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions . One of the central problems with a deduction cap, however, is that it is likely to be opposed by politically influential charitable organizations, which recognize that it will greatly undermine the incentive for high earners to make large charitable donations. Moreover, President Obama has insisted that tax rates on high earners will have to increase, though he has not made an explicit commitment to the Clinton-era statutory top rate of 39.6% (which compares to today's top rate of 35%). So, is there a way out of this impasse? Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, along with Reps. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, Bob Dold, R-Illinois, and Mary Bono Mack, R-California, have called on congressional Republicans to back legislation that would extend all the Bush-era tax cuts except for the high-income rate reductions, which would be allowed to expire. This remains a minority view among congressional Republicans, but it may well gain support in light of the popularity of allowing the high-income rate reductions to expire. Another possibility is that congressional Republicans will embrace the Schumer-Pelosi proposal. That is, rather than embrace expiration for the high-income rate reductions for households earning $250,000 or more, they would accept it for households earning $1 million or more. This would shield a large, politically influential constituency of affluent households, a disproportionately large share of whom live in high-cost metropolitan areas in blue states, while allowing Democrats and Republicans to take a politically popular stand. Opinion: A tax we could learn to love . To raise somewhat more revenue, this threshold could be set at $500,000 or $410,000, the latter of which would more precisely target the top 1% of households by annual income. Rather than set the tax rate for this new top bracket at 39.6%, Congress could set a rate of 36% or 37%, a face-saving gesture that would contribute to an appearance of moderation. Back in 2007, Alan Viard, a tax economist at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, offered a detailed explanation of why increasing taxes on high-income households alone is unlikely to raise enough revenue to reach ambitious deficit reduction goals. At the time, he estimated that raising $1 trillion in additional revenue relative to the Bush-era tax code from households earning $1 million or more ($500,000 for singles) would require raising the tax rate from 35% to 57%. If the goal of a millionaire's tax bracket is not to raise revenue in the most efficient manner but rather to make a political point, as seems at least somewhat plausible, it is easy to imagine it as the basis of a political compromise. The Obama administration is eager to secure more fiscal stimulus for the coming year in light of sluggish global economic growth. So a tax compromise that raises relatively little revenue is arguably desirable, at least in the short term, as it would help forestall an economic contraction.

"(CNN) -- Two residents of Pawnee will soon bid farewell: Rob Lowe and Rashida Jones are exiting ""Parks and Recreation"" during the show's sixth season, EW has confirmed. (Buzzfeed first reported the news.) The pair will depart about halfway through the season, in the 13th episode. Jones has been with the show since it launched, starring as Ann Perkins, the unlucky-in-love, loyal best friend of Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). Lowe came aboard late in season 2 in a guest arc as Chris Traeger, the super-upbeat state auditor, and wound up becoming a series regular. Chris and Ann dated in season 3, and were trying to have baby at the end of last season. Heidi Klum to guest star on 'Parks and Rec' In a statement today, ""Parks"" executive producer Michael Schur said: ""The news about Rob and Rashida is true Ã¢â¬â they will be leaving the show after the 13th episode of the upcoming season six. We've been working on their storyline (on and off) for four seasons now, and heading into this year, with the two of them contemplating parenthood, it felt like a natural time to move them into the next phase. We absolutely love both Rashida and Rob, and will be sad to see them go. Rashida was one of the very first people we knew we wanted in the cast, and as important as Ann is to Leslie (and vice-versa), she'll certainly never be far from Pawnee. Rob we initially thought we could only have for six or eight episodes, and we couldn't be happier that he will have stuck around for 75. They are wonderful, funny, committed actors, they've been a huge part of the 'Parks and Rec' family, and we think we have a great Pawnee send-off in the works for them."" Kristen Bell to play snooty City Councilwoman on 'Parks and Rec' While it is unclear what that storyline is, Schur recently told EW that when the show resumes, things will be going well romantically for them. ""Their main thrust for the first chunk of episodes is just being a couple and dating Ã¢â¬â and also obviously, trying to have a baby,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- San Francisco on Wednesday threatened to sue Nevada over the practice of ""patient dumping,"" in which the state allegedly sent hundreds of indigent mentally ill patients on one-way trips to California. In a letter to Nevada's state attorney general, San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera threatened a class-action lawsuit, saying Nevada's state-run psychiatric hospital Rawson-Neal sent two dozen patients to his city and hundreds more to other spots in California without any arrangements for care once they arrived. ""As part of my office's investigation, we have obtained the names of the almost 500 patients whom Rawson-Neal discharged and sent by Greyhound bus to California since April 2008,"" Herrera says in his letter to Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto. Herrera said San Francisco has spent at least $500,000 on medical care, housing and subsistence grants for the patients since they arrived from Rawson-Neal. A spokeswoman for the Nevada attorney general's office, Jennifer Lopez, said the office received the letter and was working on the matter. ""We cannot comment further on pending litigation,"" she said. The Sacramento Bee newspaper first reported on the practice in March when it told the story of former Rawson-Neal patient James Flavy Coy Brown, 48, who was sent on a 15-hour bus ride to Sacramento despite knowing no one in the area, never having visited, and having no arrangements for his care, housing, or medical treatment. Rawson-Neal put Brown in a taxi to the Greyhound bus station with a one-way ticket, snacks, and a three-day supply of medication to treat his schizophrenia, depression and anxiety, the paper reported. Brown said he was told to call 911 when he arrived. He was ""completely confused"" with no idea why he was sent to Sacramento, a social services worker told the Bee. Brown disappeared in Sacramento, according to the newspaper, and his whereabouts remain unknown. In April, after reports that Rawson-Neal bused more than 1,500 psychiatric patients to locations across the United States, Herrera's office launched an investigation to find out whether any of the 31 Greyhound bus tickets the hospital bought for trips to San Francisco were for improperly discharged patients, a statement from the city attorney said. The investigation discovered 24 patients were sent to San Francisco, including some who made multiple trips, and that 20 sought and received emergency medical care once they arrived, Herrera's office said. That was just San Francisco, however. Herrera's office said it later found that 500 Rawson-Neal patients were sent to locations throughout California. The alleged busing of patients ""unlawfully burdened California local government resources ... in order to provide care and services which Nevada was legally obligated to provide to its own indigent residents,"" Herrera's office said in a statement. ""While our prospective litigation asserts the rights of California taxpayers, it's equally necessary to protect society's most vulnerable from continued institutional abuse,"" Herrera said. ""Homeless psychiatric patients are particularly defenseless from the kind of lawless 'patient dumping' practices Nevada officials engaged in."" Herrera said Nevada can avoid a lawsuit if it reimburses California local governments for the cost of taking care of the patients and adopts binding protocols to end the busing practice, his office said. Nevada must respond to the offer by September 9. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","San Francisco says Nevada gave mental patients a one-way ticket .

"(CNN) -- It doesn't happen very often that a marriage proposal is under police investigation. Now, Las Vegas police are investigating whether their department may have gone too far helping a rock star fulfill his romantic wedding proposal to his girlfriend by giving them a ride in a helicopter. Police confirmed to CNN that a fly-along took place last week, but didn't identify Daren Jay ""DJ"" Ashba and his now-fiancÃ©e as the passengers. Ashba, a guitarist for Guns N' Roses, posted a photo to Instagram this past weekend of himself and his girlfriend, Nathalia Henao, wearing headgear similar to what passengers would wear on a helicopter ride, telling followers: ""That was the most incredible day of our life!! Special thx to the Las Vegas Police Dept. for the most amazing helicopter private tour over Vegas!"" Las Vegas Metro Police told CNN in a statement Tuesday that an internal affairs investigation is under way ""into what we believe was an unauthorized and inappropriate fly along."" Several department employees will be interviewed and ""if the investigation determines that the fly-along was outside of policy the department members involved with face discipline,"" the statement said, adding the police department is also reviewing its fly-along policy. Neither Ashba nor a rep for Guns N' Roses immediately responded to CNN's requests for comment Tuesday, and Ashba has since been mum on social media about the incident. In the past year, Las Vegas has made the news over looming budget cuts that could affect public safety. Las Vegas Metro Police warned in April that budget cuts could result in fewer police officers patrolling the streets, which prompted Clark County officials to propose a sales tax increase to pay for new officers. Nevada State Legislature passed the bill in May and it was signed into law by Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval days later. Clark County commissioners voted August 6 to put off a decision for further study until ""no date certain"" in regards to raising the sales tax by 0.15% to pay for police officers. County officials estimate the tax increase would generate an additional $56 million a year, with about $44 million going to the Las Vegas Metro Police Department.

"(CNN) -- Somalis forced to flee war and drought are living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at home and in neighboring countries, including in Kenya and Ethiopia, an aid agency said Thursday. Somali refugees in Kenya queue to find out about a move to a displacement camp. Somalia has seen a rise in fighting between government forces and the Islamic militant group Al-Shabab, which wants to implement a stricter form of Sharia law or Islamic religious law. The clashes have left scores dead in recent months. The country in the Horn of Africa is also going through the worst drought in 10 years, international agency Oxfam said. ""Somalis flee one of the world's most brutal conflicts and a desperate drought, only to end up in unimaginable conditions in camps that are barely fit for humans,"" said Robbert Van den Berg, a spokesman for Oxfam International in the Horn of Africa. ""Hundreds of thousands of children are affected, and the world is abandoning the next generation of Somalis when they most need our help. Why does it seem like you matter less in this world if you are from Somalia?"" The international community has failed the refugees, who have little access to basic services such as water and medicine, Oxfam said. About 8,000 Somali refugees flock into the Dadaab camp in northern Kenya every month, the aid agency said. The camp, which has facilities for about 90,000, has 280,000 refugees who have no access to basic necessities, including clean water, Oxfam said. ""The Kenyan government has repeatedly promised to provide more land to ease the overcrowding, but has so far failed to do so,"" Van den Berg said. ""More pressure from the international community is needed to make it happen."" Kenyan officials decried the criticism. ""It is wrong to say we are not doing anything,"" said Francis Mwaka, a federal communications official. ""The Kenya government is aware of the problem and is working on a solution."" Several government departments that deal with refugee issues are planning to meet next week, Mwaka said. ""During this meeting, they will discuss the possibility of having another camp for refugees in the country or relocating some of the ones in Dadaab to another camp,"" he said. Mwaka confirmed Oxfam's report that the Dadaab camp was built to host 90,000 refugees. In Ethiopia, the Bokolmayo camp has about 10,000 people. At least 1,000 people arrive there every month, but the facilities are not adequate enough to handle the influx, Oxfam said. Meanwhile, in Somalia, insecurity has hindered international aid agencies from reaching the 485,000 people who have fled the capital, Mogadishu, to nearby Afgooye, Oxfam said. The displaced are getting help from Somalis, who do not have enough resources, it added. ""In all three locations -- Afgooye, Dadaab and Bokolmayo -- the services being provided to vulnerable and desperate people are far below international standards,"" Van den Berg said. About 1.4 million people have been displaced in Somalia and 500,000 more have fled to countries in the region, according to Oxfam. The transitional government has been mired in chaos since 1991 when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Government officials have struggled to establish authority amid challenges by Islamist groups that have seized control of some cities.","Somali refugees living in unsanitary conditions at home and in neighboring countries .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Have at least $68,000 to spare? If so, you may be in the running to join an exclusive group of individuals who have had their complete genome sequenced. Bidding for an eBay auction for whole genome sequencing service begins at $68,000. Starting Friday, the non-profit X Prize Foundation and private firm Knome are auctioning a whole genome sequence on eBay. The highest bidder will walk away with a full readout of their gene map, along with a complete interpretation of their genetic details. Hopes that genome sequencing will help usher in a new era of individualized health care have been rising ever since the first human genome sequence was completed in 2003. The genome is a map of all the DNA in the human body. It serves as a blueprint for physical and behavioral traits as well as susceptibility to diseases. If genetic sequencing can be made more widely accessible, it has the potential to have a profound impact on health care, said George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who worked on the Human Genome Project. The auction will run for 10 days and bidding begins at a cool $68,000. Proceeds will go to the X Prize Foundation, an educational institute that provides cash incentives to encourage innovation. The launch of the auction on Friday coincides with DNA Day, which marks the day when the double helix structure of DNA was discovered as well as the completion of the first human genome sequence. There are about 1,600 known genes that influence an individual's health and the health of their offspring, according to Church, who is also a co-founder of Knome. Besides identifying risk of diseases, sequencing can also determine an individual's potential reaction to certain drugs and pick out those that may be ineffective or even toxic. He believes personal genomes eventually will be integrated into preventive care one day. But genomics today is like the personal computers in the 1970s. Would you pay to have your genome sequenced? How much? Send us an iReport with your views . ""This is a time of rapid transition where tools are being developed and people are deciding whether they want to be early adopters or not,"" he told CNN. For now, complete human genome sequencing is still out of reach for most consumers. Cambridge, Mass.-based Knome charges $99,500. The company has attracted at least 20 customers since it was started in 2007. The winning bidder will be invited to attend a roundtable discussion where Knome's scientists will review the winner's analysis. The winner also gets a private dinner with Church. To be sure, the cost of technology has fallen rapidly from the $3 billion it cost to sequence the first human genome in 2003. But it's still cost prohibitive to incorporate complete sequences into medical research and care. Genomics plays a critical role in the move towards personalized medicine, according to MaryAnn Guerra, executive director of the life sciences prize group at X Prize. But the cost of technology is limiting wide-range research studies which could help shed more light on how to interpret genetic information. ""If we can drive this technology to be at a price point where you can do more studies and apply it more broadly, the more the data will have an impact on individuals,"" she told CNN. In the aim of speeding up the sequencing process and lowering costs, X Prize is offering $10 million to the first team to successfully sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days for $10,000 per genome or less. However, predicting disease is a tricky business, and there is still much to be understood, researchers say. Recent studies suggest that many diseases are the result of variations of several, rather than just a single, gene. Much more research needs to be done before genetic testing can be applied to personalize medicine, according to David Goldstein, who heads the Center for Human Genome Variation at Duke University. ""Right now we need to understand how the genome of patients is changed in disease,"" he said. ""We don't understand how genomes of people with epilepsy or autism or schizophrenia differ. We are still at the research phase.""","Bidding for auction of whole genome sequencing begins at $68,000 .

"(CNN) -- A group of people surrounded the car of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, one man yelling that he is hungry, as a woman climbed up onto it and sat on the vehicle's roof to speak to the president. The video of the incident, as Ahmadinejad was being driven in a convertible through the southern coastal city of Bandar-Abbas, was posted Saturday on YouTube and has racked up more than 100,000 views. Several people in the crowd seem to be supporters of the president wanting to shake his hand. On his official website, the firebrand president posted photos of other parts of his visit to Hormozgan province, with throngs of smiling people waving flags and reaching out to shake his hand as his entourage throws flower petals. One photo shows a bandage on the president's right hand. In the video, the car travels through a street amid other traffic, surrounded by guards, as it comes to a stop and a group surrounds it. A man begins yelling over and over, ""Ahamdinejad, I'm hungry!"" The guards and crowd then chant, ""Peace be upon the Prophet Mohammed, the leader's helper has come."" Guards also scream at the crowd, ""Get back!"" A woman in a hijab approaches the car. It's not clear what she's saying. She climbs onto the hood and starts to crawl over the windshield. A man grabs her leg and drags her back down. But she pulls away from him, waving her hand, sits down on the bit of roof that covers the driver's section of the car and begins to speak to Ahamdinejad. The president, who is standing up throughout the video, speaks with her and says something to the people behind him in the car. The woman then goes to the back of the car, and the vehicle continues down the road. The description with the YouTube video says it was taken by a local. It was posted online by someone who lists little identifying information. Australia is listed as the YouTube user's country. The description says Ahmadinejad ignored the man who was shouting about being hungry. CNN's Ash Gallagher and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","A YouTube video of the incident has received more than 100,000 views .

The contents of the note were not disclosed ""in the interest of the investigation,"" according to police, the news agency said. Shebarshin was alone in the apartment, it added. According to Itar-Tass, Shebarshin was born in Moscow in 1935. He served as an intelligence officer under diplomatic cover in Pakistan, India and Iran and took high-ranking positions in the KGB beginning in 1983. He was appointed deputy chairman in 1989. He led the KGB for one day only, on August 22, 1991, and retired the following month.","Former KGB chief Leonid Shebarshin is found dead in his apartment in Moscow .

"London (CNN) -- Lawyers acting for David Miranda, the partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, said they will bring his case to the High Court in London on Thursday after he was detained at Heathrow Airport. Greenwald, who works for The Guardian newspaper, has been at the forefront of high-profile reports exposing secrets in U.S. intelligence programs, based on leaks from former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Miranda, a Brazilian citizen, spent nearly nine hours in detention Sunday being questioned under a provision of Britain's terrorism laws. He was stopped as he passed through London on his way from Berlin to his home in Brazil. Opinion: Silence the media, compromise freedom . Authorities confiscated Miranda's electronic equipment, including his mobile phone, laptop, memory sticks, smart watch, DVDs and games consoles, lawyer Gwendolen Morgan wrote in the court filing Wednesday. The lawyers, hired by The Guardian to represent Miranda, are trying to recover his property and prevent the government from inspecting the items or sharing what data they may have already gleaned from them. ""What they're essentially seeking right now is a declaration from the British court that what the British authorities did is illegal, because the only thing they're allowed to detain and question people over is investigations relating to terrorism, and they had nothing to do with terrorism, they went well beyond the scope of the law,"" Greenwald told CNN's AC360 on Tuesday. ""And, secondly, to order them to return all the items they stole from David and to order that they are barred from using them in any way or sharing them with anybody else."" Miranda 'afraid' during questioning . Pressure on The Guardian? Meanwhile, new claims have emerged that the pressure placed on The Guardian over its reporting on information leaked by Snowden came from the highest levels of government. The British newspaper The Independent reported Wednesday that Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the country's top civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, ""to contact the Guardian to spell out the serious consequences that could follow if it failed to hand over classified material received from Edward Snowden."" Asked about the report by CNN, Cameron's office did not deny it. ""We won't go in to specific cases, but if highly sensitive information was being held insecurely, the government would have a responsibility to secure it,"" a Downing Street press officer said. She declined to be named in line with policy. The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, said in an editorial published Monday that the paper had physically destroyed computer hard drives under the eyes of representatives of Britain's General Communications Headquarters -- the UK equivalent of the NSA. The move followed several meetings with ""a very senior government official claiming to represent the views of the prime minister"" and ""shadowy Whitehall figures,"" Rusbridger said. They demanded The Guardian hand over the Snowden material or destroy it, he said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the head of Cameron's Liberal Democrat coalition partners, considered the request ""reasonable,"" his office said. Ã¢â¬Âª""The Deputy Prime Minister felt this was a preferable approach to taking legal action,"" according to a statement issued Wednesday evening. ""He was keen to protect the Guardian's freedom to publish, whilst taking the necessary steps to safeguard security."" Greenwald broke the story of the existence of a U.S. National Security Agency program that is thought to have collected large amounts of phone and Internet data. The Guardian also claimed, based on documents provided by Snowden, that GCHQ made use of the NSA program, known as PRISM, to illegally spy on UK citizens. A UK parliamentary committee subsequently found ""no basis"" for this claim. The UK government says GCHQ acts within a strong legal framework. 'Journalistic material' Miranda was stopped as he returned to the couple's Rio de Janeiro home after staying in Berlin with filmmaker Laura Poitras, who has been working with Greenwald on NSA-related stories. Miranda will seek a judicial review on the grounds that the legislation under which he was detained was misused, his solicitor Morgan said Tuesday. Morgan wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May and the Metropolitan Police chief asking for assurances that ""there will be no inspection, copying, disclosure, transfer, distribution or interference, in any way, with our client's data pending determination of our client's claim."" The law firm has also demanded the same from any third party, either domestic or foreign, that may have been given access to the material. The letter, seen by CNN, claims that Schedule 7 of Terrorism Act 2000 was used to detain Miranda ""in order to obtain access to journalistic material"" and that this ""is of exceptional and grave concern."" Miranda has said he does not know what data he was carrying back with him. 'Huge black eye' for British government . Britain's Home Office on Tuesday defended Miranda's questioning, saying the government and police ""have a duty to protect the public and our national security."" ""If the police believe that an individual is in possession of highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism, then they should act and the law provides them with a framework to do that,"" it said. ""Those who oppose this sort of action need to think about what they are condoning."" In a statement that didn't name Miranda but referred to his detention, the Metropolitan Police called what happened ""legally and procedurally sound"" and said it came after ""a detailed decision-making process."" The statement describes the law under which Miranda was detained as ""a key part of our national security capability which is used regularly and carefully by the Metropolitan Police Service to help keep the public safe."" But that's not how Miranda and Greenwald view the law, or at least how it was applied in this case. Sitting alongside his partner, Greenwald said the detention gave the British government ""a huge black eye in the world, (made) them look thuggish and authoritarian (for) interfering in the journalism process (and created) international incidents with the government of Brazil, which is indignant about this."" Greenwald added, ""To start detaining people who they think they are reporting on what they're doing under terrorism laws, that is as dangerous and oppressive as it gets."" White House knew Miranda would be detained . Miranda, who didn't have an interpreter on hand during his detention despite English being a second language for him, said: ""They didn't ask me anything about terrorism, not one question."" He added, ""They were just telling me: 'If you don't answer this, you are going to jail.'"" Greenwald said the entire episode was designed to intimidate him and other investigative journalists from using classified information and digging into stories critical of the British and allied governments. But, he said, it will have the reverse effect on him, making him more determined to carry on. The seizure of material from Miranda will not stop the newspaper reporting on the story, he added. ""Of course, we have multiple copies of every single thing that we're working on,"" Greenwald said. ""Nobody would ever travel with only one copy of anything.""

"(CNN) -- In all the toing and froing that we have seen in recent weeks surrounding match-fixing -- the Europol press conference that announced more than 680 suspicious football matches worldwide and the banning of 33 players and officials for life in China -- one question has been largely overlooked: just how do you actually fix a football game? After all, football is not a sport like cricket with stops and starts. It's a team game with an ebb and flow that should make it very difficult to fix. But according to the European police investigators, the fixers and dodgy sporting people were able to successfully manipulate hundreds of games -- so how did they actually arrange these corrupted matches? In essence, there are three ways and the first is the old stand-by of a dodgy referee. There have always been officials who are willing to corrupt matches. I showed in my book ""The Fix: Soccer & Organized Crime,"" that there is a long tradition in some countries of clubs providing referees with sexual bribes before matches: good-looking young women who suddenly found the men in black irresistibly attractive. The next morning, club officials would drop a gentle word about '""ocal hospitality"" and the official, who was often married, knew that they had to provide a ""well-refereed"" match for the host team. The problem with that method is that it is very difficult for referees to deliver a fixed match. They can give away needless penalties and red cards, but in the end their capacity to actually affect a match is limited. A second method is gathering four or five players in a team to throw a match. The advantage to this scam is that it actually makes identifying a fix very difficult for a spectator. You have six players running around trying as hard as they can; and you have five players pretending to run around trying as hard as they can. This way an outsider finds it extraordinarily difficult to figure out what is going on. All they see is 11 players who may or may not be making mistakes honestly. All of whom are swearing and cursing the moment anything goes wrong. Who is on the fix or even if there is a fix occurring is very difficult to tell. The most pernicious method, and most effective, is when a fixer can get a club owner to fix matches. The Europol investigators spoke about this during their conference. There are dodgy club owners in Europe who will begin a season by looking at the 40 or so games in the league, and think, ""Right we will try to win these 30 matches, and we will lose these 10."" Morally it is a terrible thing to do. Financially, however, it makes excellent sense. Knowing that they will lose those specific 10 matches, the club owners will bet against their team and make more money losing those matches, then in winning all the other games. Last year FIFPro, the umbrella group of professional footballers' unions, conducted a survey where they spoke to over 3,000 European players about their working conditions and the possibility of corruption in the sport. The results were so shocking that FIFPro entitled the results of their survey ""The Black Book of Football."" In the report, players spoke frequently of intimidation and threats to ensure that entire teams fixed matches. And that intimidation was often coming from the owners of the teams. If corruption exists at a club, it makes it very easy to fix a match. A club owner simply has to walk into a dressing room and say, ""Right, lads. Today, you will lose the match. If you do not lose you will not get your salary for the last few months."" In those cases, all the players have to do is make sure the spectators do not notice and they have a successful fix. All this is not to say that every game is fixed. The situation is far better in Europe then Asia. In that continent, there are entire leagues like - the Chinese and South Korean -- that have had to be shut down for months while mass arrests were conducted before the sports could continue. It is to say, though, that unless serious measures are taken the world's game will be very, very badly affected.","Shanghai Shenhua stripped of 2003 and fined .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of sexually abusing a woman while she slept during a 2012 airline flight, the U.S. district attorney's office said. Bawer Aksal, 49, of North Bergen was convicted of one count of sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact following a five-day trial in federal court. The jury in Newark deliberated seven hours before returning its guilty verdicts, according to a statement from the federal prosecutor's office. Aksal was arrested in August 2012 when he arrived aboard a flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Newark Liberty International Airport. According to the statement, Aksal was sitting in the middle seat in a row of three seats, while the victim was next to him in the window seat. The incident took place about an hour before landing, when the aisle passenger looked to his right and saw Aksal ""half into the victim's seat, with his body against the victim's. His right arm around the back of her and his left hand beneath a sweater that was draped over her."" The victim awoke to find Aksal's hands insider her shirt and shorts, and she struggled out of his grasp, the prosecutor's statement said. Both the aisle passenger and the victim immediately headed to the back of the plane to report what happened to the flight attendants. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over all sexual abuse cases that occur on U.S. flights, as such events are outside the jurisdiction of any state. Aksal now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. ""Mr. Aksal is very disappointed,"" Aksal's attorney, Robert J. Degroot. told CNN after the verdict. ""He felt that the trial presented evidence that did not meet the necessary burden. He has faith in the American system and he feels that he will ultimately be vindicated."" Aksal is scheduled to be sentenced in court on October 23.","The victim awoke as another passenger was assaulting her with his hands, prosecutors said .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia has opened a criminal case on an American band after one of its members stuffed the Russian flag into his pants, pulled it out his backside and whipped it between his legs, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported Monday. A musician told the audience ""Don't tell Putin"" and then tossed the flag into the audience at a concert Wednesday in Odessa, Ukraine. RIA Novosti reported that Russia's Interior Ministry has issued a statement saying that a ""specialized investigative unit"" within the ministry ""launched a criminal case regarding desecration of the national flag."" The band, Bloodhound Gang, left Russia Sunday, CNN learned. The musicians, known for making satirical and provocative songs, had a big hit in 1999 with ""The Bad Touch."" The stunt was caught on video and posted to YouTube. It went viral in the Ukraine and Russia, and was flooded with angry Russian-language comments. Journalists later quoted the band as saying that all items that the band throws into the crowd must first pass through the bassist's pants. The group was scheduled to appear at the Kubana rock festival this week, near the southern Russian Black Sea resort of Anapa, the news agency said, but the band was ""deported."" The band told CNN that it left Russia and was not deported. They said they canceled their concert at the festival. A member of the band's crew, who asked to not be named for security reasons, told CNN the band was attacked Saturday by Russian nationalists inside Anapa airport in Krasnodar Krai. The band members were ""beaten up"" by a crowd of men who punched and kicked them, the crew member said, adding that some of the attackers had whips. He said there were no serious injuries, and a Russian police guard was accompanying them as they waited to leave. RIA Novosti reported Monday that Russia's Criminal Code states that ""foreign nationals ... who commit a crime beyond the boundaries of the Russian Federation are subject to criminal liability in line with this code if their crime is aimed against the interests of the Russian Federation or a Russian national."" Desecration of the Russian flag can result in a one-year prison sentence, according to Russian criminal code, the news agency said. Russian prosecutors in the Krasnodar Region have said they had begun an investigation into local music festivals, including Kubana. Russian and Ukrainian lawmakers have also proposed permanently banning Bloodhound Gang members from entering the countries. Earlier U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul called the incident ""disgusting"" in a Twitter message but said the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protects flag desecration.

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts husband and wife were each sentenced to prison Monday after being found guilty last month of raping their two adopted children. Joseph Mayotte, 50, sexually abused his daughter over a five-year span, starting when she was 8, according to a news release from prosecutor Joseph D. Early Jr. Mayotte was convicted in August on 11 charges -- including rape of a child aggravated by age difference -- and was sentenced Monday to 16 to 20 years in prison. His wife, Linda Mayotte, was convicted on 19 charges -- including three counts of rape of a child -- and sentenced from 18 to 22 years behind bars. The 49-year-old became pregnant with her adopted son's child when he was only 15, according to Paul Jarvey of the Worcester County District Attorney's Office. It was a pregnancy she carried to term, Jarvey said. ""Let them burn in hell,"" is what the son, now 21, said of his former parents in an impact statement read in court today, according to Jarvey. The Mayottes, who lived in the central Massachusetts town of Northbridge, were arrested in 2009. The two adopted children -- along with the child to whom Linda Mayotte gave birth -- were adopted by other families. ""Their trust was broken by these two predators,"" Early's statement said.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- Sears Tower is history. As of Thursday, the iconic Chicago, Illinois, skyscraper is now named Willis Tower. It still looks the same, but Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, will have a new name: Willis Tower. At least that's what the owners of the 110-story skyscraper now call it after its new main tenant, the London, England-based insurance broker Willis Group Holdings. However, there are plenty of people who refuse to call it that. More than 90,000 people have joined the group ""People Against the Sears Tower Name Change,"" on the social networking Web site Facebook. ""This name change is absurd,"" one member wrote. ""Would Paris change the name of the Eiffel Tower? Or London change Buckingham Palace? Or New York, the Statue of Liberty?

The group has gathered more than 34,000 signatures on an online petition against the name change. The name change seemed to be a fait accompli, though.

"(CNN) -- Nobody knows what caused Rosy Esparza to fall out of her seat on a Texas roller coaster ride and plunge to her death. Six Flags Over Texas has closed the Texas Giant ride amid its investigation into Esparza's death on Friday at its park in Arlington, Texas. Many questions remain unanswered: Was her death a freak accident, or a sign of a larger problem? How risky are roller coasters? And who's in charge of keeping theme parks safe? On Monday a medical examiner ruled that Esparza was killed by multiple traumatic injuries from her fall. Dramatic accounts of Friday's incident have emerged, with some witnesses describing family members shouting at the scene and others claiming that the woman had raised concerns with the ride operator about whether the lap bar holding her in her seat was secure. On Sunday, son-in-law Ronald Segovia told CNN that he did not hear his mother-in-law mention that her lap bar did not lock properly, contrary to witness accounts reported by CNN affiliates. Opinion: Death by 'amusement' Segovia and his wife were sitting in front of Esparza, who was seated by herself on the Texas Giant ride. Details such as conversations between passengers and ride operators are among the things investigators will consider, experts say. ""You're going to look at the operations of it, and the human factor, the human part of the equation,"" said Bill Avery, an amusement ride and device safety consultant. ""Was there an error or omission made by an operator or someone in operations?"" Maintenance and design would also be examined, he said, in addition to details such as the rider's posture and size. ""There's no one answer sometimes,"" said Robert Swint, an accident reconstructionist. In Facebook posts, her sons described the situation as a nightmare. There is no federal regulation of theme parks, and critics say Esparza's death shows that the government needs to keep better tabs on amusement park deaths and injuries and ensure that someone is held responsible when they happen. The amusement park industry stresses that its rides are ""one of the safest forms of recreation available."" The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, a trade group representing amusement parks, says visitors of fixed-site amusement parks have a 1 in 24 million chance of being seriously injured. That would mean it's more likely you'll be struck by lightning, die from a bee sting or drown at the beach. According to a National Safety Council analysis of amusement park injuries, there were just over 1,200 ride-related injuries in 2011, and about 4% of those caused serious physical harm. Roller coaster accidents accounted for about 28% of the injuries, the council said. Some industry observers say that amusement parks are loosely regulated, and rules vary from state to state. They note that Six Flags will be in charge of conducting its own investigation into Esparza's death, not an outside independent agency. The company said it will be relying on internal and external experts in its investigation and cannot speculate on what happened. ""While the cause of this tragic accident is still unknown, one thing is clear: Roller coasters that hurtle riders at extreme speeds along precipitous drops should not be exempt from federal safety oversight,"" Sen. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, said in statement Monday. ""A baby stroller is subject to tougher federal regulation than a roller coaster carrying a child in excess of 100 miles per hour. This is a mistake."" Markey has called for greater regulation of amusement parks for more than a decade, arguing that it would help prevent injuries. But his measures asking for the Consumer Product Safety Commission to step in have never passed. Earlier this year, researchers from Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, warned that thousands of children are injured yearly on amusement park rides and called for greater regulation. The amusement park industry says that state regulation is the best way to handle safety. They argue that there are already many layers that keep riders safe, including mechanical and design standards, state and local governments, insurance companies and private safety firms. As the investigation continues, legal analysts say the threat of a lawsuit against Six Flags is looming. ""As of now, Six Flags is conducting this internal investigation themselves, and also the German manufacturer of the roller coaster has sent people in to investigate ... and see if there was any kind of defect in the roller coaster when this accident happened,"" attorney and legal analyst Faith Jenkins told CNN. ""Obviously they're concerned about accountability and liability in terms of someone bringing a civil lawsuit for negligence and perhaps product liability."" So, should riders be worried? Avery, who founded a ride safety consulting firm and once headed up safety at several parks, said there are simple steps that visitors can follow. When it comes to securing safety restraints, Avery said, ""as a general rule, it needs to fit snugly near your waistline, above the top of your thighs, so it can hold the passenger in regardless of what kind of forces are applied, and where they're applied, on the human body."" Don't be afraid to ask operators questions, he said. And if you don't like their answers, he said, ""you have the right to say, 'I choose now not to ride.'"" Six Flags Chairman and CEO Jim Reid-Anderson hosted a quarterly earnings call Monday from the Texas theme park, expressing sympathy to Esparza's family. ""We've been here through the weekend to support our team as we work through this tragic event,"" he said. Six Flags said it has not experienced a dip in attendance at any of its parks since Friday's incident, but that could change. ""There is a lag in reaction time after an accident, and there could be a short- to medium-term attendance impact at the affected park,"" Reid-Anderson said during Monday's call. Reid-Anderson told investors that the ride would remain closed until the investigation is complete. ""You can rest assured that it will remain closed until we are certain it is safe to ride,"" he said. CNN's Luisa Navarro, Joe Sutton, Ed Lavandera and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Six Flags is investigating after a Texas woman plunged to her death from a ride .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers have saved 110 people from a ship that capsized in the waters between Australia and Indonesia and are searching for the many missing, an Australian official said Friday. The boat, that was carrying about 200 people, flipped over Thursday, authorities said, triggering the massive rescue effort. A 13-year-old boy was one of the many rescued, Australia Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. The others that were rescued were all adults, Clare said. Authorities believe all the passengers in the ship were male, according to Clare. The survivors were being transported to Christmas Island. ""Over the course of 36 hours from the time the boat capsized, my advice is that people can survive out there if they've got either life jackets or they are able to hold onto debris, as a lot of people did through the course of yesterday,"" Clare said. ""So the window is still there where we hold out the prospect of finding more people alive."" On Thursday, authorities said the vessel was 110 nautical miles northwest of Christmas Island. Indonesia has sent two warships to assist Australian rescue efforts. And Clare said four more ships would be in the area Friday to help the ships and aircraft that are already searching. Christmas Island has been the scene of another recent boat capsizing. At least 28 people died in December 2010 when a boat carrying asylum seekers crashed into cliffs near the coast of the island. Most of the people on the boat were from Iran and Iraq, a rescue worker said at the time.","The ship overturns midway between Australia and Indonesia .

"Berlin (CNN) -- A German man sent to prison over an incestuous relationship with his sister has lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life at the European Court of Human Rights. Patrick Stuebing had a consensual sexual relationship with his sister after they first met when he was in his 20s and she was a teenager. They had four children, two of whom are disabled, the court said. Stuebing lodged his case with the European Court of Human Rights after being sent to prison in November 2005 by a Leipzig court and losing subsequent appeals against his conviction for incest. But the court ruled Thursday that the German authorities had the right to ban incest. In convicting Stuebing, the German Federal Constitutional Court had ""considered that sexual relationships between siblings could seriously damage family structures and, as a consequence, society as a whole,"" the court ruled. Stuebing, who was born in 1976 and lives in Leipzig, was adopted and grew up with no contact with his birth family after the age of seven, according to a court statement. When he reestablished contact with his birth family in 2000, he met his sister Susan, eight years younger than him and then aged 16. Their relationship intensified after the death of their mother, the court said, and from January 2001 they ""had consensual sexual intercourse and lived together for several years."" Their four children were born between 2001 and 2005. Speaking to CNN's Frederick Pleitgen in 2007, Stuebing explained that he and his sister had fallen in love, and simply wanted to have their relationship legalized. ""We just want to lead a normal life,"" he said. ""People harass us all the time and call us the incest couple. They have no idea who we really are or how it all happened."" Stuebing's sister was not prosecuted by German authorities because she was considered ""only partially liable for her actions,"" Thursday's court ruling said. The sister ""suffered from a personality disorder and was considerably dependent on him,"" the court said. An appeal can be lodged against the court's judgment, which is not final, within the next three months. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","Patrick Stuebing was sent to prison for his incestuous relationship with his sister .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will name Iran, as well as its Central Bank, as a ""primary money laundering concern"" Monday, but will not place sanctions directly on the bank, a senior Treasury Department official said. The United States will also sanction a number of Iranian companies allegedly supporting Iran's nuclear program, the official said. The Treasury Department announced that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will hold an afternoon news conference ""to outline new steps the United States is taking to increase pressure on Iran."" U.S. officials have been considering action against the Central Bank of Iran but became concerned that a full sanction could have a negative effect on the world economy because of the potential impact on oil prices. A number of congressional members have been calling for sanctions against the bank amid questions about how much the current spate of sanctions are actually working. U.S. sanctions already prohibit American companies from doing business with Iran. The United Kingdom also announced Monday it will impose fresh sanctions against Iran, cutting all financial ties with the country over concerns about its nuclear program. U.S. diplomatic sources told CNN Saturday that the goal of the new measures is to bar foreign companies from doing business with Iran's petrochemical industry by threatening to ban them from U.S. markets. The sources did not want to be named because they are not authorized to speak on record before officials roll out the sanctions. Plans for the additional sanctions come on the heels of a report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency detailing evidence that the Iranian regime is developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told CNN's Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that Iran is probably less than a year away from reaching the point at which it will be too late to stop its nuclear program. ""It's true that it wouldn't take three years, probably three quarters, before no one can do anything practically about it because the Iranians are gradually, deliberately entering into what I call a zone of immunity, by widening the redundancy of their plan, making it spread over many more sites,"" Barak said on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors issued a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program."" But the U.N. agency's resolution did not threaten action to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" The Obama administration is facing increased pressure from Congress to turn up the heat on Iran, including sanctioning the Central Bank. Last week, Republican Sen. Mark Kirk introduced an amendment that would impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that do business with the Central Bank. U.S. officials have said the administration has been reluctant to cut off the bank out of concern it could drive up oil prices and hurt the U.S. economy. But the diplomatic sources said the United States has discussed possible sanctions on the bank that would limit some financial transactions, but not cut it off completely.

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to provide the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but the latest effort to fight homophobia in football is in danger of fading into monochrome. Stonewall, a UK-based gay, lesbian and bisexual charity, has teamed up with Irish bookmaker Paddy Power to promote a campaign which is asking football players across the country to wear rainbow colored laces. The organization has sent laces to all 92 professional clubs in England and the 42 in Scotland with the hope they will be worn this weekend. While some stars such as Queens Park Rangers and former England midfielder Joey Barton have been outspoken in their support, others are far from convinced. Several top clubs have objected to the way the campaign has been handled with reservations over the role of Paddy Power -- a betting firm which is notorious for its risque marketing techniques. Chelsea was just one club which objected to the bookmaker's involvement. A club spokesman said: ""It's important to say everyone at Chelsea is fully committed to tackling all forms of discrimination. We have fully endorsed the principles behind the campaign. We have a number is issues with it ... the tone of it, the lack of communication and the commercial part."" The Premier League was also unhappy with the way the campaign had been sprung on its clubs, claiming it would have done its utmost to aid Stonewall if it had been notified earlier. ""The underlying message behind this campaign is a good one -- indeed we and our clubs have worked hard with government and other stakeholders to ensure the whole equalities agenda is something we are fully aware of and engaged in,"" a Premier League spokesman said. ""However, we were not consulted about this particular campaign. Had we been involved earlier in the process we could have worked with Stonewall to consider things like boot deals, the use of particular betting partners, and other issues. ""It is up to individual clubs and players to decide whether they support this campaign. We have let Stonewall know that we would be happy to talk to them in the future to discuss ways in which we could work together."" While several top clubs such as Manchester United and Tottenham have also refused to take part in wearing the rainbow laces, Stonewall is adamant the campaign has been hugely successful in drawing attention to homophobia in football. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has given his players the opportunity to make up their own mind, while Everton has said its players will wear the laces for the game against West Ham. ""It has been a fantastic success,"" said James Lawrence of Stonewall told CNN. ""If you look at the response from clubs and individuals, we've had huge support. ""The whole crux of the campaign was to call on people who wanted to wear the laces was to do so. It's not for clubs to force individuals to do so. ""We want to give as many people who want to show their support the opportunity to do so."" While Stonewall has been hugely encouraged by the attention garnered by the campaign, it also acknowledges that it has received criticism for teaming up with a gambling firm. Paddy Power has courted controversy in the past with its advertising, with one commercial being pulled after it invited viewers to pick out transvestites and asked Cheltenham racing fans to ""spot the stallions from the mares."" ""Whenever you launch any kind of campaign there is always criticism,"" argued Lawrence when pressed on the organization's decision to team up with the betting firm. ""Working with Paddy Power opens up a whole new market and reaches people which Stonewall doesn't traditionally deal with. ""The support the campaign has gathered has blown us away."" Paddy Power also insisted the campaign has been a success, due to the debate it has stimulated. ""Six days ago this issue was not on the news agenda. Now everyone is talking about it, which has to be a good thing,"" a spokesperson told CNN. ""The hashtag RBGF has been trending worldwide, the majority of feedback is hugely positive and we have had more requests for laces from the general public than we're currently able to cater for -- so we've ordered 10,000 more."" One of the groups which has been particularly critical of the campaign is FootballvHomophobia, which has taken umbrage with some of the language used to promote the laces project. It is particularly concerned by the innuendo used and believes the campaign's tag line ""Right behind Gay Players"" is unhelpful in the battle against homophobia. A statement read: ""Our discomfort is with the reliance on sexual innuendo and stereotypes about gay men and anal sex, as exemplified by the tag line 'Right behind Gay Players'. ""As an initiative with a strong focus on education, we feel it is incongruous to run a campaign aiming to change football culture whilst using language which reinforces the very stereotypes and caricatures that, in the long term, ensure that homophobia persists. "" 'Rainbow Laces' may have an important short term advantage of drawing attention to the issue of homophobia in football, but this needs to be followed in the long term with an informed and sensitive discussion around the contested nature of what constitutes discriminatory, offensive language as opposed to acceptable banter."" However, Paddy Power said it had taken advice from Stonewall ""to ensure the tone of this campaign is right."" ""We've had a lot of positive support this week from the public in general and other bodies like the Gay Football Supporters' Network,"" its spokesperson said. ""We sent the laces out to clubs three days before the campaign went live to give them the opportunity to discuss this internally. The laces were accompanied by a full explanatory letter and invitation to get in contact with us if they had any questions. ""It's pretty sad that some of the powers-that-be deem this not enough notice when it's a simple case of players choosing whether or not they'd like to wear a pair of rainbow laces."" Paddy Power also brushed off criticism that its involvement had hindered the campaign. ""The rainbow laces we've provided are simply rainbow-colored and not branded, so they do not breach any FA rules or clash with any commercial deals,"" it said. ""It's a real shame that some in the game are using our involvement as a pretty weak excuse to prevent players from making a choice on whether they want to lace up to show their support."" However, the opposition has not put off other sports stars supporting the campaign, with English rugby players also getting in on the act. James Haskell, an England international who plays for club side London Wasps, plans to wear the laces this weekend while former football player turned television presenter, Gary Lineker, has also spoken of how he will boast the rainbow colors.","Football players in UK urged to wear rainbow laces to campaign against homophobia .

"(CNN) -- Step aside Iowa and fried butter -- there is a new national fried treasure to feast upon. The country's first deep-fried cheeseburger is making its debut among at least 30 other varieties of hamburgers served by 15 different vendors at the National Hamburger Festival in Akron, Ohio, this weekend. ""We cook the cheeseburger, put it on a bun and dip it in batter before dropping it in a deep fryer,"" said Drew Cerza, the festival's founder. Cerza came up with the idea for a deep-fried burger alongside a chef at a local burger restaurant. He wanted to combine two of his favorite things -- hamburgers and chicken wings.  Cerza said the special batter is a cross between funnel-cake batter and pancake batter, making the deep-fried cheeseburger both sweet and savory. ""We'll serve it with a side of Lipitor,"" Cerza said with a laugh. The Hamburger Festival started six years ago in Akron, one of at least four places that claim to be the birthplace of the burger. Local lore has it that in 1885, Akron natives Frank and Charles Menches created the sandwich after they ran out of pork and were forced to use ground beef while serving concessions at the Buffalo Fair. ""I just said, 'Let's just do it (in Akron) and stake the claim,'"" Cerza said. Recognizing the controversy surrounding the burger's birthplace, Cerza staged ""Hamburger Hearings,"" during the festival's first year and allowed each of the four cities, Seymour, Wisconsin; Athens, Texas; and New Haven, Connecticut, to send representatives to make their case to a ""burger commission."" After deliberations, the jury was hung and an online poll had to be taken, naming Seymour, Wisconsin, the home of the hamburger by popular vote. ""We had a lot of fun with it,"" Cerza said, ""Everyone is very proud of their influence on the hamburger."" Still, he says, with hamburger chains White Castle and Wendy's beginning in the state, it's tough to deny that ""Ohio is a hamburger state."" The festival is expected to attract 20,000 people over the weekend.  Most visitors are regional, but Cerza said the universal appeal of the hamburger has prompted road trips from all over the country. ""This festival is America,"" Cerza said. ""It includes all demographics of everybody, just like the hamburger."" This year's two-day festival includes live performances from a Jimmy Buffett cover band, a beauty pageant and, likely the messiest event of the weekend, bobbing for burgers in a pool full of ketchup. Cerza came up with the ""bobbing for burgers,"" event after a trip to Wal-Mart. ""I saw kiddie pools on sale, and ketchup one row over,"" Cerza said. ""The idea just sort of came to me."" For the third year in a row, Christy Sinko took home the title, retrieving 26 foam hamburgers from the ketchup filled kiddie pool. Sinko, a second grade teacher from Medina, Ohio, said her prize is a year's worth of ""bragging rights,"" but Cerza said his contest proves that, ""people will do anything for a free T-shirt."" While Sinko said there isn't a whole lot she does to prepare for the bobbing for burgers event, she says, ""the key to winning is not being afraid to get dirty."" Also a winner at this year's festival was Akron firefighter Matt Askea, who won the hamburger eating contest, finishing off one Menches quarter pounder (with a bun) and 10 patties in five minutes.","The festival began six years ago in Akron .

"(CNN) -- England soccer captain John Terry endured a difficult end to last year, and his 2012 has begun in a bizarre manner involving an anti-smoking campaign in India. The Chelsea defender's representatives are investigating how Terry's image might have been used without their permission as part of a warning on cigarette packets. A blurred picture closely resembling the 31-year-old appears above a ""smoking kills"" slogan. ""It's been brought to our attention that an image of our client has been used on some cigarette packaging without our consent or knowledge,"" Elite Management said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We've now instructed our legal team to investigate this matter."" The public relations officer of India's health ministry told CNN that the picture that resembles Terry is not one of those pictures that it sanctioned. However, one of the pictures seen on cigarette packets this week --which was cleared by the ministry and included in a May 2011 press release -- does show a strong resemblance to Terry. An official at India's Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity earlier confirmed that the image had been cleared by the health ministry.

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Police in Indian administered Kashmir Friday arrested a teacher of a local college on charges of writing an exam ""with anti-India content."" ""We have arrested Noor Mohammad Bhat under (the ) Unlawful Activities Act,"" Srinagar district police chief, Ashiq Bukhari said Friday evening. He said the teacher who teaches English in a college here had written an exam for graduate level examinees with questions attempting ""to glorify the Kashmiri stone pelters and to project separatist views."" Bhat had included a question, ""Are the stone pelters real heroes? Discuss."" The content of the exam dealt with pro-independence unrest which has lasted more than five months. During the conflict young boys have resorted to pelting Indian security forces with stones ever since the unrest erupted on June 11 after a 17-year old boy was killed in a police action here in Srinigar, the region's capital. The unrest which has so far claimed 110 lives. It has also left hundreds wounded, some of them left disabled. The unrest has also seen the arrest of hundreds of youth charged with the offence of stone pelting while scores have gone underground to escape arrest. Another question on the exam required translation of an Urdu passage into English. ""Kashmir is burning yet again. The blood of the youth is being shed like water. Even young boys are not being spared and are beaten to death by police and security forces. Bullets are being pumped into the chests of young girls and women. Though people across Kashmir are shedding tears of blood, yet the rulers are in deep slumber. Even prayers have turned ineffective,"" it read. A student said he was taken aback on seeing the exam and hesitated for some time to answer the questions. ""I was perplexed, but later I thought it may be a plan of the government to probe the mind of the young students on the unrest,"" said Mushtaq Ahmad. ""This is a new dimension added to the unrest after months of shutdowns and curfews,"" said Abdul Quyoom, a local resident. The mountainous Kashmir region is divided among Pakistan, China and India. In the past, India has poured thousands of security forces into its part of Kashmir to fight what India called a Pakistan-inspired insurgency. However, since the defeat of the insurgency, Indian forces have found themselves fighting mostly Muslim Kashmiris who say they have suffered oppression and want independence from Hindu-dominated India.","Authorities arrest teacher for content of exam .

"Athens (CNN) -- The leader of Greece's extreme right wing Golden Dawn party and four party lawmakers were charged Sunday with forming and participating in a criminal gang. Nikos Michaloliakos and the other four -- all members of parliament -- left the Athens prosecutor's office in handcuffs, escorted by counterterrorism officers in bullet proof vests and balaclavas. It is the first time since the restoration of democracy in 1974, following a seven-year junta, that a party leader and members of parliament have been arrested. Michaloliakos' arrests and those of the lawmakers -- Elias Kassidiaris, Elias Panagiotaros, Ioannis Lagos and Nikos Mihos -- are part of a crackdown following a controversial stabbing death. At least 10 more people have been arrested, including Golden Dawn party members, police said. More than 30 warrants were issued as police operations were launched across Greece Saturday. One more Golden Dawn lawmaker is still being sought, police said. Pavlos Fyssas, a popular anti-fascist figure and well-known hip-hop artist with the stage name Killah P, was the victim of the knife attack that was allegedly committed by a Golden Dawn supporter. Clashes broke out in a working-class Athens suburb this month, as Fyssas' death inflamed already growing concerns about the rising influence of Golden Dawn. The ultranationalist, anti-immigration party has been linked by critics to street violence and neo-Nazism. The violence came despite police raids of Golden Dawn offices and the arrest of a 45-year-old party supporter who police say admitted killing Pavlos Fyssas. Kassidiaris denied his party's involvement in Fyssas' death, calling it a ""heinous crime."" The singer's death has nevertheless led to renewed calls to ban Golden Dawn . The Greek constitution does not allow for political parties to be banned, however, and the arrested lawmakers will retain their parliamentary seats unless they are convicted of a crime. Golden Dawn holds 18 of Parliament's 300 seats. Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos, whose socialist Pasok party is part of the governing coalition, said Golden Dawn ""must be dealt with as a criminal organization."" In 2012, the party rode a wave of dissatisfaction among some Greeks over internationally imposed austerity measures amid the country's deep financial crisis, winning 7% of the vote and gaining seats in parliament for the first time. Recent polls had seen support rise as high as 12%. However, since Fyssas' killing last week, opinion polls suggest that Golden Dawn's popularity has dropped. A poll carried out from September 19 to 21 by Rass, for the Eleftheros Typos newspaper, indicated that support for Golden Dawn had fallen to 5.8%, down from 8.3% on September 15. Back in 2009, before the financial crisis and ensuing austerity measures hit Greeks hard, the party polled only 0.3%.","Party leader Nikos Michaloliakos and others face charges of forming a criminal gang .

"(AOL Autos) -- It had never been done before, but as Monte Perlin gunned the engine of his Harley motorbike and prepared to land it in an open boxcar of a moving train, he was strangely calm. Stuntman Monte Perlin putting his motorcycle through its paces. Rather than fret for his own life, he was thinking about the responsibility he had for the life of the woman sitting on the saddle behind him. He laughs to tell the story now, but his moving-train stunt for Disney's 2008 Adam Sandler vehicle ""Bedtime Stories"" was perhaps the most dangerous Perlin's attempted in his 25 years in Hollywood. His career has involved many films, including ""Spider-Man,"" ""Star Trek, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and portraying Arnold Schwarzenegger's stunt double in ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."" That's right: Monte Perlin is a stunt man. In fact, he said that after completing that train stunt, which involved probably more math than we'd care to compute (consider a man jumping 70 feet on a motorbike at 60 mph from a ramp into an open car of a train traveling at 45 mph, all with a woman on the seat next to him...sounds a bit like a SAT question, doesn't it?) the footage showed he missed. In actuality, he came too close -- or about 6 inches -- to one of the boxcar's doors. So, he had to do it again. ""I have to time it with a girl on my back,"" Perlin said. ""Too short, I'm dead. Too late, I'm dead. Too high, fast or powerful, I take my head off. It had to be perfect. While he didn't sleep for two nights before the stunt, he says a strange type of calm precedes any of his attempts at a difficult trick. Then, just before launch, he says, as he revs the engine of whichever ""boss hog"" he's riding that day, his adrenaline kicks into gear. ""I get that feeling, that I could wrestle 10 gorillas, I could jump 10 trains, and boom! I go for it."" Perlin completed the stunt, this time ""hitting"" it almost exactly through the middle of the box-car's open gate and the movie's production team wrapped the scene. ""I did it again and just hit it perfect,"" he said. ""I hit the impossible stunt."" It didn't start this way . Perlin grew up in Lake Arrowhead, not far from Hollywood, where from the age of 10 he ripped around the largely rural area on motocross bikes before he graduated onto some seriously heavy machinery -- including his own super-modified Harley Davidson that packs a 350 Chevy car engine. That gave him a perfect start in his chosen career of motorcycle stunt riding. AOL Autos: Fastest coupes under $30k . He got into Hollywood by ditching the small-town naysayers who didn't believe in him, he says, and traveling to Los Angeles. After a couple misfires, he looked into a stunt school he found in a Hollywood trade publication and he found his calling. AOL Autos: Top 10 best car commercials . Perhaps more importantly, Perlin met his wife, also a stuntwoman. ""(She) changed my life and stopped my drinking,"" he said. ""I told her, 'If we're gonna get married, I gotta have a career.'"" In addition to traveling to Africa, Israel, Russia, and all over the world, the couple raised four kids on a 10-acre ranch about 25 miles north of Hollywood in Lancaster. Perlin hasn't touched a drop of alcohol in nearly 25 years. He says he often takes his grandkids for ""wheelies"" around his neighborhood. As it turns out, stuntin' runs in the family: His 17-year-old daughter is a champion horse show-jumper and is gunning for an Olympic place, but is already a professional stuntwoman. AOL Autos: Ford's 'Wonder Woman' engineers important new car . Stunt work isn't something to be taken lightly, though. Perlin has the scars to prove it. He says he's broken ""almost everything."" Everything, according to Perlin, includes both of his arms, legs, knees, feet, ankles, several of his ribs, his back and his pelvis. But, his background in gymnastics has left him some flexibility. AOL Autos: Most common car- related injuries . Perhaps philosophically, Perlin points out that the most important thing for any stuntman, alongside having a particular niche or forte like motorbike riding, is learning from the mistakes you'll inevitably make. Sometimes this means knowing when to say no and, simply, when to go for it. He recalls the time he was cajoled by a director into doing a motorcycle stunt he considered too dangerous. ""The worst thing (I ever did) was on a Brian Bosworth series 13 years ago in Florida. I had to jump off a pier, over the water and into a barge. Well, usually they give you a lighter bike mocked up to look like a Harley, but they wouldn't do that (for) this so I had to get a stock Kawasaki 1200 Vulcan. I could jump a 35-foot distance (on that bike) but from pier to barge was now more than 35 feet. I checked the tide and the jump was 40 feet long. ""Now (I know) I don't want to do it. But the production manager came running out and said, 'If Monte Perlin doesn't do this jump, you all are going home right now.' He was really throwing it at me. I did the jump and landed perfectly, but the bike snapped in half and crushed my ankle. In the hospital, the 'doc said they were gonna have to cut my foot off."" Perlin's foot was saved by steel plates and screws, but not before he learned an important lesson: ""It's not the fact of making mistakes in life, it's what you learn from them."" He describes a later stunt where he had to jump a motorbike down 2.5 stories from a roof, jumping through a window, all while wearing a rubber monster suit. He says the lights were bad, and he ""couldn't see a thing."" ""I called down to floor, said I couldn't see the ground,"" he said. ""They said 'You wimp, my mother could do that.' But, five minutes later the lights were right, and I landed it. The end result was I had learned from my mistakes. There are ways to get around anything."" One tough assignment . Most famously, perhaps, Perlin portrayed Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Terminator 3,"" a role that still has a special place in his memory (although he says he's back working with his old Terminator team on a ""major blockbuster"" to be filmed this summer). AOL Autos: Top 10 movie car chases . ""For Terminator 3, I got a call to double Arnold, to go in and meet him. We hung out for six months, riding together and training. Now (as a double for the) Terminator, I can't be riding and looking, or turning my head. I had to use peripheral vision for all my stunts."" Not that he needed a reminder, but Monte's Terminator experiences proved once again that stunt work is serious business. ""In one of the sequences, Arnold's riding on a motorcycle and the lady's on a crane. She swings at him and he grabs the crane. But that transfer was not as sweet as it looked. Riding at 45 mph, following the crane, a harness was supposed to bring me closer to the crane and lock me safe to it. But, the crane made a swerve and it pulled me off the motorbike, and he's still going. Picture a fish on the end of a hook, being swung around. If that timing was off I would (have been) wrapped around a pole and torn in half."" On the same shoot, Monte had to do battle with an object much larger than him and perhaps less forgiving than a moving crane. ""For an explosion shot in the movie, I was heading right toward a tanker,"" he said. ""I swerved around (it) and was head on with a remotely controlled ambulance, (which was) on fire. If I had fallen and it would of hit me, I would have been bone dead. ""But, it landed beside me -- a full-weight paramedic truck flipping through the air. I talked to the guy on the remote control after that. He said it would have landed on top of me, but on the last second it turned to the right and missed me. It woulda squished me."" Unless you're Monte Perlin, do not try this at home. You might get squished.","Stuntman Monte Perlin has broken ""almost everything"" in his 25-year career .

"(CNN) -- Work is under way to establish political stability in Egypt following the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy, the country's interim foreign minister told the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday. Nabil Fahmy sought to assure the world that the temporary government is following a road map that will see nationwide elections by next spring. ""It has so far succeeded in establishing the principles of justice, freedom and democracy as a basis for governance,"" said Fahmy, who is part of the temporary government established by Egypt's military following Morsy's ouster. ""This will be followed by parliamentary elections, then presidential elections, so that the transitional phase ends by next spring."" Fahmy's statement to the world body comes amid concerns that the military-backed government has been moving to outlaw the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that rose to power following the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Western nations, including the United States and Britain, have urged Egypt's military-backed government to have an inclusive political process. All Egyptians may participate in the political process, Fahmy said, ""as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them,"" and follow the rule of law. The government is also determined to empower women and support its youth, Fahmy said. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters have been killed and thousands more have been injured in clashes with the military and its supporters following the ouster of Morsy. Each side blames the other for stoking the violence. Morsy, who was backed the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, was the country's first democratically elected president. But critics say he became increasingly authoritarian and forced through a conservative Islamist agenda during his year in power that alienated moderates. He is also blamed for failing to revive Egypt's economy, which crashed when the 2011 uprising drove tourists away. Just a year into his presidency, there were mass demonstrations calling for his removal. After the Morsy ouster, Egypt's military began to crack down on his party, the Muslim Brotherhood. The crackdown led to ferocious clashes in the streets of Cairo and other Egyptian cities, many of which have led to condemnation from the international community. Morsy, who was deposed by the military amid widespread protest over his rule, has been held in detention since early July. Less than a block away from where Fahmy spoke at the United Nations, dueling protests took place between Egyptians who support the government and those who back Morsy. ""Free, free Egypt! Long live Egypt!"" shouted the pro-Morsy crowd, some of whom waved pictures of the ousted president. One placard read, ""Only in Egypt your vote never counts"" and another read, ""No to massacre and martial law in Egypt."" Nearby were those who support the current government. As they chanted ""We love Egypt,"" one person raised a sign saying ""Egyptians support our government in their war against terrorism.""","Egypt's foreign minister says nationwide elections will be held by next spring .

"(CNN) -- Watching the Olympics, which kick off in earnest Friday with the opening ceremony in London, is more fun when you know the stories behind the Games. No doubt, sports broadcasters will hammer on plenty of rags-to-riches, against-the-odds backstories about the Olympic athletes. (You can also find plenty of them on CNN's London 2012 page). And that's all good. But knowing the technological underpinnings of the Games is perhaps just as intriguing. Here's a quick look at 10 of the most interesting tech stories to watch at the London Olympics: . Robotic cameras: Getty Images will install robotic cameras at a few locations at the Olympic Games. They can be controlled remotely and swivel 360 degrees. ""The biggest help will come from cameras stashed in floodlights, rafters and scaffolding in and around Olympic venues to provide imagery from places inaccessible to human photographers due to space or security reasons,"" NBC News wrote. In a YouTube video about new photo tech, Getty says it will shoot some of the Olympics in 3-D. Souped-up sound: If you like to believe in the Tooth Fairy, don't read the next sentence: Much of the sound you hear on TV during the Olympics isn't real -- well, at least in the sense that some of it wasn't recorded during the event being shown. Some of the audio is recorded in advance, in optimized conditions, and then superimposed on the TV broadcast, writes The Atlantic. The site gives the example of archery, which an Olympics audio engineer says is based on the sound he heard watching ""Robin Hood."" He captured it by putting a special mic on the ground between the archer and target, which, as Alexis Madrigal points out, creates a sound no person could actually experience at the event. Two-part track: Look, Ma, no spikes! A new surface on the Olympic track in London means runners won't have to wear spiked shoes. ""Unlike other track designs that combine traction and shock-absorption in an upper layer of rubber granules, the Mondo track separates these functions, with a cushion backing for shock absorption and a solid upper layer that optimizes slip resistance, traction and durability,"" the BBC writes. ""This design cuts the need for the spikes on athletes' running shoes to penetrate the running surface."" Prosthetics: Called ""Blade Runner"" and ""the fastest man with no legs,"" South African Oscar Pistorius will be the first person to compete in the able-bodied Olympics using prosthetic legs. After some controversy about whether prosthetics should be allowed in the Olympics, Pistorius will run the 400 meters and the 4x400 meter relay on specially made carbon-fiber prosthetics. Data-head athletes: Some people are calling this the ""Twitter Olympics."" Others say it's the ""Data Olympics."" Many athletes are using sleep-tracking devices and motion-capture systems to understand, with a new level of precision, how their bodies work. According to the Financial Times, some biometric device companies are trading athletes their participation for data that they can use to improve their body-tracking gadgets. Virtual cycling: Australian cyclists have been training on London's cycling course even thought it's thousands of miles away by using virtual reality. As the Australian Broadcast Corporation notes in a video package about the technology, the cyclists watch a screen that looks like a video game but actually is a ""mile for mile, hill for hill recreation of the London Olympic road cycling course."" NASA treadmill: American runner Shannon Rowbury, meanwhile, has been training for London with a treadmill that simulates weightlessness. The AlterG treadmill uses anti-gravity technology developed by NASA to give runners the feeling that they are only 20% of their actual weight, the company says. In an interview posted on the company's website, Rowbury said the treadmill helped her start running much more quickly after a stress fracture. Low-tech suits: We tend to think of the Olympics becoming higher-tech over time, but new technologies of course bring controversy and questions about how much help athletes should receive from space-age materials and equipment. High-tech Speedo swimsuits, called LZR Racer, are credited with helping swimmers shatter world records in 2008. But they will be banned at the London Olympics, leading to questions about how fast swimmers will go without this technological aid. At a news conference, Michael Phelps, who won eight gold medals in Beijing, said that records will fall in London even without the tech. ""If somebody wants a record, it's going to be broken."" Electronic blocks: Omega, the official timekeeper of the games, is debuting new starting equipment for swimming and track-and-field events in London. The track starting blocks will be fully electronic for the first time. Previously, 1970s technology required athletes to push back the blocks 5 millimeters to register a start, according to Wired. The swimming starting blocks now will light up to indicate who placed first, second and third. Jump-kick sensors: Taekwondo has been at risk for being eliminated from the Olympics, but technology that registers the strength and accuracy of kicks may save the sport. ""I think taekwondo will really benefit from the technology because it will ensure the medals go to the best athletes, not to someone else because of a mistake from a referee or a judge,"" World Taekwondo Federation President Choue Chung-won told Reuters. ""This is a wonderful opportunity for us to remain in the Olympics. Not many sports have this kind of technology. ... It will help eliminate human error in taekwondo.""","Technology is a controversial and exciting aspect of the Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Syria's civil war has been grinding on for nearly two years now, resulting in the deaths of more than 60,000 people, according to estimates from the office of the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner. More than 500,000 Syrians have sought refuge in neighboring countries, and the U.N. believes that number could top a million in the coming year. Will the situation improve in 2013, or will the bloody stalemate continue? There have been encouraging signs lately for the opposition, which has made military gains against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. But some observers say al-Assad's grip on power remains strong. CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh, who have reported from inside Syria, analyze the conflict and what the future may hold. Will the rebels defeat the regime? Nick Paton Walsh: I think there's very little doubt that will happen. It's not going to be one day in which there's a decisive changing of the flags over a building in Damascus and then the whole country turns 180 degrees in terms of its government. But there have been weeks now of consistent bad news for the regime. ... That affects not only how people feel inside the regime's inner circle, it affects how their sponsors feel. And, of course, it boosts morale for the rebels as well. So that real sense of momentum has been in place for months. It's beginning to nip around the capital, and I don't think any observer at this point thinks that the Assad government really has a chance in terms of retaining long-term power over the country. Will al-Assad stay and fight until the end as he has said? Or will he go? Nic Robertson: The rebels have said that they won't rest until Assad is completely gone; they won't negotiate with them. But he's showing no signs of leaving whatsoever. Perhaps there are early indications that Assad does realize that he cannot hold on to complete power as he has in the past. So perhaps what we're seeing is the regime entering a new phase now where, rather than fight to hold on to everything, they're fighting to have a better negotiating position in the future. Paton Walsh: The question really is how messy is that final stand of Assad actually going to be? You'll see pockets of these regime forces, particularly in the north, being left to their own devices. ... The real problem of course is going to be how does the rebel militia, how do these disparate groups deal with these Allawi military prisoners once they've actually taken them into custody? If al-Assad is overthrown, then what? Paton Walsh: There will be a period of definitely chaos, warlordism perhaps, and sort of a vacuum whilst the armed groups who won the rebellion struggle for some degree of control over territory. I don't really agree with the more dramatic visions of a nightmare future in Syria that's something between ""Mad Max"" and the Taliban. I think it's going to be a much more watered-down version of that. I think there's an optimism, perhaps amongst many Syrians, that they are educated, moderate in terms of the Islamic values they have. And remember also, this wasn't really a rebellion started over Islamic principles. It is not Iran or Afghanistan. This was about trying to reject what they saw as a corrupt and repressive regime. ... It's classic in these situations, once the major battle is finished, for world attention to radically drift elsewhere onto the next crisis. But that will be the moment when Syria needs help at its most. It will be the moment where the Syrians finally expect the West to actually step in now that the complicated issue of who's arming who and who's fighting who has been put aside. What kind of help will Syria need? Robertson: The economy in Syria is completely destroyed, and it's going to take years to rebuild. So any notion that there can be a quick turnaround in 2013 is fiction. What we're going to see in 2013 are large numbers of displaced people, millions internally inside the country. Thousands, tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of people without shelter, their homes have been destroyed. Large areas of Damascus, Homs, Hama, Aleppo have been destroyed, people without homes. And they're going to be desperate for food. Paton Walsh: I think once the majority of the violence ends, once the nuts and bolts of the civil war are behind them, then food, utilities will come back reasonably quickly because of the nature of where Syria is and who it's bordered by. The real question though is, how do you rebuild a country where so many districts of so many of its cities have already been flattened in many ways? I mean, two or three months ago, Aleppo was in pieces, really struggling to keep anything going. Robertson: You have this whole opposition that hasn't even engaged yet with the opposition outside of the country and the opposition that's fighting there. So to see how they're going to get together and govern together is very difficult. ... Any sort of sense of these opposition groups want to coalesce around democracy, those are not the indications we have at the moment. They're talking about ""We won't stop until we get rid of Assad."" These are not people who are showing a great ability to compromise so far. How will the world respond or help or engage with the new Syria? Paton Walsh: I think, in many ways, the process of that is under way, with the U.S. trying to influence a government in exile (and) many opposition figures gathering in Doha or Turkey to try and work out how that government would look like. But the problem is that might not relate to the daily struggles people are facing on the ground inside Syria after what would be a two-year long war. And bridging that gulf between the men in suits in five-star hotels ... and people on the ground who may be starving or missing the roof of their house from shelling is going to be the enormous challenge. Robertson: Distrust is endemic region-wide. The distrust of the United States and Europe is deep-rooted in the culture in Syria already from 40 years of Assad rule, from watching what's happened in other Arab countries, from hearing what radical Islamists say what the West is trying to do with Islam. All these things have been fomenting in the background. And now you have a scenario where the West hasn't come to the aid of the Syrians, so people are deeply angry. I don't think we're going to find friends quickly in Syria. We're certainly not going to win trust there quickly. And that's going to make whatever we want to see -- the international community wants to see happen in Syria -- that's going to make it much, much harder to achieve.

"(CNN) -- For sheer inspirational value, it will be hard to top one of this fall's new TV series, ""The Michael J. Fox Show."" The beloved actor, now 52, is returning to prime-time television tonight in his first starring role since 2000, when he abandoned ""Spin City"" at the height of its popularity to deal with his worsening Parkinson's disease. The physical challenges posed by his medical condition haven't kept Fox from taking on a number of recurring and guest-starring roles on TV in recent years, most notably on ""Rescue Me,"" ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""The Good Wife."" But to play the lead in a weekly series requires an effort on another order of magnitude, as Fox readily admits. ""It's a lot of hard work, but it's been satisfying,"" he said Sunday at the Emmys, where he paid tribute to the late Gary David Goldberg, the producer behind ""Spin City"" and the show that launched Fox to fame, ""Family Ties."" Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement, and currently, there is no cure. Those who suffer from the disease may have difficulty speaking and may experience cognitive issues. Read more about Parkinson's . Fox acknowledged that embarking on a new series was something of a risk. ""It's been a learning experience to see what I can do (physically) now and what is difficult for me to do now,"" he said. ""I didn't give myself credit for being capable of doing (a regular series). And it's been great."" On the NBC sitcom, Fox plays Michael Henry, a prominent New York news personality who put his career on pause after he developed Parkinson's. When Henry decides to go back to work, his family is surprisingly relieved to have him out of the house. It's part family comedy, part workplace comedy, in a sense combining the key elements of both ""Family Ties"" (and its homey Keaton family setting) and ""Spin City,"" which mostly took place in the office of a fictional New York mayor. His character's condition is a primary source of humor in ""The Michael J. Fox Show,"" at least in the pilot episode. In one scene, Henry's problem with muscular control causes him to dial 911 by mistake. He explains to the 911 operator, ""My meds haven't kicked in yet."" (In a subsequent scene, cops respond to the 911 call. After determining there is no emergency, one of the officers recognizes Henry and says, ""Since we're both here, could I get you to sign an autograph? My uncle's got Alzheimer's."" Henry responds, ""I've actually got Parkinson's."" The cop says, ""Either way."") Fox insists, however, that his sitcom will not amount to a series of Parkinson's jokes. ""It's in the first couple of episodes, but we taper off as we go along,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""But it's what the character lives with, based on stuff from stories I told the writers. ... It can potentially take three minutes to get a spoon of eggs from here to there. There is no particular meaning to that, it's just fact. And when you deal with that fact, it's funny."" Dealing with Parkinson's, of course, hasn't always been a barrel of laughs for Fox, who was diagnosed in 1991 at the age of 30 (he didn't publicly reveal his condition until 1999). In fact, in a new interview with Howard Stern, the actor admitted he began drinking heavily after struggling to cope with the disease. ""I used to drink to party,"" he said on Stern's radio show. ""But now I was drinking alone ... every day."" He said therapy helped get him out of the depths of despair and to a realization that he could live with the disease. ""It all started to get really clear to me,"" he said. That clarity involved resuming his acting career, albeit on a more modest scale, and becoming involved in fundraising for Parkinson's research. He also became a champion of stem cell research, injecting himself into the contentious politics of the issue, which earned him rebukes from some conservatives (including Rush Limbaugh, who once accused the actor of exaggerating his Parkinson's symptoms to curry sympathy). With his new sitcom, Fox has gone back to the future -- to the medium that made him a household name in the 1980s. His co-star Wendell Pierce, who plays Fox's boss on the show, said Parkinson's has not dulled the actor's comedic gifts. ""I see him as a great athlete,"" he said. ""Sometimes I see him just rein in the physicality of a symptom or whatever but at the same time focus on the scene. ... He hasn't lost anything. He hasn't forgotten how to do it."" Pierce said no special accommodations have been made to Fox due to his illness. ""He goes through a normal day (on set),"" he said. ""As with any series, you have long days. You've got to be prepared for them; you've got to rest up; you've got to do your homework. He does all of that, which makes it even more extraordinary, because he has to take care as to how he budgets his energy, his time, to do the work."" Fox says that if anything, Parkinson's has actually made him a better actor. In the current issue of Rolling Stone magazine, he said he learned not to rely on the kind of physicality that had been his calling card. ""When that was taken away, I found that there was other stuff that I could use,"" he said. ""That hesitation, that Parkinsonian affect, is an opportunity to just pause in a moment and collect as a character and respond to what's happening and just gave me this kind of gravitas."" That gravitas will be on display for the full 2013-14 season. NBC made the highly unusual commitment to order 22 episodes up-front, the price it apparently had to pay to prevail in a network bidding war for the show. Pierce said Fox has earned it. ""He was deserving of a full season order, because he has demonstrated that he has the star power to deliver,"" he said. Fox and his co-stars have shot several episodes, with many more ahead. As for how it's going, the actor said it's so far, so good. ""It's been great,"" he said. ""The cast is great, and the writers are great. It's been a good experience."" Does he see what he's accomplishing as inspirational? Fox won't come right out and say it, but he hinted as much to Rolling Stone. He told the magazine that in the back of his mind, he's aware some people might be inspired to see a person with Parkinson's return to full-time work. ""Another side of it that I don't deal with every day but is certainly present, is that on some level, it might be empowering for people.""","""The Michael J. Fox Show"" premieres tonight on NBC .

It educates teens, they learn some things maybe they didn't know and it even helps them ask their parents better questions."" Although teenage pregnancy rates in the U.S. are at historic lows, they are substantially higher than other Western countries. ""Teen birth rates fell at least 15% for all but two states during 2007--2011Ã¢â¬â the most recent period of sustained decline,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. The pregnancy rate for girls ages 15-19 dropped to 31.3 per 1,000 in 2011, a record low for the United States. But experts say the drop does not mean the issue is no longer a priority. Other states offer similar services for teens. North Carolina launched a BrdsNBz program in 2009. California has its own service, HookUp 365247, which is loosely based on the same concept. It provides teens who text the number with weekly sexual health tips and the nearest reproductive health clinics. In New Mexico, parents can text their questions as well.

"Billings, Montana (CNN) -- Stacey Dean Rambold, a former high school teacher who served a month-long sentence for raping a 14-year-old girl, was released Thursday from a Montana jail. Rambold's lenient sentence and the judge's comments about his victim sparked national outrage and protests. He won't be a free man exactly; he's on probation for the next 14 years, 11 months. According to court documents, that means he'll have to agree to conditions like undergoing sex offender treatment, not going to places where children congregate and not having a cell phone with photo, video or Internet capabilities. Prosecutors have appealed the sentence, saying it is illegal, to the Montana Supreme Court. The victim's mother says she hope Rambold will be behind bars again soon. ""(Judge G. Todd Baugh) made a mistake and I'm disappointed. (31) days, that's outrageous, but the Montana Supreme Court stepped in. Hopefully they'll make it right,"" said Auliea Hanlon, whose daughter, Cherice Moralez, committed suicide before Rambold went to trial. In the meantime, Hanlon told CNN's Erin Burnett Thursday night that she wants to avoid the man who raped her daughter. ""I hope I don't see him. That would be horrible,"" she said. ""I didn't see him for the first six years. I didn't see him until the courtroom."" But she said someday, she hopes she will be able to forgive him. ""I could be miserable the rest of my life,"" she said, ""but that wouldn't do my other kids any good."" Rambold declined to answer questions from CNN as he entered and left a probation office in Billings on Thursday. Defense attorney Jay Lansing had no comment on the case, but has said his client contends the sentence imposed is lawful and appropriate. Before suicide, raped Montana teen loved outdoors, poetry . Activists file formal judicial complaint . On Tuesday, the Montana and Pennsylvania chapters of the National Organization for Women and an activist group called Ultraviolet filed a complaint with a judicial review board, CNN affiliate KULR reported. More than 140,000 people signed accompanying petitions, the groups said. ""If we can't get him removed from this, there is something wrong with the system, and I know people in the state will work to not get (Baugh) re-elected (next year),"" said Marian Bradley, president of Montana NOW. The case drew widespread attention when Baugh imposed a one-month sentence on Rambold and made controversial comments about the victim, saying she ""seemed older than her chronological age"" and she was ""as much in control of the situation."" Rambold admitted raping the girl in 2008 while she was 14 and he was her teacher at her high school. Moralez took her life shortly before her 17th birthday. The judge later apologized for his comments, and earlier this month tried to revisit his sentence. But the state Supreme Court barred him from a new ruling, saying he didn't have the legal standing to change a sentence. Baugh said he didn't realize at first that the minimum sentence should have been two years. Baugh's secretary said Wednesday the judge had no comment on Rambold's release. 'We want the conversation to go nationwide' There is one good thing about the case, NOW's Bradley said: It's brought renewed national attention to the critically important issue of violence against women. ""We want the conversation to go nationwide, so that everyone will say this behavior is not OK in my community. . ... I think everyone believes, 'In my town it can't happen, it shouldn't happen, I need to stop it,'"" she said. ""And you can stop it. You can stop it by going out and spreading the word."" That's why she sees a glimmer of hope in how much people are talking about the case. ""I think as long as we know that it's happening we can acknowledge it and we can do something to change it. If we don't see it and don't acknowledge it, we can't make a change at all,"" she said. ""So I think this is important. This is so sad for the mother, this is so sad for the community, this is so sad for our state and our country. But there is hope."" The legal process . With Cherice's death, the prosecution entered into what is known as a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" with Rambold. This meant that all charges against Rambold -- who admitted to one of the rape charges -- would be dismissed if he completed a sex-offender treatment program and met other requirements. One of them was to have no contact with children. But the ex-teacher fell short of the agreement and prosecutors asked Baugh last month to sentence him to 20 years. Baugh ruled Rambold's infractions weren't serious enough. ""He made some violations of his treatment program,"" the judge said. ""They were more technical and not the kind you would send someone to prison for."" Hanlon said the pain of her daughter's death hasn't faded. ""I think we just get used to it, so we don't cry every day,"" she said, but the tears still came. Opinion: In Montana, a case study in rape culture .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a woman who burst into a Tripoli hotel to tell journalists that she had been beaten and raped by troops loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said Monday that her daughter is still being held. Her claim contradicts an earlier statement from the government, which has said that Eman al-Obeidy was released and is at home with her family. ""Yesterday, late at night at 3 a.m., they called me from Bab al Aziziya,"" Gadhafi's compound in Tripoli, al-Obeidy's mother told Al-Jazeera television Monday. ""And they told me: Make your daughter Eman change her statement ... and we will release her immediately and whatever you ask for you will get, whether money, or a new apartment, or guaranteeing financial security for you and your children. But just tell Eman to change her statement."" A government spokesman said Sunday that al-Obeidy had been released and was with her family. Spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said then that al-Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by ""one or two, preferably female, reporters to verify that she's fine, she's healthy, she's free with her family.""  He refused to take further questions on the issue, repeatedly stating that Libyan society is ""very conservative."" A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach Al-Obeidy's sister's house Monday, but were blocked by security forces. The sister's mobile phone has apparently been turned off, a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN, and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel. The family of al-Obeidy said she is a lawyer -- and not a prostitute or mentally ill as Libyan government officials initially said after the incident. The government has since changed its story, saying she is sane and pursuing a criminal case. Al-Obeidy's father told Al-Jazeera that his daughter ""has her full mental capabilities and she is a graduate of law school and a lawyer and she is pursuing higher education in Tripoli. And she was kidnapped by Gadhafi's tyrannical forces."" ""I am not ashamed of my daughter,"" al-Obeidy's mother, who spoke from an undisclosed location in Libya, told the network.  ""I am proud of her because she has broken the barrier. She broke the barrier that no man can break. And those dogs there with him, Moammar, (are) the criminals!"" She urged the youth of Libya to take action. Al-Obeidy burst into a Tripoli hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning. Her face was bruised, as were her legs. She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh. Speaking in English, she said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men. Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said, CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy's story. ""Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me,"" she said. ""My honor was violated by them."" Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles. Government officials tried to stifle her, but she persisted. Security forces moved to subdue her, and even a member of the hotel's kitchen staff drew a knife. ""Traitor!"" he shouted. Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head. One government official, who was there to facilitate access for journalists, pulled a pistol from his belt. Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment. Some journalists were beaten and kicked. CNN's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair. As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away, al-Obeidy warned, ""If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it."" CNN's Nic Robertson and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","The Libyan government says Eman al-Obeidy was released .

"(CNN) -- After more than three decades, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is not ready to give up power. Referred to by locals as ""old man,"" the 89-year-old leader trudges on, holding on to his presidency by suppressing the media and intimidating his opponents, rights groups say. But his supporters have dismissed the claims, saying the bespectacled leader wins hearts based on his popularity and policies. Zimbabwe election praised by African Union, sidesteps rigging claims . Last week, Zimbabwe's election commission handed him another five years in power when it said he won 61% of the votes in the country's presidential elections. His rival, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, cried foul and threatened to mount a legal challenge. The United States, the United Kingdom and Australia all questioned the results. Mugabe has never been shy about his grip on power. ""This is my territory, and that which is mine I cling (to) unto death,"" he once said. War hero . Once hailed as a liberation hero, Mugabe became a household name during a guerrilla war against white colonial rulers in Zimbabwe, then known as Rhodesia. The white regime threw him into prison for 10 years. After his release in 1974, he launched a fight for freedom from Mozambique. He coordinated a guerrilla war against then-Prime Minister Ian Smith's white minority rule in Rhodesia and returned home a hero in 1979. ""He was very clear of what they were looking for, which was really one person, one vote, democracy for his country,"" said Moeletsi Mbeki, brother of former South African President Thabo Mbeki. ""He was leading this party which had an army, which was credible, which was doing a good job against the white settlers in then-Rhodesia."" He went on to lead the newly independent Zimbabwe -- first as prime minister in 1980, then as president seven years later. Different paths . Mugabe and South Africa's anti-apartheid icon, Nelson Mandela, both battled to free their nations from white minority rule. But Mandela, who became president in 1994 after he was freed from prison, kept a promise to retire after only one term. Though both were hailed as liberation heroes, Mandela is considered an iconic statesman. Mugabe, on the other hard, is vilified by some world leaders. ""In western lore he has been a terrorist, a Marxist ideologue, now a bloodthirsty tyrant, stereotypes that he alone on the continent has been able to mock and laugh off,"" Roy Agyemang said in an opinion piece in Britain's The Guardian newspaper. Agyemang, who produced the movie ""Mugabe: Villain or Hero?"" said the leader is unfazed by the characterizations. "" 'If standing for my people's aspirations makes me a Hitler,' Mugabe once said, 'let me be a Hitler a thousand times.' "" Good ol' days . Zimbabwe's economy was strong in the early years of Mugabe's rule. The country was known as the breadbasket of southern Africa because of its strong agricultural sector. But that changed in the 1990s, when the economy began a downward spiral and Mugabe's government faced charges of elitism, cronyism and corruption. His liberation credentials brought him high regard during the early part of his leadership, with many seeing him as a unifying figure committed to the needs of the average person. Goodwill runs out . But the goodwill from his liberation struggle slowly ran out. In 2000, he drew criticism for his land reform program that evicted white farmers and gave the land to poor black Zimbabweans, many veterans of the struggle for independence. Most were not as familiar with commercial farming. ""Zimbabwe belongs to the Zimbabweans, pure and simple,"" he said in a 2009 interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. White Zimbabweans -- even those born in the country with legal ownership of their land -- have a debt to pay, he said. Soon after, agricultural output decreased sharply. 'One of Africa's bad boys' Despite his pariah status in the West, analysts say Mugabe's anti-Western tirades have propelled his popularity at home. To some, he commands respect for challenging the status quo and retaining his image as a critic of former colonial powers, said Ayo Johnson, director of Viewpoint Africa, which sells Africa content to media outlets. ""Mugabe ... is one of Africa's bad boys and wears his medal with pride,"" Johnson said in a past interview. ""He who stands up and shouts the most is usually revered."" Few African leaders have as willfully and spitefully taunted the West, a major source of donor aid, as Mugabe has. His anti-West tirades especially target Britain and the United States, which he accuses of colonialism. ""Keep your pink nose out of our affairs, please,"" he told the United States last week in response to criticism of his push for elections without key reforms. Agyemang says Mugabe's bold economic policies are moving the nation forward. ""Mugabe is more than just a politician, he leads a cause, or as his militant supporters would say, he has become the cause itself,"" Agyemang said in The Guardian piece. ""And the cause has something to do with giving back the African his dignity well beyond symbols of nominal independence."" No longer a breadbasket . In recent years, political rivals have accused him of turning a nation once known as the breadbasket of southern Africa into one racked by hunger and once sky-high inflation. But Mugabe has clung to power at all costs. In 2008, his party lost to his closest rival, Tsvangirai, who did not get enough votes to avoid a runoff. Opposition party supporters were beaten, tortured and killed, rights groups said, and Tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff in protest. The post-election violence left about 200 people dead and thousands injured. Regional leaders dismissed that election as a sham and pressured the two to form a power-sharing agreement, which led to a tense coalition in 2009. Mugabe's main opponent became his prime minister, and the squabbles continued. Former teacher . Born in February 1924 in then-Rhodesia to a carpenter father, Mugabe spent his early career as a teacher. His first wife died in 1992, and he married his current wife, Grace, four years later. They have two sons and one daughter. Mugabe has university degrees in education, economics, administration and law from the University of London. In 2002, the European Union imposed sanctions on Mugabe and his allies, including travel bans, accusing Zimbabwe of human rights violations. in 2008, the United Kingdom stripped Mugabe of an honorary knighthood awarded by Queen Elizabeth II. Later that year, the nation plunged into post-election violence. The European Union eased the sanctions after a successful referendum on a new constitution in March of this year but called for credible elections. Inflation . As he has continued to lash out at the West, donors have distanced themselves, sending Zimbabwe on a downward economic spiral. By 2008, the nation's inflation had soared to 200 million percent. Food shelves were empty, and a loaf of bread cost about 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars. International isolation continued to hit the economy as corruption remained rife. Despite widespread poverty, the nation has made major strides in its economy in recent years, experts say. There is food on the shelves, schools and hospitals are open and farming is showing signs of recovery. Since 2010, the nation's gross domestic product ""has grown by an average of over 7% and inflation has remained in the low single digits,"" the International Monetary Fund said last month. ""Government revenues have more than doubled from 16% of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 36% of GDP in 2012, allowing the restoration of basic public services."" Medical trips . Illness has come with Mugabe's advancing age. He has reportedly made regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment amid growing concerns about his health. In 2011, public documents showed he amassed a staggering $29 million in travel expenses. WikiLeaks released cables detailing party members' reports that he is suffering from cancer, which he has denied. Despite the reports, a Freedom House survey last year showed that Mugabe's party was regaining its popularity. Q&A: Why Zimbabwe elections matter .

"(CNN) -- The smell of fall is already in the air in some parts of the United States. That means it's time to pack up the car and drive to wherever the leaves are changing colors. Or is it? For some, hiking through the woods looking for leaves to slowly, slowly, slowly change colors and eventually fall off is about as interesting as watching paint dry. This so-called ""kidnappee"" is only observed on leaf-peeping trips ""when dragged there by someone else,"" according to Yankee Magazine's Introduction to Leaf Peepers. A leaf-loving spouse or parent or friend has often conned this hater of quiet nature into a leaf-focused trip. Is there a way to honor the wishes of those travelers who appreciate the amazing beauty and science of trees hunkering down for the winter and those would rather do something else? The leaf lovers could choose to travel solo. That's a fine option. But may we suggest a compromise for those in mixed marriages and other foliage-fraught relationships? Give the nature lovers some designated time to enjoy the leaves, then try something a little less organic. Or at the very least, pick a destination with a layer of history or adventure on top of the leafy beauty. A sip of Maine . If your family is heading to Maine, you likely have some hard-core leaf enthusiasts among you. This fall foliage giant has a state website dedicated to the changing leaves. Head to Camden Hills State Park for the view from the 800-foot summit of Mount Battie, made famous by Maine poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, and enjoy the views of Camden Harbor, Penobscot Bay and the surrounding hillsides covered in fall color. The hike to the top can take two hours, or you can drive. From the top, you might even be able to spot Cadillac Mountain at Acadia National Park. The compromise: Head to the nearby town of Belfast to enjoy a pint at Marshall Wharf Brewing Company on Belfast Harbor. The brewery serves their product at its tasting room (11 a.m. to 4 p.m.) and its adjacent brew pub, Three Tides (4 p.m. to about midnight). Walk and shop off your drinks on Belfast's Main Street. Zipping through New Hampshire . Everywhere you go in New Hampshire, there's another stunning hike capturing the majesty of the changing season. Head to Lake Winnipesaukee for a scenic drive. ""Driving around the lake, you get to explore the quintessential towns of Wolfeboro and Meredith,"" says Jim Salge, Yankee magazine's fall foliage blogger. ""Wolfeboro bills itself as the oldest summer resort in America. On the Guilford side, there's Weirs Beach, a popular lakefront attraction, and Ellacoya State Park."" It's mostly a driving route, with places to get out and walk in towns and parks along the lake. The compromise: Head down the road to Gunstock Mountain Resort, where the resort's zipline tours can get your adrenaline going. If you only have time for one activity, the zipline rolls peeping and adventure into one. Pennsylvania's Civil War history . Gettysburg National Military Park's beauty as the park's leaves start to change color stands in dramatic contrast to the bloody history of what happened on the park grounds 150 years ago this year. Visitors to the national park can enjoy guided or self-guided tours or horseback tours this fall. Expect the most beautiful fall foliage in mid- to late-October. The compromise: The leaves are certainly not the main story at Gettysburg. Learn more about the Battle of Gettysburg and President Abraham Lincoln's historic Gettysburg Address. Although many events were held in July during the 150th anniversary of the battle, there are still plenty of anniversary activities to experience. New Mexico's extraordinary artist . The changing colors of New Mexico's landscape are brilliantly captured by many of the artists who have called the state home. Head to the popular Aspen Vista Trail in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains for peak aspen tree leaf-peeping season now through the end of October. The trailhead is located on Artist Road #475, about 13 miles from Santa Fe. The compromise: For another unique jolt of color and form, visit the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe. Starting in October, the museum will host an exhibit showcasing O'Keeffe's depictions of Lake George (New York), where she had a rural retreat. The exhibit runs through January 26, 2014. Or tour O'Keeffe's home and studio in nearby Abiquiu. (Spots are limited so make sure to make reservations in advance.) North Carolina's small-town culture . At an elevation of 6,684 feet, the Mount Mitchell summit in North Carolina is a spectacular vantage point to view the changing leaves of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The highest point east of the Mississippi, Mount Mitchell State Park is at an altitude of more than a mile. The compromise: Drive into the town of Blowing Rock for respite from the quiet of the leaves. Blowing Rock is filled with art galleries, performances, festivals for almost every interest, and nearby farms. Consider a zipline tour at Sky Valley Zip Tours for a more adventurous trek. Montana's hunting and food scene . There's nothing like Glacier National Park for seeing nature at its wildest, and the trees on the Going-to-the-Sun Road are heading into full fall foliage splendor in late September. Head there quickly before winter descends upon the park. The compromise: After a stint in the forest, you might be inspired to hunt for your meal. For the sports enthusiast, there's fly fishing and hunting based out of the nearby town of Kalispell. Foodies will appreciate Kalispell's Festival of Flavors (September 19-28) and the nearby town of Whitefish celebrates German beer and food at its annual Great Northwest Oktoberfest (September 26 through October 5). An artist's view of California . California's rugged fall foliage is unlike anything you'll see in the northeast and it's happening right now. Drive up to Bishop Creek Canyon in California's Eastern Sierra, near Mammoth Lakes. There you'll see ""spectacular displays of lime, yellow, orange, red and crimson-quaking aspen reflected in tourmaline blue lakes and surrounded by saw tooth granite peaks,"" writes John Poimiroo, who blogs about California's fall foliage. The compromise: After all that peeping, visitors can head to the town of Bishop to see how celebrated photographers Galen and Barbara Rowell see the landscape at Mountain Light Gallery. Vermont's ice cream . What leaf-peeping enthusiast could leave out Vermont? It has an official ""Foliage Forecaster"" in Michael Snyder, commissioner of the state Forests, Parks and Recreation department. Start in Burlington and head east toward Waterbury and Stowe, where you'll see good early fall color driving through the Champlain Valley (Interstate 89 or Route 2). After spending the first half-hour in farm country and the foothills of the Green Mountains, head north to Waterbury on Route 100. ""This week's forecast looks great, and the onset of cool nights and some frost is what really kicks in the next level of vibrancy,"" Snyder says. If that good weather continues next week, ""that drive within an hour's radius of Ben & Jerry's will afford viewing opportunities of every stage of fall color."" The compromise: That's right. He said Ben & Jerry's. Stop by the plant in Waterbury for a tour and some ice cream. You'll get to sample the ice cream flavor of the day and buy more at the factory Scoop Shop. And where did you favorite flavors get buried after being eliminated? The factory's flavor graveyard (which is only open through October). Because it's Vermont, and we think you should soldier on a bit longer (you non-leaf fans), we add Snyder's extended tour: From Ben & Jerry's, take the classic foliage tour on Route 100 north up to Stowe, where the color is already more advanced. Head up Route 108 through Smuggler's Notch, another fall favorite, to quickly spot more advanced color. Check the Vermont foliage website before you to to ensure that fall hasn't turned into winter yet.","Touring Maine's fall foliage can be rewarded by a pint at a local brewery .
The leaf-peeper and the history buff alike will appreciate Gettysburg .
The colors on the trails near Santa Fe also appear at the Georgia O'Keeffe museum .
After a leafy drive, Vermont tourists can enjoy a scoop of Ben & Jerry's finest ."
"(CNN) -- It is now more than 20 years since pro-democracy grassroots organizations led struggles that eventually resulted in the overthrow of long-serving authoritarian regimes in many countries in Africa. Since the 1990s, there have been significant improvements in the transition to democratic governance in Africa. However, there have also been some major reversals. Click on the interactive map above to find out more about Africa's governments. Unfortunately, some pre-1990 incumbent leaders (for example, Paul Biya of Cameroon and Robert Gabriel Mugabe of Zimbabwe) remain in power, despite efforts by the opposition to unseat them. In addition, Mali, which had made significant progress toward deepening and institutionalizing democracy, suffered major regression, first, by the capture and subsequent occupation of the northern part of the country by a group of separatist rebels, and second, by a military coup that ousted its democratically elected government. Soldiers also intervened in Guinea-Bissau, suspended government institutions and proceeded to engage in activities that seriously undermined the rule of law. Meanwhile, violent mobilization by ethnic and religious groups continue to negatively impact governance in Nigeria, Central African Republic, Kenya, Uganda, and Madagascar. The failure of national institutions to grant adequate protection to individual liberties continues to plague countries such as The Gambia, where a U.N report says several prison inmates were executed last year without due process of law, and South Africa where the police last year used deadly force against miners who were exercising their rights to strike. See also: New violence clouds future for South African mines . Despite these setbacks, there have been significant and spectacular achievements in the continent's struggle to deepen and institutionalize democracy. Ghana continues to lead the way. First, after the country's president, John Atta Mills, died in office in July 2012, he was succeeded, as required by the constitution, by the country's vice president, John Dramani Mahama. Second, in December 2012, the country held competitive, fair and peaceful elections, which were won by Mahama. He was subsequently sworn in as the country's president. Finally, Ghana has also shown significant leadership in openness and transparency in government. In 2003, Ghana committed to the extractive industries transparency initiative and has since emerged as a leading example of how governments can minimize corruption in the management of public revenues from the extractive sector. Read also: What Ghana can teach the rest of Africa about democracy . Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Guinea and Malawi have made some gains as they move steadily towards democratic governance. Ivory Coast, after a violent and extremely bloody civil war, inaugurated a new president, followed by the development of new laws and institutions, especially those dealing with corruption and openness and transparency in government. In addition, the country now has a fully functioning legislative assembly, and the country's security situation, previously worsened by sectarian strife, has improved significantly. Sierra Leone, whose institutions were destroyed by a long and brutal civil war, has seen restoration of many national institutions and a return to the rule of law. This is exemplified by the fact that the country's 2012 presidential and parliamentary elections were free, fair and peaceful and the results were accepted by the people. The winners went on to form a government which continues to rule the country in peace. Senegal also held elections in 2012, which resulted in the peaceful transfer of power. Since taking office, the new president, Macky Sall, has made significant efforts to improve openness and transparency in government, as well as force public officials to be accountable to the constitution and the people. Lesotho's governance system was strengthened by successfully conducting fair and free elections, which resulted in the peaceful transfer of power. Both Malawi and Guinea saw some improvements in their governance systems -- in Guinea, opportunities for civic dialogue improved significantly and in Malawi, the death of the sitting president was not followed by bloody chaos; instead, as required by the constitution, the vice president, Joyce Banda, was inaugurated the new president. The Arab Spring brought significant improvements to governance structures in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. The tragic death of Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi, by self-immolation, brought about a grassroots political movement among Tunisians that effectively overthrew the country's authoritarian ruler, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. This movement, which was subsequently nicknamed the Arab Spring, spread to Egypt and Libya, resulting in the ouster of long-serving dictatorships in those countries as well. Elections, considered fair and free, have since been held in all three countries and each now has a democratically elected government. Nevertheless, many groups within these countries, especially those which historically have suffered exploitation and persecution at the hands of their governments (e.g., ethnic and religious minorities, and women) have expressed the fear that although these new regimes came to power through democratic elections, they are likely to reject or abandon democracy once they have had a chance to consolidate their power bases. Already, such fears appear to be coming true in Egypt, where the new president, Mohamed Morsy, has already engaged in extra-constitutional practices to grab more power for himself. In addition, the elected parliament was dissolved by the anachronistic supreme constitutional court, and the new constitution was hurriedly drafted and done so through a top-down, elite-driven, non-participatory process. As a consequence, what had started as a dynamic grassroots-led program to transform Egypt's laws and institutions and produce a more effective and relevant governance architecture, has degenerated into a struggle by entrenched interests, led by Morsy and his Freedom and Justice party, to further entrench themselves politically and economically. In Tunisia, the revolution, which since the ouster of Ben Ali had been progressing well, despite opposition from several Islamist groups, suffered significant regression following the brutal and cowardly assassination of Chokri Belaid, a secularist and staunch critic of the ruling Islamist-led government of Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali. Meanwhile, the brutal assassination of the U.S. ambassador and the wanton destruction of property in Benghazi, the cradle of the Libyan revolution, is indicative of a still-born transformation, one that had failed to create institutions capable of guaranteeing the rule of law in Libya. The struggles of grassroots organizations in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt are symptomatic of what needs to be done throughout Africa to deepen and institutionalize democracy. Read also: Western-style democracy 'not suitable for Africa'? The many individuals that participated in North Africa's grassroots revolution to replace authoritarianism with democracy are frustrated because their revolutions did not achieve their critical goals -- reconstruction and reconstitution of anachronistic and dysfunctional state systems inherited from the ancien rÃÂ©gimes to provide legal and judicial systems that guarantee the just rule of law. That is, laws and institutions that protect individuals' rights, including protecting all citizens from violence directed at them either by state or non-state actors, and enhance people's ability to engage in productive activities to create the wealth that they need to fight poverty and improve their living conditions. Such laws are consistent with the provisions of the universal declaration of human rights and other international human rights instruments. These revolutions, as has been the case in other African countries, were hijacked by entrenched opportunists, whose main interest is in preserving the status quo, so that they can continue to use these anachronistic state structures to enrich themselves at the expense of their fellow citizens. In order to advance the transition to democratic governance in Africa, as well as minimize the chances of regression, each African country must engage all its relevant stakeholder groups in state reconstruction through democratic (i.e., bottom-up, participatory, inclusive and people-driven) constitution making to produce institutional arrangements that adequately constrain civil servants and political elites, enhance the ability of each country's diverse population groups to coexist peacefully, and create economic and political environments that maximize entrepreneurial activities and the creation of wealth.

"(CNN) -- A man convicted of murdering three men who answered a Craigslist ad to work on an Ohio cattle farm was sentenced to death Thursday morning, Summit County Court Bailiff Brian Scheetz said. A judge in Summit County accepted a jury's recommendation that Richard James Beasley should die for the crimes. Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron, Ohio; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Virginia; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon, Ohio, answered the ad and were killed in late 2011. In March, a jury convicted Beasley on 26 counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and unanimously recommended that he be sentenced to death. Would-be victim Scott Davis apparently was in Beasley's cross hairs, too. After answering the online ad for work on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio, the South Carolinian in November 2011 told a deputy sheriff how he'd met with two males, and then drove toward Stock Township. Told a road was closed due to a landslide, Davis got out of the car and started walking through a heavily wooded area toward what he was informed was where he'd be working. He turned around ""to see a gun pointed at his head,"" Noble County Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum later explained. Shot in the arm, Davis ran and hid in the forest for seven hours. Eventually, he got the nerve to go to a house and ask for help. After he told his story, authorities began to connect his case with those of other missing men. One of them was Kern, killed one week after Davis' escape. Authorities have said that one of Beasley's motives was to steal from his victims.

"(CNN) -- Conventional webmaster wisdom holds that changing the name of a website leads to a drop in its popularity. ""You are going to lose traffic,"" a SearchEngineLand blogger warned would-be name changers in 2009. ""That is a fact. Even if you only perform a domain change and preserve the exact same site structure and content, you will lose some traffic."" If that's true, it spells bad news for MSNBC.com, which on Monday changed its name and URL to NBCNews.com following a split from Microsoft, the technology giant that had partnered with the U.S. news network to produce the website. But maybe that assumption is outdated? NBC, for its part, said it doesn't expect the move to affect traffic. All existing URLs, including those linked on social media sites, will still work or will redirect to the new NBCNews.com URL, Vivian Schiller, NBC News chief digital officer, said in a conference call with reporters Monday. (The MSNBC cable channel will launch a new website in 2013 as an extension of its on-air brand, NBC News said.) If you take a look at a few of the sites that have changed their names -- it's really rare for a site to do so, by the way -- you see that many of them not only survive a name change but are able to thrive after it. Or maybe because of it. Here's a look at a few that have come out better on the other end of a URL switch: . Facebook: If you're under 30, or if you saw ""The Social Network,"" you probably know that Facebook used to be called thefacebook.com. The company officially dropped the ""the"" in August 2005. That's universally regarded as a good move, but it's worth pointing out that the switch occurred before Facebook was a household name. IMDB: The Internet Movie Database, now super popular and owned by Amazon, started in 1990 as a USENET group with the domain rec.arts.movies. The site then was hosted by Cardiff University before it migrated to IMDB.com, according to a feature in Total Film. PerezHilton: The pop culture and gay news blog started out as PageSixSixSix.com, a reference to the New York Post's gossip column. Now pretty much no one (except a friend from HLN's website, who sent this reference) remembers the previous blog. Overstock.com: The Internet retailer changed its name to O.co in 2011, but switched it back, as CNET reports, because of brand confusion. Consider this the warning for NBCNews.com, although NBC is already a recognizable brand in the United States. O.co, by the way, still redirects to Overstock's site. PayPal: Elon Musk founded a site called X.com in 1999. The next year, it would merge with Confinity to become PayPal, the well-known online payment system. According to PayPal's official blog, the ""X"" was a reference to that ""universally recognized programming variable"" -- a reference to innovation and creation. This may be the only example of a site's URL actually getting less cool because of a change. Twitter: The micro-blogging site launched in 2006 as Twttr because a ""bird enthusiast"" already owned the URL for Twitter.com, according to CNNMoney. Six months later, the company had enough money to buy some vowels. Ask.com: Remember that fashionable digital butler from the '90s? Ask.com began in 1996 as AskJeeves.com but fired Jeeves in 2005 to become Ask.com. Can you think of any others? Do you have thoughts on the MSNBC.com name change? If so, please let us know in the comments section.","MSNBC.com changes its name to NBCNews.com .

"(CNN) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will meet with the group known as the P5 plus 1 on Thursday during his visit to the United Nations, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Monday. The P5 plus 1 includes Germany and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Russia, China, France, and Britain. There has been friction between Iran and Western nations over the country's nuclear aspirations and Iran's backing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in that country's civil war. But world powers have been searching for ways to tackle both topics. After Zarif sat down with Ashton on Monday morning, she spoke to reporters about her first face-to-face meeting with the diplomat. ""As you know I spoke to him several times over the summer but this was the first opportunity for us to meet face to face,"" Ashton said. ""We talked about a number of important issues, but focused on the nuclear issue. We had a good and constructive discussion."" She said there will be a ""short discussion"" at the meeting this week. Ashton said she and Zarif agreed that they will meet in October ""with our teams in Geneva"" Switzerland. Zarif was to meet with British Foreign Minister William Hague at 3 p.m. Monday in a closed-door meeting, a Western diplomat confirmed. Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, has been making overtures toward the West that some analysts term as a charm offensive and others see as an opportunity for the West and Iran to forge a deal on the country's nuclear weapons. Tehran says it wants to develop nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes, but Western nations have long said that Iran is intent on developing nuclear weapons. The dispute about why Iran is seeking nuclear capability -- for energy or for bombs -- has prompted international sanctions and escalated concerns about additional warfare in the Middle East. ""We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart,"" Rouhani said in an op-ed column last week in the Washington Post.

"(CNN) -- Former 100 meter world record holder Asafa Powell has pulled out of the world championships in Daegu, which are set to get under way on Saturday. Jamaica's Powell, who took 100m bronze at the last championships in Berlin two years ago, was expected to be one of the main challengers to his compatriot and reigning champion Usain Bolt. The 28-year-old is the fastest man in the world this year, a 9.78 second run in Lausanne, but a statement from his management company confirmed he will be absent from the biennial event with a groin injury. ""Asafa Powell has officially withdrawn from the 100m event in Daegu citing a continued groin strain,"" read the statement. ""Powell suffered a groin strain in Budapest on July 30 and has had recurring tightness and pain ever since. ""After Budapest, Asafa missed eight days of training before he could attempt to sprint again. When he returned to the track he was able to sprint but it caused the groin to flare up. Despite missing out on the individual event, Powell could be part of the Jamaican 4 x 100m relay squad which claimed gold in Berlin and also at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. ""He has received all sorts of treatments over the past two weeks in the hope of being prepared to run the 100m here in Daegu,"" continued the statement. ""Asafa is very disappointed to say the least. He was really hoping to be able to run in what was going to be one of the most anticipated races of the championships. He is still optimistic to be able to run the relay."" His absence and that of leading American Tyson Gay would appear to leave the way clear for Bolt to retain his title, but the world record holder told gathered reporters Thursday that was short of his very best form after battling back from injuries that curtailed his 2010 season. ""I wouldn't say it's 100 percent but I'm happy with where it is and I'm going out there to do my best,"" he said. ""This for me is a comeback season from injury. I have been working really hard this season to get back in tip-top shape."" Bolt added, . Meanwhile, former Olympic gold medallists Sebastian Coe and Sergey Bubka have been elected as vice-presidents of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Five men were in the running for four positions, with Qatari Dahlan Al-Hamad and Robert Hersh of the U.S. the other two people voted in. A second vote was required to decide the four successful candidates after a malfunction in the electronic voting system caused the body's president Lamine Diack to order a revote. Initially, former Ukrainian pole-vaulter and gold medallist at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul Bubka missed out on election to Canadian Abby Hoffman. Bubka was voted in via a manual vote following the system error. Coe, a two-time Olympic gold medal winner over 1500m, dismissed suggestions of foul play and insisted it was purely a glitch which caused the re-vote. ""We would have preferred the technology to work better but it has failed us and we had to go back to a manual vote,"" Coe told British newspaper The Guardian. ""There was just a technical glitch -- there is nothing else involved and we have to live with it. ""These things do happen. I instinctively thought it looked a bit of a rogue result [but] I'm no great believer in conspiracy theories. Clearly something wasn't working."" Senegalese chief Diack was re-elected as president unopposed, with a majority of 169 to 29 after a second ballot.","Asafa Powell pulls out of 100m at world championships through injury .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Benazir Bhutto died from a fractured skull caused by hitting her head on part of her car's sunroof as a bomb ripped through a crowd of her supporters, a spokesman for Pakistan's Interior Ministry said Friday. Members of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party in the northwestern city of Peshawar protest her assassination. ""When she was thrown by the force of the shockwave of the explosion, unfortunately one of the levers of the sunroof hit  her,"" said spokesman Brigadier Javed Iqbal Cheema. The explanation is the latest from the Interior Ministry. It initially said Bhutto was killed by shots fired by the bomber, and then, via the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, it said the cause of death was a shrapnel injury. But Farzana Raja of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party told CNN the government's explanation is ""a pack of lies,"" she told CNN. Raja also accused the government of a ""total security lapse."" At a news conference, Cheema showed images of Bhutto in a car, standing up through an open sunroof, looking out at the crowd as she was about to be driven away. When the gunshots rang out and the explosion occurred, Bhutto ""fell down or perhaps ducked"" and apparently hit her head on a lever, Cheema said, adding that the lever was stained with blood.  Watch the shots, then a blast Â» . The blast killed at least 28 more people and at least 100 were wounded. The Interior Ministry also revealed Friday that it had proof showing that al Qaeda was behind Bhutto's assassination. Cheema said the government had an intelligence intercept in which an al Qaeda militant ""congratulated his people for carrying out this cowardly act."" However, that claim has not appeared on radical Islamist Web sites that regularly post such messages from al Qaeda and other militant groups. The Interior Ministry told Pakistan's GEO-TV that the suicide bomber belonged to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi -- an al Qaeda-linked Sunni Muslim militant group that the government has blamed for hundreds of killings. U.S. officials believe that a Taliban leader, Baitullah Mahsud, may be the person behind the  assassination. Bhutto was laid to rest in a chaotic funeral at her ancestral home of Garhi-Khuda Baksh on Friday after  violent scenes erupted across Pakistan following her death a day earlier.  Watch video from Bhutto's funeral procession Â» . Hundreds of thousands of people in the surrounding streets almost brought the procession to a standstill before it finally reached the Bhutto family's mausoleum. The throngs of her grieving supporters crushed up against the flag-draped coffin, while minor scuffles also broke out.  See images of Pakistan mourning Bhutto. Â» . Violence erupted in Pakistan in the hours before Bhutto's funeral started, with at least nine people reported killed and banks, train stations and cars torched. Bhutto's body arrived in the hours before dawn at Garhi-Khuda Baksh after a long journey by plane, helicopter and ambulance. The opposition leader's family -- her husband Asif Ali Zardari and three children -- accompanied the body aboard a Pakistani Air Force C-130 transport plane to Sukkor but traveled by bus from there to Larkana and on to Garhi-Khuda Baksh. Another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, told CNN on Friday that he had planned to attend Bhutto's funeral, but was advised not to by Zardari, who cited security concerns. The prime minister's office has launched a judicial inquiry and the Ministry of the Interior is setting up a police inquiry, according to Information Minister Nisar Memon. Memon said no decision had been made to postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for January 8. Bhutto, who was campaigning for the elections, had completed an election rally and was leaving the rally site, Rawalpindi's Liaquat Bagh Park, at the time of the attack.  What impact could Bhutto have had in Pakistan? Â» . Her father and former prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in the same northern city in 1979. As a shocked Pakistan absorbed the news of Bhutto's death, authorities called for calm and asked residents to stay inside. In Sindh province, where Karachi is located, police said demonstrators had burned a dozen banks, set two train stations on fire, along with three trains. Since Thursday, 240 vehicles have been burned. Because of the violence, paramilitary forces in Sindh were told to ""shoot on sight"" anyone causing civil disturbances, a spokesman for the Pakistan Rangers said. But by Friday morning, Pakistani media reported an uneasy calm had spread across the shaken country, now marking a three-day period of mourning declared by President Pervez Musharraf. Bhutto led Pakistan from 1988-1990 and 1993-96, but both times the sitting president dismissed her amid corruption allegations. She was the first female prime minister of any Islamic nation. A terror attack targeting her motorcade in Karachi in October killed 136 people on the day she returned to Pakistan after eight years of self-imposed exile. Bhutto had been critical of what she believed was a lack of effort by President Musharraf's government to protect her.

"(CNN) -- A day after a jubilant first delivery, giant panda Mei Xiang gave birth to a second cub Saturday night, but it was stillborn. Washington's celebrity panda gave birth to the first cub Friday, to the excitement of hordes of fans watching it on public panda cams. The cub, about the size of a stick of butter, appeared to be doing well. So was its mom, who was cradling it in her den at the Smithsonian's National Zoo. ""It is robust, healthy and fully formed,"" the zoo said in a Twitter post Sunday after the cub's first neonatal exam. After the first cub's delivery, zoo officials said there was a 50% chance of a twin being born by Saturday. But the zoo's second baby watch did not end so well. Mei Xiang's second cub arrived at 7:29 p.m. Saturday. She groomed it for 17 minutes before it fell onto the floor of the den, said Pamela Baker-Masson, a spokeswoman for the zoo. ""It lay motionless and made no sound. Throughout, staff could see it visually and hear the first cub squealing, and Mei never set it down,"" she said in a statement. After zoo staff used a device to grab the motionless cub, they realized it had developmental abnormalities and wasn't fully formed. ""It was never alive. A necropsy is under way, and the zoo will provide additional information tomorrow,"" she said. Zoo babies and other intriguing critters . 'Not going to relax' The first cub is doing well, and the zoo is cautiously optimistic it will thrive. ""The cub is nursing & digesting well. It is very active, very vibrant & very pink,"" the National Zoo said Sunday. In another post, the zoo said veterinarians observed that the cub's heart rate was steady and its belly was full. ""They could hear breath sounds from both lungs,"" the zoo said. A year ago, Mei Xiang delivered a female cub that died within days because of lack of oxygen due to underdeveloped lungs. ""After our last experience, and this is such a small cub, I am not going to relax,"" said Dennis Kelly, the zoo's director. ""We're going to be tense for the next two or three months. We have high hopes."" It will take two to three weeks to know the sex of the cub and zoo officials won't name it for 100 days, following Chinese tradition. Third pregnancy . The cubs were conceived through artificial insemination, and it was the third pregnancy for Mei Xiang, 15. The National Zoo says the father is either their own Tian Tian, 15, or the San Diego Zoo's Gao Gao, who is about 23. The National Zoo said it also expects to know the cub's paternity in two to three weeks. All three pandas are on loan from China. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are already the parents of Tai Shan, who was born in 2005 and is now in China, the native region for the endangered animals. Endangered species . American zoo officials are consulting with their Chinese counterparts about panda reproduction and ways to encourage newborns to thrive in captivity. The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species, with an estimated 1,900 in existence. America welcomed its first panda twins in 26 years in July at Zoo Atlanta. The twins were the first for Lun Lun, who has two other offspring at that zoo, and were the product of artificial insemination as well. Their father is Yang Yang, also a resident at Atlanta's zoo. National Zoo experts began watching Mei Xiang a couple of weeks ago. The anticipation peaked when she started cradling objects. Panda twins born at Zoo Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel extended his championship lead to 60 points with a commanding win at Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, claiming victory for the third year in a row at the Marina Bay street circuit and his third successive triumph of this season. The Red Bull star, seeking his fourth consecutive Formula One title, won for the seventh time in 2013. However, as he was after winning at Ferrari's home track Monza, Vettel was booed on the podium following the race. ""Fortunately we keep winning so they've got a reason to boo, but it's not nice,"" the German said. ""As long as they keep booing, we are doing a very good job so that's the way I see it. ""The parade lap was quite nice there were a lot of people cheering. Obviously I didn't give them the most exciting race, but on days like this, I really don't mind."" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner was less happy with the reaction from some of the crowd. ""The boy drove an unbelievable race. What we have witnessed is one of the best drives I've seen him produce in terms of raw pace and what he was able to deliver,"" Horner said. ""So to see a driver, who has put in a performance like that and to not get the reception he deserves, is not sporting. ""He says it doesn't affect him, that he doesn't feel it, and he does have a broad set of shoulders. But he is a human being at the end of the day, and like anyone he has feelings. ""When you've driven your heart out and you are getting that reaction, to me it's not fair and not right."" Vettel's closest title rival, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, battled his way up from seventh on the starting grid to finish second but was 32 seconds adrift in the only night race on the calendar. ""We knew we didn't have the pace, that we had to invent something, and the first opportunity was at the start,"" the two-time world champion said. ""This is a fantastic podium, a second place that feels like a win. Red Bull were too fast all weekend, so we have to congratulate them for a fantastic weekend, and next we have to do better."" Kimi Raikkonen, who will join Alonso at Ferrari next year, overcame a back problem and a starting position of 13th to take the third and final podium place for Lotus. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber had been poised to take fourth place but suffered technical problems in the closing stages and had to retire after slipping down the field. ""We were just trying to get home at that point but then on the last lap we caught fire,"" he said. The Australian was given a lift back to the pits by Alonso, for which both were told off by the stewards -- and Webber will now face a 10-place grid penalty at the next race in South Korea following his third reprimand this season. Webber was frustrated by his car's problems, which were explained by Horner. ""We could see with 12 laps to go that we began to lose water pressure. The water then effectively ran out at which point it is only a matter of time until the engine overheats, which is what happened on the last lap -- it was cruel luck."" Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, who had briefly led after overtaking pole sitter Vettel at the start, came through to take fourth ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton -- who remained third overall. ""The start was quite hairy, I kept the inside clear, but Nico went in too deep,"" Vettel said. ""I was able to get the place back, which was crucial because we had good pace, but then we had the safety car."" Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo, who will replace Webber at Red Bull next year, inexplicably ran into a barrier on lap 25 -- meaning the field closed up again behind Vettel, but the German roared clear again once the safety car departed. The advantage his speed created meant the 26-year-old was able to go to the pits and still come back out in front. ""After that again we had the pace, and the car was incredible, which doesn't happen by accident. It was a pleasure to drive it around this crazy track,"" Vettel said. Ferrari's Felipe Massa was sixth ahead of McLaren duo Jenson Button and Sergio Perez, with Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Force India's Adrian Sutil claiming the other points on offer.","World champion Sebastian Vettel marches towards a fourth consecutive F1 title .

"Santiago de Compostela, Spain (CNN) -- The driver of a train that derailed in northwestern Spain, killing at least 78 people, is under detention and is being investigated for ""a crime,"" the regional police chief said Friday. Investigations into the cause of the crash are still under way, but suggestions that the train was traveling too fast have come to the fore. Police are guarding the hospital bed where the driver was placed in detention Thursday afternoon, Maria Pardo Rios, a spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court, told CNN. Investigators are expected to ask the train driver, who is under formal investigation, more questions on Friday. The case has not yet been turned over by police to judicial authorities, she said. Spain train crash victim: 'It felt like a roller coaster' Galicia regional police chief Jaime Iglesias on Friday confirmed that the driver is under police detention because of ""a crime."" Asked the follow-up question, ""What crime?"" he responded: ""Well ... in connection to the accident, in connection with his recklessness, in connection with causing the accident."" The crash on the outskirts of Santiago de Compostela, a city popular with tourists and Christian pilgrims, late Wednesday shocked the Galician region and the nation. The crumpled wreckage of the eight train cars sent careering onto their sides when the train derailed has now been removed from the tracks, but the grim task of identifying the dead continues. A spokeswoman for the Galician regional government told CNN at least 78 people are confirmed dead and the number could rise to 80. Of the dead, 72 have been identified, she said. A spokeswoman for the department of health in the Galicia region said 81 people are still being treated in hospitals, 31 of them in a critical condition. Of those 31, three are children. Those hospitalized include 31 from Galicia, 38 from other Spanish regions and eight from Argentina, Colombia, Peru, the United States and Britain. The nationalities of four others have not been established. An American woman identified as Ana-Maria Cordoba from Arlington, Virginia, is among the dead. And at least five other U.S. citizens were injured, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf. The unidentified remains will be sent for DNA testing in Madrid, police Superintendent Antonio del Amo said at a news conference Friday. The process could take days or even weeks, he said. Conflicting accounts have emerged in the past two days over the number of people killed and injured. Del Amo explained the confusion by pointing out that the operation was very complex and involved a difficult accident scene. Questions over train's speed . Spanish news agency Efe and national daily El Pais cited sources within the investigation as saying that the driver had said the train was traveling about 190 kilometers per hour (120 mph). Elena Garcia, a spokeswoman for national railway Renfe, on Friday did not disclose the speed the train was traveling on an express track, where cars can move as fast as 250 kph. She did say, though, the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph. Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the ""tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast,"" but that the reasons it was going so fast are not yet known. Workers were using a large crane to remove the train's two engines, one at the front and the other at the rear, from the track Friday morning. The express passenger service was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when it derailed at 8:41 p.m. Wednesday, the state railway said. Security footage revealed how, as the train hurtled around a bend, its cars derailed and slammed on their sides into a concrete support structure for a bridge. Survivor: We looked like the walking dead . Flames burst out of one train car as another car was snapped in half in the crash. Rescue crews and fellow passengers pulled bodies through broken windows and pried open doors as stunned survivors looked on. Stephen Ward, an 18-year-old from Bountiful, Utah, who is in Spain serving on a Mormon religious mission, was one of the lucky ones. Still patched up and wearing a neck brace, he told CNN's ""New Day"" show of his ordeal -- and his relief that he made it out alive and without permanent injury. Ward was writing his journal when he noticed from information on a screen across from him that the train was going ""very, very fast."" ""We went round a sharp turn and all of a sudden you could tell one set of wheels left the rails,"" he said. ""We were just riding on one set of wheels for two or three seconds."" Luggage started falling from the overhead racks ""and then after one or two seconds, you could feel us leave the other set of the tracks and the train rotated about 90 degrees."" Ward blacked out before the train hit the ground, regaining consciousness only as he was being helped out of the train. He registered nothing of the chaos inside and it took him a couple of minutes to grasp that what he was seeing outside was not a dream -- and that people were dead. ""They were helping out other people -- there were bodies, there was screaming, there was smoke."" The survivors looked like the walking dead, he said. ""I've got staples all over my scalp, I was covered in blood. They've scrubbed most of it off me now but everyone was just covered in their own blood and occasionally the blood of others. It was gruesome to say the least."" Ward, who has already fought off a rare intestinal cancer, said he was very thankful to have survived this latest brush with death and he wants to continue his two-year mission in Spain. Another victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like the train was going fast. ""But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal,"" he said, ""And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark. And I hit my head a ton of times, and 10 seconds later I was wedged between seats, and I had people's legs on top of me."" As he waited for rescuers to pull him from the wreckage, he heard other passengers yelling. ""I heard little children screaming. ... I also heard two girls that yelled out, one supporting the other,"" he said. U.S. citizen killed on way to see her son . When the train crashed, Ana-Maria Cordoba was on the way with her husband and their daughter to visit her son, who had been on a pilgrimage in Spain, the Catholic Diocese of Arlington told CNN. Cordoba, who worked for the diocese, was killed, spokesman Michael Donahue said. Her husband and daughter are hospitalized in stable condition, the diocese said. CNN's Houston affiliate KHOU named a couple from the Texas city, Robert and Myrta Fariza, as also being among the injured Americans. According to an image it published of a note apparently posted on the door of their home, Myrta Fariza is in critical condition. Her husband was also injured but is ""recovering well,"" it said. Interim charge d'affaires Luis G. Moreno at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid said it was in touch ""with families of some injured American citizens."" A British citizen was also among the injured, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said. The state rail company, Renfe, stated that 218 passengers were on the manifest. It's not clear how many crew and staff were aboard the train. 'We cry for the victims' Spain's King Juan Carlos and his wife, Queen Sofia, visited a hospital in Santiago de Compostela on Thursday evening to meet some of those who were injured. ""All Spaniards, we are united at this time. ... Really all Spaniards join in the pain of the families of the dead,"" he said. ""We hope that the wounded will recover, little by little."" The royal family canceled all events scheduled for the day out of respect for the day of mourning, the royal household told CNN. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, head of the regional government in Galicia, declared seven days of mourning in the region for victims of the tragedy.

"(CNN) -- Johns Hopkins Hospital is back on top. After spending 21 years as the country's best hospital, according to U.S. News & World Report, Johns Hopkins Hospital relinquished its crown to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in 2012. This year, the roles have reversed yet again. The annual U.S. News & World report evaluates more than 5,000 medical centers across the United States. The rankings consider 16 medical specialties from cancer to surgery to rehabilitation. If a hospital is considered one of the best in at least six specialties, it earns a spot on the coveted Honor Roll list. This year, 18 hospitals across the country made the Honor Roll. The top 10 are: . 1. Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore . 2. Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston . 3. Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota . 4. Cleveland Clinic in Ohio . 5. UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles . 6. Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago . 7. (tie) New York-Presbyterian University Hospital of Columbia and Cornell, New York . 7. (tie) UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco . 9. Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston . 10. UPMC-University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania . Northwestern Memorial Hospital made the biggest jump on the list, rising six spaces from No. 12, while Barnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University in St. Louis had the largest loss, dropping nine spots. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia made the Honor Roll list for the first time. The University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers in Ann Arbor fell off the list, although they still ranked for some specialties. Don't dismiss a hospital just because it doesn't appear on the Honor Roll. For example, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston didn't make the honor roll, but is ranked No. 1 for cancer treatment. Similarly, the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York is ranked best for orthopedics. The Cleveland Clinic made the top of the list for cardiology and heart surgery, while Johns Hopkins Hospital led the rankings for neurology and neurosurgery. New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Cleveland all have more than one Honor Roll hospital on the list. U.S. News & World Report also released its children's hospital rankings; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia came in at No. 1. Choosing a hospital that best fits your needs depends on factors like proximity and the severity of your condition.

"(CNN) -- Falkland Islands lawmakers say they won't back down in the face of Argentina's efforts to claim the South Atlantic territory. Residents of the islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas, voted earlier this month to remain under British rule. That leaves no room for debate, lawmakers from the islands wrote in a letter to the United Nations published online Monday. ""The referendum result makes it clear that we have no desire to be governed by Argentina,"" they wrote. ""Continued harassment of our economic development and intimidation of those who want to do business with us and invest in the islands will not change this fact. The more Argentina presses our small community, the harder will be our resolve."" Argentina's president calls Falklands vote 'parody' But Argentina's top officials and supporters in many Latin American countries have a different take. They argue that the referendum was invalid and have decried the United Kingdom for pushing a colonialist approach onto the territory. ""It is as if a consortium of occupiers had voted on whether to continue illegally occupying a building,"" Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said earlier this month. ""The results were fixed."" Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and other Latin American leaders are scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other U.N. officials over the matter. The meetings have drawn the ire of the Falkland Islands government. ""Mr. Timerman's frantic efforts to lobby the international community to ignore our voice strikes us here as the diplomacy of desperation,"" Falkland Islands Assembly member Gavin Short said in a written statement. The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British Overseas Territories and have been under British rule since 1833. Falkland Islanders vote to stay British . The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain says its civil and military losses amounted to 255. For more than a year, renewed rhetoric between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch, with both sides accusing each other of colonialism. Prince William's military deployment to the islands last year further fueled tensions, drawing sharp criticism from Argentinian officials. The British government accuses Argentina of trying to coerce island residents by intimidating those involved in fishing and oil exploration and trying to isolate the remote islands by limiting access by sea. Located about 480 kilometers (298 miles) east of the tip of South America, the Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources, including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry. About 1,600 people were eligible to vote in the referendum earlier this month, officials said. Asked whether they wanted to remain a British Overseas Territory, more than 99% of Falkland Islands voters who cast ballots said yes, according to a government spokesman. Just three people voted no, spokesman Darren Christie said. Pictures at the polls showed some residents of the islands draped in Union flags as they cast their votes. Cars displayed banners that read, ""We're British and proud."" A parade honoring British heritage marked the start of voting Sunday. The vote drew praise from British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""It's the clearest possible result there could be,"" he said, ""and the fact is that the Falkland Islands may be thousands of miles away, but they are British through and through, and that is how they want to stay."" CNN's Dana Ford and Laura Smith-Spark and journalist Ivan Perez Sarmenti contributed to this report.","Lawmakers: ""The more Argentina presses...the harder will be our resolve""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Nicolas Cage and his ex-girlfriend agreed on a financial settlement to end a lawsuit that she filed against the actor over his promise to give her the home where she raised his son. Christina Fulton's lawyer would not disclose the terms of the deal, but she called it ""mutually satisfying"" for both sides. When a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, who was escorting Cage out of the courthouse Tuesday afternoon, said to him ""Long day, huh?"" the actor grunted and said ""Yeah."" Cage, Fulton and their lawyers spent much of the day mediating the case in the chambers of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Teresa Sanchez-Gordon. At one point, Judge Sanchez-Gordon walked into the courthouse hallway to consult with Fulton and her lawyers, with reporters standing nearby. It was the only public clue that a large sum of cash was about to change hands, although the amount is secret. Fulton, the mother of Cage's 20-year-old son, filed her $13 million lawsuit two years ago, accusing Cage of breaking his promise to let her keep the Hollywood home where she raised Weston Cage. Although she is still living in the home, she faces eviction since Cage allowed it to go into foreclosure, she said in a recent CNN interview. It was not revealed whether the lawsuit settlement would allow her to keep the house. A huge federal tax debt and the falling value of his investments caused Cage to lose several other homes in the past two years. Their son was placed on a psychiatric hold in a Los Angeles hospital for several days last week after a violent incident on a Hollywood sidewalk. Fulton said the resolution of her lawsuit clears the way for her to seek a conservatorship of her son. The mother claims he needs special psychiatric care that he has not gotten since he moved out of her home after he turned 18. Weston Cage issued a statement through his father's lawyer last week saying he didn't want ""anything to do with my mother."" ""Any problems that I have ever had is because of the relationship that I had with my mother,"" his statement said. That drew a quick retort from Fulton: ""My son is under a spell. He's under a trance. Weston would say whatever his dad wants him to say."" She suggested that Cage's lawyer solicited it from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. On Tuesday, Fulton said she would not be deterred from seeking control over her son. ""The right parent is not the most popular,"" Fulton said. Earlier, Fulton called the quote, she called it ""an absolute disgrace,"" suggesting that Cage's lawyer solicited a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.","The settlement was ""mutually satisfying,"" Christina Fulton's lawyer says .
