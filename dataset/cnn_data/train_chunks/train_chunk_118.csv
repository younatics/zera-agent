"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- The Australian editor of a Myanmar newspaper was ordered to remain in jail after a court hearing in Yangon Thursday. Officials revealed at the hearing that Ross Dunkley, the editor of the Myanmar Times, faces charges related to torturing and drugging a woman. Dunkley was arrested in early February. At the time, authorities said he faced immigration charges. At the hearing Thursday, authorities added the drug and torture charges stating that Myanmar law dictates that any foreigner who faces criminal charges always faces additional immigration charges. The woman making the allegations against Dunkley was at the hearing, and said the editor gave her a drug on two occasions that hampered her memory. On the second time, the woman said she jumped out of Dunkley's car to escape. Dunkley denied all charges and requested to be released on bond, which was denied. But in a strange twist, the woman told the judge that she wanted to drop her allegations and withdraw the case. ""The woman who had made allegations of physical assault against Mr. Dunkley told the court that she wanted to withdraw her complaint,"" David Armstrong, chairman of Post Media Ltd. and a friend of Dunkley's who is serving as his spokesman, said in a statement. ""She admitted that she made allegations during the hearing that she had not made in her initial police interview."" A judge asked her to consider her request and scheduled another hearing for March 3. Officials from the Australian Embassy in Myanmar attended the hearing, Armstrong said. Myanmar Times is one of a few newspapers owned and run by a foreigner in the nation. Dunkley's arrest comes amid a business dispute with the paper's local partner. ""I cannot say for sure that the cause behind Ross' arrest was driven by business dispute because I was not with him in Myanmar,"" said Armstrong. ""But what I can say, all the troubles came to Ross at an odd timing as there was a business negotiation with his local partner going on.""","Ross Dunkley was arrested in early February .

"Washington (CNN) -- The second-highest-ranking diplomat at the embassy of Myanmar in Washington has defected and wants to seek asylum in the United States. In a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton obtained by CNN, Deputy Chief of Mission Kyaw Win said he had ""no choice"" but to leave his post in protest over human rights abuses and fraudulent elections. He said he is formally seeking asylum for himself and his family because he is afraid for their lives. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland confirmed the State Department received a letter but declined to comment further about private diplomatic correspondence. Win's move is a setback for the regime in Myanmar, which held its first elections in 20 years in November. The vote drew fire from critics who said it was aimed at creating a facade of democracy. The regime had refused to allow international monitors or journalists into Myanmar for the vote but has argued the elections constitute an end to military rule and merit an easing of international sanctions. Win wrote in the letter he had held out hope for democratic reforms throughout his 31-year career, but lost confidence after last year's widely criticized elections, which largely left the military junta in control. As such, he said, he could not in good conscience continue working for the government. ""The truth is that senior military officials are consolidating their grip on power and seeking to stamp out the voices of those seeking democracy, human rights and individual liberties. Oppression is rising and war against our ethnic cousins is imminent,"" he wrote. As a high-ranking diplomat, Win maintained ties with pro-democracy Burmese activists in Washington. In the letter he talked about the balance he had to strike between reaching out to the opposition and answering to his government. He also urged the United States to set up an international council of inquiry to investigate human rights violations in Myanmar and calls for the U.S. to implement targeted sanctions against the government and its ""cronies that serve to keep them in power."" He said he fears returning to the country because his efforts to improve bilateral relations with the United States have been continually rejected and ""resulted in my being deemed dangerous by the government."" Win also warned about threats made to pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Price laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who traveled outside Yangon this week for the first time since she was freed from house arrest last November. The government warned her against engaging in political activities and issued a thinly veiled threat in a state-run newspaper that her planned first tour outside the city since her release from house arrest seven months ago could spark riots and chaos, as they did when she traveled the countryside in 2003. In his letter, Win mentions Suu Kyi's travel, warning the threats against her ""must be taken seriously."" The Obama administration has shifted from a longtime policy of isolation of Myanmar in favor of engagement, with little success. Last week Derek Mitchell, the nominee to be U.S. special envoy to Myanmar, said the United States is prepared to have a positive relationship with the country and would seek better international coordination in encouraging democratic reform there. Mitchell was critical of the regime's claims to have made a transition to civilian rule after last year's elections, saying at his Senate confirmation hearing that ""Burma remains a country at war with itself and distrustful of others."" ""Burma is the poorest country in Southeast Asia and a source of great concern and potential instability in the region,"" he said.","CNN obtained a letter from diplomat Kyaw Win to U.S. secretary of state .

"(Health.com) -- People who carry the genital herpes virus but have no visible symptoms -- and may not even be aware they're infected -- are still capable of spreading the virus about 10% of the time, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. An estimated 16% of U.S. adults are infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), which can cause bumps, blisters, or sores on the genitals and surrounding areas, along with pain and itching. But only about 10% to 25% of these people know they carry the virus. While some infected people have frequent outbreaks, most never have symptoms and others have just one or two flare-ups. Previous research has shown that people infected with HSV-2 can pass the virus to someone else through genital contact even if they don't have symptoms. The new study -- the largest of its kind to date -- helps quantify that risk, says Christine Johnston, M.D., one of the study's authors and an acting assistant professor of medicine at the University of Washington, in Seattle. ""A lot of times people are diagnosed with HSV-2 by an antibody test and they don't know what to do with that information,"" Johnston says. ""Now I think we have a number that we can tell people."" Health.com: Top 10 myths about safe sex and sexual health . The study included 498 adults with healthy immune systems who had a diagnosis of genital herpes or who tested positive for HSV-2. Every day for at least 30 days, the participants inspected themselves for symptoms and collected a swab of genital secretions, which were stored and later tested in a lab. The 410 people with a history of herpes symptoms were found to be actively ""shedding"" the virus on 20% of the days for which they collected swabs, compared with 10% of days for those who had never experienced symptoms. The symptom-free people released the same amount of virus when they were shedding as the symptomatic people did when they weren't experiencing an outbreak. (The amount of virus increased if symptoms were present.) The 10% figure is an average, Johnston notes; some people will shed the virus more frequently, while others will shed it less often. ""People will interpret the risk very differently,"" she adds. ""Some people will feel like 10% is a lot and some people will feel like 10% is a little."" Health.com: 28 days to a healthier relationship . ""[The study] just begs the point that safe sex is important, and you had better know who your partner is,"" says Richard D. Whitley, M.D., a past president of the Infectious Disease Society of America and a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Whitley is a leading expert on herpes but was not involved in the current study. Everyone should know whether they have HSV-2, Whitley says. Aside from the risk of unwittingly infecting sexual partners, pregnant women with no symptoms can pass on the virus to their babies with devastating consequences for the newborn, including death. (The risk of transmission is as high as 30% to 50% if the mother is infected during her third trimester.) In addition, HSV-2 infection can cause complications in people who have weakened immune systems due to chronic disease, and it can increase a person's likelihood of contracting HIV, Whitley says. Health.com: What to do if your partner refuses to wear a condom . People with HSV-2 can protect their partners from contracting the virus by using male or female condoms during sex, and by taking virus-suppressing drugs. Each measure reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to a sex partner by about half. Some people with herpes take antiviral drugs for years, while others just use them periodically -- for example, when they're starting a new relationship or anticipating a high-pressure situation. (Stress can up the risk of a herpes outbreak.) ""It really is a very personal decision for patients,"" Johnston says.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Indian officials welcomed the top leader of Myanmar's military junta Sunday in a visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties between the neighboring countries. Gen. Than Shwe is on a five-day trip to India, where he is scheduled to tour sacred Buddhist sites, greet Indian officials at a ceremonial reception in the presidential palace and visit the shrine to Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi before holding talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In 1951, the two nations signed what they called a ""treaty of friendship,"" and over the past few years, bilateral trade has soared to almost $1 billion, according to Indian officials. Several Indian companies have invested in Myanmar's energy sector. And India's main space agency has helped set up a data-processing center in Yangon for remote-sensing applications, India's external affairs ministry says. The visit comes several days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged India and other countries in the region to push Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to comply with UN human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements. ""It is critical that Burma hear from you, its neighbors,"" she said in a speech at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional meeting. Clinton described life in Myanmar as ""dangerous"" for the country's inhabitants and urged other nations to push for democratic reforms there. ""We would encourage India and other countries to send a clear message to Burma that it needs to change its course,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. The military general's itinerary also includes tours of the India's information-technology hub in Hyderabad and the industrial center in Jamshedpur. His visit is the second by a top junta administrator in a year.","Gen. Than Shwe is on a five-day trip to India .

"(CNN) -- The Myanmar government will ""seriously consider"" accepting observers from neighboring countries to monitor elections taking place in April, a regional organization said Tuesday. In a meeting Tuesday with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, President Thein Sein said Myanmar would consider allowing observers from the association to watch the elections. ""The two leaders agreed that such a move will boost transparency, which will add to the international goodwill that Myanmar had attracted so far,"" the association said in a statement. Thein Sein met with ASEAN's Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. The 10-member association is comprised of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Its goal is to promote economic growth and regional stability. The international community has applauded recent political reforms in Myanmar, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals have begun loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. After boycotting elections in 2010, the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party will participate in the April by-elections. Suu Kyi registered last month to run for a parliamentary seat in Kawhmu after the regime agreed to negotiate with an ethnic rebel group and pardoned hundreds of political prisoners. Her party, the National League for Democracy, is putting up candidates for all 48 parliamentary seats that are being contested. Suu Kyi and her supporters, as well as international political leaders, have urged Thein Sein's government to ensure that the elections are carried out in a free and fair manner. Representatives from ASEAN allowed into Myanmar in 2010 did not carry out thorough monitoring of the elections that year, said Aung Saw, editor of the Myanamar exile magazine Irrawaddy, which is based in Thailand. ""They were just taken to a few polling stations, that's it,"" he said. Western governments have made a number of gestures in recognition of Myanmar's recent political changes -- the United States announced in January that it would exchange ambassadors with the country for the first time since 1988. But the April by-elections are seen as a key gauge of the government's commitment to reform. The international attention trained on the elections may prompt the Myanmar government to allow more rigorous monitoring this time around, Aung Saw said. He noted that the Thailand-based Asian Network for Free Elections, which aims to promote and support democratization, is an example of a regional body that could provide independent election monitoring. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Myanmar is due to hold by-elections in April after a series of political reforms .

"(CNN) -- European foreign ministers said Monday that they would loosen travel restrictions on senior members of the Myanmar government in recognition of the Southeast Asian country's recent efforts at political reform after decades of military rule. Describing the Myanmar government's program of changes as ""remarkable,"" the foreign ministers said they had decided to suspend a visa ban on the country's president, vice presidents, Cabinet members and speakers of Parliament. The European Union ministers met in Brussels to discuss Myanmar and other issues. In recent weeks, the Myanmar regime has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, approved the participation of the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in April elections and pledged to pursue a peace deal with an ethnic rebel group. Western governments have applauded the effort, with the United States announcing this month that it would exchange ambassadors with Myanmar for the first time since 1988. That came after a visit to the country last month by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the first top U.S. diplomat in the nation in more than five decades. Top European officials have followed in Clinton's footsteps, including the foreign ministers of Britain and France. And on Tuesday, Pakistan said that President Asif Ali Zardari was leaving for a two-day visit to Myanmar, where he would meet government leaders and Suu Kyi. Myanmar has been ruled by a military junta since 1962, but the generals are loosening their grip on the country after coming under criticism for their human rights record and as the economy suffered from economic sanctions. Thein Sein, a former general, became president in March 2011 after elections that were criticized by democracy activists. But his rapid introduction of reforms has raised hopes of a lasting improvement in civil liberties within the country. The EU ministers on Monday called the suspension of the visa ban on Sein and other officials ""a first step"" that could be followed by a ""further easing"" of restrictions in the coming months. The lifting of more restrictive measures is dependent on the Myanmar government following through on its commitment to ""continue and complete these reforms,"" the ministers said, ""notably by the unconditional release of the remaining political prisoners within the next few months and by the free and fair conduct"" of the parliamentary by-elections in April. The ministers also drew attention to the commitment by Sein's government to address ""the ethnic conflicts through an inclusive political process."" The government earlier this month reached a cease-fire with the Karen National Union. The largely Christian Karen have been fighting in the country's eastern jungles for greater rights since the nation's independence from Britain in 1948. Karen leaders and activists said when the cease-fire was signed that it was too early to gauge whether peace would take hold. Other ethnic minorities in Myanmar, such as the Shan, are also at odds with the country's government.","EU foreign ministers praise Myanmar's ""remarkable"" political reforms .

"(CNN) -- Oxfam will relocate workers and scale back operations in South Sudan's Upper Nile state following a surge of violence along the border with Sudan, the international aid organization said Saturday. The charity has been providing clean water and sanitation for 64,000 people in the Upper Nile state. But Oxfam said it feared for its workers' safety after they reported bombing and heavy artillery over the course of several hours Friday. ""They have witnessed planes flying overhead and a build-up of South Sudanese troops over the past few days,"" Oxfam said in a statement. The aerial attacks in Upper Nile state follow the bombing Thursday of the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan's oil-rich Unity state, which prompted an international outcry. Tensions have been rising since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in July. The Sudanese army says it is fighting rebel groups in the border region. The organization's relocation of 22 staff, mostly engineers and health workers, from Upper Nile state will mean those who have fled face further hardship, it said. It estimates 50,000 have crossed the border from Sudan's Blue Nile state since August -- and thousands more are still coming. ""They have fled attacks and walked for days to reach a place they thought would be safe -- but instead they are now facing more violence,"" said Sanjay Awasthi, head of Oxfam in South Sudan. ""In desperate need of food, water and shelter, the refugees now receive virtually nothing when they arrive."" EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton urged the Sudanese Armed Forces to ""put an immediate halt to aerial bombings in the border areas"" in a statement Saturday. Ashton ""strongly condemns the aerial bombardment carried out by the Sudanese armed forces in Upper Nile and Unity States in South Sudan,"" including the attack on the Yida camp, a spokeswoman said. ""Such attacks represent a dangerous escalation of the situation and serve to increase tension at a time when Sudan and South Sudan need to reach a negotiated solution on outstanding issues."" The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called Friday for an ""independent, thorough and credible investigation"" into the bombing at Yida. The camp houses about 20,000 refugees who have fled the violence in the states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. Those two states, along with the Nuba Mountain region, straddle Sudan and South Sudan's ethnic and political lines. Although these territories are geographically part of Sudan, the population has faced ""exclusion, marginalization and discriminatory practices that have resulted in their opposition to the Sudanese government,"" according to the U.N. human rights office. The two sides fought a bitter, bloody civil war over decades that cost as many as 2 million lives. Before the independence of South Sudan in July, human rights monitors expressed concerns that long-standing grievances could end in violence consuming the region again.

"(Health.com) -- Women who take fish-oil supplements during pregnancy are just as likely to experience postpartum depression as those who don't, and their babies' minds don't appear to develop more quickly, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. However, the supplements do appear to reduce the risk of preterm birth, a benefit seen in earlier studies. Previous research has suggested that eating more fish during pregnancy may help stave off postpartum depression and promote cognitive development in young children. Both fish and fish-oil supplements contain the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is believed to play an important role in brain function. Health.com: Supplements for depression: what works, what doesn't . ""It may be that there are certain other things about eating fish, not just the fish oil, that [are] beneficial,"" says Dr. Cheryl Cipriani, M.D., an infancy specialist and professor of medicine at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, in Dallas. The overall diet -- or even the lifestyle -- of pregnant women who eat a lot of fish may explain the benefits seen in earlier studies, says Cipriani, who was not involved in the new research. In the new study, the largest of its kind to date, researchers in Australia randomly assigned about 2,400 pregnant women to take 800 milligrams of DHA per day or placebo capsules containing vegetable oil. The rates of postpartum depression six months after the women gave birth were not measurably different in the DHA group (10 percent) versus the placebo group (11 percent). Health.com: How omega-3 fatty acids may relieve depression . Nor did the children of the women in the two groups score any differently at age 18 months on a series of tests designed to measure cognitive, motor, and communication skills. (Only about 700 children participated in this phase of the study.) As in previous studies, women taking DHA supplements were less likely to give birth prematurely. And that may be enough of a reason for pregnant women to take them, says Dr. Emily Oken, M.D., an associate professor of population medicine at Harvard Medical School, in Boston. ""I think it's clear from the studies that [supplements] are safe and seem to have benefits for the prevention of preterm birth,"" says Oken, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""There's still reasonable evidence to suggest that it's helpful for women to make sure they're getting the recommended amount of DHA during pregnancy, which is currently 200 milligrams a day."" DHA supplements may be most useful to women who are at risk of delivering early, such as those who have already had a preterm baby, are carrying twins, or who conceived via in vitro fertilization. Preterm birth itself has been linked to worse cognitive outcomes in children and an increased risk of postpartum depression, Oken points out. Health.com: Foods to boost your mood . The findings aren't likely to be the last word on DHA during pregnancy. Experts say the study had several limitations that will need to be addressed in future research. For instance, the study may not have been large enough to detect subtle yet meaningful differences between the two groups of mothers and children, says Dr. Charles Bauer, M.D., a professor of pediatrics, ob-gyn, and psychology at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. ""They would have had to have a huge number of people to show differences, and it would have had to be a dramatic difference,"" he says. In addition, the children in the study may have been too young to exhibit any DHA-related differences in cognitive development. Speech -- a key aspect of development -- is still rudimentary at age 18 months, Bauer notes. (The study authors plan to do follow-up tests when the children are 4 years old.) Health.com: How fish oil supports heart health . Finally, many women were excluded from the study because they were already taking DHA supplements, which might have skewed the results. ""It may have been that women at higher risk for depression, for example, had chosen to take supplements,"" Oken says. Despite the unanswered questions, experts stress that everyone -- not just pregnant women -- should get plenty of DHA in their diet, preferably from fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, trout, and sardines, rather than supplements. DHA is ""essential for multiple systems,"" including cardiovascular and neurological systems, Bauer says.

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai asked their respective parties to shun violence on Friday, a rare expression of unity between the political rivals. It came after disturbances Sunday between Mugabe's Zanu PF party and Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change in Chitungwiza near the capital of Harare. About 30 MDC supporters were injured after suspected Zanu PF militia had disrupted a rally where Tsvangirai was scheduled to speak. The two men have different takes on who might be to blame for the violence. Tsvangirai accused the police chief, Augustine Chihuri, an ally of Mugabe, of asking police to protect only Zanu PF supporters. Mugabe defended police, saying MDC had barred officers from attending its events. But both want citizens to embrace peace. ""I am happy the president is with us,"" Tsvangirai said. ""I have brought before him the issues of violence. I have brought before him the blood unnecessarily shed in our communities simply because of one is Zanu PF and the other is MDC,"" he said. ""I told him about the Chitungwiza violence. ... The police watched and to date there is no single arrest."" Speaking to the leadership of Zanu PF and MDC, Mugabe said, ""Let us walk the talk of peace. This is our sincere plea from our hearts."" He added, ""People must hold their meetings freely. Don't stand in the way of those who are holding a meeting."" But the 87-year-old president, who has ruled Zimbabwe since its independence in 1980, said the level of violence in his country was worrying. He said he has been discussing the issue with Tsvangirai at their weekly meetings. The men, now partners in a fragile coalition government, said they want Zimbabwe's next elections to be peaceful. In 2008, political violence ahead of the presidential run-off resulted in Tsvangirai pulling out, citing violent attacks and intimidation by the militia of Mugabe's faction. Mugabe won the election but regional leaders did not recognize the polls and called for a coalition government. Since then, violence has decreased. But talk of upcoming elections has resulted in renewed clashes.","Mugabe is the longtime leader of Zimbabwe .

"(CNN) -- The selection of a Sudanese military commander to head the Arab League monitoring mission in Syria is a ""farce"" because of his government's actions in the embattled Darfur region, a Syrian opposition group said Wednesday. Lt. Gen. Mohamed Ahmed Mustafa al-Dabi has been named to chair the monitoring mission, designed to see whether the Bashar al-Assad regime is taking appropriate measures to end more than nine months of civil strife across the country. Al-Dabi and his monitoring team arrived in the Syrian city of Homs on Tuesday, and the observers were fanning out to other trouble spots Wednesday, including Idlib, Daraa and Hama. The objections to al-Dabi's presence appeared in a statement from the Doctors Local Committee in Damascus. The remarks showed up in a post on the website of the Local Coordinating Committees of Syria, a major opposition activist network. ""The appointment of al-Dabi taints the Arab League's efforts and characterizes it as nothing more than a political farce, causing little help but much harm to the situation in Syria. We call for a fair, independent observer mission to be allowed full and unrestricted access to all areas of Syria. It would be more appropriate, in our view, in the circumstances of the current conflict, for the United Nations to be mandated to conduct the monitoring mission,"" the statement said. Rebels in Darfur have fought government forces and allied militiamen, such as the Janjaweed, since 2003. The United Nations reported as many as 300,000 people were killed and there has been widespread displacement over the years in Darfur, located in western Sudan. The International Criminal Court, investigating genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur, issued arrest warrants for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, then-government minister Ahmed Harun, Janjaweed leader Ali Kushayb, and Defense Minister Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein. It issued summonses to appear for Abdallah Banda and Saleh Jerbo, two rebel leaders accused of spearheading an attack that killed 12 African Union peacekeepers. An Arab League source told CNN that the claims against al-Dabi ""come with no evidence. "" But the Syrian opposition statement said al-Dabi was a director of Sudan's military intelligence ""during the early years"" of al-Bashir's ""salvation regime."" ""He was later appointed as head of Foreign Intelligence before he returned in 1996 to the military as the Deputy Chief of General Staff. It was during this time that Al-Dabi is accused of allowing or at the very least, turning a blind eye, to mass atrocities being committed in Darfur,"" the statement said. ""Although not the subject of an investigation by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, his role as the deputy head of Foreign Intelligence, raises questions as to his knowledge of mass atrocities in Darfur and consequently his role as the head of an investigative commission tasked with identifying whether the al-Assad regime is responsible for committing crimes against humanity."" The opposition movement says there is widespread ""incredulity"" and ""condemnation"" over the appointment because of his roles in Sudan. ""Al-Dabi is now tasked with probing war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed against Syria victims. It is enough that the Syrian victims have had to wait this long for an observer mission, with calls being made as early as April 2011. Now over 30 of the members of the Arab League observer mission are of Sudanese origin,"" the statement said. Abdel Karim Rihawi, the head of Syrian Human Rights League based in Cairo, also complained to the Arab League about al-Dabi and the Darfur connection. ""This is not acceptable and could jeopardize the credibility of the mission and its role,"" Rihawi said. The Enough Project, a group devoted to fighting genocide and crimes against humanity and focused on crises in several African nations, has called the choice ""perplexing."" ""When he served as Sudan's former head of Military Intelligence and when he oversaw implementation of the Darfur Security Arrangement, alleged war crimes including genocide were committed on his watch,"" Enough Project Sudan analyst Omer Ismail said last week.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo arrived Tuesday in Libya following the weekend capture of Moammar Gadhafi's son and the late Libyan leader's intelligence chief, the ICC said. Moreno-Ocampo said that Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and Abdullah al-Senussi -- suspects in crimes against humanity -- ""must face justice."" Moreno-Ocampo said Libya was obliged to cooperate with the court under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970. ""This is not a military or political issue; it is a legal requirement,"" he said. Libyan authorities have said they want to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, in Libya. But Moreno-Ocampo suggested the matter was not settled. ""The issue of where the trials will be held has to be resolved through consultations with the court. In the end, the ICC judges will decide. There are legal standards which will have to be adhered to,"" he said. Moreno-Ocampo and ICC deputy prosecutor Fatou Bensouda are due to meet with Libyan authorities to ""understand their plans moving ahead,"" the prosecutor said.

"(CNN) -- Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has agreed to end her nearly three-week hunger strike and receive medical treatment, her spokeswoman said Tuesday. Tymoshenko, who has been on hunger strike since April 20, will be transferred to a hospital in the eastern city of Kharkov by Wednesday, according to spokeswoman Marina Soroka. Tymoshenko is serving a seven-year prison sentence after she was convicted last year of abuse of authority. She went on hunger strike last month to draw attention to ""violence and lack of rights"" in her country after she said she was beaten unconscious in prison. The prosecutor said his office investigated her claim of abuse and found no proof to substantiate her allegations, but European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said last month that the Ukrainian Ombudsperson's Office confirmed the report. Ashton called on Ukraine ""to examine promptly and impartially any complaints of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also expressed concern over Tymoshenko's treatment, saying in a statement last week that photos released by the Ombudsperson's Office ""further call into question the conditions of her confinement."" In October, a Ukrainian court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing overpriced gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to the seven-year prison term. The prosecutor said the gas deals inflicted damages to the country amounting to more than 1.5 billion hryvnias (almost $190 million at the current exchange rate). The court ruled she must repay the money. Amnesty International has slammed the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005 and December 2007 to March 2010. Clinton also called for the release of Tymoshenko and other members of her government ""and the restoration of their full civil and political rights.""

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Saadi Gadhafi, a son of the deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, secretly tried to travel to Mexico using false documents, Mexico's interior minister said Wednesday. Four people have been implicated in the alleged plot -- a Canadian, a Dane and two Mexicans, said the minister, Alejandro Poire. The arrests of the alleged plotters, which occurred last month, were announced Wednesday. Officials called their efforts ""Operation House Guest."" ""With these actions, the federal government contributes actively to a safe North America,"" said Alejandra Sota, a government spokeswoman. The plan was to provide false documents claiming Mexican nationality for Saadi Gadhafi and his family, and to purchase a number of properties in Mexico for use as safe houses, Poire said. One of the houses was in Bahia de Banderas, a tourist town in western Mexico's Nayarit state, he said. Mexican intelligence detected the alleged plot on September 6, he said. Intelligence agents followed the trail and discovered that Cynthia Ann Vanier, a Canadian who was in direct contact with the Gadhafi family, was the leader of the ring, Poire said. Vanier was arrested on November 10. The next day, authorities arrested Gabriela Davila Huerta o Cueto, a Mexican living in the United States who Poire said was in charge of getting the false documents. Pierre Christian Flemsborg, a Dane, was in charge of logistics, Poire said, and was arrested on November 11. Also arrested was Mexican Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto, who helped obtain the phony documents, Poire said. The suspects face charges that include falsifying documents and opening bank accounts under false identities. According to Poire, the Gadhafis would have entered the country under the following aliases: Daniel Bejar Hanan, Amira Sayed Nader, Moah Bejar Sayed and Sofia Bejar Sayed. Saadi Gadhafi remains in Niger, a landlocked West African nation bordering Libya, to which he fled this year as his father's regime was collapsing. He had offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels in Libya after his father's troops lost control of Tripoli, but appeared later to change his mind. Saadi Gadhafi's lawyer, Nick Kaufman, said he spoke with his client Wednesday. ""There is absolutely no truth whatsoever to the allegation that, since fleeing Libya where his life was in grave danger, Saadi Gaddafi has attempted to flout the restrictive measures placed on him by the international community,"" Kaufman said. The alleged plot, however, would have been hatched while Saadi Gadhafi was still in Libya, before he fled to Niger. Wednesday's announcement appeared to have been spurred by an investigation into the plot by the Canadian newspaper National Post. The newspaper spoke with the CEO of a Canadian security company who said he was involved in the alleged plan to move Saadi and his family to Mexico. Gary Peters, CEO of Can/Aust Security and Investigations International, told the paper that the plan was to be carried out with the approval of the Mexican government, which was to have supplied the documentation. Mexico contradicted that version with its own allegations Wednesday. The National Post article mentioned Varnier, whom it identified as a Canadian consultant who traveled to Libya in July on fact-finding mission with Peters. Two of the men who helped secure the private jet used for the trip were among those arrested with Varnier, the paper reported. The Canadian government confirmed the arrest of a Canadian in connection with the case and said Canadian consular officials in Mexico City and in Ottawa were providing assistance as required. Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou had reaffirmed his country's decision to grant asylum to Saadi Gadhafi, saying he should be allowed to stay and be treated like other Libyan refugees. Libya's National Transitional Council has blasted that stance. A businessman, Saadi Gadhafi ran the Libyan Football Federation before the unrest began. He played soccer for Perugia in Italy for one season. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables posted on WikiLeaks say he had ""scuffles"" with police in Europe. Moammar Gadhafi was killed in Libya on October 20. Another of Moammar Gadhafi's sons, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, was captured after a gun battle in the Libyan desert. Senior Libyan military officials said they believe the potential Gadhafi successor was also trying to make his way to Niger. Saif al-Islam had been on the run since shortly after rebels overran his father's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital in August. The International Criminal Court in Netherlands wants Saif al-Islam for alleged crimes against humanity, including murder allegedly committed during the uprising.

"(CNN) -- Normal service resumed for champion Sebastien Loeb as he began his quest for a ninth straight world rally championship title by taking the overnight lead at the Monte Carlo Rally. Loeb, from France, had been trailing rival Jari-Matti Latvala by 30 seconds going into the final stage of Wednesday's race but the Finn crashed and rolled his Ford, forcing him to retire. Dani Sordo, driving for Mini, took second despite damaging his suspension during the morning stage -- known as a 'special.' The Spaniard is one minute and four seconds behind his French rival. Monte Carlo is the first stop on the world rally championship circuit, which features 13 separate races around the globe and runs until November. Loeb has won a record eight straight titles, all for Citroen, and he was quickest in three of the four specials. His Citroen team-mate Mikko Hirvonen collided with a wall and sustained damage to one of his brakes, while Ford's Petter Solberg decision to use his snow tires meant he ended the day in third place, a second behind Sordo.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama expressed hope Tuesday that the United States and Pakistan can arrive at a ""balanced approach"" to relations as he met with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani for the first time since a string of damaging episodes last year. The talks Tuesday between the two leaders on the sidelines of a large nuclear security summit meeting in Seoul are the highest profile meeting between the two countries since NATO airstrikes on November 26 killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on the Pakistani-Afghan border. The deaths drove relations between Washington and Islamabad to a new low, coming on top of anger over the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden at a compound in Pakistan last May, and continued American drone strikes on targets in the nation. The Pakistani parliament is expected this week to start debating a committee's recommendation that the United States stop drone strikes inside its territory and apologize unconditionally for the November airstrikes. ""There have been times -- I think we should be candid -- over the last several months where those relations have had periods of strains,"" Obama said at the start of the meeting with Gilani. ""But I welcome the fact that the Parliament of Pakistan is reviewing, after some extensive study, the nature of this relationship."" The Parliamentary Committee on National Security, a group of 18 members of parliament responsible for reviewing relations with the United States, made its recommendations in a report to lawmakers last week. ""No overt or covert operations inside Pakistan shall be tolerated,"" the report said. Obama said his expectation was that as a result of the Pakistani review and discussions in the United States, ""That we can achieve the kind of balanced approach that respects Pakistan's sovereignty but also respects our concerns with respect to our national security and our needs to battle terrorists who have targeted us in the past."" Gilani expressed appreciation that Obama had acknowledged the need to respect Pakistani sovereignty and said his government was committed to fighting against extremism. He also said it was important to maintain stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Beyond the meeting Tuesday, there remains much work to be done to mend ties between Washington and Islamabad. Following the fateful border airstrikes in November, the Pakistani government shut down the two NATO supply routes in the country, asked the United States to vacate an air base on its territory and boycotted a conference about the future of Afghanistan. The Pakistani parliamentary report on relations with the United States gave an indication of the lingering discontent among Pakistani officials. Calling on the Pakistani government to ensure that ""the principles of an independent foreign policy"" are observed, the report said that the United States ""must review its footprints in Pakistan."" The three key points it listed in that regard were the cessation of drone strikes inside Pakistani borders, ""no hot pursuit or boots on Pakistani territory,"" and the need for the activities of foreign private security contractors to be ""transparent and subject to Pakistani law."" It demanded an ""unconditional apology from the United States for the unprovoked incident dated 25th-26th November 2011."" It also said that those responsible for the airstrikes should be brought to justice. When lawmakers reconvened Monday, the committee's report was on the agenda, but the speaker did not call it up for debate. The joint session of the parliament must decide whether to act on the recommendations. Hiader Abbas Rizvi, a committee member, said he expected the recommendations to be approved, but not before several days of debate. ""We kept in mind both the angles, domestic demands and the requirement by the international community, while compiling our recommendations,"" Rizvi said. ""We were optimistic, progressive, but of course patriotic Pakistanis at the end while we were compiling the recommendations."" An investigation into the lethal NATO airstrikes in November by Brig. Gen. Stephen Clark on behalf of the United States concluded that Pakistan provoked NATO forces and that distrust between the two parties led to the firefight. Pakistan disputed the findings, saying Clark's report was factually incorrect. There has been a sharp drop in the number of drone attacks in Pakistan since the airstrikes. U.S. officials rarely discuss the CIA's drone program in Pakistan, though privately they have said that the covert strikes are legal and an effective tactic in the fight against extremists. In January, Obama defended the use of drone attacks, saying a ""pinpoint strike"" is ""less intrusive"" on other countries' sovereignty than other military ways to target al Qaeda. He gave no indication that the U.S. policy of ordering drone strikes would change, at least as long as a terrorist threat remains. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Shaan Khan, Nasir Habib and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says the two countries can achieve a 'balanced approach' to relations .

"(CNN) -- A long-time follower of a jailed polygamist sect leader says he has been ex-communicated after admitting to having sex with his wife -- a violation of an order that Warren Jeffs apparently issued from behind bars. Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also dissolved his marriage, the follower told CNN late Friday. The church member spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The report follows news that Texas officials are investigating whether Jeffs violated his prison phone privileges by calling his congregation with orders, according to CNN affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City. Jeffs, leader of the 10,000-member church, is serving a life-plus-20-year term in Texas for sexual assault. He was convicted in early August of the aggravated sexual assaults of a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old girl that Jeffs claimed were his ""spiritual wives."" The television station, citing critics and observers, reported Friday that Jeffs has acted through his brother, Lyle, and at other times spoken directly to his congregation over the phone from prison. He recently banned followers from using bicycles, ATVs, trampolines and children's toys, the station reported. ""Right now, they have all been told that they are not to live as husband and wife,"" Joni Holm, who has many relatives in the church, told the station. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a breakaway Mormon sect that openly practices polygamy in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, as well as on its Yearning For Zion ranch near Eldorado, Texas. The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy more than a century ago. Holm told the station that her brother left the church three weeks ago because of the sex ban. She said he had been a follower of the church for 39 years. ""They're leaving,"" Holm said. ""Groups of them are coming out. We're getting families that are coming out now. It's only going to get worse."" Many members have disavowed Jeffs over his criminal convictions, while others are defending him and casting his conviction on sexual assault charges as an act of persecution. The follower who spoke to CNN said he does not practice polygamy. He added that although he was expelled from the church, his wife has decided to stay with him. His family, he says, is very concerned about the ramifications of her decision. If members have sex, any resulting children will be considered ""sons of perdition,"" Holm said she was told. The parents will also be excommunicated, she said.","Texas officials are investigating whether Warren Jeffs violated prison phone rules .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian authorities have killed dozens of leftist guerrillas in the past day, the nation's defense minister said Wednesday. Operations throughout the country led to the killing of 39 suspected members the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the capture of a dozen others from the rebel group, Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon told reporters. ""This is one of the greatest blows (to the rebel group) in the last five years,"" Pinzon said. One operation near the Venezuelan border led to the killing of 36 suspected rebels and the capture of five others, including a top leader of one faction of the rebel group, he said. The joint military-police operation occurred in the department of Arauca, where over the weekend authorities said rebels killed 11 troops in an attack. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. A mediator said Wednesday that the FARC will begin releasing its 10 remaining government hostages on Monday. ""With much joy and satisfaction we want to inform you that next Monday the FARC will hand over the 10 uniformed people, police and soldiers, that are in their control,"" said Piedad Cordoba, a former senator who has helped coordinate hostage handovers in the past. The hostage release could take two days, Cordoba said. She did not specify where it would take place. In December, the FARC announced the planned release of six national police officers in the group, but later postponed their release because of an alleged militarization in the area where the rebels operate. Journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.","NEW: A mediator says the rebel group will begin releasing 10 hostages Monday .

"(CNN) -- Red Bull have been untouchable for the last two Formula One seasons, but their double world champion driver Sebastian Vettel has warned the team's 2012 car will be slower than last year's model. Vettel, F1's youngest two-time champion having won the drivers' crown in 2010 and 2011, also expects this season's title race to be much tighter, after he took the checkered flag in 11 of 19 grands prix last year. ""Last season the way we incorporated the exhaust was very cleverly devised,"" the 24-year-old told the sport's official website. ""It made the car faster by generating more grip, but it's a thing of the past in 2012 and for now we have to live with it. ""I would say that goes for all the other teams as well. We are looking into ways of getting that grip level back and I am sure we will succeed, although it will take time. Red Bull out to dominate again . ""Of course we hope to do it again this season. My guess is that the performance of the cars will be even closer this year, especially the gap between the front-running teams and the midfield. We will probably even see a few surprises."" If the German could take the championship in 2012, he would join Argentina's Juan Manuel Fangio and compatriot and seven-time title winner Michael Schumacher as the only men to have won the sport's biggest prize three years in a row. ""I wasn't aware that only two drivers have done it,"" he said. ""But as the saying goes, three's a charm, so let's try to do it again this year!"" Vettel will be in distinguished company on the grid when the season begins in Australia next month, with six former world champions competing in the same season for the first time. Alongside him will be Schumacher at Mercedes, McLaren's title-winning British duo of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, Ferrari's two-time winner Fernando Alonso and the returning 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen at Lotus. ""As it has never happened before, it is something very special,"" he said. ""And to be one of those six feels even better. But then again, this is something that points to the past and has nothing to do with the next 20 races, as it doesn't make you any faster. ""It is a new game when we start on the Melbourne grid. Past glory is great to have, but you have to make sure that it reaches into the here and now."" The forthcoming season is scheduled to be the longest in the elite division of motorsport's 52-year history, with 20 races on the calendar. Vettel was not overly concerned by the addition of an extra race, with the U.S. Grand Prix returning in Austin in November, but he felt no further additions should be made to the schedule in the future. ""Twenty races is indeed a huge workload but to be honest whether it's 19 or 20 races doesn't make any real difference. There are few sports with such a long season, so I would suggest that we all just roll up our sleeves. ""I think it will be important to pace yourself cleverly and you will probably have to use the phrase 'thanks, but no thanks' more often. You can't have your finger in every pie, however alluring it may look.""","Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel says the team will not be as quick as last year .

"(CNN) -- ""The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"" is, in a way, a tough game to figure out. On one hand, the ""Zelda"" franchise has provided many hours of enjoyment for fans for 25 years, while chronicling the adventures of everyone's favorite green-hat-wearing elf, Link. This game has that. On the other hand, I was looking for something that was going to advance the franchise in new directions and possibly break some new ground. That didn't happen. ""Skyward Sword"" is full of what we've come to know and love about Link. Maze-like terrain, challenging dungeons, familiar weapons and, of course, the quest to find Zelda. There is little here that we haven't seen before. Epona, Link's trusted horse, has been replaced by a giant bird that carries him to distant locations. Unfortunately, there isn't much challenging or exciting about riding around on a flying bird after you've done it once or twice. (But, since Link is based this time out on a city floating in the sky, trying to ride a horse around could have gotten messy very quickly, I suppose.) I was also confused about where this game falls in the ""Zelda"" timeline. Link appears to be slightly older, but he doesn't have any of his traditional garb or weapons. He is a recruit in the knights' program and, in fact, has to earn his familiar hat and clothing. Contrast that with previous games where Link looks like a kid. Unfortunately, Link also seems to be missing his personality. He is, as always, silent, but really shows no reaction to anything that happens around him. In an early segment, Link is getting bullied but shows no outward emotions. It is Zelda who arrives to chastise the bullies and defend him. Nintendo has said ""Skyward Sword"" lays the foundation for the events in ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,"" but it doesn't feel like a precursor at all. The gameplay is slow, with plenty of moments of inaction. Its pace is almost leisurely as Link goes from one mission or dungeon to the next. There's no sense of urgency, but that does allow players to fully explore without feeling as if they're missing something. Environments are vibrant, with collectibles and creatures lurking around every corner. There is a maze-like quality when you're trying to reach some areas -- with only one path in and one path out. Usually, some puzzle needs to be solved to open the pathway and allow Link to continue. Instead of Navi (""Hey, Listen!""), a mystical creature named Fi acts as sort of an artificial-intelligence program, helping out whenever something new comes up or if a player gets stuck deciding what to do next. Fi lives in the handle of Link's sword and comes out when summoned. She can also evaluate your gameplay and scan the surrounding area for any dangers or monsters. Combat is decidedly different, since the game requires you to use Nintendo's Wii MotionPlus Control. Defeating monsters, or solving some puzzles, requires precise motions to get past obstacles or slice open new pathways. This was a welcome change from straight button-pushing and injected a new level of challenge into combat. The nunchucks attached to the Motion Plus Control act as your shield during combat and also help with special moves such as rolling or shield-bashing your enemies. The two controllers together work very well and made the combat enjoyable without making it tiring. In the end, ""The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"" is an underwhelming game that mostly sticks to the successful path that Link has been on for the past 25 years. This is one series that can keep fans happy with its familiar concepts and characters. But the new game's minor tweaks don't inject new energy into the franchise. I wonder where Nintendo can take ""Zelda"" next without considering some radical changes. ""The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"" is available now in Europe, North America, Japan and Australia. It is a Wii exclusive title and is rated E10+ for Everyone 10 years old and older due to animated blood, comic mischief and fantasy violence. This review was done with a review copy of the game.","""Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"" doesn't offer much that's new .

"(CNN) -- A Michigan high school student athlete with Down syndrome might get to keep playing sports during his senior year despite his age. The Michigan High School Athletic Association said Monday that its representative council had approved a proposal for a vote by member schools that would change the group's constitution to allow for a waiver of its maximum age limit under ""narrowly defined"" circumstances. Under current rules, students who turn 19 before September 1 are not allowed to compete. The rule is intended to prevent the possibility of injury or competitive advantage from an older, more developed athlete playing against younger students. Eric Dompierre, the Michigan student with Down syndrome, turned 19 in January. He was held back in kindergarten because of his disability. The athletic association did not mention Dompierre by name, but it released a statement that was clearly meant to deflect criticism over the way it has handled the question of his participation. Ballots will be mailed this week, the athletic association said, and schools will have two weeks to return them. ""The representative council does not advance proposals it does not want the membership to support, and an affirmative vote by schools is being specifically requested on this proposal,"" it said. The specific wording of the proposal was not immediately available. It is expected to be posted on the group's website no later than May 14. A two-thirds majority is required to change the organization's constitution. Dompierre has played sports with other children in Ishpeming, Michigan, since he was in elementary school. ""We didn't know how far he'd go, how many coaches would keep him on the team,"" said Dean Dompierre, Eric's father. When he got to high school, Dompierre was invited to keep playing. Now a junior, he is on the Ishpeming High School football and basketball teams. He attends every practice and works out with the other players and sometimes plays a few minutes at the end of the game. During this season's basketball playoffs, Dompierre brought the house down. After maintaining a nice lead, the team put Dompierre in the game and he hit a three-point shot against rival Negaunee High School. ""I was on the left side behind the three-point line and they passed me the ball,"" Dompierre said, smiling as he recounted the game. ""I heard the fans, including my mom crying."" Dompierre's father was in the stands with his camera and captured the amazing reaction. ""I videotaped the crowd on the other side and it was made up of mostly Negaunee fans, including their student section, and they were all on their feet cheering for Eric."" The same thing happened when Dompierre kicked his first extra point for the football team toward the end of a game two years ago. ""I was amazed that he even had the opportunity to kick, and then when he did it, I thought woo-hoo! And then watching the kids react, they carried him off the field; it was just one of the best moments,"" recalls Eric's mother, Jill Dompierre. For the past two years, the Dompierres, with the support of the Ishpeming School District, have tried to get the rule changed so Dompierre can play during his senior year. ""The rule is 100 years old. We've come a long way in those 100 years in this country in the way that we involve and include people with disabilities. And I think it's time that the rule catches up with that,"" said Dean Dompierre. CNN's Paul Caron and Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","Eric Dompierre has Down syndrome and plays high school football and basketball .

"(CNN) -- For most of my life, I've had a relationship with Iran, mostly good, but which included a long period in which Iran hurt me and other foreign service officers greatly. I was the press attachÃ© at the United States Embassy in Teheran in 1979, and one of 52 Americans held hostage for 444 days during the Iranian Revolution. I cannot forgive the youthful Iranians who imprisoned us and the regime that legitimized their cruelty, but I try to be as objective as possible as an observer of Iran's situation today. Let's be frank. Iran's intransigence with its nuclear intentions and the West's efforts, led by the United States, to undermine Iran's economy and, perhaps, its legitimacy, are moving both sides further from a war of words and closer to a hot war. This war would easily draw in Israel, and perhaps even some of the Arab nations that are showing their Islamist side since the ""Arab Spring."" It could well close the Strait of Hormuz and the drive the price of oil to impossible highs, prolonging a worldwide economic funk. And it would once again put the United States front and center in a third protracted war since 2001. But, let's not jump to conclusions that war is inevitable or react reflexively to Iran's saber-rattling, the way some of the Republican presidential candidates have been doing to score points on the campaign trail. They seem to think that this war would be surgical and quick. That's the same bad thinking that got us into Iraq. I'd rather step back a moment and focus on Iran's strained domestic political situation as the real reason for its confrontation with the U.S. and the West. While I don't want to sound like an apologist for the authoritarian Islamic Republic, I also don't want us to be naÃ¯ve about what's driving Iranian intentions. First, Iran's ""civilian"" nuclear program reaches back to the pre-revolutionary days of the Shah of Iran, and there is no proof, whether from the International Atomic Energy Agency or the U.S., that Iran is actually building a bomb. Second, it's widely reported that Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are in open conflict today, not only politically but also theologically. While this rift is esoteric to Westerners, Tehran takes it very seriously. It comes down to Ahmadinejad trying to change the entire foundation of Iran's theological-political infrastructure by asserting that he, not Khamenei, has a direct relationship with the Shi'ite Mahdi, or messiah. Khamenei has responded by condemning Ahmadinejad and his followers as the ""deviant stream."" Since May 2011, this domestic conflict has shaken the regime's stability. It may have much to do with Tehran's flailing foreign policy as the sanctions do. The regime also has its hands full with upcoming parliamentary elections in March. It likes to say that the elections are both a model and inspiration for the new surge of democracy in the Arab world. It also sees these elections as a test of legitimacy. Remember, only two years ago, Iran was convulsed with a popular uprising that opposed the outcome of presidential elections. The reform movement was brutally crushed by the regime thugs. Major reformist leaders are still under house arrest. Whether the regime is able to market itself to its neighbors as a legitimate source of a Middle East revival is rather doubtful. More importantly, reformists have loudly and clearly stated that they are not going to participate in a rigged election. This will be the first time since the beginning of the Islamic Republic that any part of the electorate has bolted from the system. Khamenei must see this reformist move as a profound crack in his authority and to the regime's legitimacy. Finally, there are more domestic disasters. While Iranians of all political stripes see a nuclear program as a national status symbol, they are paying a dear price for it. The sanctions are truly hurting the average Iranian. The hardships include high unemployment, inflation and commodity shortages. Last week, Iran's currency fell to a new low against the dollar. This situation is not going to endear the regime to the electorate. Can we move away from the precipice of war? I think so. Congress members should get out of the public relations business and stop making pronouncements about Iran that are simplistic and belligerent. It makes any chance of a negotiated settlement even more difficult. The U.S. Navy's rescue of 13 Iranian fishermen from pirates in the North Arabian Sea was a surprising and awkward moment, and a chance for both sides to step back and breathe a little. But the startling news that Iran's Revolutionary Court had sentenced an American, Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, to death, charging him with spying for the Central Intelligence Agency, says that Iran, once again, is up to the task of seeking revenge against the U.S. We need to find a real structure for diplomacy to calm these new levels of tension. Just as Qatar is hosting a political office for the Taliban in an attempt to open direct talks to an end the Afghan war, a regional approach to Iran may help. Qatar has become the dynamic center within the Arab League and has been a respected go-between. Yes, it has close relations with the United States and hosts the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command, but its prime minister, Al-Thani, was not timid when he said in 2006, ""Qatar talks to Iran as an equal, and this is important."" The Gulf Cooperation Council could play a greater role in softening Iran's relationship with the Sunni Arab world by drawing it closer to its regional neighbors, as well as serving as a liaison between Iran and the West.

"(CNN) -- By qualifying fourth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher offered a tantalising hint he was ready to shake off the indifferent form he has displayed since returning to Formula One in 2010. The seven-time world champion's challenge in Melbourne was cut short by a 10th-lap gearbox failure, but the German insists the true strength of this year's cars and drivers will not be known until after this weekend's race in Malaysia. ""The circuit in Melbourne is not really representative of the true competitive picture,"" the Mercedes driver told the sport's official website. ""But nevertheless the car gives me a good feeling for the season ahead. F1 teams and drivers for 2012 . ""Sepang will be interesting for everybody because it will be the first clue to the real relative strengths of all the cars."" Sunday's race was won by McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button, with Red Bull's back-to-back title winner Sebastian Vettel claiming second place. Schumacher is convinced Mercedes' F1 W03 car -- which features a controversial DRS-activated F-duct device that has attracted scrutiny from other teams -- is capable of helping him and teammate Nico Rosberg challenge for honors in 2012. ""After the disappointment of how the first race in Melbourne turned out, I am flying to Malaysia with a big sense of anticipation,"" the 43-year-old said. ""We saw in Australia that our car is capable of putting us in the mix."" Schumacher's compatriot Vettel expressed that the Sepang Circuit, where he was victorious in 2011, is a more difficult challenge than it first appears. ""It has big run-off areas and a broad track, meaning it appears easy, but it's not,"" the sport's youngest double world champion said. ""The heat, high humidity and weather aren't the only challenges, as the main thing is to find the ideal car set up. It's good to go there off the back of Australia and I hope we get another strong result."" Ferrari came into the new campaign off the back of a disappointing preseason, with the F2012 car struggling for pace. Spanish driver Fernando Alonso, who lost his title as F1's youngest two-time champion to Vettel, put in an admirable drive last weekend to finish fifth after starting the race in 12th. The 30-year-old said changeable weather conditions in Malaysia would test the competitors. ""There is no other place in the world, the Formula One world that is, where it can go from sunshine to torrential rain in the space of a few minutes,"" he said. ""Those on the pit wall will have to keep their eyes peeled and look at the radar carefully to be ready for any possible change in the weather.""","Michael Schumacher says Malaysian GP will show true quality of 2012 teams .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki had to admit to an embarrassing loss on Wednesday, but it won't affect her chances of winning her first grand slam title at the Australian Open. The Dane's post-match press conference was delayed because the 21-year-old misplaced her bag of clothes after a 6-1 7-6 (7-4) win over Georgia's Anna Tatishvili that put her into the third round in Melbourne. ""I left it on the practice court. I went to hit a few minutes after the match, and I left it there. I didn't have any more clothes. So I took a shower, and I'm looking for my bag and I couldn't find it,"" said Wozniacki, who will play Romanian 31st seed Monica Niculescu in the last 32. ""Thankfully, one of the locker room ladies was nice enough to go out and look for it, and it was there."" Nadal into third round as Federer walks it . Wozniacki, who fired nine aces in an aggressive on-court display, then had to field questions about her golf star boyfriend Rory McIlroy, revealing that they try each other's sports and that she is learning from his mental approach. ""It's just about you can't really do anything about the past. You just need to look forward. You have a tournament now, and you want to do the best you can. That's it,"" she said. ""Then if it goes well, it's great. If not, you have the next one. It's like tennis. So, you know, it's just important not to dwell too much in the past. "" Wozniacki's position at the top of women's tennis is under threat in the next fortnight, with third seed Victoria Azarenka one of the players who can overtake her if she wins her first grand slam.

"(CNN) -- The votes have been counted, the candidates have moved on to South Carolina, but remnants of a hard-fought battle blanket Manchester, New Hampshire. The campaigns left behind hundreds, perhaps thousands of political signs on street corners and traffic medians from one end of the city to the other. Now someone has to go around and collect them. ""It's definitely a big task to pick them up after the election is over,"" said Bob Roy as he surveyed a pile of signs at a city yard. PODCAST: The sound of cleaning up a campaign. The chief of street operations for Manchester said every four years, they expect to clean up after the campaigns in the same way they expect to plow the streets when it snows. ""A lot of them are just left in place and, therefore, we go pick them up,"" Roy said. ""It's a never ending battle."" Often, campaign workers show up at the yard. They sift through the pile and collect the signs bearing their candidate's name. Sometimes they bring them to the next primary state. Or, they hold on to them and hope to re-plant them around the city if their candidate becomes the party's nominee in the general election. Shawn Dionne makes runs in his pick-up truck several times a week as he clears the signs. ""The pile gets pretty big,"" said the public works employee who has the back-breaking job of pulling the signs out of the ground. Sometimes, campaign workers are at the yard waiting for him to back his pick-up truck up to the bin and toss in a few hundred more signs. ""I come to bring in a load and they're chilling out here just digging through, throwing signs around ... I let them do their thing,"" Dionne said.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- A man suspected of murdering a doctor in Chicago, Illinois, is trying to skirt the U.S. justice system by fleeing to the French island territory of St. Martin, according to prosecutors. Dr. David Cornbleet, a dermatologist, was murdered in his Chicago office in October, 2006. ""He's doing everything possible to protect himself,"" said Bernie Murray, chief of criminal prosecution for the Cook County State's Attorney's Office in Illinois. ""At the end of the day, he's making a mockery of both French law and United States law."" After fleeing to St. Martin, Hans Peterson, 29, turned himself in to French authorities and allegedly confessed to murdering Dr. David Cornbleet in October, 2006. Jon Cornbleet, Dr. Cornbleet's son, said he has seen a four-page confession in which Peterson admits to attacking and killing David Cornbleet in his Chicago office. Despite the alleged confession, Peterson is beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. As a French national on French soil, he cannot be sent to the United States for trial, according to a 2002 extradition treaty between the two countries. The United States, by contrast, is allowed to extradite U.S. citizens to France, under the treaty. U.S. Sens. Barack Obama and Dick Durbin, both of Illinois, sent letters to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking for help extraditing Peterson. In response to the senators, the State Department wrote it ""will continue to make every effort with the government of France to see that justice is served in this case."" Sens. Durbin and Obama also wrote the French government requesting extradition. French Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Francois Rivasseau, responded ""the French government will not be able to extradite Mr. Peterson."" ""French laws provide in that case for trial on French territory by French justice,"" he said in a statement. Murray of the Cook County State's Attorney's Office said he favors extradition over a French trial because he believes French laws are more lenient. He said a life sentence there is only 22 years. In Illinois, Murray said, murder is punishable by a minimum of 20 years in prison and possibly much more. ""It goes up to 60 or 80 or 100 years, possibly life, possibly the death sentence, depending on the facts surrounding the crime,"" Murray said. Hoping to persuade the French to extradite Peterson, Murray and the Cornbleet family said they would not seek the death penalty in the case. There is currently a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois. According to the victim's son, Jon Cornbleet, Peterson first met Dr. Cornbleet in 2002 when he was living in Chicago and went to see him for an acne problem. His father prescribed a popular acne medication, which, according to Jon Cornbleet, Peterson said made him impotent. It is believed this is the only time the two met before the night of the murder. Peterson's father, Dr. Thomas Peterson, said his son was an ""okay kid who had a little depression."" He said his son took just two pills, but that the acne medication made him psychotic. Dr. Cornbleet's daughter, Jocelyn, found his body in his office. ""I could see on the second closed door that there was blood across it,"" she told CNN. ""I knew that somebody had killed him."" Jon Cornbleet said his father was stabbed more than 20 times. For months, the case went unsolved, even though authorities said there was DNA evidence at the scene. Then, over the summer, investigators got a tip from a U.S. Marine on leave from Iraq. The Marine said a friend told him, ""I think my former roommate killed someone."" The Marine reached out to the Cornbleets through a posting they had made on myspace.com and also contacted Chicago police. He told the Cornbleet family Peterson was living in New York around the time of the murder. The family believes Peterson drove from New York to Chicago, killed Dr. Cornbleet, and then drove back to New York, reportedly telling friends he had ""completed his mission."" The Cornbleet family said video surveillance from Dr. Cornbleet's office building shows Peterson entering and leaving the premises on the night of the crime. Using the Marine's tip, DNA evidence and the surveillance video Chicago police got a warrant to arrest Peterson. But before they could track him down, Peterson fled to St. Martin. So far, Peterson has yet to be charged with a crime. He is being held in jail on the French Island of Guadeloupe. The French government did not return CNN's phone calls for this story. Jocelyn and Jon Cornbleet said they will continue to fight for his extradition. ""We're gonna go until there's absolutely nothing more we can do,"" Jocelyn Cornbleet said. ""'Til we get justice.""

"(CNN) -- When out on the playground, there arose such a clatter -- because little Tommy told all his classmates there was no such thing as Santa Claus. It's an uncomfortable scenario both the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny know all too well, and has the potential to leave parents caught like reindeer in headlights. It typically involves distraught kids cornering their parents after school with widened eyes, blurting out: ""Tommy told me there isn't a Santa Claus!"" (or Saint Nicholas, Father Christmas, Kris Kringle or Babbo Natale, respectively). Heather Barranco knows the awkward affair all too well; her own child recently told a number of the kids in kindergarten that Santa didn't exist. For spiritual reasons, Barranco's family forgoes the Santa tradition. ""One parent, whom I was friendly with, told me that her daughter was not allowed to play with my daughter anymore,"" says Barranco. ""She questioned my parenting skills and said in a very angry voice, 'I do not know what you are teaching your children in your house. But, we believe in Santa and fairies. Your daughter took away something very special from my family.'"" Barranco, a Catholic school teacher, has since advised her children not to ""out"" the jolly bearded man; to let others believe if they're so inclined. ""Note that the kid is not trying to be mean, but just ahead of the others in development of this concept,"" says Tina Feigal, parenting coach, former school psychologist and author of ""The Pocket Coach for Parents."" ""Kids talk about what's going on inside, which is natural for them,"" Feigal said. ""No blame is needed."" When the situation arises, it is up to each individual parent to decide the best way to answer the question, says Fran Walfish, child and family psychotherapist and author of ""The Self-Aware Parent."" While the ages of belief vary greatly from individual to individual, Walfish says children under the age of 7 years old -- as evidenced in Barranco's kindergarten class -- are likely to believe what their parents tell them. Between second and fourth grade is the peak of what Walfish refers to as the latency phase of child development, and is also the period during which parents can expect the question. (Eight-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon, who wrote the famous letter to the editor of New York's Sun in 1891, was right on schedule.) ""The goal of adolescence is to resolve one's separation from parents and emerge embracing his/her own ideas, opinions, and beliefs,"" says Walfish. During this phase, parents can expect to see a spike in doubt: whether it's the child insisting to go to the post office to hand-deliver his or her letter to the North Pole; staying up late to guard the fireplace; comparing handwritten gift tags with Dad's chicken scratches to even questioning the logistics of the sleigh travel. For the last, former math teacher Benjamin John Coleman urged his students to think about the four dimensions of length, area, volume and time. ""We're able to easily manipulate length, area and volume. For length, think about cutting a piece of string; for area, think about cutting out a square from a piece of paper; and for volume, think about filling a water balloon. The problem is we humans can't manipulate time like we can length, area and volume."" ""But what if Santa Claus could?"" he asks. ""He could make Christmas Eve 100, 1,000, or even 1,000,000 hours long -- just like we can cut a piece of string to any length. He'd have plenty of time to deliver all those presents."" Wary children can follow Santa's journey around the world by satellite on Christmas Eve, thanks to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which started its holiday tradition in 1955. NORAD, like Coleman, also suggests that ""the only logical conclusion is that Santa somehow functions within his own time-space continuum."" Tracking or not, ultimately any curiosity about the folklore is an opportunity to teach children about the importance of finding their own voice and truths in the world, says Paul Hokemeyer, a marriage and family therapist. ""Explain to them that the world is a diverse and large place where people hold different views on the same topic,"" he says. ""And further explain that what's important is to believe in what feels true at a particular moment in time and to hold on to it for however long as it feels honest and true."" Feigal also advocates letting your child come to his or her own conclusions, and that questioning things is a healthy sign of maturity. ""Adults need to take more of a 'curious stance' than a 'fixing stance' with this issue. Ask questions, and don't be so quick to 'make it all better' for your child,"" recommends Feigal. ""Superman is a symbol of generosity, too, and we all 'believe in' him. If Santa is in your heart, he's real."" And as confusing as it may be for the child who still believes, it's also confusing for the kids who know the truth, such as older siblings, says Walfish. Being told not to tell a younger brother or sister can be a burden for the elder secret-holder, so Walfish recommends advising them to reflect instead. ""Say, 'As you get older your ideas and belief may change. When we're younger, it's fun to believe in Santa Claus."" Most importantly for parents, 'tis not the season to feel guilty about the Santa tradition -- should they choose to participate -- when the folklore is let out of the sleigh bag. ""Moms and dads need to relax and cut themselves some slack,"" she says. ""You are not changing the truth for personal gain or deceit. Santa is part of our folklore. The celebration of Christmas has included Santa Claus for almost all young children. You are passing down the folklore, keeping up the tradition and allowing your child to fully enjoy the magic.""","What should a parent do when children corner them, asking about Santa?
Children younger than 7 are likely to believe what their parents tell them .
One answer: A lot of people believe different things about Santa ."
"(CNN) -- A gay teenager who pulled a stun gun on students he said bullied him has been expelled from his Indianapolis high school until January. ""While the district does not condone bullying, it also does not allow weapons to be brought on our school campuses for any reason,"" a spokeswoman for Indianapolis Public Schools said Tuesday. ""Students who violate this rule will be held accountable."" Darnell ""Dynasty"" Young's mother sent her 17-year-old son to school with a stun gun because, she said, administrators didn't do enough to stop the bullying against him. Students take part in anti-bullying programs from kindergarten through 12th grade, district spokeswoman Mary Louise Bewley said. The district also offers Gay Straight Alliance groups on multiple campuses, including Arsenal Technical High School, where Young attended, Bewley said. ""The district does not condone bullying,"" she said. ""Students who violate the rights of others through bullying behaviors are held accountable."" The school district held an expulsion hearing last week and the decision was announced Tuesday. ""The Indianapolis Public Schools has affirmed the decision of the expulsion hearing examiner to expel Darnell Young from Arsenal Technical High School for the remainder of this school year through the first semester of the 2012-13 school year,"" it said. ""He may return to school in IPS on Jan. 7, 2013."" His mother, Chelisa Grimes, sent her son to school with the stun gun after he said he was taunted and bullied for months. Grimes told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday that she would do it again, despite the threat of expulsion. ""I do not promote violence -- not at all -- but what is a parent to do when she has done everything that she felt she was supposed to do ... at the school?"" Grimes said. ""I did feel like there was nothing else left for me to do but protect my child."" ""I brought the stun gun 'cause I wasn't safe,"" the teen said. After six other students surrounded him at school on April 16, calling him names and threatening to beat him up, Young pulled the stun gun from his backpack. He raised it in the air, setting off an electric charge, and sending the group scurrying, Young said. Unlike a Taser, which fires barbs attached to long wires at a target, a stun gun must be near or pressed against a person to shock him. ""I got kicked out of school for me bringing the weapon to school, but I honestly don't think that that was fair,"" Young said. ""I didn't use it on nobody ... all I did was raise it up in the air and went back to my class."" School police officers arrested him a short time later and took him away in handcuffs, The Indianapolis Star reported. School officials are investigating the incident, but none of the students who allegedly surrounded Young have been positively identified. Young is known as a flamboyant dresser and Larry Yarrell, the Tech principal, said school staff had been trying to get him to ""tone down"" his accessories. ""If you wear female apparel, then kids are kids and they're going to say whatever it is that they want to say,"" Yarrell told The Star. ""Because you want to be different and because you choose to wear female apparel, it may happen. In the idealistic society, it shouldn't matter. People should be able to wear what they want to wear."" Grimes contends that school officials haven't done enough to protect all students on campus. ""I think that the self-protection device is what's making the news, but the big picture is that my child is not the only one who does not feel safe at our school,"" she said. It is a common complaint among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) students. A 2009 survey of 7,261 middle and high school students found that nearly nine out of 10 LGBT students had experienced harassment at school over the previous year and nearly two-thirds felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation. Young said rumors around campus suggested he was ""doing nasty stuff"" with teachers. The rumors took their toll. ""I was at my wit's end. I didn't know what to do and I thought about suicide,"" Young said. ""I hate saying that word because God blessed me with this life. I love life. I love my education. I would never ... but this bullying got so bad that I thought about that.""","Darnell ""Dynasty"" Young can return to high school next January, the school district says .

"(CNN) -- Websites affiliated with the CIA, Mexico's mining ministry and the state of Alabama were down Friday, allegedly done in by hackers, government officials and a well-known hacking group reported. A message Friday on a Twitter page and Tumblr feed affiliated with the hacking group known as Anonymous celebrated that the Central Intelligence Agency's website had been taken down. The posting read: ""CIA TANGO DOWN: https://www.cia.gov/ #Anonymous."" A later one pointed to a news story indicating ""#Anonymous hackers hit CIA, U.N., Mexico websites."" Numerous outside reports indicated the CIA's website was down, and CNN's attempts from late Friday afternoon into the evening to get onto the site failed. Asked about the outage, CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said Friday night, ""We are aware of the problems accessing our website, and are working to resolve them."" By early Saturday morning, the website was back. Who is Anonymous? Everyone and no one . Additionally, information was ""compromised"" in a hacking of Alabama state websites, the Alabama Department of Homeland Security said in a news release. ""We are aware of the current situation regarding individual(s) claiming responsibility for hacking into a state of Alabama ... public website,"" Alabama Department of Homeland Security Director Spencer Collier said in the release. Jack Doane, director of Alabama's Information Services Division, told CNN later by e-mail that state technology experts ""are conducting a forensic analysis to determine what if any information has been compromised."" It was not immediately clear what websites were hacked or who was responsible. A web page that included Anonymous' signature tag line stated the hacking was in response to Alabama's ""recent racist legislation in an attempt to punish immigrants as criminals"" -- referring to legislation, signed last June, aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration in the state. The Anonymous-related Twitter page also provided links to documents, messages and other files that it said it had taken off a website tied to Mexico's mining ministry. ""Hello Mexican Chamber of Mines,"" a related Twitter post read. ""Want to see your emails exposed?"" That said, another later item on the same feed added, ""We'd remind media that if we report a hack or ddos (distributed denial of service) attack, it doesn't necessarily mean we did it...FYI."" The Mexican mining ministry's website -- which is distinct from the Chamber of Mines, or Caminex, a trade association -- appeared to be down early Friday evening.

"(CNN) -- The public has been shaking its collective head since rumors of a Rihanna-Chris Brown collaboration began circulating on the Internet last week. Once the artists' respective remixes, ""Birthday Cake"" and ""Turn Up the Music,"" featuring each other, hit the Web on Monday, that head-shaking turned into full-blown opposition. Some have questioned why Rihanna would musically reunite with her ex and whether their working together was a straight career move or a byproduct of her feelings for Brown. But based on the way the ""We Found Love"" singer markets herself, industry experts agree, her decision to collaborate with Brown is actually quite characteristic. ""So much of (Rihanna's) music is about being in control of herself,"" said Tamar Anitai, the managing editor of MTV Buzzworthy. ""Some of her fans have been really surprised by (her working with Brown again), but a lot of her other fans are so used to her making these big, bold statements."" Rihanna has been in the game for a long time, Anitai said, and she wants people to know that she makes her own decisions. ""This is her way of saying, 'I've made peace with my past.' "" Since he pleaded guilty in June 2009 to assaulting his then-girlfriend on the eve of the 51st Grammy Awards, Brown's career has flourished -- as has Rihanna's. Country singer Miranda Lambert and HLN's Dr. Drew are among those weighing in on Brown's successes in addition to his troubles, including outbursts on Twitter and a reported tantrum after an appearance on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" last year. A firestorm erupted when many women tweeted after this year's Grammy Awards that they would let Brown beat them. But while the response to the pair's partnership has been overwhelmingly negative, their remixes have actually been well-received, said Ian Drew, Us Weekly's senior editor for music. ""Say what you will about them ... but when they're on a track together, it sort of lights up and ignites,"" Drew said. Referencing Rihanna's ""S&M,"" which shocked listeners with talk of chains and whips, he said that ""these two are all about pushing buttons."" What is boils down to, Drew added, is whether people have the ability to separate the artists' personal lives from their music. It's unclear what effect their collaborations will have on their careers. But the critics seem to be out in full force. A recent Newsday story titled ""Rihanna and Chris Brown deserve each other"" states, ""Apparently, Rihanna wants to show her independence and Brown wants to show that he can beat a woman and still get her to be friends."" And AJ Reynolds, who hosts Canada's Top 20 Countdown, said that all tracks featuring Brown have been pulled from the radio show after numerous parents complained. The backlash couldn't have come as a surprise to the two artists. Music producer The-Dream, who wrote ""Birthday Cake"" with Rihanna, told MTV it was actually her idea to feature Brown on the song's remix. ""When she raised the question to me, I know she's not crazy,"" he said. ""So my thought was, 'you've been thinking about this; you've already thought it out, so evidently you know what reaction you gonna get.' "" Despite the fact that Rihanna typically embraces her sexuality in her music, ""Turn Up the Music"" (which features the lyrics, ""So let's go tonight and do whatever it takes to make it right"") and ""Birthday Cake's"" explicit nature are a bit jarring, given the pair's history, said Bill Werde, Billboard's editorial director. Even so, Werde said, he can't see Rihanna's career being hurt by the collaboration. ""If Chris Brown can rebound from (the assault) ... please don't tell me that Rihanna can't rebound from what some are perceiving as a lapse in judgment,"" he added. In the end, fans reserve the right to support the artists or not, but onlookers have to remember, this is still a real and tumultuous situation. ""People have the tendency to forget that maybe this isn't some kind of contrived career move or a staged opportunity for PR,"" Werde said. ""This media-saturated world is trying to make sense of a very, very human decision. ""I would like to think she's thought through the consequences, but I don't think she's making this decision with an eye toward her career,"" Werde added. ""She's probably just thinking with her heart.""","The artists' remixes, ""Birthday Cake"" and ""Turn Up the Music,"" hit the Web on Monday .

Tyler was an 18-year-old freshman at Rutgers University in New Jersey when he jumped off the George Washington Bridge in New York on September 22, 2010, after prosecutors say his roommate and another Rutgers student spied on Clementi kissing another man via a computer webcam. His suicide ignited a media firestorm and thrust his brother into the national conversation in a way that James Clementi still finds difficult to grasp. ""There's been so much attention and focus on my brother in the media in the last year and a half, since he passed,"" Clementi told CNN's Jason Carroll in an interview airing Wednesday on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""But I felt like his voice and his personality, who he was, got lost completely in a lot of the dialogue that was out there about him."" Clementi said the brother he grew up with for 18 years was quiet and shy, but also extremely curious about the world around him. ""Anything that he didn't know, he would find out everything there was to find out about it,"" he said. James, who is gay, said they hadn't spoken about each other's sexuality growing up, but when James finally came out to Tyler before Tyler left for college, he said his younger brother was becoming more comfortable with his own sexuality. ""I didn't want to push him,"" James said. ""I actually brought it up to him that I was gay, kind of hoping that he would reciprocate and tell me the same thing about himself. ... I just wanted him to know so that it would be a safe place and that if he did want to talk to me, he would be able to."" Tyler told James he was gay, too, and James said it didn't ""seem to be any kind of burden or trouble for him, he seemed OK with it."" James acknowledged that while Tyler seemed at peace with himself before leaving for college, he must have hidden a pain within him, and he wonders how long he was hiding it. ""I think he was being brave by being honest with the people around him about his sexuality, and I think he really tried to be a strong person and be an honest person,"" James said. ""It just seems like he was being punished for that forthrightness and made to be a joke or a laughingstock, and I think that must have taken its toll on him emotionally and mentally."" Tyler Clementi's roommate, Dharun Ravi, is facing a 15-count indictment, which includes hate crime charges, in connection with Tyler Clementi's death. He is going on trial on February 21. In December, Ravi turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. ""The trial is going to be incredibly emotional,"" James Clementi said. ""I think we're just hoping for some kind of justice in the court system and putting our faith in the prosecution to do what they need to do."" When asked whether he thinks about forgiving Ravi, Clementi acknowledged that he's not quite ""there right now,"" but said he knows there will be a time for that. For now, James Clementi is memorializing Tyler in an Out Magazine article, ""Letters to My Brother."" In one of the letters -- they all were written after Tyler's death -- James asks how, after coming from the same background, Tyler always had a ""confidence and strength"" that James didn't see in himself. ""I still, in many ways, wish I was more like him,"" Clementi told CNN. ""The tragedy is that the sadness at the end was so much that it defines everything, but I think, to me, he is a strong and beautiful person and I admire him."" CNN's Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","""The tragedy is that the sadness at the end ... defines everything,"" James Clementi says .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea have completed the signing of England international defender Gary Cahill from Premier League rivals Bolton Wanderers for a fee of $10.7m. The 26-year-old finalized his protracted move on Monday after agreeing personal terms and passing a medical, making it the biggest English transfer so far during the January window. Cahill has signed a five-and-a-half year contract with the London club, despite doubts beginning to surface about the deal due to the length of time negotiations over his financial terms took. Who are football's top January transfer targets? He told the official Chelsea website: ""Chelsea are a massive club. They look to win trophies season in season out and it is a big opportunity for me to be a part of that. ""Opportunities like this, you just can't turn down,"" added Cahill, who has won seven England caps and will be battling with Brazilian David Luiz to partner England captain John Terry at the heart of the Chelsea defense. Speaking on Saturday about Cahill's impending arrival, Chelsea manager Andre Villas Boas told reporters: ""He has good technical abilities which is important in the way we want to play and to implement our philosophy. ""Competition will be tight for him but we brought him in to become better as a team."" Cahill joined Bolton from Aston Villa in January 2008 and developed into one of England's top defenders during his four years at the Reebok Stadium. However, he had already indicated he was not prepared to sign a new contract, meaning Wanderers were forced to sell him or lose him for free at the end of the season. Meanwhile, the Carlos Tevez transfer saga has taken a new twist after Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti confirmed the Italian club had made a $31.7 million bid for Manchester City's Argentine striker. Speaking to reporters after Inter's 1-0 victory over city rivals AC Milan, Moratti said: ""Our offer is 25 million euros -- now it depends on them whether they accept it or not."" Inter have emerged as favorites to sign Tevez, after Milan pulled out of the race last week when their plan to sell Alexandre Pato to Paris St Germain fell through following the Brazilian's decision to stay at the San Siro. Ironically big-spending PSG now seem the only realistic challengers for Tevez, who has fallen out of favor at City after refusing to come off the substitutes' bench during the 3-1 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich earlier in the season. Elsewhere in the Premier League, Blackburn central defender Chris Samba has handed in a written transfer request, despite Rovers manager Steve Kean saying the player was not for sale. The Congolese international has already been the subject of a rejected bid from QPR, while title-chasing Tottenham and French big spenders PSG have also been linked with the player. Samba issued a statement saying: ""In my five years at Blackburn I have always given 100% in every game I have played. I have had several opportunities to leave but I have always stayed. ""I have decided now is the right time for me to pursue a new challenge and I have asked the club to respect my decision and allow me to leave."" In other transfer news, Barcelona have announced that French defender Eric Abidal has signed a new deal with the club. The 32-year-old, who had been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp, is now contracted to the European champions until June 2013, with an option to extend the deal until 2015. Abidal has made 177 appearances in four years with Barca, winning the Champions League twice and the Spanish La Liga three times.","Chelsea have completed the signing of Bolton central defender Gary Cahill .

"New York (CNN) -- A ""pocket dial"" mistake can result in an unwanted phone call, annoying for the recipient and potentially embarrassing to the caller. But a new study found a staggering number of those apparently accidental calls in New York City are made to emergency responders, jamming up 911 lines in a city that has prided itself on its ability to respond in a crisis. Nearly 4 million of those calls were made to the city's emergency call centers in 2010, according to a recent Winbourne Consulting report, commissioned by the city after a massive blizzard delayed first responders and left Mayor Michael Bloomberg open to criticism. That's more than one-third of some 11 million emergency calls made in New York each year, the study found, which was released Friday. Those calls were 19 seconds or less. Authorities determined that they were likely accidental and say unnecessary communications add an increased burden on emergency response systems. ""The increased proliferation of cellular telephones has caused a dramatic increase in the number of accidental 911 calls made,"" the report said. In 2011, the Federal Communications Commission issued a report estimating that 70% of all 911 calls -- intentional or mistaken -- were made from wireless devices. The consulting firm recommended implementing a citywide information campaign to alert the public of the issue and to streamline systems between the police and fire departments, among other recommendations.","Nearly 4 million apparently accidental calls were made to emergency call centers in 2010 .

"COPENHAGEN, Denamrk (CNN) -- Actress Connie Nielsen hit the big time when she starred in ""Gladiator"" as Lucilla, sister of the deranged Emperor Commodus. Since then she has appeared in hit movies including ""One Hour Photo"" and ""The Hunted"". Connie Nielsen has always refused to play the Hollywood fame game. But Nielsen has refused to play the Hollywood fame game and seems drawn to challenging roles in controversial movies, including ""The Situation"", about the current Iraq war, and ""Battle in Seattle"", about the anti-globalization riots that took place in Seattle in 1999. Nielsen now lives in the US and returns to Copenhagen every year. She talks to My City, My Life about what makes the city, and its people, so special. CNN: How do you define yourself? Connie Nielsen: I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business. I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth. That's what I want from my art, that's what I aspire to. I try to combine my work with my family, that's what I aspire to. I don't say that's the only thing. It's not all work and family, because otherwise you would be saying no to the many other things in life and there are many other things. CNN: The people here are supposed to be incredibly happy -- what do you think? Connie Nielsen: I think it's funny in a way because when I grew up here it was very unusual to hear the word ""happiness"". If you asked somebody, ""what do you wish for in life?"" they wouldn't say ""happiness."" I would have answered ""excitement, knowledge,"" God knows -- I mean, many, many different things, but certainly not ""happiness"". It seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular. And I think that a lot of Danes kind of feel like that about being the happiest people in the world. CNN: Is there anything you'd like to change about the city? Connie Nielsen: Anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes, concentrate poor people there. It's specific to any big city. There was an effort to create buildings that concentrate these people very closely, and their social problems. They are still around in New York, Paris, London and here too. So if I could change anything about Copenhagen, or any other major big city, I would change the way we build buildings or housing for lower income people. I don't think people who are already burdened with social, economic, psychological situations, dysfunctional families, need to be burdened with other people with the same problems. CNN: Is the city politically driven? Connie Nielsen: I don't think I can remember a moment in my life where people didn't discuss politics. People discuss politics at the table. I think some of the first information I received was politically charged (laughs). It was at a time when girls were being told, ""Why don't you go and learn how to repair machines rather than learn to repair your jumper? Why don't you learn to cut wood rather than learn to keep a house clean?"" in school. It was to make us conscious of what we were, how we defined ourselves and why you would accept one concept of yourself rather than another. Have you searched through the truth of that concept? Have you deconstructed? Have you made sure that its foundations are valid? That's how I grew up and I think it was wonderful. CNN: How would you describe the city architecturally? Connie Nielsen: It's everything here from very late renaissance to this 19th century golden age we had here. It's that, intermixed with pure Danish modernism. I love the juxtaposition of it all. I love when we bring in metaphors for our past as well. CNN: A lot of the places you have taken us to have been very romantic, do you think there is a fairy tale quality to Copenhagen? Connie Nielsen: An alternative society ... yes I do, I do feel that. I do feel that most things are possible here. I can dream here. I can imagine. CNN: What is it about the city that makes people creative? Connie Nielsen: Well, we have a very, very long winter and it gets a little boring, so you better think of something to do! It can get deathly boring, so you start using your imagination. Sometimes it's necessity that produces it, because you need to do something. CNN: Is there something about the people here that want to change things for the better? Connie Nielsen: I think so -- I think we're an idealistic people. I think there are disillusioned people everywhere, there are doubters everywhere, but I do think there are constructive people here; I do think that people believe in people. CNN: Do you take any inspiration from the city? Connie Nielsen: Yes, yes I do. Whenever I come back here I remember that I want to write poetry (laughs). I want to take more time to sit and paint some more. I want to do so many more things whenever I come back -- I'm always reminded of that when I come here. CNN: You've lived in lots of cities all over the world and still do. Why is Copenhagen special to you? Connie Nielsen: I was born here and it's the capital of my home country. It's also immensely beautiful. Many of my friends live here and much of my partner's family lives here too and so we bring our kids back here every year. It holds all the museums that hold our history, our culture, and I take our children there and I go there for my own pleasure all the time. I love going to museums. I love this city and I love cities that are on the water. I love the water element, specifically the sea. I grew up on the sea and I grew up sailing -- I love sailing -- and the presence of the sea gives the air and the light a very special quality that I absolutely adore. CNN: It seems that for a small place it has a lot of cultural influence. Connie Nielsen: Yes, it's sort of a little pearl in the middle of the seas. There's a lot of traffic through this place, from the east, west, north and south. And we are the southern part of the north, so everything from the south comes up here on its way towards the north, and the opposite. And it has left its mark. We are definitely some kind of place where culture is being deposited over and over and over again, but it also springs from here. It's the kind of place that attracts creative people and so it springs from here too. CNN: If Copenhagen was a person, how would you describe it? Connie Nielsen: If Copenhagen were a person, that person would be generous, beautiful, elderly, but with a flair. A human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling, filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the old -- somebody who takes good care of things and of people.","Connie Nielsen says she refuses the fame and money side of acting .

"(CNN) -- Since ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""Cloverfield"" and ""Paranormal Activity,"" it's been impossible to see a camcorder movie without steeling yourself for some monstrous horror lurking just offscreen. ""Project X"" is supposed to be a comedy, but parents with teenagers -- or parents with kids who may one day turn into teenagers -- will regard it with much the same mixture of dread and terror. It's Thomas' 17th birthday. Mom and Dad have recklessly elected to take off for the weekend. Sure, they know he'll probably have friends over, but they trust him to use his common sense, and anyway, he doesn't have that many friends. But they reckon without the influence of his determined buddy Costa, who puts all his considerable social networking skills to promoting what turns out to be the ultimate house party. Beer will be chugged, tequila slammed, pills popped (cherries too), furnishings trashed, cars crashed, there will be fire, SWAT teams and loud noise late into the night. Oh yes, my friends, the peace will be disturbed! There's nothing new about any of this -- the wild party is firmly entrenched in youths' rites of passage in the movies and in high school lore across the land. In my day, it was Tom Cruise turning his home into a brothel and getting on the wrong side of Guido the Killer Pimp. Now, it's Thomas Mann orchestrating a rave in his backyard and stupidly ripping off a frazzled drug dealer by the name of T-Rick. (Kids, if you take away just one lesson from this movie, let it be this: There's no percentage in ripping off your dealer.) Still, it seems to me Cruise was at least respectful of those working girls. To Thomas and the gangsta-mouthed Costa (Oliver Cooper), even their classmates are ""hos"" and ""b*tches."" If this movie has it right, today's teen culture is about what you would expect from a demographic brainwashed on a junk media diet of rap, pornography and reality TV. Please note, I said ""If."" ""Superbad"" seems almost quaint in comparison -- and a whole lot funnier, in my opinion. Not that there's any point in sermonizing about such a self-consciously anarchic celebration of adolescent hedonism. There's not much to it, but at least there's a trace of punk rebellion in the orgy of destruction visited on a comfortably middle-class suburban home -- even if the coda dubiously suggests that this could be the shortcut to social status and parental respect. Yeah, as my kid would say, right. Directed by newcomer Nima Nourizadeh from what must have been a stick-thin screenplay, ""Project X"" loses more than it gains from the ""videography"" gambit. It is indifferently acted and in too much of a rush for quick hits to establish anything like the lull and swell of a real rave -- there's no undertow, no rapture, just a randomized string of highs and lows. Even the hangover is shortchanged (despite a producer credit for ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips). That's not to say there aren't at least a few outrageous gags, YouTube moments to share, but mostly this looks like exactly what it is: a wasted opportunity.","Reviewer Tom Charity: ""Project X"" loses more than it gains from the ""videography"" gambit .

"(CNN) -- The death of Osama bin Laden does not necessarily mean the death of al Qaeda, the terrorist network he founded, though experts say none of his most likely successors offer the same combination of charisma, cash and credibility among militant Muslims. Bin Laden has long been a prime target for U.S. authorities, a member of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list since 1999 who has had a $25 million bounty on his head since after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Yet except for a few audiotapes on subjects ranging from climate change to France's role in Afghanistan, he's been relatively quiet in recent years. But that does not mean he'll be easy to replace, nor that there is someone obvious to take his spot. A U.S. counterterrorism official said Monday there was ""no succession plan in place"" that the U.S. government is aware of to replace bin Laden. Even if the Saudi-born zealot appeared to have had a less active role of late in al Qaeda's operations, he remained the symbol of his movement -- one that tried to appeal to Muslims angry about allegedly corrupt and spiritually impure regimes in the Middle East and beyond, propped up by the United States and its allies. Death of bin Laden brings healing . He was known throughout the world, and beloved in parts of the Arab world, as someone who'd given up a life of luxury to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan before focusing his wrath on the West as he tried to build a radical Islamist society. ""They don't have anybody now who is going to have the star power, the brand name of bin Laden,"" said Philip Mudd, a former CIA officer. His most obvious replacement -- given that he's developed a high profile as a jihadist leader in Egypt and is the face and voice in several videotapes since the 2001 attacks, some of them appearing by bin Laden's side -- is Ayman al-Zawahiri. Born into a wealthy family in Cairo, he was a key figure in the Egyptian Islamic Jihad who went to Afghanistan during their fight against the Soviets to offer his skills as a physician. By the 1990s, he refocused his attention on undermining and attacking the Egyptian government and, eventually, the United States. In 1998, when his organization had effectively merged with al Qaeda, he sent a fax to the Al-Hayat newspaper warning Americans. Three days later, suicide bombers hit the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people. Since then, al-Zawahiri has been depicted as bin Laden's closest adviser, as well as his doctor. But, the U.S. counterterrorism official said, he's ""not popular with colleagues."" ""He's viewed as a very polarizing figure, someone who is not easy to deal with, not a good manager,"" said Mudd, a senior research fellow at the New America Foundation. Mixed emotions about bin Laden's death: How should we feel? Another possible contender is Anwar al-Alwaki. Born in 1971 in Las Cruces, New Mexico, he bounced between Yemen and the United States before settling in the Middle East. His face is known largely for his role as a spokesman for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is considered one of the terror network's most prolific and deadly affiliates. Al-Alwaki has been suspected of playing a key part in the failed Christmas Day plot, in 2009 by a Nigerian national to bring down a Northwest Airlines jet as it neared Detroit. He also has been suspected of encouraging U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan to kill 13 fellow soldiers during a rampage at the Fort Hood base in Texas earlier that year. Yet Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst, said the fact that al-Alwaki has never engaged in combat himself may hurt him in any bid to climb up the al Qaeda leadership ladder. The latest details of bin Laden operation . ""He's a cleric, he's a speaker, but he's not a fighter,"" said Cruickshank, an alumni fellow at New York University's Center on Law and Security. ""And al Qaeda, over the years, have wanted to be led by a fighter."" Other less well-known contenders could emerge to head al Qaeda, or the Base as it's known in Arabic. They include men like Abu Yahya al-Libi, a leading al Qaeda ideologue. Less than two months before bin Laden's death, the Libyan native released an audiotape aimed at Islamists in that country and encouraging change that went beyond ousting leaders like Moammar Gadhafi. A former al Qaeda battlefield commander in Afghanistan perhaps best known for escaping from Bagram Air Base, al-Libi has been active in taped speeches urging resistance and trying to recruit new members. Then there's Ilyas Kashmiri, a veteran militant from Pakistan who has emerged as a mastermind of international terrorism operations, according to Cruickshank. The 313 Brigade, which he leads, has focused on finding and training recruits from Europe and North America on the grounds that they are less likely to be apprehended. Bin Laden killing caps decade-long manhunt . The succession challenge is compounded by the fact that, even before bin Laden's death, many experts said al Qaeda appeared to be staggering due to operational and organizational setbacks caused by actions like Predator drone strikes and the intensified allied campaign in Afghanistan and beyond. Intelligence officials have warned that threats may spike in the coming weeks. But the U.S. counterterrorism official said President Barack Obama administration's hope is that having a muddle of men posturing to be the next bin Laden could spur ""disharmony and discord"" among al Qaeda's ranks. Thus, while small bands of terrorists may continue to operate, the lack of one unifying leader threatens to undermine al Qaeda as an ideological, spiritual and operational force. ""It's not good to have six people trying to fill (bin Laden's) shoes,"" said Mudd. CNN analyst Peter Bergen contributed to this report.","A U.S. official says they know of ""no succession plan"" now that bin Laden is dead .
An expert says his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is ""not popular with colleagues""
Another contender is U.S.-born Anwar al-Alwaki, who is now based in Yemen .
Other possibilities are Abu Yahya al-Libi, from Libya, and Ilyas Kashmiri of Pakistan ."
"London (CNN) -- In an environment of declining retail sales in the United Kingdom, one premium brand is bucking the trend as consumers vote with their consciences. Sales of ethically produced, fair trade products in the UK increased by 12% from 2010 to 2011, accounting for Â£1.3 billion ($2.07 billion). While just 0.01% of food and drink sales worldwide are certified fair trade, in the United Kingdom, the world's biggest fair trade market, ethically sourced produce is big business. Supermarket shelves teem with fair trade products from all corners of the globe, as the British consume 9.7 million cups of fair trade tea, 6.4 millions cups fair trade coffee and 3.2 million fair trade bananas every day. Fair trade involves retailers paying a premium to suppliers in developing countries. ""It's about investment to be fair to everyone in the supply chain,"" says Brad Hill, fair trade director for The Co-operative, whose supermarket wing has recently moved to stock exclusively fair trade bananas. While consumers in the United Kingdom pay a marginal premium, if any, for ethically sourced produce, the practice can make a real difference at the source of production. Demetrio Gonzales, a banana grower from Panama, says his community was barely covering the costs of production before the introduction of fair trade. ""Through fair trade, we have been able to develop our community with investments in our water supply, and ways to improve our living conditions,"" he said. British consumers' rush to embrace fair trade products seems tied to widespread public awareness of fair trade principles. According to Hill, 96% of British consumers were aware of fair trade, compared to just 47% in other parts of Europe. ""There is potential for Europe to catch up with the UK in fair trade,"" he said. ""It's all about increasing awareness."" And, to a growing extent, popular consumer brands are taking the lead themselves. Popular chocolate goods such as Cadbury's Dairy Milk, Maltesers and Kit Kat are now fair trade, while ice cream producers Ben and Jerry's will switch to exclusively fair trade ingredients this year.","The United Kingdom is the world's biggest market for fair trade produce .
Sales of fair trade goods increased by 12% from 2010 to 2011 .
The growth in fair trade is significant in a struggling retail sector .

"(Health.com) -- Jillian Michaels catapulted to fame as the punishing trainer who got results on ""The Biggest Loser"" and ""Losing It with Jillian."" But the 38-year-old has always been just as interested in building confidence as she has in sculpting rockhard abs. It's no accident that her most recent book is ""Unlimited: How to Build an Exceptional Life."" Everything Jillian tackles -- including her recent gig as life adviser on ""The Doctors,"" her DVDs (such as her latest, ""Jillian Michaels Kickbox FastFix""), and her intimate podcast -- is meant to help the rest of us claim a healthier, happier life. Sitting high in the hills of Southern California, the woman who calls everybody ""buddy"" is surprisingly funny and self-deprecating. And, as expected, she's incredibly open, talking about her tough tween years, how she stays motivated (and how you can, too), and the dream she's fighting to make a reality. Do you see yourself as more of a life coach than a fitness trainer? For years, I always thought it was hilarious that I was this fitness guru, because fitness was just a tool I utilized to help people improve their confidence. For me, it's never been about fitness. It's always been about helping to empower people. Health.com: Get the body you crave with celeb-inspired workouts . What is the connection between physical fitness and self-confidence? I've always believed fitness is an entry point to help you build that happier, healthier life. When your health is strong, you're capable of taking risks. You'll feel more confident to ask for the promotion. You'll have more energy to be a better mom. You'll feel more deserving of love. What inspires you to take care of your own body? That comes from me. You can look for external sources of motivation and that can catalyze a change, but it won't sustain one. It has to be from an internal desire. You have to ask, ""Why do I want this?"" I want to be around for a family, and to feel good about my body. I want to set an example. My number-one piece of advice is: Look inside and find out what your ""why"" is. I don't care whose butt you've posted on the screen of your treadmill. Did you ever post a butt on the treadmill? I always thought Madonna was awesome, and I still do. I remember Linda Hamilton in ""Terminator 2,"" and just thinking, Really? That scene opens up and she's just banging out pull-ups, and I remember thinking, That's awesome. What other tips do you have for staying motivated? When it comes to your ""why,"" write it down and put it everywhere -- in your car, on your phone. Remind yourself constantly why you're doing what you're doing. Then remove any sort of temptation. Build a support system, whether it's a workout buddy or a mom from day care, so you have that person to call when you have a moment of weakness. Health.com: Jillian Michaels' tips for sticking with a workout . Can anyone get motivated? Are there impossible cases? Lazy doesn't exist. Lazy is a symptom of something else. The person who can't get up off their butt is just a person who's depressed. It's usually a pervasive lack of self-worth, or a feeling of helplessness. That's why fitness is so important. You have the ability to show somebody what she's capable of very quickly. As we get older, is time working against us? I really don't believe that. I've worked with people in their 50s and 60s, and I've had a very easy time taking weight off them. If you've been living in an unhealthy way, you might have been getting away with it for 10 or 15 years, but [you'll see] the cumulative effects of toxic living. It's not because you're old. If you leave a car out in the rain, it's going to rust eventually. It's a matter of, what are you eating? How are you living? There's no such thing as not being able to turn back the clock. It's never too late. You just have to change the way you live. What else will keep our bodies young? God, sleep! I really do prioritize my sleep -- I get seven to eight hours a night. Sleep, have sex (it's really good for your health), and eat organic whenever you possibly can. Health.com: Surprising health benefits of sleep . Do you ever watch yourself on TV? I find television to be a bit like a meat grinder. It's like, you have a cow, you put it through a meat grinder, and out comes a hot dog. It's almost unrecognizable. On ""Loser,"" I was a cartoon character. And I actually feel like ""The Doctors"" made a real effort to tone me down. So who is the real Jillian? I'm part Bridget Jones, part Larry David. I'm shy; I'm prude. You are? I am so prude. We didn't talk about that when I grew up. But on my podcast you see the sense of humor, the vulnerability, the passion. We talk about weight loss, bullying -- because I was bullied. When were you bullied? It didn't get really bad until I was in junior high. I was an overweight kid, and I went through a period where, oh my God, they were making cow sounds at me when I walked down the hallway and just humiliating me. Kids can be mean. My mom pulled me out of one school and put me in another, but when you wear that stigma, you start to believe it. When you wear that energy, other kids smell it like blood in the water. That's when I got into martial arts. I had a second-degree-blue-belt test, and I broke two boards with my right foot, and the next day I walked into school and no one ever picked on me again. I suddenly believed in myself and respected myself. I had some inkling of my power, so the bullying stopped instantly. Health.com: Are depressed kids bully magnets? You've spoken about your struggle to adopt a child. Is there any news? Oh, God, nothing has been this hard in my entire life. It's very complicated and it's very time-consuming and I'm committed to the process, but two years later, no update. Theoretically, I've been matched with a child. Now I'm just trying to get her home. How do you decompress? Yoga. I've been doing a lot of it. It takes me out of my own mind; I have to be present and think about my form.

"London (CNN) -- The European head of consumer goods giant Unilever believes that improving the company's environmental practices could help double its sales, such is the appetite from customers from sustainably-made products. Jan Zijderveld, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate's president of Europe, said there was a clear demand from consumers for ""green"" products. ""What they want is products from a company where they know that the company makes the products responsibly,"" he said. ""When they buy PG Tips they know that the tea is grown from sustainable plantations, they know that the way we make it and produce is in the most responsible (way) possible."" He said the days were gone when consumers were driven by low prices alone. ""The funny thing is that for the consumer, 'good value' doesn't necessarily mean 'cheap.'"" He rejected the suggestion that Unilever's environmental focus was simply ""greenwashing,"" saying it was ""part of our European heritage to build a decent business that is rooted in society and does the right thing."" While cynics might doubt the company's ability to make good on ambitious plans to double the business while halving its environmental footprint, he believed Unilever could be a world-leading example of corporate responsibility. ""We will prove to the world that this is the right plan and this is also the right sustainable plan for business."" Read also: BT CEO: Smartphones and tablets transforming workplace . While the company had strong global credentials, having operated in Asia for more than a century, it had recently been extending further into emerging markets such as Russia. ""As a global enterprise we really have to look at where the opportunities are, and that is where the people are, where the population growth is, where the economies are growing and the consumption is still low,"" he said. He saw opportunities for the future in Russia, China, Vietnam, Pakistan, Bangladesh, as well as in African markets, ""because in many of these countries the consumption is lower, they are not consuming many of the fast-moving consumer goods we sell."" The emerging markets compared favorably to Europe in their attitudes toward business, he said . ""The environment is much more pro-business ... they understand that business is a force for good. Business generates new products, it generates jobs, it pays taxes,"" he said. ""It is a lot easier to do business in the emerging world -- it is a lot more proactive, it is less bureaucratic."" He felt there was ""too much negativism"" towards business in Europe, and said he would like to see a cultural and policy shift to create a more dynamic, innovative business sector. ""To get the innovation through takes too long, to get approvals through takes too long, so things are just too slow and too bureaucratic,"" he said. ""If we want to reinvent this continent and make it creative, growing and dynamic, you need to loosen it up a little, give it some fresh air ... Europe needs a little bit of a spring clean to be able to innovate again and grow again.""","Unilever's Europe head plans to grow the business by stengthening green credentials .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A spokesman for President Hamid Karzai expressed dismay Monday over four airstrikes in recent days by international forces in which dozens of civilian casualties have been reported. ""That's unacceptable to the Afghan government,"" said the spokesman, Aimal Faizi. He said that Karzai had spoken with local officials and the families of the victims and then summoned International Security Assistance Force commander, Gen. John Allen, and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker to the palace for an explanation. Recently signed agreements between the United States and Afghanistan had been intended to stop such unilateral operations, said the spokesman. ""The reason for the MoUs and SPA was to Afghanize each and every thing in military operations and to put an end to unilateral operations,"" said Faizi, referring to two recently signed documents, a memoranda of understanding and a strategic partnership agreement over special operations. ""We do not have joint airstrikes,"" Faizi said. ""It is unilateral when it comes to an airstrike."" He added that Allen had promised to investigate the issue and report back to the president. ""General Allen said that his teams are investigating this incident and he regrets any loss."" A news release from the palace said: ""During these bombings by coalition forces, which started since this Sunday in the Logar, Kapisa, Helmand, and Badghis provinces of Afghanistan, dozens of Afghan civilians -- including women and children -- were killed or wounded."" Karzai told Allen and Crocker that civilian casualties and the bombing of Afghan villages are unacceptable, the news release said. ""President Karzai said that unilateral operations by NATO forces and bombing civilians is not only an issue of Afghan sovereignty, but it is also an issue of human life, which cannot be ignored."" The statement added: ""President Karzai said if the lives of Afghans are not safe then strategic cooperation between the two countries will lose its meaning and concept."" Sources close to the meeting said the news release represented an accurate portrayal of the meeting. ""We take all human loss of life very seriously,"" said Gavin Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman. An Afghan police official, citing initial reports, told CNN the Badghis incident, in the northwest, killed 14 civilians and wounded six others on Sunday. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said an airstrike in the province killed three insurgents. Separately, six civilians were killed in Helmand on Friday when an ISAF airstrike, called in by U.S. Marines under attack from insurgents, mistakenly hit a house containing children, the Helmand governor's office said in a statement. The statement said that insurgents had attacked ISAF and Afghan police checkpoints in Sangin on Friday and an airstrike against insurgent positions ""unintentionally"" killed six civilians who were in the same house. The statement said the dead included two boys, three girls and a woman. It added: ""ISAF forces also confirmed the event and apologized and they promised to help with the remaining members of the family."" A spokesman for U.S. Marines in Helmand, Lt. Col. Stewart Upton, said in an e-mailed statement: ""At this point in the investigation we are able to confirm the incident and will be formally apologizing in the next couple of days to the family. We are deeply saddened by any civilian deaths, and particularly regret incidents where civilians are killed as a result of actions by ISAF."" In eastern Afghanistan, attackers killed three U.S. soldiers Monday, a Western official said. The deaths occurred just south of a base in Ghazni province when an explosion hit the vehicle the soldiers were traveling in, said the official who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to discuss the incident with media outlets. Two Americans were wounded as well, the official said. The NATO-led force reported that three service members died in the bombing. More than 1,900 Americans and another 1,000-plus allied troops have died in the 10-year conflict. On Sunday, a NATO service member was shot to death by a gunman in an Afghan army uniform in southern Afghanistan, the allied command in Kabul reported. The attacker was killed by coalition forces who returned fire, the NATO-led force reported. The year has seen a number of attacks on coalition forces by Afghan forces or by insurgents who have disguised themselves as Afghan troops, fueling distrust at a critical period of the conflict. In another attack Sunday, a roadside bomb struck a vehicle carrying U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan, killing one American and wounding two, a Western official said. The bombing happened about 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of an outpost in Paktia province, near the Pakistani border, the official said. CNN's Masoud Popalzai and Nick Paton Walsh in Kabul and Joe Sterling in Atlanta contributed to this report .","""We take all human loss of life very seriously,"" says a U.S. Embassy spokesman .

"(CNN) -- Are you reading this article on your cell phone or tablet? These days, that makes you pretty normal, especially if you're American, according to a recent report from comScore. According to comScore, which tracks these sort of things, 55% of the 234 million cell phone subscribers in the U.S. are getting at least some of their media diet via mobile devices. Only Japan and the UK had higher levels of mobile media usage. People in the United States increasingly purchase more than one device to help them consume all this mobile content. According to comScore, 14% of U.S. cell phone subscribers also own a tablet -- the highest percentage in any of the countries comScore examined. In contrast, fewer than 5% of Japanese mobile subscribers also own a tablet. ""In less than two years, nearly 40 million tablets were in use among mobile subscribers in the U.S., outpacing smartphones -- which took seven years to achieve the same level of adoption,"" comScore noted. Driving this sharp growth was the expanded array of Android tablet options, especially Amazon's Kindle Fire, released in late 2011. Also, the iPad 2 release yielded another spike in tablet ownership. Does this mean people are shifting their media experience away from computers and smartphones -- or broadcast and print media -- to tablets? Not necessarily. Here's what comScore has to say on the matter: ""As tablets gain popularity among users, they are not replacing mobile phones or computers. Rather, it would seem that tablets are supplementing a multi-device diet that is increasingly becoming the norm among consumers. ... While smartphones may have provided consumers with a first taste of mobile Internet connectivity, tablets have furthered the rise of the 'digital omnivore' -- consumers who now go about their days engaging seamlessly through multiple online touchpoints."" Seamlessly? Well, sort of. A ""seamless"" cross-device media experience implies that you can easily pick up where you left off when switching devices. This is the case when reading Kindle e-books, whether via the Kindle smartphone or tablet app, on a Kindle e-reader or Kindle Fire tablet, or on a computer. Similarly, when you stream a Netflix movie to your TV or computer, and pause it, you can resume watching it from the same point via the Netflix app for mobile devices. But not all services work this well. If I'm watching a short film on the new Vimeo app for Android phones, pause it, put down my phone and turn on my TV, bring up my Vimeo account (I use AppleTV for streaming media), and select the movie I'd paused... it takes me back to the start of the movie. It doesn't remember where I stopped watching. Gamers often experience similar frustration when they try to continue a game in progress on a different device. How well you can sync a game -- if at all -- depends on the game and the devices involved. Sometimes that experience is seamless. Sometimes not so much. And all those long-form articles you want to read? Features like ""Reading List"" in Apple's Safari browser for computers and mobile devices -- or third-party services such as Instapaper -- allow you to sync a list of articles to read across devices. But they don't let you just pick up where you left off in the midst of a 8,000-word Harper's feature story. And they may not support offline reading. Syncing your content across multiple devices is a major technical challenge which will take time to solve. But so far, that kind of syncing isn't a big concern for most consumers. More commonly, people tend to use different devices to access content at different times of day or in different settings. For instance, comScore's analysis of traffic to news websites found that from about 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on a typical weekday, computers are the leading source of site traffic. Tablet traffic to news sites peaks in the evening. On weekends, however, tablet traffic to news sites peaks in the morning. Simultaneous use of multiple devices has already become major part of how we experience media. Last October, Nielsen found that 40% of people who own a smartphone or tablet use those mobile devices while watching TV. What do people do on their smartphones and tablets while watching TV? According to Nielsen, ""e-mail was the top activity for both men and women during television programming and commercial breaks. In addition, women reported engaging in social networking more than men, while men checked sports scores more often.""

"West Pokot, Kenya (CNN) -- More than 13 years after his parents drowned in a flash flood, David Kakuko is at the Moruny River, building a bridge that might have prevented their deaths. The hanging footbridge will provide safe passage over the Moruny, a frequently flooded waterway in West Pokot, Kenya. ""Before the bridge, there [were] so many people, so many who lost their lives,"" said Kakuko, 32. ""I know, because I have no parents. I have no parents, because this river took them."" Kakuko is working alongside other local residents and Harmon Parker, a master mason who has been building bridges through Kenya's mountainous terrain since 1997. Parker, a Lexington, Kentucky, native who came to Kenya in 1989, has seen firsthand how flash floods -- and the threat of predators such as crocodiles and hippos -- can make rivers impassable in isolated communities. ""I've worked all over Kenya,"" said Parker, 54. ""And every community [has] a story of ... loved ones lost."" When Parker arrived in Kenya as a young missionary, he befriended Jay Hindson, a fellow development worker who introduced him to a bridge build in 1996. The experience changed the course of his life. ""It was a plea from the community,"" Parker recalled. ""I saw that building a bridge could change lives and transform communities."" Parker has been building bridges ever since, and in 2003 he founded the nonprofit organization Bridging the Gap. The organization oversees the building of bridges that not only save lives but connect isolated villagers to resources that can improve their way of life. ""When it floods, people really suffer not being able to get to the clinic or the market or to their school,"" Parker said. ""Like every people, they have dreams. They want to prosper."" Since 1997, Parker has helped build 45 bridges in Kenya. He estimates they've affected tens of thousands of lives, but he insists his work is not about the numbers. ""I have built many bridges in very remote areas for the 'few and the needy' that a larger organization may not consider,"" he said. ""Knowing this bridge will probably save at least one life is what makes me tick. ... I build bridges because I want to save lives, lives that I will never know about."" Parker's hanging footbridges are simple in design, with an average length of 120 feet and an average cost of about $6,000. They are built using basic materials and local tools so villagers can maintain them and make repairs when needed. There is high demand for Parker's help. But because of limited financing, he is able to organize only five or six projects a year. To determine which projects he takes on, Parker visits the village that initiated the request. To qualify for a bridge, the river in question must be considered a peril to cross. It also has to inhibit access to education, health care or commerce. Parker also requires that the community demonstrate a willingness and ability to participate in the construction of the bridge, whether it's by gathering sand, making gravel or digging foundations. It's ""so they can take pride in their bridge, so that they feel they played a big role in it and that they have ownership,"" Parker said. Kakuko has no problem with making that commitment. ""It is good for us, because this is our bridge,"" he said. ""It is not for the men who gave it to us. It is ours. So people should guard and watch over it like it is their own."" Although the bridges are sponsored by donors, villagers are also expected to provide some form of financial contribution. ""I don't know how many goats I have in this region. But they always give me a goat,"" Parker said. ""I was even offered a young wife in a real rural area. And I had to refuse that."" Parker's work requires that he spend weeks, even months at a time away from his wife and home in Nairobi. And over the past 15 years, he's been robbed at gunpoint, plagued by parasites and afflicted with grave illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever. But he doesn't see his role as sacrificial. ""I feel I'm blessed ... privileged to do what I'm doing,"" he said. ""A bridge is a beautiful metaphor for many things. There are bridges of hope, bridges of peace, bridges of life. To me, bridges are beautiful."" Want to get involved?

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As the attention of the rugby world is drawn to Hong Kong this weekend for the Rugby Sevens, corporations are looking to capitalize on a sport that soon will become an Olympic event. Two dozen teams will pound the pitch, put in flying tackles and perhaps lose teeth in an effort to claim the 2012 championship trophy. For the New Zealand Sevens team, it's time to defend last year's victory. For spectators, it's a chance to run up a credit card bill on beer and bizarre costumes. But for HSBC, this year's tournament marks its return to the stands as a sponsor after a 17-year hiatus. ""There's more to sports than just the players on the field -- there's the financial funding,"" said DJ Forbes, the captain of the New Zealand Sevens. ""If a sponsorship deal is held in high esteem, potential sponsors are going be sure the money they invest is put in the right places."" But is the right place the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens? HSBC thinks so. Even as the bank is cutting tens of thousands of jobs worldwide, HSBC is investing in rugby ahead of the sport's inclusion in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. ""Rugby has changed enormously. The HK Sevens is a very popular tournament but was much more standalone than it is now,"" said Giles Morgan, HSBC Group head of Sponsorship and Events. ""That and its upcoming inclusion in the Olympics in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro have made the game much more international and much broader. "" But while HSBC has ramped up its sponsorship investment in Hong Kong, the ""world's local bank"" is winding down some of its Asian retail operations -- notably in Japan and Thailand, while cutting 30,000 workers worldwide by the end of next year. All of this is a cost-cutting plan as laid out by HSBC's Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver to save some $3.5 billion. Morgan quickly defends HSBC's sponsorship as a calculated strategy. ""We very much regard our sponsorship as a business -- with business objectives,"" he said. ""This is not about a fun investment. We are targeting key demographics and key geographies. ""It made sense for HSBC to come back,"" he added. ""We didn't know rugby was going to grow the way it did."" And it has grown. From the Hong Kong Sevens first tournament in 1976 that featured just nine teams, it now invites 24 teams spanning every continent except for Antarctica. It now pulls in profits for Hong Kong on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. Morgan declined to comment on how much HSBC actually invests in sponsoring this year's Hong Kong Sevens but he says the bank aims for a three-to-one return on sponsorship investment. But it is rare for any company to know its rate of return on investment, according to one Hong Kong advertising firm. Not only that, companies may pay a prestige premium that comes with being a title sponsor for high-profile sporting events because there are so few of them. In American football there's only one Superbowl. In international football, there's only one World Cup. In Hong Kong, there's only one Rugby Sevens Championship. So why invest in the Sevens then? For HSBC, it helps target specific clients in markets like Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore --hub cities the bank is targeting for growth, even as it streamlines elsewhere, Morgan said. ""With strong expat communities you'll be looking at strong growth."" HSBC is sharing title sponsorship of the Rugby Sevens with Cathay Pacific, whose global hub is Hong Kong. ""We're looking for sponsorships that really help build Hong Kong and help bring people in to make the city a tourist destination,"" says Camilla Taylor, Cathay Pacific's Marketing Manager-Events. ""We target a lot of different groups, including average rugby fans around the world. We're trying to promote the Sevens to a wider audience."" Cathay has been investing in the Hong Kong Sevens for much of the last 35 years. Aside from a seven-year break from 1997 to 2004 in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the territory's flagship air carrier will likely not fly away as a Sevens sponsor soon, Taylor said. While HSBC, Cathay Pacific and other sponsors refuse to divulge their investment or returns, Hong Kong gladly throws its books wide open. The Hong Kong Tourism Board says last year's Rugby Sevens drew in more than 21,000 spectators from overseas. The average Sevens spectator from abroad spent $1,650 over the course of six days. In total, Hong Kong raked in more than $289 million in direct economic benefit. Companies are counting that as thousands descend on the city, more spectators may notice that DHL ad on the Jumbotron in Hong Kong's Central bar district, notice the Cathay Pacific billboard streak by on a Citybus, or notice that red-and-white HSBC banner flutter in the Sevens stadium breeze.","Despite cuttings tens of thousands of jobs, HSBC returns to sponsor the Rugby Sevens .

"(CNN) -- More than 8,000 people have died in the violence surrounding the Syrian uprising in the past year, a U.N. official said Tuesday. And a new Amnesty International report released Wednesday says Syrians detained by the regime are subjected to systemic torture. Dozens of women and children in Homs were some of the latest victims, killed in what activists describe as a massacre over the weekend. The victims were all stabbed to death and burned after ""Syrian forces and thugs"" stormed their homes, according to a member of the Syrian Revolution General Council. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime insists ""armed terrorist groups"" -- which it routinely blames for the violence -- were behind the killings in the Karm al-Zaytoun neighborhood. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. CNN's Arwa Damon was able to recently report from inside Syria after she and a CNN crew were secretively taken into Homs with the help of local activists. What do the most recent reports of brutality mean for the future and will the violence only worsen? Damon, now in Lebanon, explains: . Question: The latest attacks in Homs as described by the opposition are especially brutal -- have there been similar reports in the past and do you think these type of atrocities are getting worse? Damon: The situation most certainly seems to be worsening. Activists are warning of revenge killings and are warning that they will not be able to control the masses for much longer, which is one of the main reasons why they are calling for international intervention. There were two similar incidences in Karm al-Zaytoun in January, though neither was on this scale. Q: What role does sectarian divides play in all this? And is the violence expanding into other areas? Damon: Just about every Syrian across the spectrum is very quick to declare that sectarianism doesn't exist. That being said, they do admit to sectarian undertones to what is happening, especially in Homs. The concern is that if the situation isn't resolved, these sectarian undertones could emerge which would be utterly devastating. In the recent attacks in the Karm al-Zaytoun neighborhood, the families were, according to the opposition, all Sunni. The neighborhood is actually a mixed neighbhorhood of Alawite and Sunni. A few weeks ago, activists from Homs were telling us that the neighborhood had basically divided. There was one main road that moved through it, and all of the Alawite families had moved to one side, the Sunni families to another. [Alawites comprise a branch of Shia Islam; they are a minority in Syria with Sunnis being about 74% of the population, according the CIA Factbook.] . And what's incredibly difficult in all of this is really trying to independently verify what is taking place. But there is one thing that is undeniable, and that is that this horrific cycle of death continues. And many people are growing increasingly concerned about the underlying sectarian nature of this type of violence. If the situation isn't resolved, activists are warning that these types of massacres will be more widespread. Q: What were things you kept hearing from the people there when you were in Syria? What was the toll of living in this type of situation taking on the people, especially women and children? Damon: It is wrecking the population physically, mentally, emotionally. There is hardly a person who hasn't lost someone they know to violence or has been detained by the regime. Children are traumatized by the violence. Women are unable to protect their children and are left feeling helpless, vulnerable, frightened. The psychological impact is profound. (Related: Life and death under Syria's military onslaught) Q: U.N. special envoy to Syria, Kofi Annan, recently left Syria after talking with al-Assad about proposals to end the bloodshed. Annan said he's staying hopeful. What has been the reaction to this from activists? Damon: It's very difficult to gauge exactly where [Annan's] sense of optimism is coming from. A lot of activists, following those comments, were posting things to Twitter like, ""Kofi Annan is being blinded by his humanitarian blinders."" Others saying that he quite simply was unable to see the truth, because the opposition firmly believes that the Assad regime has absolutely no intent of reforming. Trying to bring about any sort of concrete plan that would result in that peace that everyone really does want -- that part most definitely is true -- is going to be incredibly difficult, because both sides are quite simply so polarized and so hardened against one another because of all of the bloodshed. The Assad government is saying that it is not going to relent in its pursuit of these terrorist armed gangs. The opposition is saying that it won't even entertain the notion of sitting at a negotiating table until some sort of cease-fire is implemented. And many members of the opposition won't even entertain the notion of negotiating with the Assad regime to begin with. They would have to see the president, his entourage removed from power before they will even begin to try to negotiate any sort of way forward. So it's a very, very difficult situation. But both sides are warning that if some sort of resolution does not take place, the violence is only going to escalate to even more unimaginable heights.","Dozens of Syrian women, children were stabbed and burned to death, activists say .

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces determined to quell a three-month uprising stormed the northern village of Badama, near the Turkish border, a witness and an activist said Saturday. Units entered the village equipped with at least six tanks, 21 armed personnel carriers, 10 security buses and randomly fired at houses, the Syrian activist said, adding that security forces also closed the road to the village of Khirbet Aljooz. Two activists said the forces shelled the mountains around Badama, causing a fire that will block refugees and aid. Jameel Saib, an eyewitness near the Turkish border, told CNN people that displaced Syrians trying to enter Badama to get bread and supplies saw the Syrian forces close roads leading to the border. If Badama is taken, Syrian refugees who want to escape the violence in their country will have no medicine or clean water, Saib said. ""This is a starvation war they're waging,"" he said. Turkish helicopters were flying in the area, Saib said. CNN could not verify on which side of the border the helicopters were operating. Meanwhile, the British government Saturday advised its citizens to leave Syria immediately and not travel there. ""Those who choose to remain in Syria, or to visit against our advice should be aware that it is highly unlikely that the British Embassy in Damascus would be able to provide a normal consular service in the event of a further breakdown in law and order and increased violent civil disorder,"" the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. Violence in Syria and an offensive in and around the town of Jisr al-Shugur has spurred thousands of people to make their way to the border region. Turkish officials are worried that the crisis could deteriorate and destabilize the area. The Turkish government said Saturday more than 10,100 Syrians have crossed the border. About 3,000 more were on the border near Badama, Saib said. More than 1,100 people may have died since the unrest across Syria began in mid-March after teens were arrested for writing anti-government graffiti in Daraa, according to Amnesty International. The Syrian government has consistently blamed the protest casualties on ""armed gangs."" International pressure on the regime continues to grow. The United States is collecting information on possible war crimes by Syrian security forces amid the crackdown, a senior Obama administration official said Friday. The White House faces pressure from critics who say the administration has been slow to respond to crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. The administration is lobbying members of the U.N. Security Council to support a resolution on Syria that, as another administration official put it, ""would send a strong message to President (Bashar) al-Assad."" Actress Angelina Jolie met with Syrian refugees in Turkey on Friday and drew attention to the anguish faced by families -- and families torn apart -- by the violence in Syria. The refugees are living in four camps managed by Turkey and the Turkish Red Crescent, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""The people in this camp have fled in fear for their lives, and many told me they were distraught about the safety of loved ones still in Syria,"" Jolie said, according to the refugee agency.

"(CNN) -- China may be flexing its growing economic and military muscles, but the country's leadership is concerned about its vulnerability on a more nebulous front: culture. The Chinese authorities are clamping down on the type of content being broadcast on the airwaves and websites within the country -- which already restricts and censors a lot of material -- aiming to promote Chinese culture and reduce outside influences. The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, warned the Communist leadership not to loosen their grip on the country's cultural scene. ""We must clearly see that the international hostile forces are stepping up strategic attempts to westernize China, and ideological and cultural fields are a focus for long-term infiltration,"" Hu said in an essay published this week in Seeking Truth, the Communist Party's official magazine. The essay was based on a speech Hu made to a meeting of party leaders in October where a broad agenda was set out to strengthen the role of Chinese culture in the country. The publication of Hu's speech comes as China prepares to revamp its top leaders this year. And it follows a series of crackdowns on dissent after a string of uprisings last year against authoritarian regimes in the Arab world. Amid the nervousness generated by that climate, Chinese leaders are worried that ""the party's propaganda is no longer working,"" said Jeremy Goldkorn, the founder of Danwei.org, a popular English-language website about China. Television appears to be a key front in the cultural conflict outlined by Hu. In a stark example of the changes the authorities are seeking, the Chinese State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, the top broadcasting watchdog, announced Tuesday that the number of entertainment shows being aired in the country at prime time had dropped by more than two thirds at the end of the year, to 38 from 126 previously, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. The sharp fall was prompted by a directive issued by the watchdog in October -- the same month as Hu's speech -- intended to rein in ""excessive entertainment"" on the country's TV screens, Xinhua said. The order, which came into effect January 1, restricted the number of entertainment programs that satellite channels can broadcast each week to two, with a maximum of 90 minutes of content defined as entertainment allowed during prime time -- between 7:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. The Xinhua report said that the channels had instead ""started to broadcast programs that promote traditional virtues and socialist core values,"" including documentaries and cultural and educational broadcasts. The Chinese authorities say they want to keep outside influences at bay, but the general public devours a lot of imported content. China has a strict quota of 20 foreign films per year, but preliminary figures as of mid-December indicated that Western film franchises like ""Transformers"" and ""Harry Potter"" were likely to occupy the top four box office spots for 2011, according to state media. Chinese citizens are also increasingly interacting with the rest of the world, notably the United States. The number of Chinese students enrolled at U.S. colleges and universities in the 2010-11 academic year rose 23% from a year earlier to 158,000, according to the Institute of International Education, an nonprofit organization. To capture the attention of its own citizens and those abroad, the Chinese government appears eager to develop programming that shows off China's own culture. In his essay, Hu admitted that China lags the United States and Europe in successfully exporting its cultural output. ""The overall strength of our culture and international influence is not commensurate with China's international status,"" according to Hu. The West , he said, ""has a stronger culture and media landscape"" internationally. Hu listed a number of prescriptions to help China catch up, including, ""Cultivate a high degree of cultural awareness and cultural self-confidence, improve the quality of the whole civilized nation, and enhance national cultural soft power."" But China faces the challenge of generating more appealing indigenous content even as it imposes restrictions on TV companies' schedules and citizens' freedom of expression. Fearing that the turmoil in many countries across the Middle East and North Africa would incite further unrest in its own population, the Chinese government last year ""expanded restrictions on online information and access to communication services, reported government propaganda in domestic news outlets, restricted the freedom of foreign journalists, and arrested dissidents with little or no cause,"" according to a report published in November by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a panel that advises the U.S. Congress. Beijing has put pressure on operators of microblogs to censor posts after criticism and debate flourished on the forums, notably in the aftermath of a fatal train crash in July near Wenzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang. And as of last month, microblog users in Beijing and many other cities have to register for the services with their real names, although they can choose to publish comments under a pseudonym. And the government may impose further restrictions in the future. The recent developments are ""part of what's going to be over the next few years a continual tightening on culture and media,"" said Danwei's Goldkorn, a longtime observer of the Chinese media scene. ""Things are not going to get any more liberal when it comes to news, media, films, TV and the internet,"" he said. CNN's Steven Jiang, Chi-Chi Zhang and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","'Hostile forces' are trying to 'westernize' China, the president says in an essay .

"(CNN) -- If you happen to browse upon a news story that's too odd to be true Wednesday, hold your outrage and check the calendar. A Lebanese newspaper ran a caricature last year of two opposition leaders hugging in light of April Fools' Day. It's April Fools' Day -- when media outlets around the world take a break from the serious business of delivering news and play fast and furious with the facts. No one quite knows when the practice began, but any journalist will point to what is undoubtedly the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled: A 1957 BBC report that said, thanks to a mild winter and the elimination of the spaghetti weevil, Swiss farmers were enjoying a bumper spaghetti crop. The segment was accompanied by pictures of farmers pulling strands of spaghetti from trees -- and prompted hundreds of viewers to call in, wanting to know how they could grow their own spaghetti trees. While not as elaborate, the pranks that media outlets harvested this year have been quite rich: . The Guardian in London ran a story Wednesday announcing that, after 188 years as a print publication, it will become the first newspaper to deliver news exclusively via Twitter. Twitter, a micro-blogging site, allows users to post updates that are 140 characters long. In keeping with the limitation, the newspaper said it had undertaken a mammoth project to retool the newspaper's entire archive. For example, Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight from New York to Paris, France, was condensed to: ""OMG first successful transatlantic air flight wow, pretty cool! Boring day otherwise ... sigh."" The news isn't always black and white. The Taipei Times, one of three English-language dailies in Taiwan, fooled many readers with a report that two pandas donated by China to the Taipei Zoo were, in fact, brown forest bears dyed black and white. To render a whiff of authenticity to the story, editors made a reference to China's tainted-milk scandal that sickened 300,000 people last year. But the story contained enough outrageous lines to clue in readers. Among them, a quote from a souvenir stand operator who worried the panda deception would affect sales of her ""stuffed panda toys, panda T-shirts, panda pens and notepads, remote-controlled pandas on wheels, caps with panda ears on top, panda fans, panda flashlights, panda mugs, panda eyeglass cases, panda face masks, panda slippers, panda wallet and panda purses."" Sometimes, of course, the pranks backfire. In Australia, the Herald Sun newspaper drew hundreds of angry comments Wednesday after a story on its Web site said a Chinese construction firm wanted to buy naming rights to the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Many readers did not realize the story was a hoax -- despite a quote from a spokeswoman named April Fulton. iReport.com: Share your best April Fools' office pranks and jokes . Geoffrey Davies, the head of the journalism department at London's University of Westminster, said such pranks do not particularly affect the credibility of a news organization. ""They are done in a way that you know it's a joke,"" he said. ""In the Guardian story, for example, the clue is in the name of the journalist [Rio Palof] -- which is an anagram for April Fool. People look out for them really, and therefore, you kind of open the paper trying to spot the spoof story."" Of course, news outlets aren't the only ones who hoodwink readers on April 1. The town of Rotorua, a popular tourist stop in New Zealand, said a rotten egg smell that permeates the town is such an aphrodisiac that Playboy founder Hugh Hefner wants to build a mansion there. Microsoft Corp. said it is releasing a new Xbox 360 video game, ""Alpine Legend,"" which will do for fans of yodeling what ""Guitar Hero"" did for rock music. And car manufacturer BMW announced in ads in British newspapers that it had developed ""Magnetic Tow Technology."" ""BMW Magnetic Tow Technology is an ingenious new system that locks on to the car in front via an enhanced magnetic beam,"" the ad said. ""Once your BMW is attached you are free to release your foot from the accelerator and turn off your engine."" Steve Price, features editor of the Taipei Times, said such hoaxes are not only good for a laugh but serve a purpose. ""It highlights an important aspect of media that readers and viewers should keep a critical mind when they read stories or watch TV,"" he said. ""I think that is especially true with the advent of the Internet and the proliferation of blogging."" The origins of pulling pranks on April Fools' Day is unclear. Some believe it dates back to the time when the Gregorian calendar was first adopted, changing the beginning of the year to January 1 from April 1. Those who still held on to the Julian calendar were referred to as ""April Fools."" Traditionally, the pranks are pulled before noon on this day. But a wildly successful prank this year was conceived and executed much earlier. Millions of Web users fell for a video that claimed to be the first flying five-star hotel in a converted Soviet-era helicopter. The 37-second clip, which was posted online Thursday, was an elaborate computer-generated hoax by the airport hotel chain Yotel. If you were one of the many who fell for the prank, hold your disappointment. You can still reserve rooms on the moon through Hotels.com or book flights to Mars through Expedia.com for $99. But hurry. The offers end Wednesday.","If a news item seems especially outrageous on April 1, it just may be a hoax .

"(CNN) -- World leaders are meeting in Seoul this week to discuss how to deal with the threat of nuclear terrorism. The effort to prevent the misuse of nuclear materials and the spread of nuclear weapons has long-placed most emphasis on defensive measures. These are essentially on the ""supply side"" -- aiming to choke off the flow of nuclear weapon components and radiological materials to terrorists. While there is a place for such steps, there is another, and perhaps more successful way, to accomplish the goal. One of the gravest threats to nuclear proliferation arises from the nations that use proxy groups -- seemingly independent organizations that are paid to further the interests of governments. Ending or reducing the use of such proxy groups has real potential to reduce the availability of such materials to terrorists. Perhaps the single, most dominant security threat stems from the nuclear-tipped country of Pakistan, with its accepted use of proxy groups to promote the perceived national interest. Third-party transfer, where a country receiving weapons sells or gives them to another party, is always a danger, and with it looms the possible catastrophe of nuclear weapons in the wrong hands. It is clear that the U.S. government is working hard with Pakistani officials to ensure that security at nuclear facilities and radioactive material storehouses is more robust. This has been taking place for years. For example, David E. Sanger and William J. Broad's New York Times article in 2007 (U.S. Secretly Aids Pakistan in Guarding Nuclear Arms) describes initiatives undertaken from the time of the Clinton and Bush administrations and the complexities associated with efforts to work with an ally that remains fundamentally ""suspicious"" of our intentions. But the broader question remains: Why does Pakistani leadership continue its half-hearted support for counterterror practices aimed at those in a position to acquire such materials? For one thing, Pakistan has a legacy of using proxy groups to promote its national security interests that goes back at least to the 1950s. At the time, Prime Minister Mohammad Daud Khan of Afghanistan worked to stoke nationalist demands and aspirations from the Pashtun population in geographical locales near the ""Durand Line,"" the disputed border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. In turn, Pakistani leaders used Islam as a framework and its own proxies as counterweights, to promote an alternate vision of a unified region unfettered by political instability and social unrest. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (""Army of the Righteous"") is perhaps the most prominent Pakistani proxy in the contemporary world because it is generally recognized as having carried out the Mumbai terrorist assaults in 2008. This terrorist group is long known for its fierce struggle in Kashmir against Indian-supported political leaders and Indian security forces. To be sure, Pakistan is not the only country in South Asia that practices international politics in this way; India has also used its own set of proxies to promote national interest in effective and sustained ways in places such as Afghanistan and Bangladesh. But while the use of proxies in the region is not especially new, the risks nowadays are compounded by the presence of nuclear weapons and radiological materials. It is vital that Pakistan comes to grips with its use of proxy groups and explores alternatives. The use of proxies in pursuit of national policy also has implications with respect to Iran, with its track record of trying to enhance its power in Iraq by supporting insurgents and providing know-how for the building of improvised explosive devices. In Afghanistan, where the weak Karzai government remains unable or unwilling to meet its security obligations outside of Kabul, Iranian proxies wield their influence. It is likely that Iranian leaders support the Shia organizations in Sunni-dominated Pakistan as well as Shia militant group Sipah-e-Muhammad with the broader aim of destabilizing Pakistan, in no small part to undermine American efforts in the region. What does that portend for possible short-run relationships between Israel and Pakistan if Iran is deemed a common threat? In turn, what does that portend for the United States from its own geostrategic position? We should take a page out of the conflict resolution literature playbook and use bargaining techniques that seek to isolate and identify motivations behind Pakistan's position on the use of proxy groups. For example, the fears and anxieties political leaders experience often drive ""hard-line"" bargaining positions on issues, and knowing what those fears are in the case of Pakistan, U.S. leadership can work to relieve those fears by providing alternatives. Another technique is to break down large seemingly unsolvable problems into smaller, more manageable ones. For instance, the broader policy of drone use by the U.S. can be broken down into smaller policies where agreement is possible. One possibility is putting in place tighter restrictions to satisfy Pakistan's leaders on when drones should be used, in what specific cases or as backups to other forms of interdiction. In turn, compromises like those can and should be linked to issues of importance to the U.S. such as stronger Pakistani support for U.S. talks with the Taliban and greater transparency by the Pakistanis about security policies. Such talks might start a process that could lead to new agreements that come closer to confronting Pakistani proxy use. All of this requires unequivocal American commitment to Pakistan for the long haul, to allay fears of abandonment. Against that backdrop, such problem-solving efforts would generate alternatives that might lead to innovative thinking about new security arrangements in Pakistan and other countries such as India and Afghanistan. It is possible to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and radiological material dissemination by reducing reliance on proxy groups, and that could be our most effective tool in this ongoing battle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Chasdi.","World leaders meeting in Seoul to discuss security measures against nuclear terrorism .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square. I was told they were rehearsing for the annual National Day parade on October 1, which people eagerly awaited. Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949. Weeks later, however, I was informed that the civilian and military parade had been cancelled in the spirit of ""simple-living and hard struggle,"" as Chairman Mao decreed. The real reason: Lin Biao, then defense minister and Mao's anointed successor, had reportedly died in a plane crash while attempting to flee the country after a failed coup attempt. China's achievements in the last 60 years have come in zigs and zags. The best place to look back at what China went through in the past six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Behind it lies the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where China's Emperors used to live. The emperor is now history, but Tiananmen remains Beijing's political center. It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic. ""The Chinese people have stood up!"" he declared in a shrill Hunanese accent. For decades, the whole nation followed Mao loyally. He emphasized political mobilization of the common man, especially the peasantry. In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear. Mao proved to be good at fighting but poor at governing. He pushed sweeping socio-economic initiatives and strident ideological campaigns, often with disastrous results. During two political campaigns in the late 1950s, over 550,000 ""rightist"" intellectuals were persecuted and imprisoned. The Great Leap Forward led to widespread famine and the deaths of an estimated 30 million Chinese. In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution. There, he rallied hundreds of thousands of young Chinese -- the radical Red Guards -- who lionized him like a demi-god. ""To rebel is justified!"" they proclaimed. They rebelled against everything and wreaked havoc everywhere. For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise. Perhaps the only factor that kept the country from total collapse was the people's incomparable resilience and their ability to ""chi ku"" (eat bitterness, or bear hardship). Mao's reign is also credited for positive changes. He banned child brides and polygamy, built Beijing's first subway line and started a space program with China's first satellite launch. In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United Nations. Still, for three decades under Mao, China tried to break out of its backwardness and isolation but only met modest success. Mao died in 1976 and his remains are kept in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.  Take an audiovisual tour of Mao's hometown » . Soon enough, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the new paramount leader. Deng overturned most of Mao's policies and embarked upon reforming the economy and opening up the country to the outside world. His quest for stability and prosperity took off in the early 1990s, propelled by his pragmatic policies to entice foreign investments and build China's private sector. Just south of Tiananmen, one landmark stands as a symbol of Deng's bold open-door policy. In the early 1980s, the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened in Beijing, just a stone's throw away from Mao's mausoleum. Today, the fast food chain still does brisk business, with a large portrait of founder Colonel Sanders hanging on the three-story building. Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy. Old Guards and conservatives in and outside the communist party accepted Deng's reform policies, but with a great deal of misgiving. The backlash came to a boil in 1989, when Tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for the students who called for freedom and democracy, and more reform. After six weeks of heady demonstrations, the Tiananmen movement was brutally suppressed.  See landmark moments in China's 60 years » . China has returned to world prominence through a 20-year economic boom, the speed and breadth of which is unparalleled in the history of mankind. China went from global economic irrelevance to the third largest economy in the world.

But pomp and pageantry aside, China's phenomenal economic growth over the decades has triggered unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income gaps, endemic corruption, rising criminality, environmental degradation and social malaise. Millions of Chinese live on less than $1 a day, and social tension sometimes boil over into violent clashes. Chinese president Hu Jintao is pushing to promote democracy in the party, curb corruption and seek a harmonious society.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- He was one of the most recognizable and influential voices in rock n' roll, and he never sang a note. So in the wake of Dick Clark's death, Americans of all stripes -- including music icons -- shared memories throughout the night and into Thursday. It wasn't just that Clark first introduced the world to likes of Buddy Holly and James Brown as host of the influential ""American Bandstand."" It was that his fresh-scrubbed, boyish image and enthusiasm bridged a racial and political divide, making it OK for America's youth to listen to music that often troubled its older generation. It is what really made him ""America's oldest living teenager,"" a moniker he earned thanks to his youthful appearance. Voice silenced . Clark, 82, suffered a heart attack Wednesday while at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica for an outpatient procedure, his publicist Paul Shefrin said. ""Attempts to resuscitate were unsuccessful."" The family has not yet decided whether there will be a public memorial service for the multifaceted Clark, although Shefrin said, ""There will be no funeral."" 'America's oldest teen' Dick Clark dies . In December 2004, Clark suffered what was then described as ""a mild stroke,"" just months after announcing he had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. That stroke forced Clark to cut back on his on-camera work, including giving up the hosting duties for the ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve"" specials. He appeared briefly as a co-host with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2005. Clark anguished each year over whether to continue appearing on the annual show because of limitations on his speech from the stroke, U.S. Rep. David Dreier, a longtime friend, told CNN Wednesday. Opinion: The smooth, unstoppable Dick Clark . ""But then he would get deluged by people who were stroke victims and other people who had infirmities and they were such admirers of his fighting spirit,"" said Dreier, R-California. Broadcast pioneer . Born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, New York, on November 30, 1929, he began his broadcast career working at a radio station managed by his father. Clark's ""American Bandstand"" began as a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956. The show was picked up by ABC and broadcast nationally a year later. By 1958, it was the show to watch, with 40 million viewers tuning in to learn about the latest in music. ""If you didn't go on 'American Bandstand,' you hadn't made it yet,"" singer Aretha Franklin told CNN's ""AC360."" The savvy entrepreneur was a pioneer in introducing African-American groups and other performers to millions of young TV viewers. His audiences were among the first integrated on television. In 1960, the Ku Klux Klan sent death threats to Clark when he brought his short-lived ""American Bandstand"" spinoff ""The Dick Clark Show"" to Atlanta. The National Guard was called in to protect the show and its integrated audience -- black and white teens. ""Dick understood the connection that music had. It wasn't about black, it wasn't about white,"" Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men told ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" While ""The Dick Clark Show"" lasted only a few seasons, ""American Bandstand"" continued to be a staple in living rooms across the country. Clark's image was dealt a blow in 1959 that nearly derailed his career when he got caught up in Congressional hearings into payola, the practice of record companies paying money or making extravagant gifts to radio stations to play their artists' albums. He admitted to taking gifts, but never money, according to news reports at the time. Clark survived the hearings, but he was forced to end his involvement with a record company. As rock n' roll came of age, Clark played an influential role in shaping music careers, from Ike and Tina Turner to the Beach Boys to Madonna. ""Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark,"" said singer Tony Orlando, who was 16 when he first appeared on Clark's show in 1961. Clark hosted the show until 1989. It was canceled a few months after he left the show. Cultural icon . ""American Bandstand"" has long been considered the forerunner to musical shows, lending its blended format of musical performances, easy banter and interviews to such staples as ""Soul Train"" and MTV's ""TRL."" It also gave way to the birth of Clark-esque television and radio hosts. Seacrest, in a statement to CNN, expressed his deep sadness for ""the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark."" ""He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life,"" Seacrest said. ""I idolized him from the start, and I was graced early on in my career with his generous advice and counsel. When I joined his show in 2006, it was a dream come true to work with him every New Year's Eve for the last six years."" Friends, admirers mourn Dick Clark . Another major figure on the music scene was too upset to talk about Clark's death. Radio host Casey Kasem's wife, Jean, told CNN that Clark served as substitute host for Kasem's popular ""American Top 40."" ""We just feel that he was one of the most magnanimous human beings that we ever knew in the industry,"" she said. Clark became wealthy as a businessman, producing successful TV shows through Dick Clark Productions. He created the American Music Awards in the 1970s, a competitor to the Grammy Awards. He sold the company to Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder in 2007. ""One of the real draws when we purchased Dick Clark Productions was the opportunity to build on the tremendous foundation of programming that this icon of American broadcasting created,"" Snyder said. ""I got to know Dick over the past five years, and he was just as personable and warm in person as he was on television. Once you got to know Dick, it was obvious why he was so beloved by his fans. He was, in every sense of the word, a giant."" Clark also hosted numerous other television favorites, including the ""Pyramid"" game shows and ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes."" ""This guy was the best,"" said singer Freddy Cannon, who appeared on ""American Bandstand"" 110 times. ""He helped me from the very bottom of my career all through the '80s and the '90s, and he's going to be missed a lot."" Former CNN talk show host Larry King said Clark's secret for success was his ability to be natural on camera. ""The hardest thing in the business is to be yourself, and no one knew that better than Dick Clark,"" King said. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Clark in its nonperformer category in 1993. Singer Donny Osmond said Clark was one of a kind: ""If someone cannot fill your shoes, you are a legend. And Dick Clark was a legend."" Clark's passing follows by less than three months the death of another TV dance show icon, Don Cornelius, the creator of ""Soul Train."" Cornelius was found dead of what authorities said was a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Los Angeles February 1. He was 75. Clark, who was married three times, is survived by his wife, Kari, two sons and a daughter. This story was reported by CNN's Alan Duke, Denise Quan and JD Cargill in Los Angeles, and written by Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta.","Dick Clark suffered a heart attack at a hospital in Santa Monica, his publicist says .

"(CNN) -- At midnight last Tuesday, two men were traveling in a black four-wheel drive through the Somali capital, Mogadishu. One was Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, the most wanted terrorist in Africa. Mohammed had survived more than a decade on the run, at least one attempt on his life, and a $5 million price on his head for planning the 1998 attacks on the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. But his luck was about to run out in the chaos of Mogadishu, where the frontlines in the battle between the weak transitional government and al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab shift almost weekly. His vehicle headed toward a government checkpoint, possibly after taking a wrong turn. According to several accounts it tried to speed through, setting off a firefight with police. Mohammed was killed, but to begin with the Somali security forces had no idea who he was. Only when they discovered cell phones, a South African passport, a substantial amount of cash and a laptop did they realize this was someone of significance. So his body -- which had been rapidly buried -- was exhumed, according to Somali military officials. A sample of his DNA was sent to Nairobi, where U.S. officials confirmed it was Mohammed. They had taken DNA samples from his wife and children some years ago. The other man in the vehicle may also have been a senior al-Shabaab figure by the name of Musa Dheere, according to Kenyan officials. Somali officials have not publicly announced the identity of the second man. Mohammed's death means that in the past six weeks three of al Qaeda's most important figures have been killed, the others being Osama bin Laden and Ilyas Kashmiri in Pakistan. Operationally, Mohammed was one of al Qaeda's most effective figures: a bombmaker with aliases, multiple passports and disguises that enabled him to move in and out of Somalia. The forged passport found in the vehicle had a recent exit stamp from South Africa, according to Somali officials. He is held responsible for making al-Shabaab's attacks more lethal in recent years, using an influx of foreign fighters and suicide bombings. Several hundred foreign jihadists -- from Kenya, Sudan, Europe, North America, Iraq and Pakistan -- have made al-Shabaab a more effective group. Several of the foreign jihadists have come from the United States, with at least two (one from Minneapolis and one from Seattle) carrying out suicide bombings. Mohammed was also reputed to have developed ties with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen across the Red Sea. ""Fazul Mohammed was certainly one of the key members of the al Qaeda old guard,"" says Candyce Kelshall of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham in England. That structure is ""now fragmented and splintered into stand-alone operating networks that are loosely linked by association around the world,"" she says. ""The death of Mohammed and Musa Dheere has effectively removed the top half of the al Qaeda network's explosives expertise in the region,"" says Kelshall. Ugandan officials suspect Mohammed -- who was probably in his late 30s -- advised on the bombings of two bars in Kampala last year, in which 79 people were killed. Al-Shabaab attacked Uganda because it had troops in Mogadishu as part of the African force (AMISOM) protecting the transitional government. Ugandan soldiers help protect government ministers and the Presidential Palace. Ironically, the Kampala bombings may have indirectly contributed to Mohammed's death. They prompted Uganda to inject more manpower into Mogadishu. And a recent offensive by Somali troops backed by AMISOM firepower has pushed al-Shabaab out of several districts of the capital -- for now. Mohammed appears not to have been familiar with the latest frontlines. The United States has had some success in tracking down al Qaeda militants in Somalia -- with special forces killing Saleh Ali Nabhan two years ago. Nabhan had been involved in simultaneous attacks against Israeli tourists in Kenya in 2002, involving a suicide bombing at a Mombasa hotel and an attempt to bring down an Israeli airliner with a SAM-7 missile. The closest the United States came to killing Mohammed appears to have been a strike early in 2007 on a coastal village close to the Kenyan border. He escaped, but many civilians were killed. But gathering useful intelligence in a country as large and anarchic as Somalia is an uphill struggle. And the transitional government is invariably preoccupied with clan-driven power struggles rather than taking on al-Shabaab. In recent days, a confrontation between the president and prime minister has spilled over into deadly street protests. Last week, CIA chief Leon Panetta told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ""the threat from al-Shabaab to the U.S. and Western interests in the Horn of Africa and to the U.S. homeland is significant and on the rise... As al-Shabaab faces increasing international pressure, we may see the group increase its international attacks."" Mohammed's death may deprive Shabaab of some of its international reach. His ability to move in and out of Somalia was important to the group's ambitions to spread jihad throughout east Africa. But al-Shabaab is well-entrenched in central and southern Somalia, where a few dollars are enough to recruit young men with no hope of a job. According to intelligence sources, al-Shabaab's revenues include taxes levied at ports like Kismayu, cash from the Somali diaspora and possibly a levy on pirates' ransoms. Kelshall says al-Shabaab ""has come of age -- its young tactical leaders are possibly more potent, more technically savvy and politically astute than any of the other networks."" And al-Shabaab does not seem to have been knocked off its stride by Mohammed's death. Two days after he was killed, Somalia's interior minister was assassinated at his home by a female suicide bomber. Al-Shabaab quickly claimed responsibility.","Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was an elusive and talented bombmaker .

"(CNN) -- A small passenger plane crashed Monday into a hill outside the capital of Honduras, killing all 14 people aboard, officials said. ""The impact of the plane was pretty strong, it would have been very difficult for a person to have survived, given the way the fuselage looked,"" said Oscar Triminio, a spokesman for the fire department. The twin-engine Let L-410 aircraft had taken off from the northwest city of San Pedro Sula carrying 12 passengers and two pilots and was en route to Toncontin International Airport in the capital city of Tegucigalpa, the Honduran Civil Aviation Department said. The airline, operated by Central American Airways, is not affiliated with a U.S. airline with the same name. At about 8 a.m., once it had been cleared to land, the plane began descending toward the airport but lost communication with the control tower, the department said. Rescuers were then alerted. The crash site was just south of Tegucigalpa at the top of a hill some 2,000 feet (600 meters) above sea level, near the town of Santa Ana Francisco Morazan, Triminio said. The weather was cold and foggy, as it had been since the weekend, he said. One of the pilots had initially survived the crash, but died on the way to the hospital, he said. The first people to arrive at the crash site were residents of the nearby village who found one of the pilots still alive. ""It's sad to hear a person in the rubble asking, 'Help! Help! Help!' "" said Jorge Sandrez, mayor of Santa Ana. Emergency personnel were searching for the data recorders to help in the investigation. The bodies of the 11 men and three women were taken to a morgue in Tegucigalpa for identification by relatives. Civil aviation authorities identified three passengers as Americans. They gave CNN a list of those on the flight. Also among the victims were Rodolfo Rovelo, who other news organizations have identified as assistant secretary for public works; Jose Israel Salinas, who has been identified as a trade union leader; and Carlos Chain, a former finance minister. Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this story from Santa Ana, Honduras .","All 12 passengers and 2 crew were killed .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli police evicted 15 Jewish settlers from a an illegally occupied house in the restive West Bank city of Hebron on Wednesday following a weeklong showdown between the settler community and Israel's Defense Ministry, which administers the occupied territory. ""We are determined to make sure that the rule of law and the authority of the state of Israel over all its citizens will be assured. When there is a violation, it will be put back to track,"" Defense Minister Ehud Barak told reporters shortly after the operation and explained that ""the house was taken over by citizens against the law."" The men, women and children were removed without any violent resistance, police said. About two dozen settlers moved into the Hebron house in the middle of the night last Thursday, claiming they had legally purchased it from a Palestinian man. But Palestinian authorities, including Hebron police Chief Ramadan Awad, disputed that the purchase was made legally. ""Our investigation shows no evidence that the house was sold to settlers by Palestinians,"" Awad told CNN. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement Wednesday that tried to strike a balance between demands from the settlement-supporting members of his governing coalition and the laws regulating settlement growth. ""We strengthen the Jewish settlements in Judea and Samaria and we strengthen it in Hebron, the city of our fathers,"" he said, using the biblical term for the West Bank. ""But there is one principle we maintain: We do all that while abiding the law and will continue to do so."" Imad Hamdan, general director of the Hebron rehabilitation committee of the Old City of Hebron, said the eviction process will help to reduce tensions. ""I believe this is a good step forward,"" he said. Hamdan said that if the settlers appeal the eviction, ""we are going to go against them and we will prove the ownership of this building to whom it belongs. They have evicted the settlers from the house, but they have not removed any furniture or belongings of the settlers that they have been bringing into the house since they have illegally moved in,"" Hamdan said. Responding to those claims, Barak stressed that the facts ""will be checked according to the legal standards by the proper authorities."" On Monday, the Israeli Defense Ministry, citing the absence of required paperwork and prior notification, ordered the settlers to move out of the home by Tuesday afternoon or be subject to forcible eviction. Hebron is the largest and most contested city in the West Bank. It is home to more than 180,000 Palestinians and several hundred Jewish settlers who live in an enclave protected by the Israeli military. Movement for Palestinians in the area is extremely limited. The city, which is believed to be the biblical burial site of Abraham, is home to the religious holy site known as the Cave of the Patriarch to Jews and the Ibrahimi Mosque to Muslims. Relations between Israelis and Palestinians living in Hebron have been marked by years of hostility and tension that have frequently erupted into violence. Netanyahu asked Barak on Monday to postpone the eviction to allow the settlers to present their legal case, but Barak ordered the operation to go ahead. The eviction triggered an immediate wave of criticism from many members of Netanyahu's coalition who have become increasingly critical of Barak's continued role in the government. ""Defense Minister Ehud Barak is dragging the entire government into direct confrontation with the settlers,"" said Danny Danon, the outspoken deputy speaker of the Israeli Knesset, or parliament, and Likud party member. ""Netanyahu must replace Barak without delay. He is running a failed political campaign on the account of the settlers. We will not give up and will pursue legal proceedings to allow the acquisition of the house,"" he told CNN. The eviction followed an announcement from Netanyahu on Wednesday seeking to legalize construction in the West Bank settlements of Bruchin, Sansana and Rechalim. Further development on the three West Bank outposts has been banned, according to settlement watchdog group Peace Now, because they have been built on private Palestinian land. Netanyahu also asked his attorney general to develop a legal solution that would prevent the planned destruction of housing units in the West Bank settlement of Beit El. The Israeli government is under court order to demolish the houses built in the settlement by May 1 of this year. Danon welcomed the decision and said: ""These houses were built under the consent and sponsoring of the government, there is no reason to demolish them."" The eviction comes as the Israeli government announced that Netanyahu will meet with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad next week in an effort to restart direct negotiations. In retribution for the eviction, Hamdan added, Israeli settlers from Tel Rumeida in the old city of Hebron burned a tent that was set up by Palestinian activists in protest of the taking over of the house. No one was injured. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces told CNN that ""the structure will remain closed off until all the legal issues will be determined."" CNN's Guy Azriel, Kareem Khadder and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: PM tries to strike balance between settlement backers, laws on settlement growth .

"New York (CNN) -- Former ESPN writer Anthony Federico apologized Monday for writing an offensive headline about basketball sensation Jeremy Lin, calling it ""an honest mistake."" The controversial headline read ""Chink in the Armor: Jeremy Lin's 9 Turnovers Cost Knicks in Streak-stopping Loss to Hornets."" The phrase -- Chink in the Armor -- contains a word that has two meanings; one is an ethnic slur. ""I'd love to tell Jeremy what happened and explain that this was an honest mistake,"" Federico told the New York Daily News in an interview published Monday. ESPN fired Federico and suspended Max Bretos, an anchor who used the same phrase, the sports network said Sunday. Federico told the paper, ""ESPN did what they had to do."" The ESPN headline Saturday morning was up for 35 minutes before being removed, but the damage was done. ESPN apologized Saturday stating, ""We again apologize, especially to Mr. Lin. His accomplishments are a source of great pride to the Asian-American community, including the Asian-American employees at ESPN."" Federico offered a similar apology in the interview with the Daily News. ""I'm so sorry that I offended people. I'm so sorry if I offended Jeremy,"" he said. Lin, 23, came off the bench earlier this month to guide the New York Knicks to win after improbable win. The unlikely star of Taiwanese descent quickly turned into a global brand and ""Linsanity"" became the phrase of the times. Lin addressed the controversy during a news conference Sunday following the Knicks' 104-97 win over the Dallas Mavericks, the defending national champions. He said he did not think the headline was intentional. ""I don't think it was on purpose,"" Lin said. ""At the same time, they've apologized. I don't care anymore."" In reflecting on his time at ESPN, Federico told the New York Daily News, ""I had a career that I was proud of.""","Former ESPN employee Anthony Federico tells the New York Daily News, ""I'm so sorry""

"Washington (CNN) -- If case you had any doubts, don't -- Bill Clinton's fully on board President Barack Obama's re-election effort. ""Barack Obama deserves to be re-elected president of the United States,"" the former president said Sunday night, as he joined the current officeholder at a fundraiser for the Obama re-election campaign. It was a very different story four years ago, when Clinton was the biggest and most vocal supporter of his wife, Hillary Clinton, in her historic battle against Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton was a critic of then-Sen. Obama, arguing that the freshman senator wasn't ready to handle the duties of the Oval Office. Among Clinton's most controversial comments came when he challenged Obama's claim to be more against the Iraq War than Hillary Clinton. ""Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen,"" the former president said at the time. But that was then. After Hillary Clinton ended her bid for the nomination, she and her husband took to the campaign trail to help Obama win the White House. The rest is history: Sen. Obama became President Obama and Sen. Clinton became Secretary of State Clinton. Now, as Obama runs for a second term in the White House, Bill Clinton will once again serve as one of the current president's most high-profile surrogates. ""I think he is beating the historical standard for coming out of a financial collapse and a mortgage collapse. I think the last thing you want to do is to turn around and embrace the policies that got us into trouble in the first place,"" Clinton said at the Sunday fundraiser at the Virginia home of former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, a longtime member of the Clinton inner circle. ""We need to keep going forward by re-electing Barack Obama president of the United States."" Later, at the same event, Obama praised his predecessor and joked that ""you guys get two presidents for one out of this event, which is a pretty good deal."" But it's not just fundraisers -- the former president had the starring role in an Obama campaign video that generated a lot of buzz after it went up online Friday. ""The president is the decider in chief. Nobody can make that decision for you,"" Clinton says in the Web video, discussing Obama's decision-making process to give the go-ahead to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Tuesday is the one-year anniversary of the al Qaeda leader's death. ""Look, he knew what would happen. Suppose the Navy SEALs had gone in there and it hadn't been bin Laden. Suppose they had been captured or killed. The downside would have been horrible for him, but he reasoned, 'I cannot in good conscience do nothing.' He took the harder and the more honorable path and the one that produced in my opinion the best result,"" Clinton adds in the video. The video also questions whether Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would have given the same order. An Obama re-election official told CNN, ""What's clear is that the Democratic Party is unified for the 2012 campaign,"" and added that ""President Clinton will help raise money for the campaign at three fundraisers and we anticipate more activity on the trail as the election approaches."" The former president can help the current White House occupant in a number of ways: Clinton's an extremely talented political strategist and surrogate who can campaign for the president in places such as the Rust Belt and parts of rural America where Obama may not be so popular. With the economy remaining the top issue on the minds of Americans, someone like Clinton touting Obama could remind them of better economic times. ""Former President Clinton represents economic strength in the eyes of most Americans,"" Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala said. ""There is no one with more economic credibility than President Clinton -- so when he says President Obama will revive the economy and save the middle class, folks listen. I expect to see Clinton making the case all over the country in 2012,"" added Begala, who was a top adviser in the Clinton White House and who now is a senior adviser to Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. Beyond his campaigning and fundraising, Clinton has also come to Obama's aid in his elder statesmen missions for the Obama administration in Haiti and North Korea. And while offering constructive criticism of some of Obama's actions in the first two years of his presidency in his 2011 book ""Back to Work,"" Clinton also makes the case for the Obama White House and appears to mark a warmer relationship between the two men. Expect the requests for Bill Clinton to keep coming. A source close to the former president points out that since Hillary Clinton's role as secretary of state will continue to keep her off the campaign trail this cycle, the former president will be busier than ever. Of course, there appears to be something in this equation for Clinton too. By lending Obama a helping hand, Clinton continues to erase any lingering bad memories from the Clinton-Obama clash during the 2008 primaries. And just in case his wife decides to make another bid for the White House in 2016 (never say never), helping Team Obama now could pay dividends in four years.","Four years ago, Bill Clinton was the biggest and most vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton .

"London (CNN) -- 22 November, 1947; A Village Near the River Euphrates . When Pembe was born, her mother was so sad she forgot about the pain she had suffered for twenty-six hours and the blood oozing between her legs, and tried to get up and walk away. At least, that is what everyone said -- everyone who was present in the delivery room on that blustery day. As much as she might have wanted, the new mother could not go anywhere. To the surprise of the women in the room and her husband waiting in the courtyard, she was yanked back into the bed with a new wave of contractions. Two minutes later the second baby was born. Another girl, only smaller. Watch an interview with Elif Shafak . This time the new mother did not attempt to run away. She gave a wisp of sigh, burrowed her head into the pillow and turned toward the window, as if straining to hear fate's whisper in the wind. If she listened attentively, she thought, she might hear an answer from the skies. After all, there must have been a reason, an explanation unbeknown to her but obvious to Allah, as to why He had given them two more daughters when they already had six, and still not one son. Thus the new mother clamped her lips shut, determined not to say a word until Allah had explained to her, fully and convincingly, the motive behind His actions. During the next forty days and nights she did not speak a word. Not when she was cooking chickpeas with sheep's tail fat, not when she was giving her six daughters a bath in a large round tin bucket, not when she was making cheese with wild garlic, not when her husband asked her what she would like to name the babies. She remained silent as the graveyard by the hills where all her ancestors were buried and some day so would she. It was a small, secluded Kurdish village with no roads, no electricity, and no secrets under the sun. Whatever took place in one corner was heard, at once, by everyone else. Secrets were a luxury only the richest could afford and in this village no one was rich. The village elders were three ageless men who spent their time in the only teahouse contemplating the mysteries of the universe and the stupidities of the politicians while they sipped tea out of glasses fragile as life. When they heard about the new mother's oath of silence, they decided to pay her a visit. ""We came to warn you that you are about to commit sacrilege,"" said the first man who was so old the slightest breeze knocked him down. ""How can you expect Allah the Almighty to talk to you when He is known to have spoken only to prophets and saints?"" asked the second man who had a few teeth left in his mouth. ""Surely there was no woman among them."" The third man waved his hands which were stiff and gnarled. ""Allah wants to hear you talk. If it had been any other way, He would have made you into a fish."" The woman listened, now and then dabbing her eyes with the ends of her headscarf. For a moment, she imagined herself as a fish -- a big, brown trout in the river, its fins glittering in the sun. Little did she know that her children and grandchildren would, at different times in their lives, feel attached to different kinds of fish, and an affinity with the piscine would run in the family for generations to come. ""Speak!"" said the first old man. ""It is against nature for your kind to be quiet. What goes against nature goes against Allah's will."" When the guests had left, the woman approached the cradle where the twins were sleeping. The shimmer from the lighted hearth painted the room a golden-yellow, giving the babies' skins a soft glow, almost angelic. Her heart mellowed. She turned to her other daughters who had lined up beside her from the tallest to the shortest, and said, in a voice both hoarse and hollow: . ""I know what I'll name them."" ""Tell us, Mother!"" the girls exclaimed, delighted to hear her talk again. The woman cleared her throat and said, with a sigh, ""This one will be Kader and the other, Yeter."" ""Kader and Yeter,"" the girls echoed in unison. ""Yes, my children."" Upon saying this, the woman smacked her lips as if the names had left a sour taste on her tongue. Kader and Yeter. Destiny and Enough. This would be her way of telling Allah that even though, like a good Muslim, she was resigned to her fate, she had had her fill of daughters and the next time she was pregnant, which she knew would be the last time because she was forty years old and past her prime now, He had to give her a son and none other than a son. That same evening when her husband came home, the girls rushed to give him the good news: . ""Daddy! Daddy! Mother is speaking."" ""Daddy! Daddy! Mother has named the babies."" Pleased as he was to see his wife talking again, the man's face clouded over when he learned about the names she had chosen. Shaking his head with disapproval, he remained silent for a long, awkward moment. ""Names with an insinuating message to the skies might offend Allah,"" he muttered, as if talking to himself. ""Why draw His wrath upon us? Better stick to ordinary girls' names and be on the safe side."" He had an alternative pair of names in mind: Pembe and Jamila -- Pink and Beautiful. Names like sugar cubes that melted in your tea, sweet and yielding, with no sharp edges. Though the father's decision was final and irreversible, the mother's choices would not be easily forgotten. They lingered in memory and stayed around, tied to the family tree like two flimsy kites caught in the branches. Thus the twins came to be known by both names: Pembe Kader and Jamila Yeter -- Pink Destiny and Enough Beauty. And such would be the names printed in the newspapers around the world one day.","Elif Shafak is an award winning novelist who writes in Turkish and English .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Rory Stear appeared on the Principal Voices roundtable last year, his company Freeplay Energy was best known for cranking out wind-up radios you could, well, crank up. Last year, former Principal Voice Rory Stear and his wife Kristine Pearson were named TIME 'Heroes of the Environment.' Africa was the main beneficiary of its best-known product, the Lifeline radio. This year, the emphasis is on India, where, like Africa, millions of rural poor live without access to electricity. ""When you've got one billion people and that kind of energy poverty it's almost a perfect storm for us,"" Rory Stear says. Freeplay Energy started manufacturing its first products in India in February. So far, around 6000 ""Farmers' lights"" and ""Farmers' torches"" have been distributed in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. By the end of the year, it hopes to be supplying lights, radios and other products to the rest of the country. Entering India . For Freeplay Energy, the move into India has been a long time coming. It took years of research. Eventually the decision hinged on finding a ""first-rate"" partner. Stear says he found just that in Devin Narang, former chairman of the Narang Group. One of India's oldest industrial houses, the group was founded by Devin's great-grandfather in 1905. ""In my mind this is the business of the future, especially for India,"" Devin Narang says. ""There are 600,000 villages, out of which 40,000 will never get electricity in our lifetime. The cost of transition is very high, it's prohibitive."" In the poorest villages, families use kerosene to power traditional Hurricane lamps. Fire isn't the only risk. Kerosene is known to cause health problems, and its cost can be excessive for local people. While the official rate for one liter of kerosene is 11.5 rupees, or 28 cents, on the black market it can sell for as much as 90 rupees, or more than two dollars. The lantern costs a lot more -- around 800 rupees -- but Freeplay hopes it will replace the two to three liters of kerosene used by each family every month. By that measure, after 13 months, the power created by the ""Farmers' light"" would effectively be free. The hope is that wind-up lanterns will eventually replace the country's hurricane lamps, providing up to 20 minutes of ""shine time"" for each minute of winding. After Principal Voices . Within months of appearing on the Principal Voices roundtable, TIME magazine named Rory Stear and his wife Kristine Pearson as two of their ""Heroes of the Environment."" Kristine heads up the Freeplay Foundation, the charity Freeplay Energy founded in 1998. It was the foundation that did the early work researching solutions to energy poverty in Africa and India. click here to read about Freeplay in Africa. Of his Principal Voices' experience, Rory says: ""It was thrilling to be asked. It's certainly great recognition of our work and that has been an extremely positive thing. ""It's an extremely well known program now and to be a part of it implies a certain gravitas,"" he adds. ""Ultimately the recognition of the whole issue of energy poverty has helped to push it into the world scene."" At last year's Principal Voices roundtable, Rory Stear asked: ""How can we enable access to self-sufficient energy by those who need it the most yet can afford it the least?"" With the help of local partners in Africa, and now India, he's going some way to finding the answer.","Freeplay Energy founder Rory Stear appeared on Principal Voices in 2007 .

"Chardon, Ohio (CNN) -- A funeral service is planned Saturday for 16-year-old Daniel Parmertor, one of three students killed in an Ohio high school shooting. The shooting occurred Monday in the Chardon High School's cafeteria where authorities say T.J. Lane opened fire at the students. Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire. The shooting rocked the school and the community of 5,100 people about 30 miles east of Cleveland. Students returned to school Friday as they tried to return to resume their daily routines. Grief counselors and police were on hand, and the principal led a moment of silence. ""Everyone is here for each other,"" Senior Garrett Szalay said. ""But a lot of us are moving on."" Authorities say T.J. Lane, 17, is responsible and charged him with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault. The latter is related to the student who was ""nicked in the ear"" by a bullet, according to Geauga County Prosecuting Attorney David Joyce. Friday marked the first full school day since the incident, a return that administrators and staff touted as key to helping people through the healing process. Staff spent two days working on the transition and expressed confidence that they'll be ready to provide comfort and support to those still trying to make sense of this week's carnage, School superintendent Joseph Bergant said. Frank Hall, an assistant football coach and study hall teacher who chased the gunman from the school, said Thursday it was important that students and staff return -- if for no other reason than to ""show that terror and evil do not win out."" ""I'm here to tell you that tomorrow our schools will be open, our teachers will be there, our administration will be there, our parents and community, but more important our children will be there,"" Hall said. Meanwhile, the legal process continues. Joyce, the prosecuting attorney, filed charges against Lane on Thursday in juvenile court. The defendant's next court appearance will be Tuesday and a hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court. The murder charges state that the teenager ""purposely and with prior calculation and design"" fatally shot three people while at Chardon High. The prosecutor has said that the sophomore confessed that he took a .22-caliber gun and a knife into the school Monday morning and fired 10 rounds as frightened students and some teachers ran for cover. By the time the bloodshed ended, three were killed: Parmertor, who died Monday; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died Tuesday morning; and Russell King Jr., 17, who was declared brain dead Tuesday. Lane's friends have said that the teen had a troubled childhood. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged with holding a different woman under running water and bashing her head into a wall. ""I think there's a lot of kids that go through things like that. That doesn't give them the right to kill other people,"" said Bob Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's grandfather. "" No one has the right to shoot other people because they've had a rough life."" CNN's Laura Dolan, Martin Savidge, Josh Levs and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","Funeral service will be held Saturday for Daniel Parmertor .

"(CNN) -- The feds call industrial hemp a controlled substance -- the same as pot, heroin, LSD -- but advocates say a sober analysis reveals a harmless, renewable cash crop with thousands of applications that are good for the environment. Industrial hemp, left, looks a lot like its cousin in the cannabis family, marijuana. Two North Dakota farmers are taking that argument to federal court, where a November 14 hearing is scheduled in a lawsuit to determine if the Drug Enforcement Administration is stifling the farmers' efforts to grow industrial hemp. The DEA says it's merely enforcing the law. Marijuana and industrial hemp are members of the Cannabis sativa L. species and have similar characteristics. One major difference: Hemp won't get you high. Hemp contains only traces of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the compound that gets pot smokers stoned. However, the Controlled Substances Act makes little distinction, banning the species almost outright. Marijuana, which has only recreational and limited medical uses, is the shiftless counterpart to the go-getter hemp, which has a centuries-old history of handiness. The February 1938 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine heralded hemp as the ""new billion-dollar crop,"" saying it had 25,000 uses. Today, it is a base element for textiles, paper, construction materials, car parts, food and body care products. It's not a panacea for health and environmental problems, advocates concede, but it's not the menace the Controlled Substances Act makes it out to be.  Watch why a North Dakota official thinks the U.S. should be in the hemp business » . ""This is actually an anti-drug. It's a healthy food,"" explained Adam Eidinger of the Washington advocacy group Vote Hemp. ""We're not using this as a statement to end the drug war."" Rather, Eidinger said, Vote Hemp wants to vindicate a plant that has been falsely accused because of its mischievous cousin. North Dakota farmers Wayne Hauge and Dave Monson say comparing industrial hemp to marijuana is like comparing pop guns and M-16s. They've successfully petitioned the state Legislature -- of which Monson is a member -- to authorize the farming of industrial hemp. They've applied for federal permits and submitted a collective $5,733 in nonrefundable fees, to no avail, so they're suing the DEA. North Dakota is one of seven states to OK hemp production or research. California would have made eight until Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last week vetoed the California Industrial Hemp Farming Act, citing the burden on law enforcement which would have to inspect hemp fields to make sure they were marijuana-free. Administration skeptical of initiatives . The DEA claims the farmers' lawsuit is misguided because the agency is obligated to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. ""Hemp comes from cannabis. It's kind of a Catch 22 there,"" said DEA spokesman Michael Sanders. ""Until Congress does something, we have to enforce the laws.""  The difference between marijuana, industrial hemp » . Asked if the DEA opposes the stalled House Resolution 1009, which would nix industrial hemp from the definition of marijuana, Sanders said the Justice Department and President Bush would make that call. ""When it comes to laws, we don't have a dog in that fight,"" he said. The Justice Department has no position yet on the resolution, said spokesman Erik Ablin. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, however, is skeptical because of the burden hemp would place on law enforcement resources. Also, hemp advocates are regularly backed -- sometimes surreptitiously -- by the pro-marijuana movement, the office alleges. ""ONDCP cautions that, historically, the hemp movement has been almost entirely funded by the well-organized and well-funded marijuana legalization lobby,"" said spokesman Tom Riley. ""All we do is ask people not to be naive about what's really going on here."" Often, the hemp movement -- like hemp legislation -- is inextricably tied to marijuana. Pot advocates like actor Woody Harrelson and activist Jack Herer have double or ulterior agendas when they expound the virtues of hemp. Not so with Monson, 57. The assistant GOP leader in the state House, who returned to the family farm where he was reared in 1975, said he became interested in hemp in 1993 when scab, or Fusarium head blight, devastated his wheat and barley crops. Monson grows canola, too, but wants another crop in his rotation. Soybeans are too finicky for the weather and rocky soil. Monson also tried pinto beans, fava beans and buckwheat with no luck. ""None of them seemed to really be a surefire thing,"" he said. ""We were looking for anything that was potentially able to make us some money."" Hemp, said the lifelong farmer, seemed an apt fit. It likes the climate, its deep roots irrigate soil, it doesn't need herbicides because it grows tall quickly and it breaks the disease cycles in other crops, Monson said. States follow Canada's lead . About 20 miles north of Monson's Osnabrock farm lies the Canadian border, the hemp dividing line. Just over the border in Manitoba, farmers have been reaping the benefits of hemp since 1998, when Health Canada reversed a longtime ban. In a Vote Hemp video, Shaun Crew, president of Hemp Oil Canada Inc., a processing company in Sainte-Agathe, praised Canada's foresight in differentiating between hemp and marijuana. While marijuana THC levels can range between 3 and 20 percent, Canada demands its hemp contain no more than 0.3 percent. In some hemp, the THC levels can sink as low as one part per million, Crew said. ""There's probably more arsenic in your red wine, there's more mercury in your water and there's definitely more opiates in the poppy seed bagel you ate this morning,"" Crew said on the video. The North Dakota Legislature is convinced, as are the general assemblies in Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Montana and West Virginia. With his state's blessing, North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Roger Johnson is backing the farmers and has proposed modeling North Dakota's hemp laws after Canada's strict regulations. ""We weren't just going to tell the DEA to take a hike,"" Johnson said. ""We're serious about this, and we want to do it in concert with the DEA."" In a March 27 letter to Johnson, Joseph Rannazzisi of the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, said the permits were denied because the state hadn't satisfied the agency's security and logistical requirements. Security aspects require careful evaluation because ""the substance at issue is marijuana -- the most widely abused controlled substance in the United States,"" Rannazzisi wrote. ""We've been terribly brainwashed"" Hemp wasn't always banned in the U.S. Jamestown Colony required farmers to grow it in 1619. Even after Congress cracked down on marijuana in 1937, farmers were encouraged to grow the crop for rope, sails and parachutes during World War II's ""Hemp for Victory"" campaign. Jake Graves, 81, heeded the call. Graves, whose father grew hemp in both world wars and whose grandfather grew it during the Civil War, was a teen when his father died in 1942. At the time, Graves' family was growing hemp for the Army. The Graveses continued growing hemp on their 500-acre Kentucky farm until 1945, when the market dried up after the advent of synthetic fabrics and the post-war reinvigoration of international trade. But Graves stands by the crop and its versatility and says that by lumping hemp in with marijuana, lawmakers ""threw the baby out with the wash."" ""We've been terribly brainwashed as a society,"" Graves said. ""Man didn't use it for all those hundreds and hundreds of years without knowing what they were doing."" In the U.S., tapping hemp's versatility relies on imports. The DEA clamped down on most hemp imports in 1999 and 2001, but relented after a Canadian company sued, saying the ban violated its rights under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Though advocates considered it a victory, Johnson said hemp won't be fully utilized until it can be grown and researched stateside. ""For us to grow it isn't enough. You have to build that infrastructure,"" Johnson said. ""None of those uses is really going to develop to any great degree until we're able to grow this commodity."" Johnson said the farmers' Vote Hemp-funded lawsuit has no hidden agenda. It's aimed solely at allowing farmers to grow hemp -- without going to jail because federal law says hemp and marijuana are the same. ""I've got a state Legislature saying they aren't and the entire world saying they aren't. This is about a crop that is a legitimate crop every place else in the world,"" Johnson said. ""It's not a crusade thing. It's a crop. Let farmers grow it. We don't want anyone to be growing drugs."" E-mail to a friend .","Fast-growing hemp used for food, paper, textiles and car parts .

"(CNN) -- J.C. Chandor is one of Hollywood's hot new names. For his feature film debut, ""Margin Call,"" he wrote the script and directed a cast that included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons and Demi Moore. His work on the film, about a Wall Street firm facing collapse after an employee (Zachary Quinto) finds out its holdings are going to be worthless, has garnered him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. His next film stars Robert Redford as a man lost at sea. At 37, he may seem like a wunderkind, but the former commercial director has been looking for his break for 15 years. He spoke to CNN about how the film came together, the challenges of building tension and his promising future. The following has been edited and condensed from the original transcript. CNN: ""Margin Call"" had a great cast. Were there problems in attracting it? J.C. Chandor: Attaching actors was actually not really the challenging thing with the film. Getting actors to say yes is one thing, but having the money there and the crew there and have everything happen at the same time is where you run into quasi-impossibility. For a long time, we had the actors but no money. CNN: Jeremy Irons plays the head of the firm and pressures it to dump its bad investments on others so it can save itself. He's been characterized as the villain. Chandor: The interesting thing is that Jeremy Irons' character is right, certainly following all norms of common understanding of business ethics. He has a piece of information before anybody else does, there's a fair market value set for something, and he has a responsibility to his shareholders and his employees and his company to do something about that. The tension comes from (the fact) that the audience wants one of (the employees) to do something. Hopefully, as the information travels up the chain of command, you see (the characters) in their own way regretting, or glossing over and moving on, or all the different emotions that happen when you see your own role in a tremendously damaging event. CNN: Your background was making commercials. Any we'd recognize? Chandor: I never was a very prominent commercial director, to say the least. I did a lot of things for energy drinks and Subaru, rally racing and Red Bull. Lots and lots of different industrials. If it was underpaid and under-budgeted, I was doing it. CNN: Now that you're an Oscar nominee, are projects now falling into your lap? Chandor: Yeah. Amazingly, this has been sort of the cherry on the sundae. The reception to my script once we were in production was very strong. The biggest trick in the game, even at studio films, is to try and get actors attached to your piece. We had managed to attract this cast without any money, without a studio, without anything else. It's been a slow, pleasant climb over the last two years since we shot the film. The film was very well received for what it was, which has allowed me to direct again, and everybody made their money back, so I've been pretty blessed from that standpoint. So now we gotta go keep trying to get the opportunity to do this again.","J.C. Chandor has an Oscar nomination for ""Margin Call"" screenplay .

"New York (CNN) -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration faced its first public oversight hearing Monday as a part of a probe into what went wrong during last month's blizzard, with administration officials saying they should have declared a snow emergency. City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn called the response ""unacceptable,"" as New Yorkers braced for another winter storm that forecasters say could dump six to 12 inches of snow beginning Tuesday night. She said the holiday blizzard ""brought New York to its knees in a way we have never seen before,"" asking administrators why a state of emergency was never called. Deputy Mayor of Operations Stephen Goldsmith said the decision not to call an emergency was based on its requirement to remove unchained cars from roadways, which could have created confusion among the thousands of drivers who would have been forced to look for parking. It was a move, he said, that later proved to be the wrong decision. Goldsmith -- who is responsible for city agencies that include police, fire and sanitation -- identified several issues that led to the slow response. He said New York had insufficient accountability tools, which led to a lack of information on street conditions, and delayed using city snow removal equipment. The city also failed to get and use private resources fast enough, didn't communicate enough with the public and had problems with emergency communications, he said. Goldsmith also added that only half the city's sanitation trucks were equipped with radios, making it hard for them to respond to changing weather conditions as snow began falling at up to 2 inches per hour. Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty called it the ""most difficult storm"" he had ever faced, blaming the coincidence of the holiday travel season that brought higher numbers of weekend travelers. But Councilman Peter Vallone said the administration failed in the planning stages, including carrying out adequate pre-salting of roadways, plus what he called its failure to communicate the seriousness of the blizzard to the public. Bloomberg came under intense criticism after telling New Yorkers to go to a Broadway show, seemingly downplaying the gravity of the crisis, during the height of clean-up operations. He later reorganized the Sanitation Department and rolled out a series of measures and pilot programs meant to improve city response during future storms. Goldsmith said the administration planned to outfit every sanitation truck with global positioning systems and other monitoring measures, including ""scout teams,"" meant to send up-to-date information back to City Hall. However, Vallone said equipment problems ""may explain missing a few blocks,"" but does not explain ""missing a few boroughs."" As the city grappled with one of the largest storms in its history, some neighborhoods in the city's outer boroughs remained snowbound for days. The snow hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. Thousand of emergency calls to 911 dispatchers remained backlogged, prompting the mayor to urge residents not to dial 911 unless it was a life-threatening emergency. Hundreds of city buses and ambulances remained stuck, prompting officials to ask the states of New York and New Jersey for ambulance loans to help reduce the backlog of emergency services requests. In one instance, a newborn died in Brooklyn after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders, according to New York Fire Department spokesman Steve Rittea. ""Why did we not err on the side of caution (in declaring a state of emergency) when lives were at stake?"" asked Sanitation Committee Chairwoman Letitia James during Monday's hearing. Goldsmith said the city needed a broader range of options in an emergency declaration, including one that would not require car removal. Sanitation union representatives, who have defended workers against accusations of an intentional slowdown amid rumors of a supervisor retaliation for budget cuts and demotions, did not speak during Monday's hearing. Department of Investigations Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn said she is conducting an independent review into the allegations. But the rumors that appeared to reflect an inner-city squabble have also raised deeper questions into how state deficits could affect public-sector services, and vice versa. During last month's blizzard, an army of private contractors joined thousands of public sector employees in New York, working overtime to salt, plow and shovel the city's five boroughs. New York hired 86 private firms to bolster snow removal efforts, Doherty said, at a price tag that remains unclear. The snow also strained budgets across the region, forcing neighboring state administrators to face the added costs of more winter weather. In the week that left many New Yorkers stranded, Mayor Bloomberg called snow removal a top priority while also reminding residents of a state deficit ""that's going to filter down to us."" New York state's $9 billion budget gap for fiscal 2012 is inherited by newly appointed Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But it could be just the beginning. The state's budget gap looms in the $14 billion range for fiscal 2013, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And New York is not alone. Neighboring New Jersey has similar problems, with projected budget gaps of $10.5 billion for the next fiscal year, according to the Conference of State Legislatures. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's budget presentation is due February 22. Cuomo's is due on February 1. And with another winter storm expected Tuesday, state and municipal governments are again expected to reach into the public coffers.","NEW: NYC hired 86 private firms to bolster snow removal at a price that remains unclear .

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II laid out the British government's plans for the coming year in a speech Wednesday marked by pomp and tradition. In the speech scripted by politicians but read in the House of Lords by the monarch, she said her ministers would reduce the deficit, strengthen regulation of the financial sector, work to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons and promote stability in Afghanistan. The government will also act on proposals to force banks to split their retail and investment operations, she said. The speech lasted about 10 minutes, less time than it took her to travel by carriage from Buckingham Palace to Parliament. In keeping with custom, her crown made the journey in a separate coach, and she donned her royal regalia in the Robing Room of the Palace of Westminster, the official name for the building where Parliament meets. Once the queen arrives for her annual speech, her official messenger, known as the Black Rod, goes to the House of Commons to summon lawmakers to her speech. By tradition, the door is slammed in his face, and he is required to pound on the door with his rod to get the attention of members of Parliament. The lawmakers then follow the Black Rod to the House of Lords, where the queen reads a speech written by politicians outlining their legislative priorities. The monarch is not allowed to enter the House of Commons, where the elected members of Parliament sit, in memory of the failed effort of King Charles I to arrest lawmakers in the 17th century on the eve of the English Civil War.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Ike grew from a Category 1 into a menacing Category 4 storm in about six hours Wednesday as it fed on the warm waters of Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said. An infrared image from a NOAA satellite shows Ike swirling in the Atlantic on Wednesday night. ""Ike is an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane"" with 135-mph  sustained winds, the center said in its 11 p.m. ET advisory. Although it is likely to lose some strength during the next few days, Ike is forecast to regain Category 4 status by Monday, the center said.

Earlier Wednesday, Ike intensified into the fifth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic season when its winds reached 80 mph. But before Ike can reach into the Caribbean or threaten Florida, Tropical Storm Hanna was getting more organized in the Bahamas, according to the hurricane center. At 2 a.m., Hanna was about 325 miles east-southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas, with winds of 65 mph. Hanna was drenching the Bahamas and Haiti with torrential rains. Haitian officials put the nation's death toll in the wake of Hanna and Hurricane Gustav at 61, said Abel Nabaire, the deputy coordinator of the civil protection service. Eight of the country's 10 departments underwater, he said. More rainfall, up to 15 inches in some places, was possible in the Caribbean, the hurricane center said. Hanna was forecast to return to hurricane strength by Friday as it shot up the east coast of the southern U.S., with landfall predicted on the South Carolina or North Carolina coast late Friday or early Saturday.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military has identified frozen remains found atop a California glacier as those of a World War II era airman who vanished more than half a century ago. Peter Stekel and a friend found the remains of a World War II airman atop a glacier in California. Ernest G. Munn had been missing since his training flight disappeared over the Sierra Nevada mountain range on November 18, 1942, the U.S. military said Monday. He was 23 at the time. Last year, two hikers found the frozen remains of a man with blond, wavy hair in a remote area of Kings Canyon, east of Fresno, California. A tattered sweater still clung to the body, and an unopened parachute lay nearby, said Peter Stekel, one of the hikers who made the discovery. DNA analysis confirmed that the remains were Munn's, the Department of Defense said Monday. The military has notified his family in St. Clairsville, Ohio. ""You don't often have an opportunity in life to provide people with the answers to questions that they have always wanted to know the answer to,"" Stekel told CNN Tuesday. ""Having the ability to supply that information just makes me really happy."" Munn was one of three cadets who, along with their lieutenant, took off from Mather Field in California on a routine training flight nearly 66 years ago. The AT-7 Navigator aircraft carried about five hours of fuel but never returned to base, the U.S. Department of Defense said. Authorities searched for the men for a month -- without success. Five years later, in 1947, hikers on Darwin Glacier in the Sierra Nevada mountain range discovered plane wreckage but found no bodies. Then, in October 2005, backpackers discovered frozen human remains of a crew member, later identified as Leo M. Mustonen. Two years later, in 2007, Stekel and a friend were in the area researching a book that Stekel is writing about the ill-fated flight. About 100 feet from where Mustonen's body was found, Stekel discovered the remains of a second man emerging from a melting glacier. At first he thought it was a tree, Stekel said.

With two of the missing airmen now identified, authorities continue their search for the others. Munn was the oldest of four children. He did well in school and watched over his three little sisters, his family told CNN in 2005. ""He was my idol,"" one of his sisters told CNN. ""He was tall and good-looking. And when he walked in, they said, 'Here comes the blond bomber.' And I would say, 'That's my brother.'"" At 23, he enlisted in the Army, kissed his sisters goodbye and told his mother never to cut her long hair. Authorities have notified his sisters, now in their 80s, about the match. Munn is expected to be buried in May in Colerain, Ohio. His mother lived to be 102, never cut her hair and died awaiting word on his fate.

"(CNN) -- A Muslim civil liberties group filed a lawsuit Friday against the federal government for allegedly violating the First Amendment rights of Michigan Muslims and violating a 1993 federal law that upholds the free practice of religion. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said U.S. border agents and the FBI infringed upon those rights with invasive questionings at the U.S.-Canada border. The group says Muslims have been detained, handcuffed and interrogated there without reason. ""They put me against the wall, and he handcuffed me and he went throughout my body,"" one of the plaintiffs, Ali Suleiman Ali, told CNN affiliate WDIV. The group says the agencies violated the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the federal government cannot substantially burden a person's free exercise of religion. Agents allegedly asked ""How many times a day to you pray?"" ""Do you pray your morning prayer in the mosque?"" and ""Who else prays in your mosque?"" according to CAIR. ""Invasive religious questioning of American citizens without evidence of criminal activity is not only an affront to the Constitution, but is also a waste of limited resources,"" CAIR-Michigan Executive Director Dawud Walid said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection responded Friday, saying that it ""strictly prohibits profiling on the basis of race or religion.""

"(CNN) -- Well, well. The boys at Augusta National Golf Club -- members and sponsors alike -- are in a big bind. Nine years after I led an unsuccessful effort by the National Council of Women's Organizations to open membership in the club to women, the ""woman problem"" is back. This time it involves Virginia Rometty, the first female chief executive of IBM. IBM is a major sponsor of Augusta National's Masters Golf Tournament, and up to now its CEOs have always been given membership in the club. But none has ever been a woman. So what happens now -- will Augusta National open its doors to women? Or will IBM pull its sponsorship and force its other executives to resign their club memberships? These are the only two real choices. We've said all along that this is not about golf. It is about access to the places where big business is done, deals are made and careers are boosted or broken. Half of Augusta's membership (which reads like a roster of Fortune 500 CEOs) probably doesn't even care about golf, but the members do care about power relationships. According to Fortune magazine, ""golf remains the true communications hub of America's business elite."" Back in 2003 when opposition to the all-male policy was making headlines, I got two calls from sponsors who said they were ""in dialogue"" with the club. The first was from Coca-Cola, saying its board was going to make a decision after talking to ""Warren (Buffett) and Sam (Nunn),"" board members who were also Augusta members. I was promised a call in the next two or three days. I'm still waiting. My second call was much more hostile. It was from IBM, telling me my organization was ""forcing"" them to do something they didn't want to do, and generally dressing me down for making an issue of the bald-faced sexism that their sponsorship supported. A few days later Hootie Johnson, then chairman of Augusta National, stepped to a microphone and announced the club was releasing its sponsors, broadcasting the tournament without commercials. The boys had clearly made a deal that went like this: We'll ""release"" you as sponsors, you'll keep your mouths shut, and when all this woman stuff blows over you can quietly come back. Two of the three did not return (IBM was the exception), but none of the sponsors ever condemned the male-only policy at Augusta National. IBM is surely scrambling for what it hopes will be another face-saving deal. The CBSSports.com senior golf columnist Steve Elling predicts that club Chairman Billy Payne will offer Rometty a membership a few days after the Masters ends next week: ""She shows up at the tournament in 2013 in green, after the gender issue has died down. That way, the club avoids the appearance that Payne has been backed into a corner or forced into making an accommodation."" Sorry, but that dog won't hunt. Telling Rometty to be a good girl and wait a little longer with IBM's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company's image, but for Rometty's credibility as its leader. Elling's scenario would scream that IBM values the relationship with a club that proudly discriminates more than it values its own integrity -- or its first female CEO. What if, on the other hand, Rometty makes an announcement that she's not interested in membership? That won't work either. It would be widely assumed that she was under pressure from the company to make such a statement, and in the bargain accept her second-class status. After all, CEOs (male and female) don't get where they are by making waves. But fixing this shouldn't be put on her. It's the responsibility of the board of directors to insist that their CEO be treated exactly like -- well -- one of the boys. Besides, whether she would accept a membership is completely irrelevant to the question of the appropriateness of the club's all-male policy and IBM's tacit support of it, and it doesn't get the club out of its bind anyway. Before she can reject a membership, she has to be offered one. If Augusta National admits it was prepared to make an offer but she wouldn't accept, it has admitted that membership is open to women, and it will immediately be asked who the next candidate will be and when. If the club remains silent, IBM's problem reverberates louder. And saying the gender issue will die down is wishful thinking. The women's movement opened the doors to the executive suites for women like Rometty with 30 years of hard work that made sex discrimination in hiring and promotion in corporate America illegal. If we hadn't raised the ruckus in 2003, you can bet it wouldn't be front and center now. And though we haven't succeeded yet, we won't stop until females are treated equally in corporate-supported venues like Augusta National Golf Club, or until those companies are shamed into pulling support. If this were about race discrimination and a black (male) CEO, IBM surely wouldn't be in the mix, and no other national sponsor would go near this club. But it's only the girls -- and sex discrimination is just not as serious. Or is it? We're listening for IBM's answer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Martha Burk.","Martha Burk: Augusta National Golf Club, site of the Masters, doesn't admit women .

"(CNN) -- Moammar Gadhafi's exit from Libya is a reminder that the Arab awakening will not just fizzle out, despite what some observers are saying. Recently, commentators pointed to the public cheers heard in Egypt as the army pushed protesters out of Tahrir Square as a signal that the uprisings were petering out and the hope of the Arab Spring would soon be lost. The doomsayers were wrong. Indeed, the uprisings are entering a difficult but inevitable phase where the two sides -- the protesters and the leaders -- are at a loss on how to proceed. The protesters, on one hand, still have no leadership and have yet to translate their protests into any coherent political and economic reform program. With initial objectives in Egypt and Libya met -- the overthrow of dictators that ruled over them for years -- they have not been able to move into the next phase of building an alternative system of governance. Their message is dying out, and regular people, who are relieved that Hosni Mubarak and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali are gone, want to see their countries move beyond street protests that are starting to upset their already difficult economic situations. This is what lies ahead in Libya. On the other hand, the one party able to lead a gradual reform process -- ironically the ruling elite, such as the military in Egypt -- is largely unwilling to embark on a process that would slowly rid itself of its privileges and install a pluralistic, stable and prosperous system based on merit rather than patronage. No one should be surprised by this. Ruling establishments in the Arab world have always made sure that political parties and civil society organizations are either suppressed or outlawed. There are few alternative leaders and systems. In such an atmosphere, organized parties like the Muslim Brotherhood, which commands about 20% of the popular vote in Egypt, will be sure to use their organizational and mobilization skills to gain political representation that will exceed their popular strength. The ruling elite, fearful of this, will naturally resist opening up political systems and resort to economic and security measures in a desperate attempt to stem the tide of change. But the only way to deal with opposition parties that are not totally committed to democracy is to gradually open up the political systems to real alternatives, instead of casting all protest votes against the ruling systems in favor of the Islamists. After the Arab public has a sense of what freedom feels like, it will not accept the replacement of secular autocrats by religious ones. It would be wrong to assume that because of these difficulties, the uprisings will fizzle or die down. What has taken place in the Arab world is the start of a genuine and permanent process of change where the average citizen suddenly discovered real power. Although the ability to effect change peacefully is a new phenomenon in the Arab world, it is a wave that will only grow. Organizations such as al Qaeda are the first to lose, having unsuccessfully preached violence. But so will ruling establishments, if they don't internalize the new reality and lead a serious reform process that redistributes power among the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The only way to keep power in the Arab world from now on will be to share it. The process of change is one that will take decades to unfold, it won't be linear, and it will undergo many seasons, multiple times over. But it is irreversible. During a recent trip to Jordan, I was most struck by a young generation no longer afraid to talk about all the issues relating to their future, and talk openly without taboos. This generation is not willing to live by the rules their parents faced, nor afraid of the powerful intelligence services in making their views known. Both sides are wrong, however, to stick to tactics that don't work anymore. Protesters need to start organizing themselves into political parties, develop programs and build constituencies. They need to shift from starting change to institutionalizing it. Otherwise, they will be unable to maintain public support. Ruling elites shouldn't conclude that the status quo can be maintained because public support for protests seems to be wavering. They need to understand that they cannot push aside opposition parties like the Muslim Brotherhood, act as if they don't exist or deal with them through security measures. Both ruling establishments and the protesters need to know that they have to engage in constituent politics. Even with a quick change in Libya, the short-term future will be messy, very bumpy and undoubtedly feature lots of mistakes and missteps. But waiting and doing nothing is no longer an option. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marwan Muasher.","Marwan Muasher: Doomsayers who say Arab Spring is petering out are wrong; it is irreversible .

"(CNN) -- Two feet of snow has fallen in western New York and more is coming along the southern shore of Lake Erie from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, the National Weather Service said Monday. The heavy snow spread north of Buffalo as well. ""Yesterday morning we had none. So it's quite a transition to go from no snow to all this. When you open the door, it's amazing,"" librarian  Dorothy Valenti told The Associated Press by telephone from Constableville, New York, not far from the east end of Lake Ontario. ""It's strange to have a snow day before Thanksgiving."" The latest lake-effect storm dropped 23 inches on Ellicottville, New York, 40 miles south of Buffalo, as of 10:15 a.m. Monday and 20 inches on nearby South Dayton. ""It's not nice,"" emergency dispatcher Laurie Moore in New York's Cattaraugus County told The AP. ""Lots of snow. Roads are snow-covered and slippery."" An additional 6 inches of snow could come by evening, according to CNN affiliate WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. The National Weather Service posted lake-effect snow warnings from Buffalo to Cleveland, Ohio, through Tuesday afternoon.  Watch how heavy snow wreaks havoc in Ohio » . Lake-effect snow occurs when cold air passes over a warmer body of water, in this case Lake Erie, according to the weather service. The cold air sucks up the moisture and heat from the water, dropping it as snow when it moves over land. Wind and snow showers with temperatures in the 20s are forecast for the NFL ""Monday Night Football"" game between the Buffalo Bills and the Cleveland Browns, WGRZ reported.

""Just pray everybody stays safe on the roads, just slow down and use your head,"" Mark Alexander, of Albion, Pennsylvania, told WJET. ""We're ready, we got steady snow tires on everything, and everything's secure at home,"" Alexander told WJET. In Ohio, state transportation officials were concerned about keeping the roadways safe. Rock salt to clear roads of ice was in short supply, CNN affiliate WKYC-TV reported, and authorities were looking for ways to stretch supplies to counteract escalating prices. The Ohio Department of Transportation used sensors in the roads to target the worst spots and help plow drivers determine how much salt to use, WKYC reported. They were also wetting the salt before spreading it to prevent it from bouncing off highways, WKYC said. Three to five inches of snow are expected in northeastern Ohio, for a total accumulation of up to 10 inches, WKYC said. Authorities advised motorists to put off non-essential travel until the snow threat eased. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday led Justice Department tributes to former presidential adviser and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, who died at 90. Holder had a personal connection to Katzenbach, remembered for facing down Alabama Gov. George Wallace at a schoolhouse door in June 1963 to desegregate the University of Alabama. Cameras recorded the confrontation between Katzenbach, then serving as deputy attorney general, and Wallace. The governor declared the desegregation ""illegal and unwarranted"" and stood in the doorway. Katzenbach replied, ""Governor, I am not interested in a show."" The Alabama National Guard enforced the registration of two African-American students and Wallace grudgingly stepped aside. One of the students was Vivian Malone, a sister of Sharon Malone, who later married Holder. Katzenbach died of natural causes Tuesday at his home in Skillman, New Jersey, according to Princeton University, where Katzenbach earned a degree and served as trustee emeritus. He was a top adviser to President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy on several key issues, including the Cuban missile crisis. Katzenbach was attorney general for two years during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Katzenbach drafted and â€” serving as Johnson's liaison to Congress â€” secured passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, according to Princeton. Holder called Katzenbach ""one of our nation's great champions of civil rights and equal justice."" Katzenbach, a New Jersey native, attended top prep schools and Ivy League colleges. He went to Germany to fight in World War II. His plane was shot down and he was captured by the Nazis and taken prisoner. According to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Katzenbach in October 1962 drafted a legal brief in support of Kennedy's decision to blockade Cuba. Holder said Katzenbach will continue to be ""an inspiration for me, for my colleagues across the Department of Justice, and for the nation he was so proud to serve."" Katzenbach was deputy attorney general from 1962 to 1964, and attorney general in 1965 and 1966. He also served as undersecretary of state from 1966 to 1969. He is survived by his wife, Lydia; sons, John and Christopher; his daughters, Maria and Anne; and six grandchildren. A memorial service was being planned.","Former U.S. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach dies at 90 .

"(CNN) -- Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown as president of Guatemala in a CIA-backed coup in 1954, a seminal event that historians say set the Central American country on a path of dictatorships and civil war that would last for decades. Even though he was democratically elected and popular at the time, after Arbenz was deposed, his reputation was ruined and he was written out of Guatemala's history books. He died in exile in 1971. This week, 57 years later, current President Alvaro Colom made a public apology to the Arbenz family, a large gesture in Guatemala. There is also a larger rehabilitation of the image of Arbenz under way. Textbooks are being rewritten and a new biography will soon be published. But this clearing of Arbenz's reputation does not console everyone. Some ask: When will the United States, which was behind the coup, apologize for its meddling? ""As president of the republic, as commander in chief of the army, I want to apologize to the Arbenz family for that great crime committed on the 27th of June of 1954,"" Colom said Thursday. ""Guatemala changed that day, and we haven't yet recovered."" The apology ""doesn't have a lot of resonance in the United States -- though it should,"" said Stephen Schlesinger, an Adjunct Fellow at the Century Foundation and co-author of a book on the 1954 coup. The United States, after all, was the power behind the event. In a nutshell, there were two main arguments about what led the United States to see Arbenz as a threat, one economic and one political. At the time, the largest landowner in Guatemala was an American firm, the United Fruit Company. Arbenz, in an effort to reduce income inequality in the country, instituted a land reform program that would have taken unused United Fruit Company land and turned it over to farmers. ""We're talking huge amounts of land,"" Schlesinger said, enough to grow the middle class. Another author of a book on the subject, Johns Hopkins professor Piero Gleijeses, said that 100,000 families -- representing about half a million Guatemalans -- benefited from the reform. Arbenz's goal was to double that number by the end of his term, he said. But United Fruit Company went to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and labeled Arbenz as a communist and a threat to democracy. This political argument gained traction, and the CIA became involved. According to Schlesinger, the CIA found a group of disgruntled Guatemalan right-wingers opposed to Arbenz who set up an elaborate ploy to oust him. The CIA helped set up secret radio broadcasts along the perimeter of Guatemala. They used fake broadcasts to warn of an impending massive revolt, and backed it up with planes that dropped bombs (many of them fake) in Guatemala, Schlesinger said. The fake broadcasts and bombings ""put such fear in the small country"" that it just collapsed, he said. The Guatemalan army went along with it because the United States convinced commanders there would be an invasion otherwise, Gleijeses said. They were ""terrorized into betraying"" Arbenz, he said. Given the deep U.S. involvement, Gleijeses said this of Colom's apology to the Arbenz family: ""It's not very clear what he's apologizing for."" ""What he should do, if he has the guts, is to ask the United States to apologize for their crime,"" he said. The son of the ousted president, Jacobo Arbenz Jr., said such an effort was already under way. Signatures are being collected for a petition to the U.S. government to apologize for its role, he said. The State Department said that its embassy in Guatemala was preparing a statement regarding Arbenz, but as of Saturday it had not been released. For the younger Arbenz, the apology from the Guatemalan government is a great first step. ""We are happy with this,"" he said. ""Justice has been done."" The Arbenz family had gone before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1999 to demand the apology from the government. Earlier this year, the commission negotiated a number of actions that the government promised to undertake. In addition to the public apology, the government is making economic reparations to the family and is naming a highway after Arbenz. School curricula are also being revamped to give Arbenz a more prominent role in Guatemala's history. Even some Guatemalans CNN spoke with brushed off the significance of the apology, saying the coup was so long ago that it is irrelevant. But according to Schlesinger, the ramifications of the coup were far-reaching. Instead of 30 years of bloody civil war, Guatemala might have remained a democracy and influenced neighboring countries to do the same, sparing thousands of lives. Gleijeses says that his sources confirm that Arbenz in actuality was a communist, but had no aspirations to form a dictatorship. His only goal was to address the nation's serious inequality, something that the land reform could have accomplished, he said. But with a strong military, whether there would have been democracy even without the coup is an open question, he said. Colom's apology seems, at the very least, able to reignite the debate over Arbenz's legacy and the problems that Guatemala faces, many which have been consistent since 1954. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Claudia Palacios contributed to this report.","Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom apologized to the family of Jacobo Arbenz .

"Washington (CNN) -- A controversial proposal to build a giant oil pipeline between Alberta, Canada, and Texas cleared a key hurdle Friday as the State Department said the project could be built without significant damage to the environment. Known as Keystone XL, the 1,700-mile pipeline has drawn fierce criticism from environmentalists, who are staging a two-week demonstration at the White House. So far, some 370 people have been arrested for protesting the project. ""There would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed pipeline corridor,"" Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) Assistant Secretary Kerri-Ann Jones told reporters on the release of the State Department's final environmental impact statement. She stressed that the report is not the last word on the pipeline, which now must pass through a 90-day review period that will include public hearings. A final decision is expected before year-end. Supporters say the pipeline would create jobs and let the United States replace Venezuelan or Middle Eastern imports with well-regulated, dependable Canadian crude. Opponents say the project would bind the country to an unnecessary and dirty form of oil for decades to come and expose surrounding areas to dangerous spills and leaks. ""It was disappointing, but expected,"" Daniel Kessler, a spokesman for the Rainforest Action Network, said about the State Department's report. He is part of a group of activists that has been protesting the pipeline at the White House since August 20. Some 370 people have been arrested so far and 2,000 are planning to be before the scheduled end of the demonstration on September 3, he said. According to the U.S. Park Police, roughly 50 people have been arrested per day since the start of the demonstration for failure to obey a lawful order. ""It really doesn't make a lick of sense,"" Kessler said about the pipeline. ""There's no excuse for not doing the right thing on this."" The company that wants to build the pipeline, TransCanada, cheered the State Department's report. It emphasized the project's benefits, economic and otherwise. ""The fundamental issue is energy security. Through the Keystone system, the U.S. can secure access to a stable and reliable supply of oil from Canada, where we protect human rights and the environment, or it can import more higher-priced oil from nations who do not share America's interests or values,"" said Russ Girling, TransCanada's president and chief executive officer. The pipeline would draw from oil sands deposits in Canada and pass through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas, with construction on an existing pipeline in Kansas. It could transport up to 830,000 barrels per day and is estimated to cost $7 billion.

"Editor's note: Since 2007, CNN and CNN.com have followed the story of Youssif, an Iraqi boy disfigured when he was burned by attackers. Today, CNN's Arwa Damon catches up with the boy and his family, now living in California where Youssif is undergoing treatment. Today Youssif goes to school in California and continues to have treatment to help his scars. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Youssif stands on stage beaming as he belts out ""Jingle Bell Rock,"" his tiny burned hands waving in sync with his classmates at Hamlin Street School. His mother, Zaineb, stands at the back, cradling his little sister, Aya, tears rolling down her face. ""I am so proud of him,"" she says. ""It reminds me of what he was like in Iraq when he used to sing in kindergarten. I felt for a moment that none of this had happened. My son was back, without fear, strong."" Youssif spots us, and waves wildly. Little appears to remain of the sullen and withdrawn dark-eyed boy we first met in Baghdad more than a year ago. It has been almost two years since masked men in Baghdad doused Youssif, then just 4 years old, in gasoline and set him on fire. His mother still doesn't sleep at night. ""I still blame myself. I should have protected him. Sometimes I say to myself that I wish it had happened to me, just not to him."" Zaineb says, her voice starting to quiver. ""If only I hadn't let him go out to play that day."" Today Youssif plays freely, without fear. ""Let's race"" he shouts to his friend Brandon as the two boys dash across the schoolyard. A couple of minutes later the two are playfully jostling over a rubber ball. Youssif shrieks and bursts into laughter as the two play catch. ""It's like this weight has been lifted off of me, off of him,"" his father, Wissam, says. ""It's like we've left this dark, depressing state where we were consumed by Youssif and the attack that had happened. You know, it's so hard to see a child, my child, go through something like this. When I see him like this, I feel like he's coming back.""  Watch more on Youssif's recovery » . After CNN and CNN.com first reported Youssif's story in 2007, more than 12,000 CNN.com users contributed to a fund set up by the Children's Burn Foundation of Sherman Oaks California, enabling the boy and his family to travel to the United States for treatment. Youssif has undergone more than a dozen surgeries. Much of the thick scar tissue around his eyes, mouth and nose -- left by his treatment in Baghdad -- has been removed. He currently has yet another tissue expander in his left cheek, intended to stretch out ""good skin"" to be used to replace his scar tissue. Youssif has grown used to the sometimes painful treatments. ""When I started this process of tissue expansion, I would have to chase him around the room,"" Dr. Peter Grossman, Youssif's surgeon, tells us as he injects more liquid into the expander. ""We'd need three people to hold him down for these injections."" Youssif will probably have many more surgeries stretched out over time. ""The problem we have with Youssif is that every operation we do tends to heal well after surgery, but then a month after, he starts to form these really thick scars,"" Grossman said. ""It's probably best at this time to let his body relax, let these scars mature over a period of a year or two years."" Today, Youssif grimaces in pain but braves it alone, refusing to take his father's hand. ""Seven or eight times put water,"" Youssif says back at home, explaining how the tissue expansion works. ""I am not scared. It goes here,"" he says pointing to the scarring over his lip. He's not all that interested in talking about medical procedures. ""When I sharpen this it broke,"" he says, trotting over with his new pencils. We all smile. ""You cut it like this"" he orders, handing me scissors and what is meant to be a snowman he's just drawn. A few moments later I am being berated for coloring ""wrong."" ""Great, I am taking orders from a 6-year-old"" I think to myself, laughing. Keely Quinn with the Children's Burn Foundation comes by for an extra reading lesson. They are reading one of the ""Five Little Monkeys"" books, Youssif's favorite. By the time I join them on the couch, Youssif's got Dr. Seuss' ""Foot Book."" ""What's the biggest change you've seen in him in the last year?"" I ask her. Youssif pipes up, reading, ""Small feet, big feet."" ""Aside from reading and learning English,"" Keely says as we're both laughing. ""I think it's the change in confidence, in his ability to handle himself in social situations. He's worked really hard in saying good morning to his teachers, saying hello back, answering questions and just gaining social confidence."" He's thriving at school, loving the first grade. ""He's amazing,"" his teacher Mario Daley says. ""I work with children of all levels of ability, and Youssif, with what he's gone through, his motivation, what he produces is fantastic. He just tries so hard."" Before the attack, Zaineb says, Youssif wanted to be a doctor. Now he says ""I want to be a doctor to help burned Iraqi children.""","Youssif continues to be treated in California for his burns, scars .

"Chardon, Ohio (CNN) -- Schools throughout the small town of Chardon, Ohio, will be closed Tuesday -- except for counselors on hand to help any students who want to come in to talk, to try to come to grips with the bloodshed that left one of their own dead. Four students, meanwhile, spent the night in local hospitals for gunshot wounds -- two in critical condition at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, and one in serious condition and another in stable condition at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Chardon police Chief Police Chief Tim McKenna said late Monday afternoon. They all had been in the Chardon High School cafeteria on Monday morning, when two witnesses saw another student they later identified as T.J. Lane walk up to a table and start firing. ""He was silent the entire time,"" said Nate Mueller, who was just a few feet away from the shooter. ""There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire."" A teacher identified by students as Frank Hall helped chase the gunman out of the school. Police arrested the suspect -- whom they have not named, except to say he's a juvenile -- nearby a short time later. One of Lane's friends, Haley Kovacik, said she was in ""complete shock"" that Lane -- whom she described as a ""a very normal, just teenage boy"" -- could be responsible for the mayhem. ""He did have a sad look in his eyes a lot of the time, but he talked normally (and) he never said anything strange,"" Kovacik told CNN. ""It is a really big shock."" Another friend, Torilyn LaCasse, saw Lane being picked on regularly at school and said he put a wall around himself, reluctant especially to share anything about his personal life. One glimpse into his mindset may have come December 30, when Lane posted a long, poetic rant on his Facebook page centered ""in a quaint lonely town, (where there) sits a man with a frown (who) longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet."" ""He was better than the rest, all those ones he detests, within their castles, so vain,"" he said, later thanking those who ""liked"" the post and saying he'd written it in class one day. He concluded the post by writing, ""Die, all of you."" A student at Chardon High, Evan Erasmus, said the victims were students who attended a nearby vocational school, and were waiting for a bus to take them there. Lane himself is a student at the Lake Academy Alternative School, said the school's interim director, Don Ehas. The student killed in Monday's shooting was identified by his family as Daniel Parmertor. ""Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him. The family is torn by this loss,"" the family said in a statement released by MetroHealth Medical Center. Gov. John Kasich ordered flags to be flown at half-staff Tuesday at the Ohio Statehouse, as well as throughout Geauga County, in honor of Parmetor. Why he was killed remains a mystery, as school and law enforcement authorities have not offered details as to the suspect's motive. ""I just can't believe it. I don't think it's real,"" said student Danny Komertz, who witnessed the shooting. ""And I just, it kills me that I saw someone hiding, and now that someone is now dead."" Komertz said he heard a pop as he was walking with friends. He looked up to see a boy he did not recognize holding a gun, pointing it at a group of four students. ""He just fired two quick shots at them,"" said Komertz, a freshman. ""I saw one student fall, and I saw the other hiding, trying to get cover underneath the table."" Komertz said he started to run when he saw the gun, but heard a total of five shots. Multiple calls reporting a shooting flooded into the police dispatch center beginning at 7:38 a.m., McKenna said. Around that time, student Evan Erasmus said, he had just arrived for his English class when an administrator ""yelled 'lockdown!'"" over the announcements. ""All of a sudden, all the doors started slamming. You could hear them slam,"" Erasmus said. ""And we all turned off the lights, and we headed towards the corner."" After police got word from a dispatcher that a teacher had chased the suspect out of the school, officers went inside, soon followed by paramedics to help the injured students, McKenna said. Neil Thomas, who was in his Spanish class at the time of the shooting, said the actions of teacher Frank Hall, the assistant football coach who is thought to have chased the gunman from the school, were very much in character. ""Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone,"" Thomas said. ""And today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us, that he would take a bullet for us."" It was unclear exactly how the suspect was captured. Initial reports from police indicated that he may have turned himself in to bystanders, but McKenna did not mention that. Instead, he said officers ""came up with the suspect"" after starting a search shortly after the shooting. As investigators took over the school, students were evacuated to nearby Maple Elementary School, said Lt. John Hiscox of the sheriff's office. Local officials, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and several students credited frequent lockdown drills and the quick response of school authorities for helping keep the situation from becoming worse. The Chardon High shooting was the latest, but hardly the only mass shooting in recent years on school campuses. In addition to several at universities, including an April 2007 rampage at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead, the bloodiest attack on a high school campus was when teens Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves at Colorado's Columbine High in 1999. Hours after calling off school Monday, Chardon school superintendent Joseph Bergant said there would be no class on Tuesday -- though counselors will be on hand at Chardon Middle School and St. Mary Chardon School, which is alongside the church in which a candlelight vigil is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, according to the superintendent. ""I hope that every parent, if you haven't hugged or kissed your family in the last couple of days, take that time,"" Bergant said.

"New York (CNN) -- A cancer-stricken New Jersey student asked by superstar singer Taylor Swift to join her at Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards is too ill to attend, supporters said. A Facebook group started by Kevin McGuire's older sister, Victoria, said Saturday that her 18-year-old brother was admitted to the hospital Friday night. The post continued, saying, ""Please continue to pray for Kevin and his health, because that is the most important thing. As for Taylor, she is just as depressed as all of us to miss out on this date, and we are so thankful for the opportunity she has given us."" The country sweetheart took to her Twitter page hours after, confirming the sad news. Swift wrote, ""Just talked to Kevin McGuire. He's not well enough to join me at the ACMs. Please keep him in your thoughts. I'll make it up to you, Kevin!"" McGuire, 18, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2007 at the age of 13. The cancer was in remission for years before a relapse. Realizing he would lose his hair because of treatment, McGuire was worried about securing a date to his upcoming senior prom. Victoria McGuire asked, ""What if I got Taylor Swift?"" Victoria started the ""Taylor Swift take Kevin McGuire to prom"" Facebook page in February. It went viral overnight, gathering the attention of Ms. Swift herself. Shortly after, Swift expressed her apologies that she couldn't accompany McGuire to his prom. She did, however, ask him to be her date to the music awards show. CNN's Gabe LaMonica and Anisa Husain contributed to this report.","New Jersey student, 18, is suffering from leukemia .

"(CNN) -- Diners flock to restaurants for the food, but they sometimes return for the eye candy. Many restaurants have swapped the utilitarian server uniform of television's ""Alice"" for khaki pants, polo shirts and, on occasion, pin-on ""flair.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Police have found the body of a 7-year-old Georgia girl who went missing more than two days ago, the state's chief law enforcement official said Monday. Police believe Jorelys Rivera was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered at her apartment complex in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) Director Vernon Keenan. ""This is going to be a very, very horrendous crime. I am convinced of that after having observed the body. A child death is always a terrible thing, but a child who dies under extreme violence is the absolute worst thing,"" he told reporters. An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death, Keenan said. The girl was last seen Friday near a playground at her apartment. Police initially thought she might have wandered off, but after more than 48 hours of searching, they said they believed the girl was kidnapped. Canton police, assisted by the FBI and the GBI, expanded the search area Monday and began canvassing for sex offenders living nearby. They are now asking for help to find out who killed the little girl. Her body was found in a dumpster at the apartment complex where she lived. ""We need help from the public,"" said Police Chief Jeff Lance. As of Monday afternoon, Keenan said, investigators were actively pursuing leads, but police had no one in custody and no suspects. ""Quite frankly, at this point we do not have a strong suspect. We've not focused in on anyone. We very much need information from the public who may know something about the abduction of this child,"" said Keenan. State troopers were stopping and talking to everyone entering, leaving or driving by the apartment complex Monday afternoon. Earlier, as volunteers and police handed out fliers with information and a picture of the missing child, her mother spent the morning in court trying to regain custody of her other children, who were taken by the Department of Family and Children's Services for alleged lack of supervision. The girl's parents are not suspects, Keenan said. Joselin Rivera had spoken with local media hours after her young daughter went missing Friday, saying she just wanted her returned safely. After the girl's body was found, neighbors said they feared for their safety. Speaking in Spanish, Luis Fernando Montenegro said he was concerned for his daughter, who attends night school. ""If she (Rivera) was abducted here and her body was also found here in the (apartment) complex, how do we know the killer is not still here?"" he asked. CNN's Holly Firfer and Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","NEW: ""How do we know the killer is not still here,"" a neighbor asks .

"Miami (CNN) -- Officials in a popular stretch of coastal North Carolina ordered all visitors to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Irene, which damaged homes in the Bahamas Wednesday as it churned toward the U.S. East Coast. Irene, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, could jump to Category 4 strength by Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said. Federal emergency management officials had a simple message for those in or near the path: Be prepared. Dare County, North Carolina -- home to Manteo, Nags Head, Duck and Kitty Hawk -- was taking no chances. A mandatory evacuation for tourists was to take effect 8 a.m. ET Thursday. Residents could stay for now, but they were advised to ready themselves for Irene. The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse closed Wednesday evening. Other venues, including the Wright Brothers National Memorial visitors center, also were shuttered. ""They are taking precautions,"" Sydney Jenkins, bar manager at Poor Richard's Sandwich Shop in Manteo, said Wednesday evening. ""It's now more or less whether it's even going to hit us."" ""This is a huge storm,"" said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. ""The cloud field is more than 800 miles across. The tropical storm force winds extend out 200 miles from the center."" The strengthening came as the storm pounded central and southeastern Bahamas. Rainfall of 6 to 12 inches was expected in the Bahamas, with 15 inches possible in some places, the Miami-based Hurricane Center said. At 11 p.m. ET Wednesday, Irene was moving northwest at 12 mph and was between Rum Cay and Long Island, 150 miles east-southeast of Nassau. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 70 miles and U.S. weather officials predicted significant storm surge. ""We are urging persons in central Bahamas to exercise extreme caution,"" said Capt. Stephen Russell, head of the National Emergency Management Agency in the island chain. No injuries had been reported as of Wednesday evening, but extensive structural damage from wind was reported on Acklins and Crooked islands, Russell told CNN. Numerous homes had been blown off their foundations. Russell had no information on rainfall amounts. Electricity was out in some locations. Irene whipped through the island of Mayaguana, the mostly easterly island in the chain, and moved into Long, San Salvador and Cat islands, which are not heavily populated. About 65% of the country's population is on New Providence, home to Nassau. Projections showed the island being outside of hurricane-force winds, Russell said. ""We hope the system makes a gradual turn to the northeast."" After it makes the turn, Irene could threaten large sections of the Eastern Seaboard, from the Carolinas into the Northeast. But, forecasters said, it was too soon to predict how it would affect the United States because of the ""cone of uncertainty."" Even if Irene doesn't touch land or glances off the U.S. coast, ""the waves are going to be tremendous,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Swells generated by Irene will begin affecting the Southeast's coast Thursday. ""On the forecast track, the core of Irene will move across the southeastern and central Bahamas through tonight and over the northwestern Bahamas on Thursday,"" the Hurricane Center said. Irene forced more than a dozen cruise ships to change their itineraries in the Caribbean, CruiseCritic.com reported. Those ships include the Carnival Sensation, which had been docked in Freeport, Bahamas, but was coming back to Port Canaveral, Florida, late Wednesday. Irene has prompted the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism & Aviation to recommend strongly that people with plans to travel to the Bahamas in the next few days postpone their trips. The storm will curve northward as it nears the United States, with most of the latest projections suggesting the storm will avoid landfall until it is north of North Carolina. The storm is expected to arrive off North Carolina by Saturday morning. The storm approaches as Americans increasingly are relying on social media to prepare for and keep abreast of disasters. According to two American Red Cross surveys, the increased use of social media and mobile technology has caused response agencies ""to engage with people in times of disaster and to include information from social networks in their response efforts."" North Carolina coastal areas could see about 6 inches of rain and tropical storm force winds.  Irene is forecast to be a Category 2 or 3 storm when it reaches the U.S. East Coast later Friday or early Saturday. Many counties were taking a wait-and-see attitude on evacuations. Warren Lee, emergency management director in New Hanover County, North Carolina, said shelters likely will be opened. ""If the storm stays on current track, we don't expect a major impact and we will not issue an evacuation order plan right now."" Some computer models suggest New York or New Jersey could be hit. ""Everywhere from North Carolina to Massachusetts remains in the cone of uncertainty,"" Jeras said. ""Worst-case scenario, we could be looking at two landfalls, or we could be lucky and get a brush instead of a direct hit. ... Even if Irene doesn't make landfall in the United States, it may very well bring flooding rains, damaging winds and power outages to the Northeast. Planning is critical, and everyone needs to be ready with a disaster plan and a safety kit."" Chris Martin, an employee at Endeavor Seafood in Newport, Rhode Island, said a bridal shower is scheduled Sunday in Portsmouth for his fiancee. ""We're hoping to have it outside."" Martin is hoping the hurricane, if it actually affects the state, will not arrive until Monday. Hyde County, in North Carolina's Outer Banks, declared a state of emergency for Ocracoke Island and the county's mainland, along with a mandatory evacuation for all visitors and a voluntary evacuation for residents. The mandatory evacuation will extend to residents beginning 5 a.m. Thursday, Hyde County Emergency Services said. Ocracoke is reachable only by boat or private plane. While forecasts showed the storm ""moving further from the coast and toward the sea,"" North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue said Wednesday, ""we must all prepare for the worst."" In Kill Devil Hills in the Outer Banks, locals who insist on staying through the storm were planning ""hurricane parties"" as they stocked up on water, canned food and flashlight batteries, said CNN iReporter Penelope Penn, who was in the area Tuesday. ""The water was so calm and the sky so clear at the Outer Banks last night. It truly is calmest before a storm,"" Penn added.  On Wednesday, Penn was in nearby Virginia Beach, Virginia. The last major hurricane to strike the United States was Wilma in 2005, which was a Category 3 at landfall, Jeras said. Hurricane Katrina, earlier the same year, was also a Category 3 at landfall. The most recent hurricane to make landfall in the United States was Ike in 2008, which hit near Galveston, Texas, as a Category 2. Gloria in 1985 was the most recent hurricane to hit New York. It was a Category 3 at landfall, the National Hurricane Center said. In 1991, Hurricane Bob hit Massachusetts, a Category 2 at landfall. Bill Read, director of the Hurricane Center, said Irene could cause problems with flooding in Northeastern states that have already had lots of rainfall this summer. Widespread damage is possible from the coastal Carolinas all the way up to the Canadian Maritimes, including the major cities of the Northeast, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Irene is expected to pass well east of Florida, so only minimal effects are expected Thursday and Friday as the storm moves northward toward the Carolinas. But the U.S. Coast Guard is worried boaters in south Florida are taking the threat too lightly. Officials expect heavy rip currents and beach erosion in Miami. ""The most prudent thing to make sure mariners are not out this time tomorrow,"" Capt. Chris Scraba said. South Carolina state officials decided not to order evacuations. Boaters and swimmers were urged by the Coast Guard to stay out of the water. CNN's Ed Payne, Chandler Friedman, Joe Sutton, John Fricke, A. Pawlowski and Nelson Quinones contributed to this report.","Extensive damage reported on two Bahamas islands .

"(CNN) -- A tall and beguiling blonde sits alone at the bar of a luxury Middle Eastern hotel. Looking across the lobby she seductively eyes a mustached Arab man. Emboldened by her enticing glances he approaches the bar and they begin chatting. Unbeknown to the man, he has just taken the bait in an elaborate trap that, in a matter of hours, will lead to his death and an international murder mystery. Their conversation is carefully recorded on camera and watched on a monitor by a team of technical experts a short distance away. They carefully assess the movements of their subjects and when the Arab man finally moves away from his new female acquaintance one of the observers cries ""cut!"" The scene -- loosely based on a true story -- is being played out on the set of a new Israeli film called ""The Javelin,"" showcasing the unsolved murder of Hamas leader Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel room more than two years ago. Al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead on January 20, 2010. Police believe he was killed the night before by a team of foreign agents, who after tracking al-Mabhouh's movements from Syria into the United Arab Emirates, entered his hotel room, injected with him a muscle relaxant and then suffocated him. Speaking from the set at an Israeli resort hotel the film's writer and director Emmanuel Naccache says he was immediately intrigued by the cloak-and-dagger case worthy of an Ian Fleming or John le Carre novel. ""What really fascinated me about this story was that within 5 minutes one morning the whole world accepted one truth, one story which is probably true or maybe true,"" Naccache remarked. That widely accepted story is that a group of more than two dozen disguised Israeli agents traveling on stolen passports were part of an elaborate plot by the Mossad spy agency to assassinate al-Mabhouh. Closed circuit cameras in Dubai hotels and airports infamously captured the last known movements of al-Mabhouh and those of his assassins leading Dubai police to assert that they were 100% certain that the Mossad was behind the plot. A number of governments served Israel with diplomatic rebukes following the murder claiming passports from their countries had been forged as part of the operation. The Israeli government has until this day denied any responsibility for the murder. ""I don't know if Israel carried out the assassination ...most of us kind of assume it,"" Naccache says. But it was the lack of certainty about the facts of the case that prompted Naccache to start writing the script. ""There is the reality that everyone knows or thinks they know from the newspapers,"" he explains. ""I want to tell the story slightly different with the same basis, with the same pictures with the same video camera and with the same type of character, but I did it my way."" The film, Naccache says, does not attempt to recreate the known events in the al-Mabhouh case, but rather offers an alternative storyline to the one he says has become widely accepted. Naccache says he tries to answer some frequently asked questions about the assassination plot: Did the assailants want to be seen? Were they not aware of the ubiquity of closed circuit surveillance cameras in Dubai or did they just not care? And, did the agents overestimate their own abilities and underestimate the investigative skills of the Dubai police? This is not the first time the Dubai killing has served as grist for Israeli popular culture. Just weeks after details of the case started emerging, an Israeli supermarket chain produced a television advertisement shot entirely on surveillance cameras with shoppers dressed as the agents in Dubai furtively stalking grocery aisles looking for bargains. ""We call it an assassination of prices!"" the commercial's director joked at the time, raising questions about the tastefulness of marketing off a murder. Al-Mabhouh's assassination is not considered a laughing matter in Dubai or Gaza where his family lived, but in Israel the widespread belief that the Mossad was involved in the extra-judicial killing of a man considered to be a terrorist serves as a point of pride for many. Speaking at a media event for the new film, Israeli model-turned-actress Bar Refaeli, who plays a femme fatale impersonating a secret agent, underscored the admiration many in the country feel for those working in the Mossad. ""That's my secret life dream: I would love to be in the Mossad -- and actually maybe I am -- who knows?"" Refaeli, who is one of Israel's best-known international faces, says she grew up hearing stories about the exploits of Mossad agents, but she acknowledges the sensitivity of the subject matter and works hard to avoid the politics. ""I don't want people to think that I am pro or against because it doesn't really matter what I think -- I am just playing a role as an actress in a movie that is based on a very interesting story."" An interesting story that is still a mystery. Despite a global search none of the suspects Dubai police identified as Mossad agents has been prosecuted and few are holding their breath for a breakthrough in the case.","New film focuses on unsolved murder of Hamas leader in Dubai hotel in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Spanish and European champions Barcelona took a break from their preparations for the FIFA Club World Cup semifinals by meeting children displaced by Japan's devastating tsunami. The club, who beat arch rivals Real Madrid 3-1 on Saturday, are in Japan for the tournament and face Qatari side Al Sadd in their final four clash Thursday. Before a training session in Yokohama, the club's stars, including FIFA world player of the year Lionel Messi, met 11 children who used to live near the Fukushima power station, hit by March's earthquake and tsunami that ravaged the area and killed an estimated 15,000 people. Many of the children, aged between nine and 18, lost relatives in the disaster and now live in a Tokyo school. Each of them received a Barcelona shirt with their name on the back. Is Mancini the right man for Manchester City? The club won the tournament in 2009, and defender Gerard Pique has urged his teammates to grasp the opportunity to be crowned the best club side on the planet for the second time. ""We can't miss out on chances like this,"" the former Manchester United player told his club's official website. ""We haven't yet adapted to the time change or recovered from such a long journey. We trained a bit harder today and tomorrow we'll train even harder."" Pique said Saturday's 3-1 victory over Real Madrid in a match known as 'El Clasico', which took Pep Guardiola's side to the top of Spain's La Liga, had filled the team with confidence. He added: ""We are very happy with our play and the result. We left feeling that we're on the right track and doing things well. The team knew we were able to win there."" As for Asian Champions League winners Al Sadd, a clash with Barcelona is their reward for beating African team Esperance in a controversial quarterfinal clash that was marred by crowd trouble. Defender Nadir Belhadj, who has also played for French side Lyon, says the players can't wait to test themselves against some of the world's best. Crowd trouble mars Al Sadd victory . ""We should treat this match as a celebration,"" he told FIFA's official website. ""We'll be well prepared to put in a good performance, but the main aim will be to enjoy ourselves. We'll need to pull together. ""This Barca side is the best in the world, as we saw once again with their impressive display in the 'Clasico' against Real Madrid."" Belhadj admitted Al Sadd will have to be at their best to limit the threat posed by Argentina striker Messi, who already has 17 league goals to his name in 16 games this season. ""Lionel Messi and Barca are on another planet,"" he said. ""We'll play with the resources we have, and with a group of players that has already helped us to achieve big things. ""The chance to face Barcelona is extremely satisfying in itself. It is possible to guess what Messi is going to do, but actually stopping him from doing it is another matter.""","Barcelona's players meet tsunami survivors in Japan ahead of Al Sadd match .

"(CNN)  -- The Army Corps of Engineers' failure to properly maintain a shipping channel linking New Orleans, Louisiana, to the Gulf of Mexico led to catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Katrina, a federal court ruled Wednesday. ""It is the court's opinion that the negligence of the Corps, in this instance by failing to maintain the MRGO properly, was not policy, but insouciance, myopia and short-sightedness,"" U.S. District Court Judge Stanwood Duval Jr. wrote in his lengthy ruling, referring to the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet canal. ""For over 40 years, the Corps was aware that the Reach II levee protecting Chalmette and the Lower Ninth Ward was going to be compromised by the continued deterioration of the MRGO ... The Corps had an opportunity to take a myriad of actions to alleviate this deterioration or rehabilitate this deterioration and failed to do so. Clearly, the expression 'talk is cheap' applies here."" Duval's ruling was issued in a lawsuit brought by six plaintiffs affected by the 2005 hurricane, who claimed the Corps of Engineers was liable for damages. The judge ruled against one couple, who lived in New Orleans East, but awarded the others, from the Lower 9th Ward and St. Bernard Parish, damages ranging from $100,000 to $317,000. ""The people of this city are vindicated,"" said Joe Bruno, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys. ""They didn't do anything wrong. It's now time for them to be compensated."" The ruling applies not only to the six plaintiffs, attorney Pierce O'Donnell said, but to 100,000 homes and businesses in the parish and the Lower 9th Ward. Under the precedent set by Duval's decision, they too will be entitled to compensation. ""The judge's ruling today validates the feelings and beliefs that many citizens have held for four years,"" said New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin in a statement. ""Although the ruling is liberating for thousands impacted by the devastation and tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, it is my hope that justice will prevail to help families make their lives whole again."" Once a Category 5 storm, Katrina had weakened to a Category 3 storm with 127 mph winds when it made landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005, between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and the mouth of Mississippi River. A few hours later, the storm again crossed over land on the other side of the river, its winds only slightly diminished. More than 1,800 people died in the storm, most -- nearly 1,600 -- in Louisiana, where Katrina devastated New Orleans when the city's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred. Overall, the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people, causing more than $81 billion in damage. FEMA called Katrina ""the single most catastrophic natural disaster in U.S. history."" While courts have declared the Corps was liable for Katrina flooding, judges until now have issued it a ""get out of jail free"" card, the plaintiffs' attorneys said. ""It has been proven in a court of law that the drowning of New Orleans was not a natural disaster, but a preventable man-made travesty,"" the attorneys said in a statement. ""The government has always had a moral obligation to rebuild New Orleans. This decision makes that obligation a matter of legal responsibility."" Duval ruled that because the Corps failed to maintain the shipping channel, erosion widened it, and its banks -- which helped protect the levees -- deteriorated, leaving the levees unprotected, undermined and more vulnerable to waves coming off Lake Borgne. The Corps also failed to take other actions, such as armoring the banks with rocks, the attorneys said. ""This court cannot but comment that the Corps' approach reminds the court of the old adage, 'Close your eyes and you become invisible,' "" said the ruling. ""It is beyond arbitrary and capricious -- it flies in the face of the purpose of NEPA [the National Environmental Policy Act] and ignores the very heart of what 'operation' means,"" Duval wrote. The plaintiffs claimed the Corps was not entitled to immunity because its activities regarding the shipping channel ""were in direct contravention of professional engineering and safety standards,"" Duval wrote. ""... Ignoring safety and poor engineering are not policy, and clearly the Corps engaged in such activities."" ""This is not the Corps that built the Panama Canal,"" said Joe Bruno, another plaintiffs' attorney. ""This is a different Corps. This is a Corps that's reckless."" The attorneys said they plan to go to Washington after Thanksgiving to meet with the Justice Department.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two U.S. citizens from Seattle and Los Angeles -- described as ""would-be terrorists"" by the FBI -- have been arrested and charged with plotting to kill Americans enlisting in the armed forces in Seattle, federal officials announced Thursday. The men were identified as Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, (also known as Joseph Anthony Davis), 33, of Seattle; and Walli Mujahidh, (also known as Frederick Domingue Jr.) 32, of Los Angeles. ""Driven by a violent extreme ideology, these two young Americans are charged with plotting to murder men and women who were enlisting in the armed forces to serve and protect our country,"" said a top counter-terrorism official at the Justice Department. Acting Assistant Attorney General Todd Hinnen said the threat was averted and the public was not endangered because of the intervention of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. When the suspects attempted to recruit a third man, that individual instead went to the police, authorities said. ""Because someone stepped forward we were able to disrupt a very deadly attack,"" said U.S. Attorney Jenny Durkan. Agents began monitoring Abdul-Latif and Mujahidh in the past month and collected audio and videotapes of the pair discussing a violent assault on the Military Entrance Processing Station in Seattle. Law enforcement officials said that unbeknownst to the defendants, the weapons they obtained, including machine guns, were rendered inoperable and posed no risk to the public. The two suspects initially planned their attack on Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, but later changed targets and decided to assault the recruiting station. According to a source working with federal agents, Abdul-Latif said the original plan to attack Fort Lewis ""would be in retaliation for alleged crimes committed by United States soldiers in Afghanistan,"" a court document said. The subjects allegedly were interested in carrying out a deadly attack to gain maximum attention, according to the criminal complaint against them. ""We're not only trying to kill people, we're trying to send a message. We're trying to get something that's going to be on CNN and over the world. That's what we want,"" said Abdul-Latif, according to the court document. Mujahidh was quoted in the document as saying, ""Ain't gonna be no innocent women and children. That's why I'm saying we go in there and lay everybody down, man. Everybody in that building is connected with the military,"" he said. The two suspects appeared in federal court in Seattle late Thursday, where they heard the changes against them. They were not asked to enter a plea. The two men were ordered held without bail pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for July 7. Both defendants said they could not afford attorneys, so the court provided them with public defenders. The plot allegedly involved a conspiracy to use grenades and firearms which they would use to kill the victims and then use to fight police as they made their escape. The men are scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate in Seattle later Thursday to hear the charges against them. CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","Two accused of plotting against military recruits .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela successfully underwent hernia surgery Saturday, a family member told CNN Saturday. Mandela was ""comfortable"" and in ""a satisfactory condition"" Saturday, said the South African president, who referred to the medical event only as ""a planned procedure."" The 93-year-old likely will be discharged within the next two days, a Mandela relative told CNN. Considered the founding father of South Africa's democracy, Mandela became an international figure when he endured 27 years in prison for fighting racial segregation. He was freed in 1990, and three years later, he and then-South African President F.W. de Klerk won the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1994, Mandela was elected president, serving only one term as he had promised. On Saturday, President Jacob Zuma said Mandela was being treated for a ""longstanding abdominal complaint."" The president referred to Mandela by his affectionate clan name Madiba. ""Madiba is fine and fully conscious and the doctors are satisfied with his condition, which they say is consistent with his age,"" Zuma said in a statement Saturday afternoon. ""He was in good health before admission in hospital but doctors felt the complaint needed a thorough investigation. He underwent a diagnostic procedure as part of his ongoing medical management. We are happy that he is not in any danger and thank the doctors for their hard work and professionalism,"" Zuma said. A government official assured the public that Mandela's hospital stay was not an emergency. ""People need not panic. This was planned ... Mandela has had abdominal pains for sometime,"" said Keith Khoza, a spokesman for the ruling African National Congress. Officials and family declined to name the hospital where the former president is undergoing treatment. Mandela last appeared in public in the closing ceremonies of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. He was hospitalized last year for treatment of an acute respiratory infection, and continued to receive treatment at home after doctors discharged him. Despite his rare appearances, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy here. He spent 27 years in prison after being convicted of sabotage and attempts to overthrow the former apartheid regime. In a life fighting the racism of apartheid he went from being considered a terrorist to jailed freedom fighter to nation builder to elder statesman respected in the world's capitals. Clint Eastwood's 2009 film ""Invictus,"" starring Morgan Freeman as Mandela, dramatizes Mandela's nation-healing presidency in the 1990s. Mandela relocated to his childhood town of Qunu last year, but moved back to his Johannesburg home earlier this year. At the time, Zuma said the move was because the home in his boyhood town was undergoing maintenance. Members of the public can send messages to Mandela through President Zuma to president@po.gov.za, officials said.

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's telecommunications regulator, Conatel, fined private television broadcaster Globovision Tuesday 7.5% of its gross income for alleged violations of the country's media responsibility laws, marking the latest salvo in the long-running feud between the broadcaster and the government. Globovision said it would appeal the fine of 9,300,000 bolivares fuertes ($2.2 million), which the station said risked bankrupting it. Conatel's director, Pedro Maldonado, however, said during a news conference that the fine could not be appealed. Globovision is Venezuela's last remaining television broadcaster that is openly critical of President Hugo Chavez. The fine stems from Globovision's coverage of a standoff at the Rodeo II prison in June and July. The station violated a law that prohibits stirring anxiety in the public and instigating intolerance for political reasons, Maldonado said. These are violations under a media responsibility law passed in December. The goal of the law is to establish ""social responsibility"" in those who provide television, radio and Internet service. The law affects all text, images, sound or context sent or received in Venezuela. Maldonado said the sanction does not seek to suspend the transmission of Globovision, a 24-hour news station. But Maria Fernanda Flores, a vice president of the network, said paying that sum could spell the end of its broadcast. ""This fine represents the bankruptcy of Globovision,"" she said. The government official said Globovision had ""a couple of days"" to pay the fine. Globovision defended its coverage of the prison standoff, which started with a riot that killed at least 22 people and turned into a nearly monthlong standoff between prisoners and national guard troops. The broadcaster said it was denied access at the scene and completed its reporting fairly and in a balanced way given its limitations. Claudio Paolillo, a member of the freedom of expression committee of the Inter-American Press Association, likened Chavez to a dictator in an interview with Globovision and said the fine was a roundabout way to shutter the station. ""The political objective is to shut down all the voices who are critical or independent,"" he said. Chavez and his top leadership did not immediately comment on the move. The broadcaster is the last remaining TV network that carries an anti-Chavez line, since the president refused to renew the license of another opposition station, RCTV, allegedly over telecommunication regulation violations. The station had to go off public airwaves and transmit solely on cable. Over the years, the government has launched various investigations into Globovision -- for everything from reporting about an earthquake before an official report had been issued, to failing to pay about $2.3 million in taxes. Station officials have said the charges are politically motivated. Last year, the government secured a 25.8% interest in the broadcaster when it took over two companies, which owned a 20% and 5.8% stake in Globovision, respectively. The government's interest was sufficient to name a representative to the broadcaster's board, Chavez said then. His government has also gone after the owner of Globovision, Guillermo Zuloaga, who is wanted in Venezuela for allegedly illegally storing vehicles at his Caracas home with the intent to sell them for a profit. The TV magnate, who is living in exile, has said he is being persecuted for political purposes and that the charges are trumped up. His son is also wanted. International groups accuse Chavez of using a friendly judiciary to silence critics and the press. The president, however, maintains there is robust freedom of the press in Venezuela. The country's constitution protects freedom of expression, but those who exercise it will be responsible for that content, the government has argued.","NEW: The penalty is the latest salvo in long-running dispute between Globovision and the government .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Friday ruled against four Republican presidential candidates seeking a spot on Virginia's March 6 primary ballot, saying they waited too long to file their claims. Left off the ballot are Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former U.S Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. The four candidates challenged the state's residency requirements for those seeking to circulate ballot petitions, but Judge John Gibney ruled against the challenge. The four candidates ""knew the rules in Virginia many months ago,"" the judge wrote in his ruling. ""In essence, they played the game, lost, and then complained that the rules were unfair."" Gibney, a 2010 appointee to the federal bench in Richmond by President Barack Obama, said his ruling denied the candidates' motion for a preliminary injunction. ""The plaintiffs have waited too long to file, and the doctrine of laches bars their claim,"" Gibney wrote. ""The Commonwealth is far along in the electoral process. The primary election is so close that the plaintiffs cannot gather the requisite signatures to get on the ballot. To place the plaintiffs on the ballot would deprive Virginia of its rights not only to conduct the primary in an orderly way but also to insist that a candidate show broad support,"" the judge wrote. Two other candidates did qualify for the GOP primary: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. Gingrich told CNN's Erin Burnett the decision means ""voters of Virginia have been denied five candidacies that ought to be on there."" ""We're going to keep going,"" Gingrich said. ""It just means that I have to ultimately, coming out of winning South Carolina (and) winning Florida, I'll have to beat Romney in enough extra states to make up for it."" The Paul camp welcomed the decision and said the campaign is now a ""two-man race."" ""Nothing new was learned here today, as the Virginia ruling merely confirms the suspicions of what many people feel about the viability of Perry, Gingrich, Huntsman, and Santorum,"" national campaign chairman Jesse Benton said in a statement. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said he didn't expect the ruling to be the last word in the ongoing case, which is expected to be appealed to a federal appeals court in Richmond. ""I am pleased that the district court is allowing Virginia's orderly election process to move forward,"" Cuccinelli said in a statement. ""The ruling today dealt only with the request for a preliminary injunction. The litigation is ongoing."" Virginia holds its Republican primary on March 6, Super Tuesday. At stake in the primary are Virginia's 49 delegates. Virginia state law specifically prohibits voters from writing in candidates not on the ballot in primary elections. Huntsman and Santorum did not file petitions with the Virginia State Board of Elections that would have allowed them a place in the state's primary. Gingrich and Perry filed petitions that were rejected by the Republican Party of Virginia for not meeting requirements. The four candidates sued the state's board of elections over laws they claimed were unconstitutional. Virginia requires candidates to obtain 10,000 signatures from registered voters in the state, with at least 400 signatures coming from each of the state's 11 congressional districts. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Gingrich says ""we're going to keep going""

"(CNN) -- After seven years in exile, former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will be back in his homeland Friday, two days ahead of a highly anticipated election, his U.S. attorney said. Aristide was at the privately-owned Lanseria International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa on Thursday, said lawyer Ira Kurzban who is accompanying Aristide back to Port-au-Prince along with actor Danny Glover, an Aristide supporter and critic of U.S. objections to his return. A diplomatic source who is not authorized to speak to the media confirmed to CNN that Aristide was boarding an outgoing jet from South Africa Thursday night. A group of prominent U.S. lawyers sent a letter, meanwhile, to Cheryl Mills, chief of staff at the State Department, lashing out at what they said was American interference with Aristide's ""constitutional and human right to return."" ""The United States trying to control when any Haitian citizen -- especially a former president -- can enter Haiti is outrageous,"" said Bill Quigley, a New Orleans law professor and legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. ""It violates a stack of binding international human rights treaties,"" he said. ""I felt compelled to speak out to defend both President Aristide's human rights and the American tradition of rule of law that I teach in my classroom."" The United States warned Monday that Aristide's presence in Haiti could disrupt Sunday's runoff vote that will decide Haiti's next leader. The office has been in dispute since a late November election ended with controversy and allegations of widespread fraud. ""Mr. Aristide has chosen to remain outside of Haiti for seven years,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. ""To return this week can only be seen as a conscious choice to impact Haiti's elections... Return prior to the election may potentially be destabilizing to the political process."" Kurzban said Aristide planned to get involved with educational projects and teach. He wants to return before Sunday's election, Kurzban said, because he had ""genuine concerns that the next president may take a different view"" and not allow Aristide to return. ""It is not to be involved in the elections, as the United States suggests,"" Kurzban said. Aristide's supporters, including Glover, say that the former Roman Catholic priest and Haiti's first democratically elected president was shuttled out of Haiti by the United States after his second presidential term was aborted by a coup in 2004. They say the White House wants to keep Aristide out of Haiti in favor of a leader more in line with its own views. ""I am going to South Africa to show our solidarity with the people of Haiti by standing at the side of the leader they elected twice with overwhelming support: President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,"" Glover said in a statement. ""People of good conscience cannot be idle while a former dictator is able to return unhindered while a democratic leader who peacefully handed over power to another elected president is restricted from returning to his country by external forces,"" Glover said, referring to Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, who fled into exile in France in 1986 after 15 years of iron-fisted rule. Duvalier stunned the world by returning to Haiti in January. Shortly after, Aristide again aired his desire to go back home. The Haitian government issued him a new passport last month. Aristide retains a following in Haiti, especially among the poorest of the poor, who first catapulted him to power in 1990 with more than 67 percent of the vote. But Aristide's relationship with his homeland, as well as the international community, has been a complicated one. He gained popularity in Haiti by giving the poor and disenfranchised a voice, but his critics accused him of corruption, greed and human rights abuses -- problems that have plagued the impoverished Caribbean nation under other leaders as well. Last year, a massive earthquake devastated Haiti. Recovery efforts have been slow and have complicated the election process. The United Nations voiced concerns this week over violence marring the campaign and called on ""all candidates, especially those in the presidential run-off, to avoid threats, intimidation and harassment."" ""Consolidation of democracy in Haiti depends largely on the will of politicians to adopt the principles of a peaceful transfer of power and to accept election results in accordance with mechanisms provided by the electoral law,"" said a statement from the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which has been in Haiti since Aristide's departure. The presidential vote pits former first lady Mirlande Manigat against popular musician Michel Martelly in a runoff that was delayed by two months because of unrest and charges of fraud. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this story from Cape Town, South Africa.","Aristide is scheduled to fly to Haiti Thursday night .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's electoral map has many colors in comparison to the red and blue of America, yet on both sides of the Atlantic, battleground state elections can portend change on the national level. Voters in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state, go to the polls this Sunday, and what they decide will set the tone for German federal politics just as citizen sentiments in bellwethers such as Ohio or Pennsylvania affect the balance of power in Washington DC. In turn, Brussels will be watching because Germany is the power broker within the EU -- and this will not be the first time that NRW has caused Europe to pause while German political parties jockeyed to govern in a region that generates nearly 4% of EU GDP. The state has many large cities with a population density to match Tokyo, and nearly a quarter of Germany's top 100 companies are based there. When NRW voters went to the polls in 2010 Europe was on their minds. The Greek drama was unfolding but the German government -- consisting of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and its junior partner, the Liberals (FDP) -- tactically delayed any action until after the vote in NRW. Nonetheless, the Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens came back into power in the form of a minority government. Because a budget could not be passed this March the legislature was dissolved and NRW will again hold a vote, this time with Greece confronting an exit from the eurozone and other EU nations choked with debt and high unemployment. This week's state election will also be a referendum on Chancellor Merkel's handling of the Euro crisis. Although Chancellor Merkel has governed since 2005, first in a grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) and then with the CDU's dream partner, the FDP, since 2009, and although she consistently tops popularity polls among her peers; Germany has seen the winds of change in a number of state elections over the past two years. The North Rhine-Westphalia electoral results will have pundits and pollsters predicting its significance for the capital. NRW is an election to watch for trends and disruptions in German politics. In the short term, the first question will be whether or not the governing coalition will last until the next federal election scheduled for the fall of 2013. After all, Chancellor Merkel can thank the 2005 NRW election for ushering the CDU back into federal government one year sooner than hoped for. NRW was a traditional stronghold for the SPD, and after many decades serving as a governing party, the Social Democrats along with the Greens were voted out in favor of the CDU and FDP. As a result, Chancellor Schroeder tried to consolidate power in the midst of internal struggles within his own party due to reform under Agenda 2010. At the time, Germany was suffering high unemployment and sluggish growth. Agenda 2010 was a plan to jump-start the country's social market economy with tax cuts and entitlement reductions. Chancellor Schroeder called for a snap election that year and a few months later found himself handing over the keys to the Chancellery to Angela Merkel. Today, many would agree that Germany's current economic strength is linked to the belt-tightening and painful measures undertaken in the name of Agenda 2010. Moreover, the 2005 NRW election introduced an era of fragmentation and disenchantment in the German political landscape. The 2005 NRW election gave rise to the Left, exhibited low voter turnout, and left the traditional catch-all parties straddling right-and-left of center. These trends happened again during the federal election a few months later and consequently it took nearly two months for Germany to form a government. One can only imagine the amount of coalition wrangling during the next federal election with yet another political party on the scene -- the Pirate Party. So far, the Pirate Party, which made its debut during the Berlin state election last September, seems to have a singular focus on the interne. But the subject of transparency is also on the agenda and has struck a chord with German voters. When one hand doesn't suffice to count the number of political parties in Germany, anticipate instability within Europe's powerhouse. Voters in North Rhine-Westphalia won't experience automated calls or be asked to donate over the internet, but the votes they cast will have an impact on the future course of Germany and its role within Europe.

"(CNN) -- A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Monday off the third-largest island in the Philippines, prompting the country to issue a tsunami alert for the coastlines near the epicenter. The quake struck about 11:49 a.m. (10:49 p.m. Sunday ET) about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from the coastal city of Dumaguete on the Philippine island of Negros, the USGS said. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology issued a Level 2 tsunami alert for areas along the Tanon Strait between Negros and the neighboring island of Cebu. That's a notch below the highest tsunami alert of Level 3, which requires evacuation of the affected areas, a spokeswoman for the institute said. She said the institute was advising people to watch out for unusual waves and to stay away from the shoreline. The alert was issued at 12:31 p.m. (11:31 p.m. Sunday ET), the spokeswoman said. No tsunami warning has been issued for the wider Pacific region and there is no tsunami threat to Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The earthquake occurred in the ocean at a depth of 46.6 kilometers (29 miles), according to the USGS. There were no initial reports of widespread damage. At the Circle Inn Hotel in the city of Bacolod, which is on Negros but not on the coast nearest the quake's epicenter, a receptionist said the quake lasted between three and five minutes. ""We felt the shaking,"" the receptionist said. ""The guests all exited the building. But all the people here are okay."" There was no damage to the hotel, the receptionist said.","NEW: The Philippines issues a tsunami alert for the coastlines near the quake .

"(CNN) -- Expressing apologies that she can't accompany him to prom on his birthday, country music beauty Taylor Swift on Friday asked an 18-year-old student with cancer to be her date to the Academy of Country Music Awards in April. Kevin McGuire was diagnosed with leukemia in 2007 at the age of 13. The cancer was in remission for years before a recent relapse. Realizing he would lose his hair because of treatment, McGuire was worried about securing a date. His older sister, Victoria, asked, ""What if I got Taylor Swift?"" She started a Facebook page on Tuesday that went viral overnight, garnering more than 93,000 likes and the attention of Swift herself. In a message left on the Facebook page, Swift said, ""Kevin, I'm so sorry but I won't be able to make it to your prom. But I was wondering, the ACM Awards are coming up. Would you be my date?"" Representatives for Swift confirmed that the message was posted by the singer. McGuire has a fever and is extremely ill, so he won't be able to participate in a YouTube video Victoria and his younger brother planned on making in response to Swift. McGuire, a New Jersey high school student, will be in and out of the hospital the remainder of his senior year and turns 19 on prom night, according to his sister.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- The third most powerful political figure in the Yemeni government has died from wounds he received in the presidential palace attack in Sanaa last June. Yemen State TV announced the death in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, of Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani, the president of the Shura Council, and announced the start of a three-day mourning period. Along with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, he had been receiving treatment in Saudi Arabia since June 3. Saleh remains in Saudi Arabia. Ghani is the second senior official to be reported dead from the palace bombing. Ghani was known to be one of the few officials Saleh trusted, and he stood beside Saleh for more than three decades. He took the post of prime minister in 1975, three years before Saleh became president. Government spokesman Abdu Ganadi said that Yemen lost a leader who served his country for more than five decades. ""He is a victim of a terror attack. Yemen lost a leader and the government holds the Ahmar family responsible for his death. The palace attack was planned by the terrorist Ahmar family,"" Ganadi said. He was referring to the family of Sadeq al-Ahmar, the leader of Hamil al-Ahmar, a Hashed tribal confederation. Hours after the attack, Yemeni security forces pounded al-Ahmar's home, killing 10 people and wounding 35, because they blamed his followers, a Hamil al-Ahmar official said. Ghani's death came as hundreds of security forces were deployed to the streets of the capital, Sanaa, amid fears that the imminent toppling of the regime in Libya could have an effect on Yemen. Tens of thousands of youth protesters marched in the streets of main cities celebrating the success of a third revolution of the Arab world in 2011. ""Yemen will follow the path of Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia. It is only a matter of time until the Saleh regime faces the same fate,"" said Khaled Anesi, a leader in the Yemen Revolution Youth Council. Anti-government protests continued on Monday in 15 of Yemen's 18 provinces. Opposition parties are giving youth extra dose of courage and hope, vowing that they will not give in until Saleh meets the fate of other fallen rulers. Mohammed Qahtan, the spokesman for the opposition Joint Meeting Parties, said that what happened in Libya is a brief showcase of what will soon follow in Sanaa. He said that the Yemeni people will have their goals met within days and the revolution will prosper. ""The ruling family has not learned its lesson from Libya and insists on using force against its own people,"" Qahtan said. ""The will of the people is stronger than any ruler or dictator.""","Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani was president of the Shura Council .

"(CNN) -- Sanaa residents reported hearing heavy explosions and sporadic gunfire for several hours early Tuesday, one day after security forces set fire to tents and tore through demonstrators' camps in Freedom Square in Taiz with bulldozers, an activist and eyewitnesses said. It was not immediately clear what caused the blast sounds in Sanaa, which residents described as coming from the Hasabah neighborhood, an area close to it and the region near the airport. Hasabah is home to Sheikh Sadeq al-Ahmar, leader of the powerful al-Hashid tribe, whose forces oppose the government. Eyewitnesses in the capital city said they saw a heavy security presence in Sanaa, as well as what they described as ""armed thugs"" roaming the streets. In Taiz, a center of protests against the Yemeni president, the protest camp was essentially gone on Monday, said Bushra Maktati, a leading human rights activist. A field hospital was also dismantled, with the equipment taken away by troops, Maktati said. Troops also used water cannons to disperse thousands of protesters in the city on Monday, a day after clashes left at least 20 people dead and 200 wounded, according to eyewitnesses and two medical officials who could not be named because of security concerns. One youth activist said the attacks would not stop their protests. ""Our revolution will not stop even if hundreds are killed every day,"" said Sameer Al-Samaee, a leading youth activist in Taiz. ""Killing innocent civilians always leads to war crime charges and that is what we are seeking for Saleh."" Meanwhile, government forces launched airstrikes against Islamic militants in the coastal city of Zinjibar, where fierce fighting raged Sunday. And the nation's largest cell phone network was ordered shut down Sunday, according to a senior official with the country's Communications Ministry who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The SABAFON network was ordered shut down because of violations and unpaid fines over the last few years, the Communications Ministry official told CNN. A management official with the SABAFON network, who also was not authorized to speak to the press, confirmed the shutdown. The official denied the government's allegations and said the move appeared to be a tactic to pressure members of the al-Ahmar family, including Hamid al-Ahmar -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh's chief political enemy. The official said members of the al-Ahmar family are majority shareholders in SABAFON, with the largest shareholder being Hamid al-Ahmar. Saleh has been under intense pressure to resign after months of protests and mounting opposition. Taiz, where protests continued Monday, has been a center of anti-Saleh activity. The most recent protests broke out Sunday when thousands of protesters took to the streets and were met with gunfire from security forces. Protesters threw rocks at the forces, who responded with more gunfire, witnesses said. The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa condemned what it called the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"" on demonstrators in Taiz. It praised the protesters and called on Saleh ""to move immediately on his commitment to transfer power."" On Monday, security forces were arresting youths and taking them from the streets to an unknown location, Maktati, the human rights activist, said. At least 70 tents had been burned down by security forces since late Sunday night, according to witnesses. Abdu Ganadi, a government spokesman, said security forces were rescuing colleagues who had been captured and beaten by protesters. ""We did not attack the protesters,"" Ganadi said. ""Reports are all exaggerated. Only two were killed."" He said protesters' tents were burned by people attacked by the protesters, and that tents that burned were empty. In Zinjibar, fighting continued Monday between Yemeni troops and Islamic militants. Militants moved into the city on Friday and controlled the streets by Saturday, residents said. The militants began ferocious attacks on Saturday, according to a Yemeni government official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Security forces and soldiers abandoned their posts, leading to chaos, the source said. Hundreds of soldiers moved back into the city on Sunday, with heavy fighting between militants and the Army's 25th Mechanized Brigade, the source said. More than two dozen soldiers had been killed since the start of the battle on Saturday, said a government source Sunday who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The fighting occurred on the same day Saleh met with top military and security officials to talk about ""hostilities and crimes"" occurring in his country, the Yemeni State News Agency reported. Saleh has been resisting protests calling on him to step down after 33 years in power. The powerful al-Hashid tribe, which includes the al-Ahmar family, rose up against long-time leader Saleh in the last week, after he backed out of a regionally brokered deal meant to ease him out of office and end months of demonstrations of the kind that have swept the Arab world this year. The recent fighting has raised fears of a full-blown civil war in Yemen, an impoverished, arid and mountainous nation that has been a key U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network.","Witnesses say security forces use bulldozers and fire to dismantle camps in Taiz .

"Florence, California (CNN) -- Sergio Blanco faced the most painstaking moment of parenthood the past week when he had to ask two of his young sons whether they were sexually molested at Miramonte Elementary School. All throughout this working-class neighborhood, hundreds of parents have been holding similar conversations, searching for the right vocabulary for body parts in talking to their kids as young as kindergarten-age. The moment has marked a collective loss of innocence for the Mexican immigrant enclave, where the chimes of a church bell tower sing on the half-hour and front yards yield a cornucopia of lemon and orange trees. If it wasn't shocking enough to discover that a former teacher allegedly photographed his pupils in adult-like bondage with a suspected semen-filled spoon next to their mouths, an equally disturbing aftermath now roils the Spanish-mission-style homes and flats. Parents must ask their kids whether they appear in the now 600 photos found by detectives. The difficulty of such questioning is compounded by how such open talk is taboo in their culture, parents said in Spanish. ""A parent isn't prepared to have such a conversation -- just trying to figure out what kind of words to use,"" said Blanco, a 42-year-old painter whose front yard has a full view of the turquoise-and-mustard-colored facade and school entrance. Playful murals of kids, jungle beasts, and leaders ranging from Mother Teresa to John F. Kennedy adorn the two-story exterior. ""I told them they could tell me anything,"" Blanco said in an interview at his house, with his sons playing in the family car. ""Don't be afraid. You can confide in me."" Two of his five sons attend Miramonte Elementary, in third and sixth grades. ""This is a very grave problem -- something very serious,"" Blanco said. ""They said they weren't touched at all -- on their buttocks, their penis or testicles."" His son Andrew, a third-grader, seemed to display a naivete of the matter that would be expected out of any 9-year-old. ""I was like ...,"" he said, pausing, ""kind of uncomfortable -- because you don't know if any of the teachers are coming back. ""It was like somebody was going to send me to somebody's classroom,"" he said about being asked about inappropriate touching. Norma Ascencio, who has two daughters enrolled at Miramonte, said parents have agonized over asking their children about their teachers. ""In the Latino culture, it's a conversation that is like a taboo,"" said Ascencio, whose daughters are enrolled in fourth and fifth grades. ""It's a very uncomfortable conversation. But we have to do it. ""The kids were shy,"" Ascencio said. ""One of my girls said, 'I don't want to hear anything about that teacher.' "" ""That teacher"" is 30-year teaching veteran Mark Berndt, 61, who was arrested last week and is accused of taking the bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom. On Thursday, Los Angeles County investigators announced they have found 200 more photos allegedly taken by Berndt, who has been charged with 23 felony counts of lewd acts with pupils, according to a sheriff's spokesman. Authorities have been able to identify pupils in 175 of the 200 photographs and they are trying to identify those in the remaining 25, said Sgt. Dan Scott of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Authorities declined to provide further details. Authorities now have a total of 600 photographs allegedly taken by Berndt, and in further example of their perverse nature, some of them also feature a large three-inch cockroach crawling on kids' faces, authorities said. A year ago, the school board fired Berndt in the wake of an investigation into him that began more than a year ago; Berndt appealed his termination but he dropped the appeal and resigned last spring, Waldman said. Berndt is now being held in lieu of $23 million bond, authorities said. In their expanding investigation into alleged teacher sexual misconduct at Miramonte, authorities this week also charged a second teacher, Martin Bernard Springer, 49, of Alhambra, California, whom the school board fired Tuesday. Springer pleaded not guilty Tuesday to three felony charges of lewd acts with a female pupil under the age of 14. As the controversy unfolded, the Los Angeles Unified School District has decided to restaff the entire school. The school board closed the 70-teacher school to kids and their parents Tuesday and Wednesday so that the system could conduct the wholesale restaffing. That decision has upset many parents, who are angry that the school's good teachers are being punished -- by being transferred to another school -- because of crimes allegedly committed by a couple of other teachers. On Wednesday, the new school staff was being trained in the Miramonte auditorium, said one of the teachers, special education assistant Contisia Davis. The 1,400-student school is scheduled to reopen with entirely new staff on Thursday. In an interview on the school campus during a break in the training, Davis described the auditorium mood as ""optimistic,"" though new teachers are facing a daunting task of taking over a school mid-year, with state assessment exams coming up in two weeks. ""It looks good in there because everyone is doing their job and doing the best they can,"" Davis said. A 16-year teaching veteran, Davis said she was specially selected to work at Miramonte; she was assigned to the school system's Manual Arts High School until she was told of her Miramonte assignment Tuesday. As an indicator of how the school sits in a low-income area, all of Miramonte's 1,400 students receive a free or reduced-price meal under the federal school lunch program. The student enrollment is 98% Hispanic and 2% African-American; 56% of the students are learning English, according to the school system. Davis, 36, said she and the new faculty were being trained on how to include social skills in their lesson plans -- so that kids can adjust to the sudden change of having all new teachers. ""The teachers are concerned on how the children are going to feel,"" Davis said. Despite the optimism, there were anxieties, Davis said. ""It's a rat race: everyone is trying to figure out who's who. This is all our first day here,"" Davis added. Gloria Silva, who has a daughter enrolled in fifth grade at Miramonte and whose four other children graduated from the school, said she was worried that Miramonte's state test scores would suffer when the exams are administered later this month. Miramonte is a kindergarten-through-sixth-grade school located in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about 6 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. The school struggles academically, according to its website: ""The 2011 Adequate Yearly Progress report indicates that in the areas of language arts and mathematics our students did not meet the proficiency target rate of 67.6% in (English/language arts) and 68.5% in math. All of our subgroups did not meet AYP targets."" Those results worry Silva. ""The test scores are going to get worse -- to fall even lower,"" Silva said, joined by several other mothers standing by the flag pole in front of the school entrance. She and the half-dozen other mothers denounced the complete reconstitution of the school staff, from cafeteria to classroom to principal's office, she said. ""The school is already below standards,"" Silva added. Another mother agreed. ""There are good teachers here, too,"" said Maria Flores, who has two children at Miramonte. She will miss the principal, she said. ""The principal is always telling the students, 'Go for it! Study hard! I come from Mexico too,'"" Flores said. ""He was a motivator.""","A sexual misconduct scandal forces parents to have difficult talks with kids .

"(CNN) -- Recent Yemeni airstrikes targeting Islamic militants in the south accidentally killed at least 11 pro-government tribesmen, a senior Yemeni military official told CNN Sunday. The attack took place just east of Zinjibar, the provincial capital of Yemen's restive Abyan province and a city that has seen clashes between government forces and al Qaeda-affiliated fighters intensify since Islamic militants first seized the town in May. ""We give our condolences to the brave tribal fighters who were killed in the Abyan air attack,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The officials blamed the incident on poor communication: ""Coordination between the tribes and the government forces is limited, and that is why the raid missed its target."" Still, the botched attack threatens to further weaken an already-strained  relationship between Yemen's government and the country's powerful  tribal structure. Indeed, a field leader for the tribal fighters in Abyan said the tribes informed the government of their whereabouts prior to the airstrikes to ensure that the tribes were not accidentally hit. ""Though the government was informed of where we where, tribes were attacked by not one air raid, but two air attacks,"" said Mohammed al-Gadani. ""The current regime and al-Qaeda are a coin with two faces. Both are working together against the stability of Yemen,"" said al-Gadani. Yemen has been beset for months by anti-government ferment and militant  activity. Ali Abdullah Saleh is recovering at a Saudi Arabian hospital  from wounds he received in an attack last month. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. However, Saleh's opponents have accused him of exploiting those fears in order to maintain U.S. support and stay in power. On Saturday, hundreds of influential Yemeni tribal leaders met in the capital, Sanaa, and vowed to unite against Saleh. Calling their assembly the ""Alliance of Yemeni Tribes,"" attendees chose Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar as their leader. Al-Ahmar, the current sheikh of the powerful Hashid tribe, called on Saleh to step down after the shooting of dozens of protesters in March. His tribe has opposed government forces and fought back against them in May and early June. Al-Ahmar delivered a speech in which he promised, ""President Saleh will not rule Yemen after today as long as I live."" At the end of their meeting, the tribes issued a statement calling for a civil nation and a country where everyone is treated equally.","NEW: Tribal fighters accuse Saleh's regime of being two-faced .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration's attempt to mandate that Catholic organizations provide contraception to their employees in insurance plans injected some ugly nostalgia into the presidential race in recent weeks. ""The sexual and religious politics of the 1990s (are) suddenly back,"" wrote Andrew Sullivan in Newsweek, while Mormon Glenn Beck said that ""We are all Catholics now"" (somebody tell the Pope). President Barack Obama has stirred up the Republican Party's inner-fundamentalist -- an angry, vengeful spirit currently being channeled by candidate Rick Santorum. As Saint Santorum leaps to the top of the national polls, it does indeed feel like a return to the 1990s. In that decade, the prominence of God and guns created a brutal partisan atmosphere that pitted liberal against conservative, libertine against fundamentalist. But while the issues Santorum is pushing are the same, America in 2012 is different place. Santorum will have to sell his social conservatism to the ""Modern Family"" generation -- people who are a little more tolerant than their parents were and lot more interested in positive solutions to economics problems. In other words, this is not your mother's culture wars. That one, the old one, was formally declared 20 years ago by conservative pundit and presidential candidate Pat Buchanan. On August 17, 1992, he told the Republican National Convention, ""There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the Cold War itself. For this war is for the soul of America."" Watching at home, a young Rachel Maddow -- who had just come out to her friends as a lesbian -- recognized the speech as ""positive polarization,"" dividing the country in two and reaching out to the bigger, more conservative half. Buchanan, she once told an interviewer, was ""without euphemism, declaring that my own country was at war with me."" At the time, a Gallup Poll showed that only 38% of Americans thought homosexuality was an ""acceptable alternative lifestyle."" Positive polarization worked: The night after the speech, the GOP candidate President George H.W. Bush leapt 9 percentage points in the polls and looked competitive against Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. Clinton still won the 1992 election handily, but the culture war would handicap his presidency. It contributed to the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994 and climaxed in the impeachment of Clinton in 1998. (He was acquitted.) But America started to change in the new millennium. War and unemployment drew voters' attention away from social issues. Religious conservatism as a political project was largely discredited by the burlesque of its leaders. Televangelist Pat Robertson claimed he could deflect hurricanes with prayer, Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell blamed 9/11 on homosexuals, and evangelical pastor Ted Haggard bought crystal meth from a gay prostitute. (Update on Haggard: He's now ""what the kids call bisexual."") Of course, social conservative activists never went away -- they just stopped proselytizing and joined the tea party instead. A recent Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found that the tea party draws a great deal of its strength from religious conservatives. Sixty-four percent oppose gay marriage, 59% want abortion illegal in most circumstances, and 42% say they empathize with the ""Christian movement."" No wonder then that they are thrilled by the so-called revival of the culture war, or that they are gravitating toward the super Catholic Santorum. There is more than a thematic connection between Santorum and the age of Buchanan. Santorum's campaign manager is Mike Biundo, who worked for Buchanan in 1996. His statewide staff is peppered with former Buchananites (Jim Finnegan and Ted Maravelias of New Hampshire, Michael Phillips and Craig R Bachler of Florida), and his list of endorsements is a roll call of '90s Christian conservatives: Gary Bauer, James Dobson, Phyllis Schlafly and Richard Viguerie. Just to complete the picture, Mitt Romney touted an endorsement from Buchanan's old rival Bob Dole. The revival of the cultural conflict will probably help Santorum in the GOP primaries. All his victories have come in Midwest caucus states, with a turnout presumably dominated by the faithful. But within the wider population, the conversation about God and sex is probably less relevant than it was in Buchanan's day. Attitudes on abortion have ebbed and flowed, but on everything else the public has mellowed. Take gay rights. In 1992, 48% of Americans thought sexual relations between people of the same gender should be legal. Now it's 62% and, for the first time, a majority of Americans also support same-sex marriage. Likewise, Public Policy Polling insists that Republican opposition to the contraception mandate will actually cost it votes. Generational change and economic problems have rendered debates about lifestyle largely academic. One might hypothesize that the new culture war is really about partisan battles between political elites rather than a genuine social rift within the adult population. At this moment in the news cycle, it hurts Obama that he is being screamed at by little old nuns, and it helps Santorum that he is mobilizing bishops and rabbis.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cartoonist Jerry Robinson, who worked on the earliest Batman comics and claimed credit for creating the super-villain The Joker, died Thursday at the age of 89, his family confirmed. ""Batman has lost another father,"" Batman movie producer Michael Uslan said. ""Farewell to my dear, dear friend, mentor and idol, Jerry Robinson."" Spider-man co-creator Stan Lee, who was with rival Marvel Comics, called him ""a genuine talent and a genuine gentleman."" ""Jerry Robinson was not only one of the finest artists ever to illustrate comic books, but he was also the head of an editorial syndicate which made cartoons available worldwide, as well as being an inspiration to young artists, whom he always found time to help and advise,"" Lee said. Robinson, in a panel discussion at New York Comic Con in 2009, said he was a 17-year-old creative writing student at Columbia University when he was hired as a writer and illustrator at DC Comics. Though he was initially just assisting Batman creators Bob Kane and Bill Finger, his chance to create The Joker came in 1940, when the demand for more Batman stories overloaded Finger. ""This was going to be a problem, so I volunteered to do one of the stories,"" Robinson said. He handed in the work for a grade in his college creative writing class, he said. ""I wanted a very strong villain, because I thought that's going to carry the story,"" Robinson said. ""Villains are more exciting."" He wanted his villain to have a sense of humor, and ""in a space of hours"" one night ""somehow The Joker came out,"" Robinson said. The first Joker image was modeled out of the joker card in a deck of playing cards, he said. ""It's extraordinary what's happened over the years,"" he said. Cesar Romero played The Joker in the 1960 television Batman TV series, followed by Jack Nicholson's and Heath Ledger's portrayals in Batman films. ""His creative work is immortal as co-creator of The Joker, Robin the Boy Wonder, and the visualizations of Alfred, The Penguin and many more,"" Uslan said. ""Jerry elevated comic books as art and fought for respectability for all his fellow artists."" Robinson's role in the creation of The Joker is a long-running controversy in the comics industry. Kane downplayed Robinson as his assistant at the time. But those now working for the DC Entertainment issued statements Thursday making it clear they credit Robinson for his creative contributions. ""Jerry Robinson illustrated some of the defining images of pop culture's greatest icons,"" DC Entertainment Co-Publisher Jim Lee said. ""As an artist myself, it's impossible not to feel humbled by his body of work. Everyone who loves comics owes Jerry a debt of gratitude for the rich legacy that he leaves behind."" ""It's impossible to work at DC Entertainment without feeling the impact of Jerry Robinson's contributions to the industry,"" DC Entertainment Editor-in-Chief Bob Harras said. ""His influence continues to resonate today.""","""Batman has lost another father,"" Batman movie producer Michael Uslan says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Wearing a floaty, flowery dress doesn't convey the traditional image of power, yet when it's designed by Diane von Furstenberg, somehow, inexplicably, it does. It's not just about dresses. Diane von Furstenberg aims to empower women with confidence. The Belgian designer, now long-time New Yorker, was peddling her own brand of 'girl power' long before Posh, Baby and Sporty, et. al. were spicing up anything. Diane Halfin was 22 when she arrived in the United States. It was 1969. She was young, pregnant, devoid of any real design experience and yet to sell a single dress. On paper, it sounds like a hard-luck story. In reality, she was the beautiful daughter of wealthy parents, the product of boarding schools in Lausanne, Switzerland and Oxford, England, followed by a year studying Spanish at the University of Madrid. She was well-connected, hugely ambitious and soon to be married to a prince. Egon von Furstenberg was a Swiss-born aristocrat whose name opened doors. Their marriage lasted just three years.  Watch Revealed: Diane von Furstenberg » . ""Yes, of course the fact that I was a woman in my early 20s and that I looked cute and that I had a lot of drive and that on top of it all, I was a princess, all of that helped,"" Diane von Furstenberg told CNN from her office in New York, her face repeated on authentic Andy Warhol prints behind her on the wall. ""But none of these ingredients alone would have been enough,"" she continued. ""What really made me very successful is that I had created a product that women wanted, and that made sense, and that was in demand."" That product was the wrap dress, a simple stretch of jersey fabric that ties around the waist. Diane von Furstenberg sold her first dress during New York Fashion Week in 1970. By 1975, she was making 15,000 dresses a week and millions of dollars in sales. It wasn't just the wrap dress Diane von Furstenberg was selling; her image and lifestyle came as part of the package, first by accident, then by design. ""The first time I took a picture of myself for my first ad was because I had no money for hiring a model,"" Von Furstenberg said. ""I sat on a white cube and a friend of mine took a picture, and then I looked at the picture and thought 'oh the cube is too white' and I wrote on it 'Feel like a woman, wear a dress' and that photograph stayed with me for decades."" Emboldened by her success in fashion, Diane von Furstenberg launched a perfume ""Tatiana,"" and then a range of cosmetics. Her name and image became so synonymous with style and strong sales that she signed a number of licensing deals that saw the DVF brand stamped on everything from sheets and towels to curtains and rugs. Diane Von Furstenberg's golden touch hasn't always been foolproof. In 1978 she sold her entire inventory of wrap dresses after steep discounting at New York retailers prompted fashion bible ""Women's Wear Daily"" to declare that the trend for wrap dresses was over. Reluctantly, Von Furstenberg sold her remaining inventory to pay off her debts and focused on expanding her other ventures. By 1980, DVF had seventeen licenses. ""Everything was a license,"" Von Furstenberg told CNN. ""Different companies were handling things and the spirit of the brand disappeared."" ""I was very frustrated because I had originally created something wonderful that I was very proud of. [But] it had disappeared and I realized that a lot of my own identity had gone with it. So I became very insecure. And I don't like feeling insecure, it's not a fun thing."" For a woman who's passionate about empowering women, an admission of insecurity from Diane von Furstenberg is surprising, and one guesses quite rare. She's a strong woman, a fighter, who's staged successive comebacks after knocks in her professional and personal life. Fourteen years ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. The source was traced back to tiny cancerous cells at the base of her tongue and soft palate. ""I was shocked, but I had to deal with it,"" Von Furstenberg said. ""Parallel to the [radiation] treatment I did a lot of yoga. I was very lucky, I was extremely lucky because it went away."" ""I think that in life you just have to deal with what you have to deal with, and you take it straight on and you do what you have to do and you have no choice,"" she added. A few years later, in 1997, almost 20 years after she sold her first dress, Von Furstenberg noticed that the wrap dress was slowly reappearing. Like most out-of-favor fashion trends, the clothes were coming out of the closet and back onto the street. It was the green light for Diane von Furstenberg to resume production of the dress that catapulted her to worldwide fame in the 1970s. She's resigned to the fact that she'll always be regarded first and the foremost as the designer of the wrap dress, despite the varied nature of her collections.  See video of the launch of DVF's ""La Petite Valise"" collection in Florence » . ""I mean the wrap dress is a tiny part of what I do, but yet, it will always be part of what I do,"" Von Furstenberg said. Along with her work as a fashion designer, Von Furstenberg is also President of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a position she accepted in 2006. She also campaigns for the empowerment of women through the non-governmental organization Vital Voices, and last month took her message to the Women's Forum, a global meeting modeled on the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""If I have any mission in life as a designer, or even as a woman, or as a mother, as a friend, it is to empower women. To make women feel confident, so that they trust themselves, their judgment, their power, their capacity."" By the end of the year, there'll be 29 Diane von Furstenberg boutiques in major city centers around the world, with the three newest set to open before the end of year. ""I'm very happy with where the brand is now,"" Von Furstenberg told CNN. ""There's a spirit behind the brand and that is really something that I'm so proud of and that I really want to capture."" ""So in a sense I have begun now, the new moment, the period of my life where I'm really kind of preparing the legacy so that maybe the spirit of the brand and the brand will last after me."" Cue a cheer from the legions of DVF fans around the world. Are you one of them? If so, we want to hear from you. Why did you buy your dress and what does it mean to you?

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban recruited and trained a suicide bomber, then sold him to the Haqqani network to carry out an attack in Afghanistan, but he was arrested before pulling off the plan, an official with Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) said Monday. The accusation comes amid a growing war of words between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with each side blaming the other for instability and attacks, including cross-border bombardments. Last week Pakistan complained that the Afghan government and NATO were not doing anything to prevent the Taliban from crossing into tribal agencies in the east. The Afghan NDS source, who did not want to be named for security reasons, said Afghan authorities arrested a man trying to commit a suicide attack in the Jaji Maidan district of Paktia Province in eastern Afghanistan. The bomber, identified as Sheer Hassan Khanjar, is from Miran Shah, Pakistan, and was recruited by Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, the official said. After three years of training in how to carry out a suicide attack, the would-be bomber was sold to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the NDS source said. Sirajuddin Haqqani is a leader of the Haqqani network, which operates on both sides of the Pakistani-Afghan border. Afghanistan officials believe the Haqqani network was behind last week's deadly siege on a Kabul hotel. Sheer Hassan, the alleged would-be suicide bomber, told Afghan officials that someone working for Mehsud sold him and others to the Haqqani network. Pakistan army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said he had no information about claims the Haqqani network may be buying Pakistani suicide bombers from Mehsud and the Pakistani Taliban. Abbas said the Pakistani government has long acknowledged that militants move back and forth along the border, and Pakistan is doing its part to stop it. ""It's difficult to stop militants crossing the border in that region but it's the responsibility of both sides to stop it,"" Abbas said. ""We have more than 900 check posts along the border and that's more than they have on the other side."" Tensions between the two nations have shown no sign of waning despite Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to Islamabad last month. Journalist Fazel Reshad Wardak and CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Bomber was recruited and trained by the Pakistani Taliban, an Afghan official says .

"(CNN) -- The top general in the Yemeni opposition says he rejects a new proposal that would allow the country's embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to remain in power until a new leader is found. ""The general public in Yemen is seeking a transfer of power to the vice president,"" Gen. Ali Mohsen al-Ahmer said in an exclusive interview with CNN. ""This is a principle that we must follow because there are agreements that sides have signed and it is compulsory that all sides agree on its specifics; not change its points."" Ahmer, a leading Yemeni military leader who defected to the opposition in March, told CNN that the Yemeni people want full implementation of an agreement written by the Gulf Cooperation Council that would push out Saleh and hold elections for a new government. Ahmer also called for the United States, the European Union and the GCC to pressure Saleh to step down. ""Our friends the Americans and the Europeans and the British and the GCC and Saudi Arabia are guarantors for its implementation,"" Ahmer said of the power transfer plan. Yemen has been consumed by unrest for months as protesters have demanded an end to Saleh's rule. And Ahmer's stance is likely to harden its political stalemate. Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansoor Hadi is the acting leader of Yemen in the absence of Saleh, who was wounded in a June 3 assassination attempt and is getting treatment in Saudi Arabia. Saleh has said he intends to return. Under the Gulf Cooperation Council plan, Saleh would have given up power to a transitional government after 30 days. But in May, after four members of his ruling party signed the deal, he refused -- saying he would not leave the country to sign the deal because he feared a coup, according to a senior official of his ruling General People's Congress party. According to Ahmer, Hadi can make significant changes in Yemen even though he holds the title of acting president. Ahmer spoke highly of Hadi, referring to him as ""our brother the vice president"" and calling him wise. He said ""all sides agree on him and all respect him"" to head the interim leadership that would oversee elections for a new government. ""In truth, he does not act with full authority as president of the Republic of Yemen, but in the future, he will practice his full authority,"" Ahmer said. However, officials loyal to Saleh insist that he has to oversee any transition for it to be legitimate. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Asked what steps are being taken to avoid further escalation of the conflict, Ahmer said the opposition wants the United States to play a role ""because they are guarantors in this initiative."" ""The people must help with these peaceful demands -- whether friends or neighbors -- to help Yemen pass to safe waters,"" Ahmer said.

"(CNN) -- To a friend of more than 20 years, Manssor Arbabsiar was a man who liked to be called ""Jack"" and didn't seem to have strong views on politics or religion. To U.S. authorities, the 56-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen is a suspect in an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. ""It was shocking because it didn't seem like he would be the type of person to do something like that,"" said Mitchel Hamauei, who said he met Arbabsiar through mutual Iranian friends. ""He was a happy go lucky guy, always joked around,"" Hamauei said. ""He had a really happy demeanor."" Hamauei, who runs a gyro and kebab restaurant in Corpus Christi, Texas, said the two were close enough that he attended the graduation of Arbabsiar's son. ""I know his wife and his son. They're very down-to-earth people,"" Hamauei said. The two kept in touch even after Arbabsiar moved to Austin about four or five years ago. ""I saw him about a year ago. He came by the store to eat a sandwich."" Arbabsiar was a used car salesman, Hamauei said. Their conversations would be about ""life in general,"" he said. ""Nothing religious. Nothing political."" ""He would go out and party,"" Hamauei said. ""As far as I know he never practiced religion."" Martha Guerrero, Arbabsiar's estranged wife, told the Austin, Texas, station KVUE Tuesday that they've ""been separated for a long time"" and she doesn't know anything about his affairs. However, she believes he is innocent. ""I may not be living with him, being separated, but I cannot for the life of me think that he would be capable of doing that,"" said Guerrero. ""He was at the wrong place at the wrong time, I'm sure of that, and I know that his innocence is going to come out."" She said she and her children ""are under a lot of stress right now"" and want the ordeal to end. She said they have nothing to do with the situation. David Tomscha, another friend of Arbabsiar's in Corpus Christi, told CNN Arbabsiar traveled to Iran once a year and owns property in Iran. Arbabsiar and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, are accused of a conspiracy to murder a foreign official, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism, the FBI said Tuesday. Arbabsiar was arrested in September. Shakuri remains at large, the bureau said. The two were in a group that began planning this spring to kill Saudi Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir, the FBI said. Arbabsiar has had prior brushes with the law, but for minor infractions. Public records show three arrests for Arbabsiar over the last 25 years. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail for evading arrest in 1987, and he pleaded ""no contest"" to a lesser charge in 2004 after he was arrested for driving on a suspended license. Arbabsiar also received a speeding ticket in 2007 for going more than 10 mph over the limit. A 2001 theft charge against Arbabsiar was dismissed, CNN affiliate KIII-TV reported. According to the allegations he now faces, Arbabsiar and an undercover informant discussed using explosives to kill the Saudi ambassador and possibly attacking a crowded restaurant, according to an FBI affidavit released Tuesday. The informant named $1.5 million as his price, it said. Arbabsiar allegedly sent $100,000 intended as a down payment, telling the informant his ""cousin"" had deep pockets, court documents said. ""This is out of character,"" Hamauei said. ""Whether he would actually carry it out? I don't believe so.""

"Charleston, South Carolina (CNN) -- A fish salesman. A restaurateur. A cigar aficionado. A retired cop. Four voters. Four candidates. No clear choice who to vote for. On the eve of the critical Southern Republican Presidential Debate in Charleston, CNN talked to several undecided voters in South Carolina. All said they were closely following the GOP campaign, yet all were frustrated about the field of candidates. Their indecision, however, makes them valuable targets, coveted by the campaigns in the final hours before the first Southern primary. In the latest CNN/ORC poll of South Carolina voters, while 57% said they had a clear favorite, 38% of those who initially expressed a preference for a candidate said they might change their minds, and another 8% said they were unsure or had no clear choice. Yet, even in the confusion and frustration, these voters do agree on three things. 1) They feel strongly that President Barack Obama has to go. 2) The flurry of TV ads by the candidates and super PACs has had little impact on their decision-making process -- in fact, many say the ads have turned them off. The debates, however, have mattered greatly, they say, providing genuine insight into the candidates. 3) They are truly flummoxed about who to vote for Saturday. Here is a snapshot of four voices of indecision, what their issues are and what it will take to win their vote: . ---------- . Jen Jones, 46, is the manager of a popular barbeque restaurant in Charleston -- Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q, which specializes in spare ribs, beef brisket, mac-n-cheese and Primary Bingo. She came up with the game, where each server has a sheet of paper with names of candidates, networks, politicians and menu items and are encouraged to strike up conversations with customers in order to get them to mention one of the names. Jones is a self-described ""political junkie"" and former Glenn Beck fan -- ""I don't know about him now ... "" -- who now identifies herself as a fiscal conservative. Her husband runs a local Cracker Barrel restaurant and is as undecided as she is. But as engaged in the political process as she is -- ""I've watched every debate and know all the candidates"" -- she is stumped when it comes to who she will vote for Saturday. She said she'll make up her mind after watching the debate Thursday night. ""It's really bothering me,"" she said while passing around muffins made from scratch. ""I have always known who I was going to vote for until now. I can't make up my mind."" Still, her analysis of the remaining GOP field is not pretty: . Mitt Romney: ""He's a Ken doll."" Ron Paul: ""Lunatic. Wacko. Crazy."" Newt Gingrich: ""He's smart, but man, is he mean."" Rick Santorum: ""I like him, but I really don't know a lot about him."" So, when pressured, who would she vote for? ""I guess, if I had to, it would probably be Gingrich. Newt is the smartest guy on the stage, but he is just so negative. He went on that temper tantrum after Iowa, with all those ads. I just didn't like that."" But moments later, she changes her mind: ""Santorum. Maybe Santorum. If he ends up winning that Iowa thing (the state GOP just certified the results of the caucus declaring him the winner), then maybe I will go for him."" ""But then there's Romney ... "" --------------- . Ron Manz, 51, is the owner of CharlestonSeafood.com, an online seafood delivery company. He's originally from Pittsburgh but moved to South Carolina a decade ago to start his own business. He was hit hard by the Gulf oil spill in 2010, which decimated the fishing industry for months. But as a staunch conservative, he still supports offshore drilling and opposes excessive government regulation. Manz has been disappointed by the nasty tone of the campaign in his adopted state this week, calling it ""too down and dirty, too negative."" And he can't stand the millions of dollars spent on ""useless"" campaign ads and super PAC commercials. ""I'm really tired of them,"" he said. ""But I'm tired of the Geico commercials, too."" In 2008, he supported John McCain. In 2012, he is leaning toward Romney. But he is still not sold. He also said he would probably make up his mind after Thursday night's debate. ""It would take a catastrophic error for me not to go with Mitt,"" he said hesitantly. ""If Mitt doesn't screw up -- say, he has a baby out there or something -- then I'm probably leaning his way. But that all could change after the debate."" His take on the lineup of candidates -- ""They've all got baggage."" Gingrich: ""He's just another old fat white guy."" Santorum: ""I think he wants to punch Newt in the face."" Paul: ""He's way out there. He frightens me."" A self-described tea party supporter, Manz now thinks the movement may have strayed too far since its historic victory in the 2010 midterms. Today, he doubts the tea party has much power in the current bid for the White House. ""Their best days are behind them. They've just gotten too extreme."" But he is clear and unwavering in his dislike for the current president. ""Are you kidding me? Four more years of the same old same old? It would be dreadful for the country."" -------------- . Joe Hightower, a retired Charleston County deputy sheriff now living in Goose Creek, counts himself among the firmly undecided. Sitting in a local cigar shop, nursing a half-smoked stogie, Hightower worries out loud about the uninspired field. ""I'm stuck,"" he said, exasperated. ""I'm not seeing a real clear choice here. It's either bad, real bad or worse."" His take on the GOP field isn't all that generous, either. Gingrich: ""He's smart. Sure. But I just don't trust him. He's an egotistical so-and-so."" Santorum: ""He simply doesn't have the experience. He's just not ready."" Paul: ""He's a little too extreme for me. Kind of wacko."" When asked if he had to make a decision today, he paused, saying reluctantly, ""Well, if I had a gun to my head, right now, I guess I'd have to go for Romney. But that's only with a gun to my head."" Hightower said he, too, has closely watched the series of debates, and they have been key in his decision process. ""You can see who they really are. Under pressure, those debates really bring out their true self."" But the TV ads that have saturated South Carolina airwaves? ""I don't pay any attention to them, none whatsoever."" The one thing, however, that Hightower is clear about is his disappointment in the job Obama has done, although he admits he supported him in 2008. ""I just want Obama out,"" he said bluntly. ""I voted for him last time around, but that won't happen again. No way."" ---------- . Kim Rittinghouse, 47, the owner of the Kingston Cigar Shop, has two sons in their early 20s. One is a marine biologist. The other is a Marine. ""I guess either way, if they do budget cuts, my boys will get cut, too."" Nevertheless, she said, she supports the conservatives' efforts to shrink the size of the federal government. ""It's just gotten out of control."" In 2008, she voted for Obama in the primaries but switched to support McCain in the general election. This year, first she hoped New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie would have run for the nomination -- ""I like him. He's bold but has a little finesse"" -- then she turned her support to Herman Cain -- ""Yeah, I was definitely on the Cain Train."" Now, she says, it's a tossup. ""You know, I might just listen to what Sarah Palin said. I am almost leaning toward Newt Gingrich, just so we can keep this thing going."" Her take on the GOP field? Romney: ""I like his business experience."" Santorum: ""He's a long shot."" Paul: ""I like his budget cutting, but he is kind of crazy."" Gingrich: ""He's definitely the smartest one out there, but he has a huge ego."" ""If you could just pull them all together, you'd have one great candidate!""","Days before the South Carolina primary, many voters don't know what to do .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai asked a Taliban-linked cleric based in Pakistan Saturday to help mediate talks with the Afghan Taliban, the cleric told CNN. Maulana Samiul Haq said he told Karzai he was prepared to help bring Taliban leaders to the table if the Afghan president and his government had specific offers and demands. ""What can I convey to the Taliban if their demands and offers for solutions are not clear?"" Haq said. ""Unless there's a concrete process in place, then things can't move forward."" Karzai has not yet commented on the cleric's remarks. Haq -- known as one of the spiritual leaders of the Taliban movement -- met with Karzai during the final day of the Afghan president's visit to Pakistan. The religious leader and former Pakistani senator runs an Islamic seminary in northwest Pakistan that produced many of the Afghan Taliban's leaders during the Afghan jihad against the Soviet occupation in the 1980s. Haq says he is in contact with senior leaders of the Taliban but he didn't say who. He said the Taliban have two key demands -- the exit of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and the release of Afghan Taliban prisoners from detention centers in Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Air Base. ""Thousands of people have been killed in Afghanistan. Why should the Taliban start a dialogue without a guarantee that foreign forces will leave the region?"" Haq said. Haq said the Taliban are reluctant to negotiate with Karzai because they view him as a supporter of U.S. policy in the region. ""He needs to change that impression,"" Haq said. Haq's comments come after the Taliban rejected a reported claim Thursday by Karzai that the movement was taking part in secret talks with the Afghan government. The statement followed a report in the Wall Street Journal in which Karzai said, ""There have been contacts between the U.S. government and the Taliban, there have been contacts between the Afghan government and the Taliban, and there have been some contacts that we have made, all of us together."" Karzai's assertion suggested a change in course for peace efforts, because the Taliban has long publicly refused to meet with Karzai's government, and Afghan officials have complained they were largely sidelined in talks taking place between the United States and the Taliban. ""The last cards are with us. So far, it has been a U.S.-Taliban business. We have not been involved in this so I cannot say what was discussed,"" an Afghan government official told CNN last month. Last June, Karzai said the United States was involved in peace talks with the Taliban, and that representatives of the government and insurgents had been in touch, but that no high-level meetings had taken place. Karzai arrived Thursday in Pakistan for discussions with President Asif Ali Zardari on improving relations between the two countries and peace efforts in Afghanistan. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Cleric Maulana Samiul Haq says Karzai asked him to mediate talks with the Afghan Taliban .

"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- Actor George Clooney and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo could be called as witnesses in the trial of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on charges of sex with an underage prostitute, the court announced Wednesday. Prosecutors allege Berlusconi paid for sex repeatedly with an underage prostitute and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was arrested for theft. Berlusconi resigned earlier this month over his country's debt crisis, bringing to an apparent end an 18-year era in which he dominated Italian politics. Prosecutors say Berlusconi had sex 13 times with underage dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the heart-stealer."" They allege the prime minister abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft. El Mahroug has said she never had sex with Berlusconi and that she lied to him about her age, telling him she was 24. Clooney and Ronaldo are being called because they attended parties at Berlusconi's house, the former prime minister's lawyer said. ""They will say what really happened at Berlusconi's house,"" Niccolo Ghedini said. The lawyer also complained about the number of hearings Berlusconi has to attend. He's facing separate trials on corruption charges in addition to the Ruby trial, and has been in court all week, Ghedini said. ""We have 40 hearings from now to May,"" Ghedini said.

"(CNN) -- Four gang members potentially face life in prison without parole after being convicted Friday of using violence and intimidation to extort ""rents"" from drug dealers and suppliers on their Los Angeles turf, a federal prosecutor's office said. This scheme ended up claiming the life of a 3-week old baby, who was shot in a stroller by gang members targeting a street vendor who refused to pay $50 to members of Columbia Lil' Cycos, a ""clique"" of the 18th Street gang, said the U.S. Attorney's Office for Central California in a press release. The street vendor, who was next to the stroller at the of the September 15, 2007 incident, was shot four times but survived. A total of 43 Columbia Lil' Cycos ""members and associates"" were charged in 2009 with being part of the broader scheme, in which an attorney Isaac Guillen laundered more than $1.3 million in drug and extortion funds that went toward that gang unit and Mexican Mafia member Francisco ""Puppet"" Martinez. Some 37 of those have been found guilty, after Friday's conviction of 35-year-old Eduardo Hernandez, 31-year-old Vladimir Iraheta; 31-year-old Leonidas Iraheta, and 35-year-old Javier Perez. A jury found these four guilty Friday ""of a host of federal offenses"" after an eight-week trial. They are set to be sentenced in September. ""The members of the 18th Street Gang, including those convicted today, thought that they controlled neighborhoods and territory within this city,"" U.S. Attorney AndrÃ© Birotte Jr. said. ""Today's verdicts prove otherwise, and law enforcement at every level will work together to continue to make our streets safe."" Prosecutors argued that Columbia Lil' Cycos pressured ""narcotics suppliers and street dealers"" to give them money -- typically, a cut of their sales -- in order to hawk drugs in an area adjoining MacArthur Park in the Westlake district of Los Angeles. Besides authorization to sell drugs, the ""rent"" money paid for ""protection from rivals."" And if they didn't pay, they'd be punished. According to evidence presented in court, Hernandez as well as Vladimir and Leonidas Iraheta made ""thousands of dollars a week extorting the street vendors,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said. After the baby's death, Columbia Lil' Cycos leaders ordered the shooter in that incident be kidnapped. He was sent to Mexico and was, in a remote area, the victim of a strangulation attempt. ""But unbeknownst to the would-be killers, the shooter survived the attack,"" the prosecutor's office said.","4 Columbia Lil' Cycos gang members are convicted in a federal court in California .

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Romania's deputy health minister, whose resignation last week triggered ongoing protests across the nation, was reappointed to his post on Tuesday after meeting with the prime minister. Raed Arafat said Tuesday he had withdrawn his resignation, adding that President Traian Basescu called him over the weekend to discuss the matter. Protests broke out last Thursday after Arafat, an opponent of health care changes proposed by the government, resigned. Arafat gained popularity after creating what many Romanians see as an efficient medical emergency system. Facing public pressure, Basescu decided to scrap the changes Friday, saying he made the decision after realizing that a majority of those in the medical system opposed the measure. Critics had argued that the proposal favored the private health care system by allowing it access to government funds while the state-funded system lacks financial aid. Arafat said Tuesday he withdrew his resignation because the changes were scrapped. He said he will now focus on creating a new health care bill that does not compromise the nation's health care system, especially the emergency system. Protests, however, continued on Monday, as thousands took to the streets nationwide to demonstrate against government austerity measures, calling for Basescu's resignation and early elections. However, officials said there was no violence on Monday. Protests took place under the supervision of thousands of police, and there were arrests for disturbing the peace and criminal acts, officials said. On Sunday, authorities used tear gas on demonstrators. The demonstrations are the most serious since Basescu's election in 2004. Banks, shops and bus stations in the capital have been vandalized, said Bucharest Mayor Sorin Oprescu. The protesters blocked traffic over the weekend, waving flags with the centers ripped out to symbolize the 1989 revolution. Others carried signs reading ""Liberty"" and ""Down with President Basescu."" A special parliamentary session is expected this week on the events. Opposition leaders said Monday a new series of protests is planned. The group disagrees with the government's response to the citizen demonstrations, said Crin Antonescu, liberal opposition leader. ""The National Liberal Party asks the prime minister and his cabinet to resign immediately because they couldn't manage the violent protests held over the last couple of days in Bucharest,"" Antonescu said Monday. Government officials have called on opposition leaders to meet with them in the next few days. The protests also follow several unpopular measures taken by the government over the past two years. After receiving a loan of 20 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union in 2009, the government cut salaries in the public sector by 25% a year later to enforce austerity measures recommended by the IMF. Prime Minister Emil Boc invited trade unions and employers to meet Tuesday on the labor code, but the labor unions refused to participate. After meeting with employers, Boc said the government is focused on creating new jobs for Romanians and providing financial support to those wishing to start businesses.","Raed Arafat withdraws his resignation after meeting, speaking with officials .

"(CNN) -- Identifying the moment when a political regime begins to decompose is as difficult as dating the onset of a recession. But in histories of the decline of the order built by Vladimir Putin in Russia, last Sunday's parliamentary election is bound to feature prominently. Despite a campaign marred by what international observers described as ""procedural violations,"" ""apparent manipulations,"" and ""serious indications of ballot-box stuffing,"" the governing United Russia party failed to prevent a sharp drop in its vote total. Official results gave it just short of 50%, down from 64 percent four years ago. Almost as striking was the surge in backing for three opposition parties that until recently had seemed on their last legs. The Communists won 20%, followed by the social democratic Just Russia party with 13 percent and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats with 12 percent. Russian protesters, opposition leader arrested . Putin's regime is unlikely to collapse anytime soon. In many countries, leaders would be delighted to control 53% of the legislature's seats -- the share United Russia will receive after parties that failed to reach the 7% threshold are eliminated. But the election makes it official: The downward slide has begun. All previous ballots saw United Russia increase its vote. The party held 70% of the seats in the last Duma, enough to change the constitution at will. Those days are gone. Speaking as results came in, a chastened President Dmitri Medvedev even uttered the dreaded word ""coalition."" Personally, Putin still enjoys the approval of 67% of Russians. But his ratings, too, have been slipping. His peak -- 87% approval -- came, oddly enough, in December 2007, the month of the last parliamentary ballot. His negatives are also rising, with one-third of Russians now disapproving of his performance and 53% faulting that of the government he leads. Some members of the disaffected third were evidently among the sports fans at a martial arts fight last month who booed and jeered after Putin stepped into the ring to congratulate the winner. For Putin, himself a judo black belt, it was an unprecedented humiliation. The souring mood has two main causes. First, the regime's popularity has always rested on the buoyant economy of the oil boom years. From 2000 to 2008, Russians' real disposable income rose by more than 10% a year on average. The global financial crisis put an end to that. Last year, massive government spending on pensions and public-sector wages boosted incomes by a little more than 4%. But so far this year, disposable income has fallen. Putin's appeal has also been eroded by the relentless accumulation of aggravations: bribe-grubbing traffic police, officials who cannot put out forest fires or prevent terrorist attacks, a deranged cop who shoots customers in a Moscow supermarket, and the violence of Chechnya, now spreading across the North Caucasus. These and dozens of similar irritations are heightened by the tin-eared self-congratulation of official pronouncements. Putin's victory in next March's presidential election remains all but assured. But the last two times he ran, in 2000 and 2004, three months before the vote his ratings were respectively 79 and 81%, far above their current level. This may be the hardest fight he has faced. Whatever else they reveal, Sunday's results undercut the image, common in the West, of Putin's regime as an effective authoritarian state. In fact, it is a regime that cannot even steal an election decisively. A massive effort, involving shameless pressures on voters and manipulation of the rules, apparently only managed to improve United Russia's total by a few percentage points. Two exit polls put the party's vote at 46% and 49%. The respected Levada Center, no stooge of the Kremlin, forecast a result of 51%, which was higher than the officially announced total. Rather than a classic authoritarian government, Putin's is a peculiar hybrid that has combined genuine popularity with counterproductive attempts to over-manage and eliminate all potential threats. Continually centralizing power, the Kremlin has progressively lost control. Barring a return to rapid growth, it is not clear how Putin and Medvedev can reverse the slide. They will hear conflicting arguments. Some will urge them to reach out to the middle class with a new package of liberal reforms. Yet, unless they suddenly become willing to genuinely share power, this probably will not buy them much support. Four years of Medvedev's tweets about modernization and rule of law have inoculated the elites against empty Kremlin promises. At the same time, the elections hardly revealed a hunger for liberal economics or even Western-style democracy. The Yabloko party, made up of unimpeachable democrats and civic activists, won just 3% of the votes. Another option is to woo the masses with additional bursts of populist spending, at least until the presidential vote is over. Yet with the budget already swelled by anti-crisis measures, such a strategy is dangerous. The long-serving finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, was fired last September after publicly criticizing Medvedev's plans to increase military expenditures. A third possibility is for Putin to trade in his soft authoritarianism for a tougher, more effective model. Yet, even if he wanted to do this, it is doubtful that he has the kind of skilled and ruthless apparatus that could make it work. It is hard to think of extremely repressive regimes that have succeeded in societies as economically developed, highly educated, and rich in communications technology as Russia's is today. Paradoxical as it might sound, authoritarianism in relatively modern countries relies on a significant degree of consent. That leaves the most likely outcome a continuing downward slide, perhaps temporarily slowed by improved economic performance or accelerated by striking government failures and scandals. The turbulence is just beginning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Treisman.","Daniel Treisman: Russian elections may mark beginning of Putin's regime decline .

"Moscow (CNN) -- A plot to assassinate Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has been foiled, Russia's state-run Channel One TV reported Monday, less than a week before presidential elections that Putin is expected to win. Citing unnamed sources, the report said a group of plotters was arrested in the Ukrainian city of Odessa in early January and, after weeks of questioning, confessed to planning to kill the Russian leader. The TV report included what it said was a confession by Adam Osmayev, a fixer associated with the two men who were seized in Odessa. ""Our final goal was to come to Moscow and try to organize an attempt on Prime Minister Putin,"" Osmayev said. He said the plan involved using military-grade land mines to blow up vehicles. Channel One showed video of what it said was the raid on Osmayev's apartment by armed security officers wearing black bulletproof vests and helmets. The video shows Osmayev, with red marks on his back and bloody bruises on his face, kneeling as officers demand his name. Ukraine's domestic security agency, the SBU, uncovered the plot after an explosion at an apartment building in Odessa killed one of the plotters and injured another, Channel One said. The survivor tipped them off to Osmayev's involvement, the report said. The plotter who was killed was allegedly willing to be a suicide bomber, and the mission was organized by Chechen militant leader Doku Umarov, Channel One reported. CNN has not independently confirmed the existence of the plot, and a former British ambassador to Moscow expressed doubts about it. ""There was a similar alleged plot against him the election before last,"" Andrew Wood said. ""That's pretty much (all) you need to know. It's suspiciously convenient."" Putin has dominated Russian politics for more than a decade, and his opponents accuse him of rigging parliamentary elections late last year. International observers also said that the election was not free and fair, and protests of a size not seen in Russia in two decades followed the vote. Wood said the protests may have encouraged the Kremlin to say there was a plot against Putin's life to build support for him. ""They've been taken aback by the degree of opposition,"" said Wood, who is now a Russia expert at Chatham House, a think tank in London. ""Even if he wins this election, which one must assume that he will, it won't necessarily mean that he has strong and durable support,"" he said. Wood did not say outright that he did not believe there was really a plot to kill the prime minister. ""It's conceivable, but it seems improbable. Anything could be true. I can't say it's not true,"" he said. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Itar-Tass that he confirmed the TV report but would not comment on it. The Russian FSB declined to answer CNN questions about the alleged plot. The announcement comes a week ahead of this Sunday's presidential election. Putin handed over the presidency to ally Dmitry Medvedev in 2008, when he was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. After spending four years as prime minister, he announced in December that he would seek the presidency again. Human rights groups say civil liberties and democratic freedoms have suffered during his rule. But opponents took to the streets by the thousands after his United Russia party won a narrow majority in December parliamentary elections, which monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said were ""slanted in favor of the ruling party."" The leading opposition candidate in the March 3 vote is Communist Gennady Zyuganov. Russia's third-richest man, billionaire New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky are also running. Critics of Putin's showed up in the thousands on Sunday in a show of strength ahead of the election. They attempted to complete a circuit of Moscow's 15-kilometer (9.3-mile) ""Garden Ring"" road but fell short. The RIA Novosti news agency quoted police as saying 11,000 people turned out Sunday, far below the estimated 34,000 needed to complete the human chain. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","A former UK envoy to Moscow says the report is conceivable but improbable .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- Climbing up the spiral stairs and through a stone tower to our room, we notice a passageway. ""Where do you suppose it goes?"" asks my wife, Sandra, as she signals me to follow her. Stop for coffee and cake at the 11th-century Hornberg Castle hotel-restaurant in Neckarzimmern. We emerge atop a medieval parapet. On our left is the steeply banked Rhine Valley and the vineyards that line the winding Rhine River; to our right is a medieval inner courtyard with a multilevel patchwork of Romanesque arches, half-timbered chambers and tumbledown stonework. I'd first stumbled upon the Schönburg Castle Hotel while traveling through Germany's Middle Rhine Valley four years earlier. The 13th-century fortress had struck me as one of the most hauntingly romantic places in Europe. And so here we are on our honeymoon, the first leg of a two-week journey through the Rhine Valley: south along the Burgenstrasse (""Castle Road""), to the Romantische Strasse (appropriately, ""Romantic Road""), then north toward the vibrant city of Weimar. Oberwesel to Heidelberg: 90 miles . From the Frankfurt Airport, we drive an hour northwest to the town of Oberwesel, contending with jet lag and a torrential downpour. As the Schönburg Castle Hotel comes into view, however, the unforgiving weather subsides and we forget our desperate need for sleep. Travel + Leisure: Guide to Germany's Rhineland . Darkened by storm clouds, the crumbling fortress commands the valley with a sphinxlike gravitas. Its stones have survived countless histories: throughout the Middle Ages wealthy nobles lived here, accumulating monies from river traffic tolls; during the 17th-century Palatinate Heritage War, the French Army set the castle on fire; it was abandoned for more than two centuries until, in the late 1800's, an American of German descent purchased the property and sold it to another family, who turned it into a hotel in the 1950's. Our wood-paneled room, an octagonal chamber at the top of the highest tower in the hotel, resembles an officer's quarters on a sailing ship: the bed is built into a windowed alcove, high off the floor, so we have to climb a semicircular stepladder to reach it. A doorway leads to a tiny stone balcony overlooking the valley. I can't help thinking of Rapunzel locked away in her belfry. With the castle as our base, we explore the Middle Rhine, stopping at small villages along the valley floor and amid the forests on the plateau above the river. At the Historische Weinwirtschaft (""Historical Wine Inn""), a stone-walled restaurant with a wood-beamed ceiling, dogs and children run around freely, popping up every so often at our table, which had been made from an old wooden bed. The place strikes me as the very essence of Heimat, the peculiarly German nostalgia for connection with home and homeland. The notion is reflected in the food we eat -- the ingredients of our sauerbraten have been raised a literal stone's throw away -- and the welcoming, laid-back staff are locals. The road heading south of Oberwesel takes us to the university town of Heidelberg, with its stone-arched bridges spanning the Neckar River and the grand, 12th-century Heidelberg Castle perched above the town on a high promontory. Sandra and I trek up a narrow cobblestoned alley, past gabled stone houses with ancient doorways, and through a lush green park until we reach the castle. What was once a thick-walled tower now stands torn in half, the remnants of centuries of warfare. But as old ruins always do, the broken masonry now radiates calm in the cool autumn sunlight. Heidelberg to Rothenburg ob der Tauber: 100 miles . East of Heidelberg, the Castle Road follows the course of the Neckar, along which castles emerge from the crests of hills like capped mushrooms. We excitedly count each one, like kids on a road trip spotting license plates. At the town of Neckarzimmern, in the Tauber Valley, we pull a hard left to Hornberg Castle, an 11th-century keep, where we stop for coffee and cake on the castle's terrace, with a view of the red-roofed village below. The walled city of Rothenburg ob der Tauber is one of the few towns in the Tauber Valley that has remained virtually untouched since the 17th century. And for the next couple of days, we stay on its main street in a storied old pile called the Hotel Eisenhut. Travel + Leisure: The world's best hotels . Once among the most prosperous towns in Germany, Rothenburg suffered an outbreak of the plague in the early 1600s and was sacked soon after in the Thirty Years' War. The town never recovered, and as a consequence, little was built; the city is a medieval time capsule of half-timbered houses and arched gateways that pass through the bases of stone towers. Despite being a picture-perfect town full of tourists, Rothenburg, truth be told, is not the most exciting place. It is, however, known for the Restaurant Mittermeier. In the busy basement enoteca, decidedly less pricey and formal than the fine-dining room upstairs, dark walnut tables are full of hip young locals; it's like being back in the 21st century. The owner, 42-year-old Christian Mittermeier, is a voluble, bearlike man who apprenticed as a butcher as a teenager, before managing a small hotel just outside of town. After a glass of red wine and some goat ragoût, we ask his advice on the best vineyard in the region to visit. ""Mine!"" he says. ""Meet me at nine tomorrow morning and I'll take you myself."" Rothenburg ob der Tauber to Weimar: 165 miles . True to his word, Mittermeier shows up the next morning, and together we drive north through pastureland and orchards brimming with apples and pears -- it's no wonder the Germans call this the Romantische Strasse. Up the side of a steep ridge sits Mittermeier's winery, Tauberzell, where we try the Riesling grapes and take in the valley below. Travel + Leisure: 10 unexpected U.S. wine trails . ""There is the Tauber River, which means fish; the mill, which means grain and bread; the fields with sheep, which means meat and wool; and beyond, the village,"" he says. ""From this one spot, I can see everything that is important to me, and no factory in sight. It must have been like this 500 years ago."" On the way back, Mittermeier insists we stop at Mainbernheim village, where his cousin owns a hotel-restaurant called Gasthof Zum Falken. It's a Thursday, one of the two days each week when his cousin, Lars Zwick, makes fresh bratwurst from pork butchered in town. Zwick serves each of us a pair of perfectly grilled sausages over sauerkraut, with a glass of local Riesling, before we head out. After dropping Mittermeier back in Rothenburg, we drive north on the Romantische Strasse toward Weimar, a town of an altogether different provenance. If Rothenburg is a time machine to the Middle Ages, then Weimar is a portal to the Enlightenment; J. S. Bach and Franz Liszt both lived in the city center during some of their most productive years. As we cruise down the tree-lined streets, the country's genteel past comes to life, with stately slate-roofed houses rising from walled-in yards. The Bauhaus movement was founded here in 1919. Judging by its modern interiors, you would never suspect that our hotel, the 313-year-old Hotel Elephant, was once the preferred meeting spot for intellectuals like Goethe. For dinner, we head to the nearby Anno 1900, a Beaux-Arts-style pavilion jutting out from the side of the historic Hotel Anna Amalia. Franz Kafka lived in the hotel building in 1912, as did his longtime friend Max Brod. Outside, the weather has turned cool and crisp. I pull Sandra close and together we set off, our footfalls echoing off the cobblestones. Planning a beach getaway? Don't miss Travel + Leisure's guide to Affordable Beach Resorts.

"(CNN) -- The NCAA says it has contacted the FBI after point-shaving allegations were lodged against Auburn University's men's basketball program. ""We are very concerned by the point-shaving allegations involving Auburn University men's basketball program and have been in contact with the school and the FBI since the issue arose in February,"" the NCAA said this week in a statement. ""The NCAA takes any allegation of point shaving very seriously because sports wagering threatens two of our core principles -- the well-being of student-athletes and the very integrity of intercollegiate sport.""

Because of the nature of the allegation, Auburn is not in a position to make any further comment on the situation,"" said Cassie Arner, a university spokeswoman. The FBI said it could not comment on the issue. Point-shaving schemes usually involve a player taking payments from a gambler to ensure a team does not cover a published point spread.

"(CNN) -- International pressure is mounting on Israel and the Palestinians to halt violence in Gaza, with the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and other countries all calling for an immediate restoration of calm. Protesters knock down barriers near the Israeli Embassy during a demonstration in central London. Angry protests also took place in several cities around the world on Sunday against Israel after its air strikes in Gaza killed at least 270 people and wounded hundreds more. In London, hundreds of demonstrators battled riot police in an attempt to enter the Israeli Embassy, according to media reports. But neither side indicated they were ready to heed the calls for calm. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the operation in Gaza ""is liable to continue for some time, perhaps more than can be foreseen at the present time."" Hamas, too, showed no signs of backing down, saying Israel had violated an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire intended to stem violence in the region. ""We will stand up, we will defend our own people, we will defend our land and we will not give up,"" senior spokesman Osama Hamdan said. For a second day, black plumes of smoke rose above Gaza City as makeshift ambulances screamed down rubble-strewn streets, taking wounded Palestinians to hospitals already crowded with hundreds of patients wounded this weekend. More than 110 Hamas rockets have been launched into Israel by Hamas militants since Saturday morning, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman said. An Israeli man died when a rocket slammed into a home Saturday, IDF said. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Zalmay Khalilzad, supported Israel's contention that it was up to Hamas to stop the violence. ""Israel has the right to self defense and nothing in this press statement should be read as anything but that,"" Khalilzad said. The United States has warned Israel, however, to avoid civilian casualties. Israeli leaders maintain they are attempting to do so. White House Spokesman Gordon Johndroe ""Hamas' continued rocket attacks into Israel must cease if the violence is to stop. Hamas must end its terrorist activities if it wishes to play a role in the future of the Palestinian people. The United States urges Israel to avoid civilian casualties as it targets Hamas in Gaza."" Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gabriela Shalev, responded that her country was only defending itself from Hamas rocket attacks. ""The last days were so bad that we had to say, and did say, 'Enough is enough,' "" Shalev said. ""The only party to blame is the Hamas."" Saeb Erakat, adviser to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, urged Israeli and Hamas leaders to enact another cease-fire. ""I believe this is the only way out. I don't think this problem can be solved through military means. Violence will breed more violence,"" he said Saturday. The power base for Abbas' Fatah party is in the West Bank. The party is locked in a power struggle with Hamas, which won parliamentary elections in January 2006 and wrested Gaza from Fatah in violent clashes last year. Abbas, a U.S. ally, wields little influence in Gaza. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's office issued a statement saying he was deeply alarmed by the violence and bloodshed in Gaza and in southern Israel. ""While recognizing Israel's security concerns regarding the continued firing of rockets from Gaza, he firmly reiterates Israel's obligation to uphold international humanitarian and human rights law and condemns excessive use of force leading to the killing and injuring of civilians. He condemns the ongoing rocket attacks by Palestinian militants and is deeply distressed that repeated calls on Hamas for these attacks to end have gone unheeded,"" a spokesman said. The U.N. Security Council ended a four-hour emergency meeting Sunday with a call for an immediate halt to hostilities and a re-opening of border crossings to allow humanitarian supplies to reach Gaza. The Palestinians' U.N. envoy said if Israel does not halt attacks within 48 hours, Arab delegations will demand stronger action from the Security Council. UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband called on Sunday for an urgent ceasefire and immediate halt to all violence. ""The deteriorating humanitarian situation is deeply disturbing. Prime Minister (Gordon Brown) has spoken to Prime Minister Olmert of Israel. As we made clear yesterday, Israel must abide by its humanitarian obligations. ""The UK supports the prompt and sufficient delivery of food, fuel and medicine into the Gaza Strip. I have discussed this unfolding crisis with my counterparts in the region and beyond. iReport.com: Are you there? ""I have discussed with Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit his plans to convene a meeting of Arab League Foreign Ministers. This is an important opportunity for Arab leaders to make clear that the interests of the Palestinian people can only be secured through a viable Palestinian state existing alongside a secure Israel. We must renew our collective effort to achieve this goal in 2009."" Russia also urged both sides to refrain from violence. ""Moscow believes it is necessary to immediately stop a large-scale military operation against Gaza Strip, which has already led to numerous casualties and sufferings of peaceful Palestinians,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said. ""At the same time, we are urging the leadership of Hamas to stop missile strikes upon Israeli territory. We are sure that what needs to be done without delay now is stop military confrontation, restore a cease-fire, and rid peaceful civilians on both sides of terror and pain."" Jordan's King Abdullah II by contrast urged ""Israeli aggression"" that targets ""innocent civilians including women and children"" to end. ""The establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the Palestinian national soil is a prerequisite to achieve security and stability,"" he said, adding that Israel will not get security and peace unless it ends what he called its ""occupation."" Iran's supreme leader has declared Monday a ""day of mourning"" for Palestinians in Gaza, blaming the violence on ""the bloodthirsty nature of the Zionists."" The state-run news agency IRNA said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was urging all Muslim nations, as well as ""freedom seekers,"" intellectuals and media ""to fulfill their heavy duty in confronting the crimes of the 'Zionist vampires.'"" Iran has long openly supported Hamas, supplying it with weapons and training. Like Hamas, Iran's government does not recognize the existence of Israel. Hamas, the party in control of Gaza, is considered a terrorist organization by the United States. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted by IRNA as saying Saturday night, ""Zionists are at the end of the road both in theory and practice in all economic, political, military and cultural terms."" Some Iranian students and members of parliament held a demonstration in front of a United Nations building in Tehran, accusing U.N. member nations of being silent in the face of ""crimes"" against Palestinians. Some demonstrators also condemned Egypt, which has tried to broker agreements between rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, as well as between Palestinian leadership and Israel. The European Union called for an immediate halt to violence. A statement issued by current EU president France said the bloc ""condemns the disproportionate use of force"" from both sides. The statement urged the ""reopening of all checkpoints and the immediate resumption of fuel and humanitarian aid deliveries."" The statement said ""there is no military solution in Gaza"" and urged a lasting truce. France's President Nicolas Sarkozy, in a separate statement, expressed ""great concern"" about the escalating violence by Israelis and Palestinians. In London, Palestinian families and supporters protested outside the Israeli Embassy and chanted in unison: ""Five, six, seven, eight -- Israel is a terror state,"" according to the Press Association. Similar demonstrations were held in Paris, Istanbul and other cities. Crush barriers were torn down and riot police were brought in to control the crowd of more than 500 people, PA reported. The crowds waved Palestinian flags and held placards, some of which read ""holocaust in Gaza"" and ""no peace, no justice."" One protester was Gamal Hamed, from Hammersmith, in west London, whose 23-year-old son lives in Gaza. The 68-year-old said: ""Yesterday was the bloodiest day in my homeland's history. We will do what we can to make the world take notice."" CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","International pressure grows on Israel and Palestinians to end violence in Gaza .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou announced Wednesday that a government reshuffle will take place Thursday, after which he will seek a vote of confidence in parliament. The planned reshuffle represents an attempt to win support for additional austerity measures intended to help the economy weather the current crisis, measures that sparked debate Wednesday in parliament as demonstrators protested outside. Papandreou faces strong opposition from his own party over the measures, with one member of parliament defecting and another saying that he would vote for them. After Papandreou's announcement of the reshuffle in a brief televised statement, the main opposition called for an early election. The Greek parliament has opened debate on the austerity measures, seen by some economists as essential to Greece's meeting the terms of its international creditors. Papandreou said the formation of a unity government requires agreement from all opposition parties on the cuts and privatizations agreed to in an international bailout Greece undertook slightly more than a year ago. Papandreou's reshuffle comes amid mounting opposition and the defection of one of his party's parliament members over the austerity program. The main opposition party, New Democracy, has repeatedly demanded that Papandreou quit and that a cross-party coalition renegotiate the terms of the bailout package. The government's popularity has plunged recently, and anti-government protests turned violent Wednesday, as demonstrators threw gasoline bombs at the Ministry of Finance and police fired tear gas at protesters, police said. Tens of thousands of protesters had vowed to form a human shield around the parliament to prevent lawmakers from debating new austerity measures Wednesday afternoon. ""This is a joke. It is all a joke,"" protester Christos Miliadakis, 35, said of the government plans. ""When will we be able to get out of this vicious circle? My wife lost her job. I had a 12% pay cut as a result of the first bailout. The new measures want to cut another 20% of jobs in the public sector,"" he said. ""So if no one has money and we are just more in debt, who is going to drive the economy? We will live like slaves paying all our lives."" Architecture student Maria Iliadi, 23, said that, for people like her, ""the future in this country has been erased. There will be no big public projects, and no one will be building for a long time. Sometimes, finishing my degree seems totally pointless."" About 25,000 demonstrators were on the streets of the capital by the middle of the day, police said. Two police officers and four civilians were slightly injured, and 12 people were arrested, they said. Labor unions were holding a 24-hour strike to protest the measures and planned to march to Parliament to join forces with the protesters. The strike has brought public services to a grinding halt and kept most transport networks at a standstill, although flights have not been affected. Rallies also were scheduled to take place in other Greek cities. On June 9, the Cabinet approved a tough five-year plan for 2011-15 and introduced a bill in Parliament to put the measures into effect. The government has said that the passage of these additional measures is essential to Greece's securing the fifth portion of a 110 billion euro ($158 billion) bailout package that Greece signed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts. Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou has said the country hopes to secure a second bailout deal this month. The search for a second bailout comes after it became evident that Greece is extremely unlikely to raise capital from private markets in 2012 due to the prohibitively high interest rates it would face. Papaconstantinou has also indicated that European Union members may support calls to get the private sector involved. Despite the harsh austerity measures that the Greek government has imposed, it is failing to close its budget deficit as quickly as many had hoped. The country is in recession amid its fiscal restructuring program. The finance minister has defended the five-year austerity plan, saying it is needed to keep Greece solvent. The new measures will include a number of additional taxes and an additional 20% cut in public-sector jobs. Protesters have been gathering outside Parliament for more than three weeks as part of an ongoing peaceful demonstration against austerity measures, with some camping in the square facing Parliament. They call themselves ""The Indignants,"" a grass-roots movement that takes its name from the Spanish campaign of ""Los Indignados,"" who have been holding similar mobilizations against austerity across Spain. The Indignants issued a statement saying it would keep going until the politicians and technocrats it blames for what is happening in Greece ""go away."" The credit rating agency Standard & Poor's on Monday cut Greece's rating to just two notches above default, among the lowest in the world. The agency has said a default on some debt appears ""increasingly likely."" Unemployment in Greece skyrocketed to more than 16% in May, a 40% rise since last year. The European Commission has said Greece's economy was expected to shrink by 3.5% this year. Papandreou has pledged to continue with the changes no matter the political cost. He has said that the alternative, a default, ""would be a catastrophe."" The five-year austerity plan is expected to face a vote in Parliament in before the end of the month.","Prime Minister George Papandreou will seek a vote of confidence Thursday .

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Romania's prime minister resigned Monday in the wake of weeks of public protests against austerity measures and a deadly spell of bitterly cold weather. The resignation makes Romania the sixth European country to see a prime minister fall amid the debt crisis sweeping European Union member states. Besides budgetary issues, criticism has also mounted over the government's handling of a recent, and continuing, cold snap -- including snow-clogged streets, widespread power outages and other problems that contributed to the deaths of at least 34 people. Announcing his resignation on television, Prime Minister Emil Boc said he is not the kind of person to hang on to power, and that it is time to make space for another government. He admitted making mistakes, but said he is sure Romania has a bright future. ""We made this decision in order to alleviate the social and political situation in the country, (and) to not lose what Romanians have won with so much suffering -- the country's economic stability,"" said Boc, who had been prime minister since 2008. Later Monday, President Traian Basescu appointed Mihai Razvan Ungureanu as his pick to be the nation's next permanent prime minister. The 43-year-old Ungureanu was Romania's foreign minister from 2004 to 2007, and since then he has been the head of the east European nation's foreign intelligence service. ""I call for a new government to step in immediately,"" Basescu said in remarks broadcast on Romanian television. ""Tomorrow, the new prime minister will negotiate with the ruling coalition to form a new government."" According to Romania's constitution, Ungureanu is now the country's new prime minister by virtue of having been appointed by Basescu. But he must get the approval of parliament in order to officially form a new government, including lining up a slate of ministers. Ungureanu accepted the appointment, saying his political independence should help him fulfill his mandate. ""The government needs strong parliamentary support and the citizens' support as well,"" he said. Parliament is expected to approve a new government in the next 60 days. If it does not, parliament would be dissolved and early elections would be held. Currently, Romania is expected to have a local election in the spring and parliamentary elections in the fall. Opposition politicians, who have boycotted parliamentary sessions since February 1, have called for new elections for a totally fresh start in Romania -- and not a more incremental step of a new prime minister appointed by President Basescu, and with it a new government. After Monday's announcements, liberal leader Crin Antonescu signaled that he and other opposition leaders do not plan to back Ungureanu or any new government that might form under him. ""We believe this is an improvised solution by Basescu to keep the current coalition in power, although most Romanians don't agree with this,"" said Antonescu. The opposition met Monday evening with the president to discuss the political situation. Some echoed a sentiment voiced by protesters in recent weeks demanding that, in addition to Boc and his government, that Basescu himself resign. Antonescu said, ""President Basescu's resignation is the only way we could end this political crisis, but he told us that he won't step down."" Some Romanians blame the government for imposing harsh austerity measures after the country received â‚¬20 billion from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Demonstrators have carried banners reading, ""What are we going to eat, Basescu?"" and ""Down with the government."" Protests turned violent on January 15, when some of the thousands of people gathered in central Bucharest clashed with police. Stores were vandalized and dozens were wounded. The austerity measures, tensions between protesters and authorities, and political turnover are not unique to Romania. In Europe, there have been months of unrest in Greece, while Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal have also seen changes of government as their leaders try to cut spending in order to stabilize the common, multi-national currency, the euro.","NEW: A former foreign minister is appointed as Romania's prime minister .

"(CNN) -- The man who collected the urine sample that led to Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun's now-overturned drug suspension says he did not tamper with the sample, as Braun has implied. ""I followed the same procedure in collecting Mr. Braun's sample as I did in the hundreds of other samples,"" Dino Laurenzi Jr. said in a statement released Tuesday. ""At no point did I tamper in any way with the samples. This situation has caused great emotional distress for me and my family."" Laurenzi's statement comes after Braun publicly blasted Major League Baseball's drug testing system and an arbitration board tossed out a 50-game suspension imposed as the result of the drug test Braun took last year. Braun, the 2011 National League MVP, told reporters that nearly two days passed between when a collector took his sample and when it was delivered to a FedEx office. ""What could have possibly happened to it during that 44-hour period? There were a lot of things that we learned about the collector, about the collection process, about the way that the entire thing worked that made us very concerned and very suspicious about what could have actually happened,"" Braun said during a news conference last week. Laurenzi said he collected urine samples from Braun along with two other players on October 1, a Saturday, and the samples were sealed, placed in a sealed bag and then placed into a sealed cardboard box. He finished the collection at 5 p.m. and took the samples home because there was ""no FedEx office located within 50 miles of Miller Park that would ship packages that day or Sunday."" Laurenzi said the testing policy requires collectors to take samples to their homes until FedEx can immediately send the sample to the laboratory. He said the sample was stored in his basement office in areas sufficiently cool enough to store urine. He then shipped the sample on Monday, October 3. ""It is my understanding that the samples were received at the laboratory with all tamper resistant seals intact,"" Laurenzi said. The arbitrator's decision last week to overturn Braun's suspension marked the first successful appeal of a suspension under Major League Baseball's anti-drug policy. Braun, 28, led the Brewers to the team's first division title in three decades in 2011, with a .332 batting average, 33 home runs and 111 runs batted in. He was slapped with the suspension in December after the drug test, which the sports network ESPN, citing unidentified sources, said showed high levels of testosterone. Braun said at the time there were ""highly unusual circumstances"" that would show his innocence. The arbitration panel apparently agreed, voting 2-1 to overturn the suspension, according to the MLB Players Association. Major League Baseball's executive vice president for labor relations, Rob Manfred, roundly rejected Braun's accusations, though he said some changes may be made in the testing process. ""Major League Baseball runs the highest quality drug testing program of any professional sports organization in the world. ... Our program is not 'fatally flawed.' Changes will be made promptly to clarify the instructions provided to collectors regarding when samples should be delivered to FedEx based on the arbitrator's decision,"" he wrote in a statement released last week. CNN's Alan Silverleib David Close and Kara Devlin contributed to this report .","""At no point did I tamper in any way with the samples,"" the collector says .

"(CNN) -- The last time Wales won a Six Nations rugby international at England's home stronghold, the team went on to claim the 2008 title and complete a grand slam of victories against all competing countries. Four years on, Warren Gatland's men are looking odds-on to repeat that success after snatching a 19-12 victory at Twickenham on Saturday for a third successive win in this year's tournament. Substitute Scott Williams' moment of late individual brilliance helped Wales come from 12-6 down, and a desperate try-saving tackle in the corner by fellow center Jonathan Davies condemned defending champions England to a first defeat under interim coach Stuart Lancaster. The Welsh were the best of the British nations at last year's World Cup, reaching the semifinals before a heartbreaking defeat against eventual runners-up France in which captain Sam Warburton was sent off. England, however, had a disappointing time on and off the pitch, losing to France in the quarterfinals before an investigation into a series of incidents involving the players ended with 2003 World Cup winner Martin Johnson standing down as coach and ructions in the boardroom. Lancaster made a positive start with his new-look team, grinding out wins against Scotland and Italy, and four penalties from young new fly-half Owen Farrell gave the coach hope of another victory. However, Wales fought back from the second-half sin-binning of Farrell's opposing No. 10 Rhys Priestland and drew level with fullback Leigh Halfpenny's fourth successful kick. Then Williams stole the show in the 76th minute as he ripped the ball away from England replacement Courtney Lawes, kicked downfield and gathered the ball for the game's only try, which Halfpenny converted. England roared back down the other end and threatened to score, but after spinning the ball out wide to the right, winger David Strettle was held up over the line -- forcing a decision from the video referee, which went in Wales' favor. ""We knew it would be the toughest game and it was so tough. We are over the moon to get the Triple Crown here,"" Warburton said after his team followed up victories over Scotland and Ireland. ""I am not going to say what the last team who won here in 2008 went on to do but people involved with that team say we have a really strong squad this time around. However, we will set aside thoughts of that and the Italy game in a fortnight and enjoy this for the moment."" Earlier on Saturday, Ireland ended a run of three home defeats by beating Italy 42-10 in Dublin for the 2009 champions' first win this season. Winger Tommy Bowe scored two of his side's five tries, while Jonathon Sexton kicked 17 points as the visitors lost for the third successive time. France -- the only other unbeaten team so far, albeit after having played only one game -- will visit winless Scotland on Sunday. Les Bleus' postponed match against Ireland will take place next weekend while the other nations rest.","Wales beat England 19-12 for third successive victory in the Six Nations Championship .

"(CNN) -- Turkey's peripatetic Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu spent last Thursday in Tehran in negotiations with leading Iranian officials. Davutoglu's visit comes at a very critical juncture in U.S.-Iran relations, as saber-rattling dangerously escalates over the United States' ever-more stringent sanctions and Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz. Davutoglu's visit also comes as Shia-Sunni tensions in Iraq rise in the wake of the American withdrawal. These tensions threaten the very survival of Iraq as a united country and have the potential to adversely affect Iran-Turkey relations -- in light of Iran's strong support of the Shia in Iraq and Turkey's sympathy for the Sunni cause. Iran and Turkey's divergent stances on Syria as well as Turkey's decision to host a NATO anti-missile radar facility close to the Iranian border have added even more to the strain. Reports suggest that much of the talks between Davutoglu and his Iranian counterparts were devoted to ironing out some of these bilateral differences. A major objective of the Davutoglu visit, however, was to kick-start negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 over Iran's nuclear enrichment program. The group comprises the permanent five members of the U.N. Security Council: France, the UK, China, Russia and the United States, plus Germany. Major Western powers believe the enrichment program is part of Iran's clandestine ambition to acquire nuclear weapons capability. Negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 have dragged on for years, with Iran insisting on its right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to enrich uranium for civilian purposes and the Western powers demanding that it suspend its enrichment program to allay fears that it is covertly engaged in building nuclear weapons. The most recent International Atomic Energy Agency report, issued on November 8, 2011, brought the dispute to a boiling point by stating for the first time that it had documentation that led it to believe nuclear weapons work had been done under a ""structured program"" up to 2003, and that ""some may still be ongoing."" While this information was not new, the report provided the United States and its European allies the excuse to impose even more stringent sanctions on Iran. The proposed sanctions could seriously damage prospects for Iran's energy exports by targeting the Central Bank of Iran and preventing it from carrying on financial transactions abroad. They are thus aimed at hitting Iran where it really hurts, although the prospect of Iran's oil exports being forced off the market also threatens to drastically increase the price of crude internationally. Iran's ruling elite perceives sanctions that target Iran's export of crude as existential threats. Iran has, therefore, threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth to a quarter of the world's oil passes, if sanctions are imposed on its export of crude. Iran's capacity to block the strait for any length of time might be debatable, but it is clear that threats and counter-threats have reached a point where a shooting war cannot be ruled out completely. This is the last thing Turkey wants to see, caught as it is between its NATO membership and its dependence on energy supplies from Iran. Ankara is fully aware that the cost of a war with Iran would far exceed that of the American invasion and occupation of Iraq. Turkey realizes that Iran is no Iraq, and that Tehran can inflict major damage on American interests and those of its allies, including Turkey, in the Middle East. In this context, it becomes clear that it was Davutoglu's primary mission in Tehran to persuade the Iranians to resume negotiations with P5+1. He delivered a note from the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, inviting Iran to resume such talks, and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi apparently responded positively. It is worth noting that Iran's chief negotiator on nuclear issues, Saeed Jalili, announced a few days ago that Iran was willing to resume negotiations with P5+1 on the nuclear enrichment issue. Salehi suggested in his news conference with Davutoglu that Turkey would be the ideal venue for these negotiations, a suggestion that is likely to be accepted by Ashton. Istanbul was the venue for the last round of negotiations a year ago and it appears logical that the parties reconvene there. It is likely these negotiations will be re-started, and with Turkey facilitating and providing a venue for them, Turkey could be primarily instrumental in preventing a catastrophe in the Middle East. It could even help ease Western sanctions against Iran, especially the most recent threatening financial transactions with Iran's Central Bank, which could hurt Turkey's ability to pay for its energy supply purchases from Iran. It would also help put Iran-Turkey relations, recently mired in disputes surrounding Syria and NATO's radar facilities in Turkey, on a more even keel and help defuse tensions between these two most important political actors in the Middle East.

"(CNN) -- The European Union has launched a fact-finding mission to determine the causes of the August war between Georgia and Russia, an EU spokeswoman said Tuesday. Heidi Tagliavini, a Swiss dipomat, will head the investigation into what started the Georgian conflict. The eight-month inquiry will examine the facts of the conflict in regard to international law, humanitarian issues and human rights, said the spokeswoman, who did not give her name because she was not allowed to speak publicly. Investigators will also assess the basis for all accusations made regarding the conflict, the spokeswoman said. Heidi Tagliavini, a Swiss diplomat and former United Nations special representative for Georgia, will head the mission, the spokeswoman said. The mission began its work Monday and was due to finish July 31, 2009, ending with a report to the EU, the U.N. and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the spokeswoman said. Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist territory, on August 7. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. The two sides blamed each other for starting the conflict and have made accusations of ethnic cleansing. Moscow has since recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent regions.","European Union launches mission to determine causes of Georgian conflict .

"(CNN) -- The Nigerian Islamic militant group Boko Haram says it bombed U.N. offices in Abuja last week because the world body is a partner ""in the oppression of believers,"" a spokesman for the group said Wednesday. Friday's car bombing killed 23 people and wounded more than 80. Boko Haram, which aims to impose a strict version of Islamic law in Nigeria, claimed responsibility for the attack. In a brief telephone interview arranged by an intermediary, Boko Haram spokesman Abul Qaqa said a 27-year-old Nigerian named Mohammed Abul Barra drove the explosives-packed Honda Accord into the U.N. building. ""All over the world, the U.N. is a global partner in the oppression of believers,"" Qaqa said. ""We are at war against infidels. In Nigeria, the federal government tries to perpetuate the agenda of the United Nations."" U.N. agencies operating in Nigeria include the World Health Organization, the U.N. Development Program, the children's organization UNICEF, the Office on Drugs and Crime, the Joint Program on HIV and AIDS and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. The building hit by the attack housed 26 U.N. humanitarian and development agencies, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week. Nigerian authorities said Wednesday that the bombing was plotted by a man with ties to the al Qaeda terrorist network. The Nigerian State Security Service said Mamman Nur was a ""notorious Boko Haram element"" who recently returned from Somalia, where the Somali militant Al-Shabaab has been linked to al Qaeda. Though a Nigerian engineer was among the dead, Qaqa said the group did not intend to kill the man. He added, however, ""We have told everyone that the U.N. is the bastion of the global oppression of Muslims all over the world."" ""As such, we have warned everyone to steer clear of such places,"" he said. ""They should steer clear of such places that we have mentioned in the past. The battle has changed."" Africa's most populous nation is divided between a largely Christian south and a Muslim north. ""Boko Haram"" -- which translates loosely as ""Western education is forbidden/sinful"" -- holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a state in northern Nigeria under Islamic law.","Boko Haram calls U.N.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force has grounded its entire F-22 Raptor fleet amidst continuing concern over how the fighter jet provides oxygen to the pilot, according Capt. Jennifer Faerrau, a spokesperson for the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The stand-down order was made Tuesday but is just now becoming public. It's unclear how long the stand down will last. There are about 165 Raptors in the fleet. Since January, the aircraft already had been kept at altitudes under 25,000 feet during an ongoing investigation into a November crash. Flying above that altitude could cause a pilot to black out from lack of oxygen and lose control. The stand-down affects all routine training and other missions, Faerrau said. The Air Force is looking at all the systems on this new-generation fighter jet, but one area of focus is the On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS), according to Ferrau. The order came from Gen. William Fraser, commander of Air Combat Command, which is based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.","The stand-down order was made Tuesday but is just now becoming public .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Chanting ""they don't represent us,"" tens of thousands in Madrid railed early Sunday against Spain's government and austerity cuts -- venting their anger on the first anniversary of the so-called May 15 protest movement. The government earlier had given a 10 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Saturday deadline for the crowd in the central Puerta del Sol plaza to disperse. Yet while their numbers appeared to thin somewhat by early Sunday, they remained a loud and vibrant presence in the square -- as a large number of police, stationed at a nearby government building and along side streets, looked on and let them be. Throngs of like-minded demonstrators also gathered over the weekend in Barcelona and about 80 other cities around Spain. The coordinated events marked the return of the ""indignados"" -- or the outraged, as the protesters became known -- who led Europe's first serious and significant anti-cuts and anti-austerity grassroots movement. Similar demonstrations decrying governments' attempts to get their budgets in order, sometimes by slashing public funding, later emerged elsewhere around Europe. In Madrid this weekend, marchers from the north, south, east and west descended on Puerta del Sol plaza on Saturday evening. For hours, demonstrators shouted, jumped, sang and waved white handkerchiefs. Their most dramatic moment, though, may have been their quietest: when they held their hands aloft, silently, in a ""silent shout"" before erupting in cheers. If and when the crowd dissipates early Sunday, they are expected to return. The government has OK'd three more days of protests in Madrid, meaning similar scenes could play out into the middle of the week. The number of demonstrators evident in Madrid over the weekend were strong, though they appeared to be slightly fewer than those who had gathered in the same spot -- in what's known as ground zero of the movement -- a year earlier. Back then, protesters encamped in Madrid and other cities made their voices heard. The tens of thousands of people who turned out in the initial days grew to an estimated 6 million protesters over the following months, in a nation of 46 million people. Since then, Occupy camps around the world have come and gone. The new protests organized by the May 15 movement are different in at least one key respect: a new conservative government is now in control, having taken over in December. Spain's economic crisis also has worsened since last year. The nation has slipped back into a recession, the unemployment rate has risen to 24% overall and more than 50% for those under age 25, and the government has enacted billions of dollars in austerity cuts, along with some tax hikes, to reduce the budget deficit. ""We are really tired of this situation,"" said Madrid protester Paola Alvarado, a purchasing agent. ""And the new government is the same. They steal our money and give it to the banks."" Spain's austerity protests have been largely peaceful to date, with only occasional clashes between protesters and police, and some arrests in cities like Barcelona and Valencia. And prior the latest protests, the new government -- which has vowed to maintain order and prevent a repetition of encampments in Madrid and beyond -- urged police commanders to use ""common sense"" as to how they dealt with the latest round of public dissent. In recent months, Spanish trade unions, traditionally the protest leaders, have been at the forefront of demonstrations against the austerity cuts and labor market reforms, with the May 15 movement barely visible. ""Maybe the most important thing is it awakened a consciousness, beyond concrete changes, to make historic change possible,"" said Jon Aguirre Such, who was a movement spokesman a year ago but now spends more time on his architectural cooperative for urban planning. ""I think everyone who took part in the May 15 movement made history. They can take away from us many things, but not our memory and our dream,"" Aguirre said. The original May 15 movement is credited with helping stop dozens of housing evictions. Activists pressured bank and court officials to delay or stop foreclosures on delinquent mortgages. But Ignacio Urquiza, a sociologist who has studied the movement for the left-leaning Fundacion Alternativas, said there has been little big-picture change as to government policies and operations. ""The demonstrations didn't do more than expose -- for a brief time -- some issues. But Spain's economic crisis and political system have not changed. They are the same as last year,"" he said.","NEW: Thousands in Madrid's Puerta del Sol plaza do a ""silent shout"" to protest cuts .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- A European Commission spokeswoman hinted Monday at the possibility of sanctions against Ivory Coast if the country is unable to resolve its disputed presidential election. Catherine Ashton, vice president of the commission and the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, would consider sanctions ""if there isn't a swift resolution to the crisis,"" commission spokeswoman Angela Filote said. Filote declined further comment on the threat of sanctions, which comes two days after rival presidential candidates each claimed office and a day after former South African President Thabo Mbeki arrived on an emergency mission to try to help resolve the sitaution. Despite ongoing protests, the situation has remained largely calm in Ivory Coast following the disputed election in which incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and challenger Alassane Ouattara both claimed victory. But the political chaos has heightened fears that the Ivory Coast -- known as Cote d'Ivoire in French -- would once again plunge into the unrest and bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002. A United Nations spokesman, Farhan Haq, said Monday that in light of the country's security situation, the U.N. will temporarily relocate about 460 non-essential staff members to Gambia. And Amnesty International called on the country's security forces to protect civilians, claiming that at least 20 people have been killed in the aftermath of the election. There was no official confirmation of Amnesty's claim. Gbagbo has defied international appeals to step aside and was sworn in Saturday as the new president in a formal ceremony inside the presidential palace. The ceremony was broadcast live on television. Less than a hour-and-a-half later Ouattara told reporters that he, too, had taken the oath of office and asked Prime Minister Guillaume Soro to form a new government. Mbeki, sent by the African Union, met with Gbagbo and the U.N. special envoy to the country in Abidjan before meeting with Ouattara, according to Mbeki's spokesman, Mukoni Ratshitanga. Mbeki met with Gbagbo at the presidential residence and with Ouattara at an Abdijan hotel he is using as a headquarters. He was also to meet with the electoral commissions and the nation's Constitutional Council. Mbeki told reporters he was sent by the African Union to hear out all the parties and make recommendations. He said he would issue a statement later. Ouattara told reporters he was ""honored to receive Mbeki as the president of Ivory Coast."" Meanwhile, a Soro spokesman said the prime minister presented the new government that Ouattara told him to form. But Gbagbo announced that he had designated his own prime minister in nationally televised address Sunday night. He named Gilbert Marie Ngbo Ake, an economist and former president of the University of Abidjan, who hails from a region of the country that has long supported Gbagbo. On Sunday, the army announced on national television that the country's borders and airspace would be open on Monday morning. The border had been closed last week amid rising tensions following one commission's announcement of Ouattara as the winner. International broadcasting agencies were shut down at the same time. The Constitutional Council declared Gbagbo the winner Friday, invalidating earlier results from the Independent Electoral Commission which handed Ouattara the victory with 54.1% of the vote. The Constitutional Council said Gbagbo had won the election with 51.45% of the vote to Ouattara's 48.55%. It tossed out votes it said were marred by fraud in northern regions that were considered Ouattara strongholds. It was the job of Y.J. Choi, the special envoy in the Ivory Coast of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, to review and sign off on the results. Choi said that, even if Gbagbo's complaints were taken into consideration, Ouattara was the winner. ""Having evaluated all the tally sheets, 20,000 of them yesterday evening, we are in a position to know what happened really,"" Choi said in a telephone interview from Abidjan. ""With absolute certainty, we know that Ouattara won the election."" With his credibility in question, Gbagbo defied calls from international leaders to respect the will of Ivorian voters by taking the oath of office in front of a room full of supporters and military commanders. ""These past days I have noticed serious cases of interference,"" Gbagbo said. ""The sovereignty of Cote d'Ivoire is not negotiable. My responsibility is to defend it."" The dispute has drawn international criticism and concern, with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and U.S. President Barack Obama among world leaders urging a swift resolution that respects voters' wishes. On Monday, Ban said he remained ""deeply concerned"" about the situation and has been consulting with many world leaders on the crisis. On Sunday, the World Bank and the African Development Bank issued a joint statement warning that the dispute could hurt economic stability in Ivory Coast and the region. Earlier, Sarkozy appealed for calm and urged military and civilian officials to respect the will of the people. Obama warned Gbagbo:  ""The international community will hold those who act to thwart the democratic process and the will of the electorate accountable for their actions."" Ouattara, a former economist for the International Monetary Fund who served as prime minister, had been banned from previous races. Gbagbo's critics said the incumbent stoked tensions by accusing Ouattara of masterminding the civil war. Ouattara has denied the allegation. Once a prosperous nation and a driving force in West Africa, the Ivory Coast spiraled downward into instability after fighting erupted between the government-held south and discontented Muslim rebels living in the north. Thousands of people died in the conflict. Ouattara enjoys popular support in the rebel-held north and now, with both candidates claiming they are president, the potential exists for more bloodshed. The streets of Abidjan have already seen violent clashes in the past few days. Journalists Francois Xavier Menage and Eric Agnero contributed to this report.","NEW: United Nations to relocate non-essential personel to Gambia as tensions rise .

"(CNN) -- Tourists visiting an Egyptian resort have been warned to be alert after a series of shark attacks that have left one woman dead and several people seriously injured. The German woman died Sunday after being attacked by a shark in waters off Sharm el-Sheikh, prompting Egypt's tourism ministry to close the beach until the animal responsible is found. Thousands of tourists flock to Sharm el-Sheikh each year, attracted by its warm climate and clear waters, but the UK Foreign Office on Monday amended its travel advice for people visiting the area. A statement on its website read: ""Attacks by oceanic white tip sharks are extremely rare and shark attacks of any kind are very unusual in the Red Sea. ""If you are considering diving or snorkelling in any of the Red Sea resorts be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably. ""A basic rule is never to dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make any bookings through your tour representative. ""Unusually cheap operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards."" Tour operators Thomson and First Choice also warned holiday-makers about the shark attacks. ""We are treating the situation very seriously and are advising all of our customers not to swim in the sea at Sharm el-Sheikh,"" a statement said. ""We have also cancelled all water-based excursions until further notice."" After the attacks authorities ordered people to stay out of the water around Sharm el-Sheikh. On Thursday, the Environment Ministry said two sharks suspected of the maulings were caught. Jochen Van Lysebettens, general operations manager of the Red Sea Diving College in Sharm el-Sheikh, said employees at the Hyatt Regency resort told him the attack happened about noon (5 a.m. ET) in a protected swim area off the resort. Van Lysebettens has three dive-instruction operations in the area, including one at the Hyatt Regency. The 70-year-old woman, a regular guest at the resort, was snorkeling near a reef when she was attacked, he said. She called for help, and a lifeguard brought her to shore, but she had lost too much blood and resuscitation efforts failed, Van Lysebettens said. The woman's arm and leg were severed, he said. A British tourist described witnessing one of the shark attacks. Ellen Barnes, 31, of Horsham, West Sussex, told The Sun newspaper: ""The water was churning like I was in a washing machine. I was being thrown around in the blood."" After the Sunday incident, the Chamber of Diving and Watersports called on its members in the region ""to stop any snorkeling activities happening from any boats or shore."" The chamber is under the umbrella of the Egyptian Tourist Federation. Van Lysebettens said all tourists were ordered to stay out of the water at least through Monday. The dive community is organizing volunteer expeditions to find the shark, he said, and about 40 people will search Monday. On Friday, two sharks were caught and killed near the South Sinai National Park on the Sharm el-Sheikh coast, according to the Chamber of Diving and Watersports. The chamber said that as of Friday, the condition of three injured snorkelers -- two Russian women and a man from the Ukraine -- were unchanged. One of them was critical, the chamber said in a statement, but did not say which one. The three were attacked in a 24-hour period November 30 and December 1, the chamber said. Van Lysebettens said he is not a marine biologist, but many have speculated an oceanic white-tipped shark was responsible for the German woman's death, as well as the other attacks. Divers are upset because the two sharks killed Friday are thought to be innocent. They were a mako shark and another oceanic white-tipped shark -- which did not match pictures taken by someone accompanying one of the injured snorkelers, he said. Officials at the national park did not provide details on ""why the animals could not be relocated to remote waters as was previously suggested,"" the chamber's statement said, adding it ""does not wish to see any harm to any further sharks."" Exploratory dives were taking place on Friday, Van Lysebettens said. Officials are not sure what triggered the feeding behavior, described as highly unusual. ""This incident has clearly shocked our community, and the CDWS is continuing its investigation into why this may have happened,"" Hesham Gabr, head of the Chamber of Diving and Watersports, said in the statement. ""It is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioral experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic white tip shark was triggered by an activity, most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area."" Several divers in the area saw carcasses of dead sheep in the water last week, Van Lysebettens said. It's not known how they got there, he said, but they could have washed out to sea or fallen off a boat. The shark may have been attracted by the carcass, he said, and could now be attacking slow-moving things on the water's surface. CNN's Brian Walker and Karen Smith contributed to this report.","Tourists visiting Egyptian resort warned to be alert after shark attacks .

"(Financial Times) -- Foreign auditing firms will have to appoint a Chinese national as their chief partner in China as part of a sweeping overhaul of the country's accounting industry. The regulations, unveiled on Thursday, are aimed at localising the mainland operations of foreign auditing firms, but they also provide for a lengthy transition period and wiggle room to limit controversy over the changes. Chinese auditing standards have come under fire over the past year after a number of fraud allegations against Chinese companies listed in overseas markets. The restructuring of the China operations of foreign auditing firms, including the ""Big Four"", threatened to fuel concerns by forcing them to replace all of their foreign partners with Chinese partners. Beijing has tried to allay such fears, however, by giving foreign groups time to adjust. Up to 40 per cent of their partners in China will be allowed to continue operating without Chinese qualifications this year, the finance ministry said. That cap will then be reduced to 20 per cent by the end of 2017. ""They have made huge concessions here to try to have a smooth transition,"" said Paul Gillis, a professor of accounting at Peking University. The Chinese joint venture agreements of the four biggest accounting firms -- Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC -- start to expire this year and Beijing could have imposed the rule changes as soon as they come up for renewal. ""The normal situation in the world is that accounting firms must be owned by locally qualified accountants. That is the case in most countries in the world. China is actually being more open to non-qualified foreigners participating in their practices,"" Mr Gillis said. Nevertheless, the restructuring will pose a challenge for foreign firms. Given how young the auditing industry is in China, they have few local employees who are ready to be senior partners. The restructuring announcement comes a few days after US officials said that China was considering a compromise on another contentious issue: joint US-China audit inspections. After the rash of accounting scandals at Chinese firms, the US government had asked Beijing to open its doors to the US body that oversees the auditors of publicly listed companies. James Doty, chairman of the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, said last week that China might agree to allow it to observe the audits of Chinese companies listed in the US. In a reminder of the concerns surrounding the Chinese industry, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it was investigating a client of the Chinese arm of Deloitte on suspicion of accounting fraud. The SEC also filed an administrative action against Deloitte for failing to provide audit documents related to the company -- something which Chinese regulators have barred it from doing. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Foreign auditing firms will have to appoint a Chinese national as their chief partner in China .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A California judge sentenced a retired Los Angeles Police detective Friday to 27 years to life in prison for murdering her ex-boyfriend's wife in a jealous rage more than two decades ago. Stephanie Ilene Lazarus, 52, was convicted of biting and shooting Sherri Rasmussen, 29, in her townhouse in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1986. Lazarus, who rose through ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department and became a veteran art theft detective, could be eligible for parole in 22 years. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry gave Lazarus credit for time served in jail since her arrest at LAPD headquarters in June 2009. A jury convicted her in March of first-degree murder. Friday's sentence was the maximum under state law, prosecutors said. Lazarus was charged with staging the crime scene to look like a burglary gone bad, and police long believed that Rasmussen was the victim of two male burglars. The 1986 case went cold for years. Then it was reopened in 2004 and again in 2009, when DNA from a bite mark on the victim's arm came back as a match to the detective. When Lazarus became a suspect, homicide detectives faced ""special challenges as Lazarus' office was located next door to the detectives who were now investigating her,"" police said in a statement in March. Rasmussen, a hospital nursing supervisor, was the new bride of John Ruetten, who had been Lazarus' college sweetheart. Married for just three months, Ruetten found his wife's body when he returned home from work. Rasmussen was brutally beaten and shot three times in the chest, authorities said. Los Angeles County deputy prosecutors Shannon Presby and Paul Nunez submitted a written statement to the court prior to the sentencing, according to the prosecutor's office. ""Lazarus has never taken responsibility for her acts,"" the prosecutors wrote. ""Lazarus has never expressed any regret or remorse for her actions. Lazarus' profound narcissism led her to kill and continues to motivate her denial of responsibility. This unrepentant selfishness poses a real and significant danger to any person whose interests conflict with Lazarus' egotistic desires."" Before the sentencing Friday, Rasmussen' mother, Loretta, told the court that her family has endured ""extreme pain"" over her daughter's murder. ""Every day we miss her laughter and her love,"" the mother told the judge. In his remarks to the judge, a tearful Ruetten said Rasmussen was ""just trying to save her own life"" on the day of her murder. ""I just can't bear thinking about these moments,"" Ruetten told the court. After the sentencing, Lazarus, manacled and dressed in a jail jumpsuit, waved and smiled to an apparent loved one in the courtroom gallery as she was escorted back to jail, carrying a folder. Following Lazarus' conviction in March, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the case was ""a tragedy on every level."" ""Not only did the family of Sherri Rasmussen lose a wife and a daughter, a life that can never be returned, but also the LAPD family felt a sense of betrayal to have an officer commit such a terrible crime,"" Beck said in a written statement. ""I am also sorry it took us so long to solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy,"" he said. Rasmussen, director of nursing at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, was a tall, athletic 29-year-old with a pretty smile. At the time of the slaying, Lazarus was in her second year with the Los Angeles Police Department. The killing occurred on February 24, 1986, a Monday. Lazarus had taken the day off; Rasmussen had called in sick that morning. Authorities estimate she died before lunchtime. Prosecutors argued that Lazarus was in love with Ruetten and distraught when she learned he married someone else. During the trial, Ruetten testified he casually dated Lazarus after college, but he never considered her a girlfriend and dated other women while seeing her. Lazarus eventually married a Los Angeles Police detective and the couple adopted a daughter. According to prosecutors, the key to unlocking Lazarus' dark secret lay for years on the back shelf of an evidence freezer in the coroner's office. In a vial inside a sealed evidence envelope was a cotton swab. On that swab, prosecutors say, was DNA taken from saliva from the bite wound on Rasmussen's left forearm. Testing in 2005 revealed the assailant was a woman. Some detectives, however, clung to the burglary theory and focused their inquiries on known female prowlers. But from the beginning, the victim's family had pointed to an ex-girlfriend of Ruetten's who was a cop, and as the DNA testing advanced, undercover police followed Lazarus to a Costco store and retrieved a discarded soda from a trash can. Saliva traces from the straw matched the bite mark DNA, and she officially became a suspect. Lazarus was confronted, and another sample was taken from her shortly before her arrest. Tests revealed the DNA found in the bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm belonged to Lazarus. Deputy Assistant District Attorney Presby told jurors during the trial that the chance of the killer being anyone else is ""one in 1.7 sextillion."" To avoid botching an undercover investigation of one of their own, LAPD officials carefully devised a plan to arrest Lazarus. On June 5, 2009, Detective Daniel Jaramillo from the department's robbery-homicide division approached Lazarus at her desk in the department's headquarters and asked her to accompany him downstairs to the department's jail facility, where she would not be able to bring her gun. He told Lazarus he needed her help interrogating a man who claimed to have information on stolen art, Lazarus' specialty in the detectives unit. A nearly hour-long recorded interview followed. After one of the detectives alludes to the evidence that implicated her in the killing, Lazarus said, ""Am I on 'Candid Camera' or something? This is insane. This is absolutely crazy. This is insane."" Minutes later she walked out of the interview room, only to be stopped, handcuffed and told she was under arrest in the murder of Sherri Rae Rasmussen. Lazarus's attorney, John Overland, has argued in court that the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and couldn't be trusted.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Negotiations to end a mass hunger strike by up to 2,000 Palestinians detained by Israel are making progress and a resolution may be only days away, Palestinian officials said Saturday. The talks over the detainee demands involve Palestinians, Israeli officials and Egyptian mediators. ""We have been informed by the Egyptian mediators that there is a very close deal to be reached in the coming hours or maybe by tomorrow,"" said Khaled al-Batsh, an Islamic Jihad leader and spokesman. Between 1,600 and 2,000 Palestinians are protesting prison conditions and administrative detention, a controversial Israeli military practice that allows authorities to detain people indefinitely. Hassan Abed Rabo, a spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Detainees and ex-Detainees, told CNN he was aware of progress in the negotiations, but did not know the details. The head of the Palestinian Prisoner Association Club, Qadoura Fares, said a deal had not been reached, but pressure to resolve the standoff included American and European officials. A senior Israeli official on Saturday would say only that talks to end the impasse were ongoing. Israel's high court on Monday rejected an appeal requesting the release of two Palestinian prisoners who have been on a hunger strike for nearly two and a half months, an attorney representing them said. Judges ruled that the two men, Bilal Diab and Tha'er Halahlah, remained a security risk to Israel, and that their hunger strike was not a reason to release them from administrative detention, according to lawyer Jamil al-Khatib. ""If any harm happens to the prisoners especially to Tha'er Halahlah and Bilal DIab and Jafar Ezzidein and all the other prisoners, Israel should be responsible and bare the consequences and consider that the truce is no longer binding,"" said al-Batsh. The Israeli military's detention process also allows for detention based on secret evidence, and there is no requirement to charge the detainees or to allow them to stand trial. Diab and Halahlah, members of the Gaza-based militant group Islamic Jihad, are both in custody under administrative detention. Diab has been in custody for nine months, while Halahlah has been in custody for 22 months. On Sunday, Al-Khatib said his clients were nearing death and accused the Israeli high court of procrastinating in delivering a ruling. ""I believe what the court is doing here is trying to break the will of both prisoners so they will back down in their hunger strike,"" he said. An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor, told CNN that both men ""were arrested for their direct involvement in promoting terror"" and suggested that administrative detention constituted ""the only available means to thwart the danger"" the men posed to Israel. Amany Daify, a project coordinator for Physicians for Human Rights, an Israeli group advocating on behalf of the hunger striking prisoners, said both prisoners ""are in a life-threatening condition"" and continued to refuse to be given minerals or liquids. More than 4,500 Palestinian prisoners are in Israeli prisons for a variety of offenses, ranging from rock-throwing to murder. Of these, about 300 are being held in administrative detention, according to rights groups. The vast majority of prisoners refusing to eat began their protest April 17, while a handful have been without food for longer. While hunger strikes are not a new tactic of Palestinian resistance, a series of recent high-profile cases has brought increased attention to the practice and served as a rallying cry for Palestinians, who have staged multiple protests in the West Bank and Gaza in support of prisoners. Besides the administrative detention policy, the Palestinian detainees' principal demands are an end to solitary confinement, arbitrary night raids and what they term indecent searches of prisoners. They also want access to educational material, improved food and access to television. They also want family members living in Gaza to be permitted to visit. A committee representing prisoners must approve any proposed agreement in order for the hunger strike to end. CNN's Kevin Flower and Guy Azriel contributed to this report.","At least 1,650 Palestinian detainees are on a hunger strike .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It wasn't so long ago that biofuels were being heralded as the savior of the planet and a thoroughly green solution to our climate woes. But fair winds have been replaced by persistent storms of criticism. But is it justified? Principal Voices has spoken to three people -- an economist, a scientist and an environmental campaigner -- at the heart of the biofuels debate. Here, they have their say on biofuels. Have yours at bottom of the page. The British countryside is transformed in the spring by swathes of rapeseed. The Economist . Keith Wiebe is the service chief in the Economic and Social Development Department at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). He is currently working on the FAO Annual Report into the state of food and agriculture which this year is focusing on biofuels. The report will be published in September 2008. Biofuels are obviously playing a role in the current food situation. It is a new source of demand that has risen dramatically over the past couple of years. This has been a significant factor in the increase in commodities prices recently. What's unique about the past year or two and particularly the past few months is the convergence of a whole number of factors on both the supply side and the demand side. The background is that you've had the gradually increasing income and demand for more, and different types of food in emerging economies. You've had a gradual decline in international stocks of food, you've got higher oil prices which means the costs of production are going up. There have been some been some production setbacks in a couple of key export countries such as Australia and also a rapid increase in demand for maize and vegetable oils for biodiesel and ethanol production. All these factors interact and lead to policy responses from countries to limit exports of commodities to protect their domestic consumers. It's impossible to disentangle a specific portion or to attribute a particular portion to the price increases. One thing to keep in mind is that biofuels play a role in the current high prices but they are certainly not the only factor. The other thing is that they have adverse short term impact on food prices. They have an adverse impact on poor consumers particularly in developing countries. But there is an opportunity over the longer term at least for small farmers who do have access to resources to adjust their production patterns. And high prices give them an incentive to do exactly that. Small farmers in developing countries see these price incentives and they see they would like to respond. But through a combination of export bans in some countries and poor infrastructure, they are limited in their ability to respond. I think it is important to distinguish between different types of biofuels. They have very different characteristics. Brazilian sugar cane is the classic example of a type of biofuel that is now performing efficiently and competitively. They are alone among all the major biofuel foodstocks in being competitive at market prices. Whereas in the U.S., maize continues to cost more to produce it than it does to be competitive with the fossil fuel counterpart. There is a lot of potential in second generation cellulosic technologies but they are not yet commercially viable but that point is coming closer every day. There is so much effort which has gone into this recently and if there is a silver lining to the whole situation it is that people are looking everywhere for alternatives. Two years ago the general perspective on biofuels was that they were a very bright prospect and to say anything negative about them was somehow a suspect analysis. This situation has been completely reversed. What we would like to continue to emphasize is that there are many different types of biofuels, some are more promising than others. Certainly there are things that need to be reevaluated and looked at very carefully. There is also the potential if policies can be improved and investment can be made in agriculture. Many of the world's poor depend on agriculture for their livelihood. We don't want to throw out an opportunity for them. The Scientist . Dr Richard Pike is the chief executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Prior to taking up the role in 2006 he spent 20 years working in the oil industry. He recently calculated that a one-way transatlantic flight would require one year's biofuels yield from an area the size of 30 football pitches. Biofuels will clearly have an application at a local level. I think there is a general view that at a very local level -- and I'm talking of small townships that are surrounded by land that could cultivate biofuels -- that it is probably sustainable. Whether it can be applied on a large scale in a sustainable way will vary tremendously from country to country. But one has to be very careful about projecting into the future. For instance in the UK there is a lot of talk about biofuels, but one of the big issues is the very low efficiency in converting sunlight into the oil or ethanol that you would use to fill up your tank. Typically the efficiency is considerably less than half a percent. That raises the whole issue of land use. If, on the one hand, you've got biofuels which represent only a half a percent conversion of sunlight, and let's say you've got photovoltaic cells and concentrated solar power systems, the efficiency of solar in terms of pure conversion is 50-100 times greater. In the UK, for every one percent of diesel and petrol you want to replace with biofuel you need, in big round numbers, about one percent of the land area of the UK. That's a very stunning statistic. And it means that if you're looking at notions of self-sufficiency then it's completely out of the window. If the UK wanted to be more biofuel orientated it would have to import it. Currently the European Union directive is to have 5.75 percent biofuels by 2010. If the UK was to provide that for itself, five percent of the land would have to be utilized -- which is an extraordinary number. Typically biofuel yields are of the order of three to four tons per hectare. That excludes things like the carbon footprint of fertilizers, harvesting and distribution. The figures you see in the press tend to be focused on the yield from the ground rather than thinking of the bigger picture. There is a real need to look at the big picture and there's a risk that the focus on biofuels and the idea that it could offer quite a significant contribution is distracting from some of the more important things that need to be looked at. There are lots of small initiatives, either at the user end -- e.g. turning off stand-by switches, drinking tap water -- or the supply end -- e.g. wind energy, tidal energy. What people are forgetting is that if you look at the energy balance of the world, 80 percent of the world's energy is supplied by fossil fuels. That is likely to remain unchanged for a long time. Fossil fuels are not going to run out that quickly. Reserves figures that you see quoted are very conservative. The other thing about biofuels is what I call the problem of unintended consequences. Biofuels are clearly going down a route that is bringing it into conflict with food crops and biodiversity. People have talked about a much more efficient biofuel process involving algae. Algae would have significantly high yields. But then again, I don't think enough people have gone through what might happen if that were pursued. You have to ask how it would affect marine life. The Environmental Campaigner . Deepak Rughani is co-director of Biofuelwatch, a campaign group backing the expanding call for a moratorium on agrofuels* in the European Union. Biofuelwatch is currently engaged in a new challenge; to help prevent the first biofuel-fired power station to be built in the UK. If energy company Blue-ng is successful a precedent will have been set and according to UK newspaper, The Independent another 43 power stations could follow. On June 4th, Newham Councilors in east London will meet to make their recommendation on the proposed plant. Coincidently the meeting marks the second day of the UN's High-Level Conference on World Food Security, Climate Change and Bioenergy in Rome. More than 770 organizations and prominent individuals worldwide have signed a Civil Society statement on the World Food Emergency which calls for a halt to all development of land for agrofuels for cars, planes and for energy production in power stations. So far, only Germany has invested heavily in vegetable oil CHP plants -- 1,800 of them. The vast majority burn palm oil because European vegetable oil is too expensive. According to experts, the impact on the climate has been disastrous. Peat expert Professor Siegert of Munich University has warned: ""We were able to prove that the making of these plantations and the burning of the rainforests and peat areas emits many thousands of times as much CO2 as we then are able to prevent by using palm oil. And that is a disastrous balance for the climate."" Unfortunately, switching to rapeseed oil, even if it was affordable, would not necessarily help matters: As confirmed by a UN report, Europe's use of rapeseed oil for bioenergy is one of the main reasons for rising palm oil prices linked to shortages in the food and cosmetics markets. Inevitably rising prices make deforestation and peat drainage in South East Asia much more profitable. There are other serious concerns about the east London proposal: Vegetable oil burning leads to emissions of NOx and particulates -- PM 10 and PM 2.5 -- known to have an adverse effect on the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Areas close to the proposed site are currently being monitored as Air Quality Management areas and many residents are very concerned about the plans. It seems that in the name of decentralized energy generation -- which is likely to be much more efficient than centralized energy generation -- government and companies are willing to both disregard the welfare of local people and at the very time when we need to be dramatically reducing our demand for vegetable oil, offer a new market for agrofuels. By backing false-solutions we stall investment from the true renewable energies such as wind, solar, wave and geothermal and ignore our responsibility to prevent crossing key climate tipping points, beyond which our current civilization and even much of life on earth could not sustain itself. * Agrofuels are biofuels produced from crops or trees grown in large-scale monocultures, or agricultural and forest 'waste' which should be returned to the natural system.","Once hailed as a climate savior, biofuels are now the subject of widespread criticism .

"(CNN) -- A tropical depression formed in the western Caribbean Sea on Sunday, and is likely to become Tropical Storm Rina as it skirts the Honduran coastline, the National Hurricane Center said. The depression -- the 18th of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season -- was located off the Nicaragua/Honduras border late Sunday afternoon, forecasters said. The government of Honduras issued a tropical storm watch from Punta Castilla eastward to the Nicaraguan border. A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions, including sustained winds of at least 39 mph, are possible within 48 hours. The depression was moving northwest at near 12 mph, and was expected to turn west-northwest Monday. ""On the forecast track, the center of the depression is expected to pass north of the northeastern coast of Honduras during the next couple of days,"" the center said. The depression's maximum sustained winds were at 35 mph, just shy of tropical storm strength, forecasters said. ""Gradual strengthening is expected during the next day or two and the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm tonight or Monday,"" the center said. The depression is expected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain over eastern Honduras, with isolated maximum amounts of 7 inches possible in some spots, according to the center. The forecast track shows the system brushing Belize as a tropical storm and making landfall near Chetumal, Mexico, on Friday. However, such long-range forecasts are subject to change.","The tropical depression is the 18th of the hurricane season .

"(CNN) -- The Brazilian Air Force on Friday dropped eight 500-pound bombs on a clandestine airstrip in the jungle near the Colombian and Venezuelan borders, part of wide military operation that goes beyond targeting drug traffickers. Video of the scene, released by the air force, showed craters on the destroyed airstrip, which they say was used to move drugs. The highly-publicized effort, dubbed Operation Agatha, is an effort against drug trafficking, illegal mining and logging, and trafficking of wild animals, the military said. ""This operation is a first coordination effort by the government to intensify actions on the border,"" Col. Jose Maurilo Machado de Lima said. ""We are going to carry out, periodically, operations of intensification of that control."" The operation counts with more than 35 aircraft and 3,000 troops. In its most recent mission, four Brazilian-made A-29 Super Tucano planes flew to where the airstrip was hidden, about 42 miles (68 km) northeast of the city of Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, and dropped their bombs. Two Black Hawk helicopters then brought personnel from the police, army and environmental agency to the site to verify that the operation was successful and that the area was safe.","It is part of a larger operation near the border with Colombia .

"Tegucigalpa, Honduras (CNN) -- Hundreds of troops and police officers headed to northern Honduras Tuesday after at least 11 people died in two days of clashes, authorities said. ""Arms will be taken away immediately from people who carry weapons of war and weapons without permits,"" Security Secretary Oscar Alvarez said in a statement Monday. The deployment comes after at least 11 people were killed in the Aguan region of Colon state -- six on Monday and five on Sunday, police said. The region in northern Honduras is the site of longstanding disputes over palm plantations between local peasants and corporate landowners. At least 600 police and troops will be deployed in the operation, aimed at ""reinforcing operations to stop more disturbances and confrontations between peasants and private security groups,"" the Honduran government said in a statement. Hundreds of armed people ambushed security guards Sunday at a ranch owned by Dinant Corporation, company treasurer Roger Pineda said. Five people were killed and 11 were injured, he said. A national land reform organization said local peasant groups should not be blamed for the attacks. ""What is happening at this moment has nothing to do with these organizations ... It is the result of individuals who have committed criminal acts and must be held accountable and punished,"" said Marco Ramiro Lobo, legal advisor to the National Agrarian Institute. Miguel Angel Bonilla, the Honduran minister of communications and strategy, told CNN en Español that criminals were striking at a key time, just as government-mediated negotiations between peasants and landowners in the area were nearing their conclusion. Attackers dress like peasants but were heavily armed, he said, carrying high-caliber weapons. ""Effectively there are people who are taking advantage of the situation,"" he said. ""They want it to look like they are peasants."" Land disputes over palm plantations in the area began more than a decade ago, but authorities have noted an uptick in violence in recent months. Police data indicates that more than 50 people have been killed in land disputes in Colon in the past 14 months. CNN en Espanol's Fernando del Rincon and Patricia Janiot and journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report.","NEW: Honduran government minister: Attackers ""want it to look like they are peasants""

"You wanted to know more about greenwashing, and Scot Case, from environmental marketing firm TerraChoice, answered. Greenwashing expert Scot Case of TerraChoice . ""Why are green products often more expensive than ones that don't say they are green or environmentally friendly? Is it just because green has become a new form of 'premium brand'? Isn't this bad news if we want to make more people environmentally aware when they go shopping?"" Harriet Gladwell . Case: First, it should be noted that not all greener products are more expensive. The remanufactured toner cartridges I purchase at a nationwide office-supply store, for example, carry the same warranty as other cartridges at a 30-percent lower cost. This greener option is less expensive because the manufacturer avoids the cost of manufacturing the plastic and electronic components. They simply reuse the parts from recycled cartridges. There are also greener products that do not cost extra. There are cleaning products and paints, for example, that have been certified as meeting tough environmental standards by EcoLogo or Green Seal that deliver the same high-quality performance one expects without costing any extra. Other greener products might be slightly more expensive initially, but generate substantial savings for the consumer. Energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs), for example, are still four times more expensive than traditional cheap incandescent light bulbs. However, CFLs use 75 percent less electricity and last 10 times longer, so they don't have to be replaced as frequently. As a result, the typical CFL saves consumers $30 over the life of the bulb. There are now energy- or water-efficient versions of all sorts of products -- refrigerators, windows, air conditioners, televisions, dishwashers, ovens, showerheads, washing machines, etc. The more efficient versions are typically more expensive initially to reflect the higher-quality components used to make them, but they quickly pay for themselves in lower energy and water costs. Look for products that are Energy Star registered. Even better, look for products that have been independently certified as meeting the Energy Star standards. Why are other greener products still more expensive sometimes? It boils down to the simple laws of supply and demand. Any new innovative product, whether it is ""greener"" or not, costs extra initially. It costs money to research and develop the product and to build the factories and supply chains it takes to make the product. Manufacturers try to recoup those costs as quickly as possible during the initial sales of the product. As demand increases, however, additional manufacturing efficiencies -- economies of scale -- begin to emerge that permit the prices to fall. In addition, high prices attract competitors with similar products, and the additional competition helps force prices lower. Are some manufacturers attempting to earn additional revenue by presenting their greener options as a premium brand? Absolutely. Just as some clothing manufacturers charge extra to have their name brand applied to a shirt. It is also possible, however, to buy high-quality, greener products, at very good prices, at growing numbers of mainstream retail outlets. When DVD players and cell phones were first introduced, they were only available to the very wealthy. Now everyone has at least one. The same is increasingly true with greener product offerings. ""What are the most obvious signs that a company is greenwashing the public with false claims? What words and phrases should raise a red flag?"" Carla Dos Santos . The most obvious sign a company is greenwashing is if the company fails to provide proof of their environmental claims. Legitimate environmental claims can be certified by independent outside third-party auditors. Manufacturers can also provide test data and other relevant information on Web sites. Consumers should also beware of generic environmental claims that are so vague they are likely to be misunderstood. Watch out for broad claims like ""eco-friendly,"" ""earth kind,"" ""all natural,"" ""eco-safe"" or other green babble. Even phrases like ""biodegradable,"" ""recyclable"" and ""compostable"" can be misleading if they fail to clarify how the products were tested or under what circumstances the claim is true. Make sure any environmental claim is specific, backed by proof, and, preferably, verified by an independent, outside third-party. For additional greenwashing examples and recommendations on how to avoid being fooled, check out the Six Sins of Greenwashing or the accompanying wallet-size guide book. ""Is it possible to put together information about a product's greenness that has both the detail that's really needed, and is at the same time simple and clear? And how can we get governments to serve the public and advise them on green purchasing, in the way that is most fair to commercial interests?"" Rick Reibstein . There are certainly efforts underway to provide consumers with additional information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions. The traditional environmental standards such as Green Seal and EcoLogo publish standards and then certify products meeting those standards. Most consumers find the simplicity of this type of certification scheme the most useful. Some particularly savvy green consumers, however, want additional information beyond knowing that a product has been certified as meeting a standard. They are seeking information presented in a nutrition-label format that allows them to compare two certified products to determine which is greener. I think we will see the emergence of hybrid labeling systems that do provide greater detail about the environmental features of a product. Such a label would combine the traditional ""thumbs up or thumbs down"" approach of Green Seal or EcoLogo along with additional information in a standard format. The information might be available on product packaging or on an accompanying Web site. Governments are actually already pushing manufacturers to provide this level of detail using their purchasing power rather than their legislative power. Government purchasers across North America, for example, are demanding safer, more environmentally preferable cleaning products, papers, paints, vehicles, building products, office equipment and computers. Government purchasers in New York, Illinois, California, Minnesota, and other places, for example, require cleaning products to meet the Green Seal or EcoLogo cleaning-product standards. As a result, those products are becoming more widely available for consumers too. The U.S. Federal government and many state governments are also purchasing more environmentally preferable computer products. They are requiring products to meet the EPEAT green computer standard. One unique feature of the EPEAT label is that the EPEAT Web site provides additional information on the environmental features associated with the almost 1,000 products on the EPEAT registry. Now that the information is available, consumers can use the EPEAT information to make their own purchasing decisions. Providing this level of environmental information is the foundation of market-based environmentalism. Government purchasers, other large purchasers such as colleges and universities or Fortune 1000 companies, and individual consumers can use the publicly available information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions along with traditional factors like price and quality to determine how they will spend their hard-earned money. This approach allows the greenest products to be identified and to compete with other products for market share. Of course, in addition to the market-based approach, governments always have it within their power to actually legislate minimum environmental requirements or the publication of basic environmental information. There are persistent rumors of efforts underway to use the legislative power of the federal government to encourage greater transparency regarding the environmental footprint of a product and to make it easier to share that information with consumers. It will be interesting to see what happens in Congress with a new U.S. president in January. ""How can we know if the 'green' label is credible, and do you think we'll ever get to the place where all these different certifications merge into one consistent and widely recognized label? Is this happening in any countries?"" Amber Wells . While there were only three or four eco-labels 20 years ago -- EcoLogo was North America's first and it was founded in 1988 -- there are now more than 300. At some point, I think it is inevitable that there will be some significant consolidation in the environmental-labeling world. There are already numerous meetings among the most legitimate environmental-labeling programs to collaborate more closely. A variety of efforts are attempting to separate the truly green labels from the fake green ones. There are also persistent rumors of pending federal legislation to encourage or even require greater accountability. Until then, consumers need to be aware that not all green-labeling programs are created equally. Before relying on any ""green dot"" to help make a purchasing decision, consumers need to understand exactly what the ""green dot"" means. Make sure you can answer the following questions about an environmental label before making a purchase: . (1) Who created the labeling program? -- Was it created by a manufacturer or a trade association to promote their own products, or was it created by an independent outside organization in an open, public, transparent process? Is it backed by a respected European or North American government? (2) Does the label require a product to actually meet a specific standard? -- Some labels are being awarded based on fees paid to a consultant rather than based on compliance with a published standard. Others are being awarded simply by joining a trade association or paying a membership fee. (3) Does the label address multiple environmental issues or does it focus narrowly on just a single issue like energy-efficiency or recycled-content? -- Review the standard to determine whether it covers multiple environmental issues throughout the entire product life-cycle, which includes the raw materials used to make the product, the manufacturing process, transportation and packaging, and the impacts of using and discarding or recycling the product. Make sure the standard covers the environmental issues you and the environmental community are most concerned about. (4) What does a manufacturer have to do to prove a product meets the standard? -- Some labels permit a manufacturer to determine on its own whether it meets the published standard. Other programs -- including EcoLogo, Green Seal, and the Chlorine Free Products Association -- independently review product test data and visit the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the standard. There is a three-page appendix to the Six Sins of Greenwashing report that provides additional information to help identify legitimate environmental standards.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan government vowed Friday to sink any ship approaching the besieged port city of Misrata, essentially threatening NATO patrols and humanitarian aid ships that have been bringing in food and medical supplies and ferrying out refugees and the wounded . Libya's threat came hours after NATO said it intercepted Libyan government forces laying mines in Misrata's harbor, which has been a lifeline for humanitarian aid in the months-long conflict between troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi and rebels demanding an end to the dictator's four-decade rule. NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians. It also came as Gadhafi's forces were shelling Misrata in an attempt to re-enter the city after being pushed out by rebels. Misrata, the country's third-largest city, has been hemmed in on three sides for weeks by Gadhafi's forces, leaving the sea as the only escape route. At least nine people were killed and another 30 were wounded in Friday's attacks in Misrata, said a doctor, who is a member of the medical committee in the city. ""There is an indiscriminate shelling now in Misrata,"" said the doctor, who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution by Gadhafi's forces. Rebels accused Gadhafi forces of dismantling rocket launchers so they would escape detection by NATO forces during transport, and then reassembling for use in attacking civilians, a spokesman for the rebels said. ""We have reports that Gadhafi troops are loading fish boats with weapons in Tripoli and may be coming to Misrata,"" he said. NATO personnel Friday stopped small boats carrying pro-Gadhafi forces who were laying anti-ship mines in Misrata's harbor, NATO spokesman Brig. Gen. Rob Weighill told reporters during a briefing in Brussels, Belgium. NATO warships were in the process of disarming and clearing the mines that had been laid, he said. Meanwhile, Libyan state TV announced that the Libyan military had successfully suppressed operations of the port. ""We will not allow any ship to dock at the port without being inspected by the Libyan government,"" Musa Ibrahim, a Libyan government spokesman, told reporters in Tripoli. He said any aid to Misrata must be delivered through designated land routes. Elsewhere, a senior rebel member, Omar al-Jernazi, told CNN that rebels ""took complete control"" Friday of Wazin -- a key Tunisian-Libyan border crossing -- after forcing Gadhafi forces to flee into Tunisia. The Tunisian army allowed Gadhafi's troops to return to Libya at another border crossing, the rebel said. Meanwhile, thousands more Libyans fled to Tunisia, stirring further concerns about a humanitarian crisis there, according to Tunisia's state-run news agency TAP, which cited Tunisian security sources. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees set up more tents in the Remada refugee camp, it said.

"(CNN) -- France will host golf's Ryder Cup for the first time in 2018, it was announced Tuesday. Le Golf National course, on the outskirts of the capital Paris, was chosen to stage the 42nd edition of the biannual competition between Europe and the United States ahead of Germany, Portugal, Netherlands and favorites Spain. There had been calls for the tournament to be given to Spain in memory of golfing great Seve Ballesteros, who died after a long battle with cancer earlier this month. The five-time major winner was patron of the Madrid bid. But the European Tour resisted the emotional draw of the Spanish bid, much to the delight of the French delegation. Water hazard! $500 million floating golf course planned for Maldives . They have promised to boost the sport at grass roots level by building 100 urban courses in the country and pledged to increase the number of registered players by 300,000 to 700,000 by 2022. Every registered golfer in France donated one euro ($1.41) to the cause and now the country can expect the big financial bonus from business and tourism that comes with hosting the event. Richard Hills, Europe's Ryder Cup Director, told the European Tour's official web site: ""We have one worthy gold medallist in France, who gave us the confidence to believe that they will stage a truly memorable Ryder Cup in seven years time. ""France, as the successful nation, will now be entering into a multi-faceted relationship with Ryder Cup Europe, lasting a minimum of 12 years and benefiting many aspects of golf at all levels. ""All of us at Ryder Cup Europe look forward to working closely with the French Ryder Cup 2018 team in the coming years."" The announcement was celebrated heartily by the French delegation, which included golfers Thomas Levet and Jean Van de Velde, who represented Europe in the 2004 and 1999 Ryder Cups respectively. The last, thrilling, installment, in 2010, was won by Europe at Celtic Manor in Wales, when captain Colin Montgomerie led his team to victory by 14 1/2 points to 13 1/2. Pascal Grizot, chairman of the French Ryder Cup bid, said: ""We've always believed it could happen. My greatest satisfaction is to have brought everyone together to believe it too. ""French golf united and this did not go unnoticed by the European Tour. This huge victory is one for everyone connected to French golf."" Regarding Ballesteros he added: ""We all remember Severiano Ballesteros as an icon in our sport and someone who epitomized the spirit of the Ryder Cup. He is in our thoughts today."" Georges Barbaret, President of the French Golf Federation, added: ""I can't wait for 2018. We have always believed in the link between culture and sport which I'm sure will make the Ryder Cup in France a unique event that will leave everlasting memories.""","France have won the right to host golf's Ryder Cup in 2018 .

"(CNN) -- The leaders of France and Japan vowed Thursday to work to bolster international safety standards for nuclear power plants, making the subject a prime topic at a pair of upcoming international summits. At the request of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who visited Tokyo on Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said he would explain the situation at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in the context of overall safety during the G8 summit in May in Deuville, France, and again at November's G-20 summit in Cannes, France. ""The world is one community,"" said Sarkozy. ""So what happens in one place affects other places as well. This is an issue of global safety."" Kan said he concurred with the French president, noting he would be willing to detail Japan's challenges at the embattled plant -- where at least four of the six reactors suffered significant damage, leading to the release of radiation into the air, soil and water -- at the upcoming global meetings. A discussion and possible adoption of international nuclear safety standards, he added, would be sensible and mutually beneficial. ""We need to accurately convey our lessons from this experience,"" Kan said. ""The safety criteria should be taken up in these meetings."" The French president, who traveled to Japan in his capacity as current head of the G8 group that also includes Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, said that there was a lack of clear, universal guidelines for nuclear safety. ""An independent body ... should establish international safety standards,"" he said. Still, Kan said that his government's first priority, beyond addressing the humanitarian and reconstruction needs wrought by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, is resolving the nuclear crisis without a further widespread release of radiation. After that, he said, Japan will analyze and assess its energy policy -- including the role that nuclear power will and should play. The initial goal in this assessment, according to Kan, will be maximizing safety at its existing nuclear facilities. ""We must position nuclear power plants to become safer,"" he said, ""so that such an accident will never happen again."" Sarkozy acknowledged Japan's crisis has affected France's take on nuclear energy. He promised that inspectors there will expeditiously check out French nuclear plants to make sure they are safe. ""If they do not meet the (safety) criteria, we will be closing down the plants,"" the president said. As to the immediate crisis, Sarkozy said that France would offer a special robot to work in contaminated areas in Japan as well as offer up experts and insight to help Japan navigate the current crisis. France is one of several nations to offer up such assistance. The United States, for one, has made numerous contributions, including dispatching a 140-member team of troops specializing in detecting, medical treating and decontaminating radioactive material.","French President Sarkozy, the current head of the G8, visits Japan .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday morning he has advised his family to avoid ""confined places"" such as aircraft, subways and classrooms because of the swine flu risk. Vice President Biden on Thursday said people should avoid ""confined spaces."" Biden made the remarks on NBC's ""Today Show,"" after he was asked what he would tell a family member about traveling to Mexico, where the first cases of the virus -- technically known as 2009 H1N1 -- were detected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, is advising people to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico, where the Mexican government suspects 159 deaths have resulted from the infection, most of them in or around Mexico City. Only a fraction of those cases have been confirmed. ""The CDC is concerned that continued travel by U.S. travelers to Mexico presents a serious risk for further outbreaks of swine flu in the United States,"" the agency says on its Web site. But Biden appeared to go a step further, saying, ""I would tell members of my family, and I have, I wouldn't go anywhere in confined places now. It's not that you're going to Mexico, it's you're in a confined aircraft. When one person sneezes it goes all the way through the aircraft. That's me.  Watch the vice president explain why he wouldn't fly » . ""I would not be, at this point, if they had another way of transportation, (be) suggesting they ride the subway. ... So from my perspective, what it relates to is mitigation. If you're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes, that's one thing, if you're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom it's a different thing."" Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, responded to Biden's comments by saying, ""Americans should heed the advice of medical experts when determining how best to manage health concerns during the ongoing swine flu outbreak. In a written statement, he noted that according to the CDC ""and countless other experts, swine flu should not discourage people from traveling to or within the United States."" ""Elected officials must strike a delicate balance of accurately and adequately informing citizens of health concerns without unduly discouraging travel and other important economic activity,"" he said. The Travel Association is a ""political liaison"" for the industry, and markets all modes of travel. Not long after the ""Today Show"" aired, Biden  released a statement through his spokeswoman, Elizabeth Alexander. ""The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans: that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico."" iReport.com: Share your swine flu concerns . ""If they are sick, they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces, such as subways. This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week."" The statement also refers to advice President Obama gave to Americans on Wednesday night. He said they should take the same steps to avoid swine flu that one would take to prevent any other flu: keep hands washed, cover your mouth when you cough, stay home from work if you're sick, and keep sick children home from school.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama last month pleaded not guilty to 10 counts including piracy, hostage-taking, and firearms charges in U.S. District Court in New York on Thursday. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse arrived in the United States on April 21. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse faces life in prison if convicted in any of eight of the 10 counts, according to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The U.S. Navy took Muse into custody April 12 after the hijacking in the Indian Ocean. He arrived in the United States April 21. At his arraignment Thursday, Muse stood before Judge Loretta Preska wearing navy-blue prison garb and a bright orange undershirt. The defendant appeared dejected as he listened to the proceedings through the voice of an interpreter, looking downwards at his lap and feet most of the time. The indictment charges Muse with eight counts that each could carry a maximum sentence of life in prison: piracy, possession of a machine gun while seizing a ship by force, hostage-taking, conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, possession of a machine gun during hostage-taking, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and possession of a machine gun during kidnapping. The remaining two charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years behind bars: seizing a ship by force and conspiracy to seize a ship by force. Defense attorney Phil Weinstein asked the court for time for the defense to conduct its own investigation into the case, and the judge agreed, setting the next hearing date for September 17. Weinstein then expressed concern over Muse's treatment under incarceration, alleging that prison officials were administering medication to him without proper consent and were denying him phone calls to his family in Somalia. Weinstein also expressed concern about Muse's detention conditions. ""He's been held in administrative segregation since his arrest, which means he's detained alone for 23 out of 24 hours a day,"" Weinstein told reporters gathered outside the courthouse. ""He's unable to communicate with anyone except for us."" Muse's defense team was joined outside the courthouse by Idd Beddel Mohamed, deputy permanent representative to Somalia's mission to the United Nations in New York. He told reporters his government is monitoring the proceedings and working with the federal public defenders to ensure proper legal protection for Muse. ""We have full confidence in the U.S. legal system and we believe justice will be served,"" Mohamed told reporters.  See timeline of events that led to piracy case » . There had been questions about Muse's age, with his father in Somalia telling defense attorneys his son was only 15. But, a U.S. magistrate judge ruled that Muse is in fact older than 18 and can be tried as an adult. Still, the defense team continues to raise questions about Muse's exact age. They say they are working with Mohamed and other Somali officials to try to secure proper documentation of Muse's birth date. Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship, April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast, according to the criminal complaint. They boarded the ship after firing gunshots, according to crew members quoted in the complaint. Muse was carrying a gun and was the first alleged pirate on the ship, the complaint said. According to the complaint, Muse fired his gun at the Maersk's captain, Richard Phillips, and then took $30,000 from the ship's safe after he forced Phillips to open it. A Maersk crew member managed to tackle Muse and tie his hands, leading to a deal with the pirates: They would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them and if they got a life boat, the complaint said. Phillips boarded the life boat with them and the ship's crew freed Muse, who then boarded the life boat, according to the criminal complaint. Over the next three days, the life boat floated near the Maersk with the U.S. Navy's USS Bainbridge nearby. On April 12, Muse boarded the USS Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the other pirates in exchange for Phillips' release. But while he was aboard, Navy SEALs, or special forces, shot and killed the three remaining pirates and freed Phillips. The criminal complaint said Muse ""conducted himself as the leader"" of the pirates who allegedly took over the Maersk Alabama. Still, defense attorneys said they believe Muse will be exonerated in the end. ""The complaint says that [Muse] requested ... from the Americans to come aboard the Navy ship, and they granted him that permission,"" defense attorney Fiona Doherty told reporters Thursday. ""And from there, that's where he was trying to negotiate for the safe release of Captain Phillips.""","Indictment alleges eight counts that carry life sentence .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Dozens of people have been killed during two days of clashes between Islamist militants and Nigerian security forces in a northeastern town, an army commander said. Chief of Army Staff Azubuike Ihejirika said the latest violence in what is a simmering low-level insurgency in Africa's most populous country left soldiers dead and wounded. The fighting began Thursday between Boko Haram militants and the military in the Yobe state town of Damaturu. ""There was a major encounter with the Boko Haram in Damaturu,"" Ihejirika said Friday. ""We lost three of our soldiers, seven were wounded. But we killed over 50 of their members."" That contradicted hospital and morgue workers who said the vast majority of some 50 bodies brought in since Friday were civilians. An attack on Friday left at least a dozen dead in Maidugiri, in neighboring Borno state, officials and hospital workers said Saturday. Residents said pre-Christmas festivities have been subdued in the city -- largely Muslim with a Christian minority. It isn't clear whether Boko Haram attacked. Residents say the group was involved, but the military has not yet commented. ""The situation here is very scary -- the worst military confrontation yet,"" said one resident who requested anonymity. Boko Haram -- which translates from the local Hausa as ""Western education is outlawed -- wants to introduce a strict version of Muslim Sharia law across the 155-million person country. The population is roughly split between Muslims and Christians. After Boko Haram's leader was killed in police custody in 2009, its members began carrying out a campaign of sporadic violence which has been fueled by the military's iron-fisted approach, experts say. In August, group carried out its first suicide bombing and attack outside the north of the country when a car bomb claimed 24 lives at the United Nations building in the capital, Abuja. Observers are also closely monitoring whether the group is forging links with other international terrorist organizations. People claiming to speak on behalf of the group say it draws inspiration from Afghanistan's Taliban. Some experts say the group has a network that extends across Chad and Mali. Nigerian security forces have struggled to contain near-daily blasts in the group's home base states, Yobe and Borno. While the violence has rarely spilled beyond the north, officials and diplomats say the group's anti-government rhetoric has earned it substantial support from local residents living amid unemployment and poverty levels up to twice the national average. Activist Shehu Sani, president of Civil Rights Congress of Nigeria, said attempts to broker a cease-fire have been derailed, but he stressed the importance of dialogue. ""On the one hand, Boko Haram cannot turn Nigeria into an Islamic state through force. On the other, the Nigerian forces cannot crush the group through use of force,"" he told CNN.","Boko Haram means ""Western education is outlawed'

"Paris (CNN) -- An investigation into the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean will also include a probe into Air France-KLM, the airline's attorney said Friday. A French magistrate already is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the crash, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman. However, Fernand Garnault, the attorney for Air France-KLM, said he doesn't know why the airline is part of the investigation. He said the magistrate is looking into a problem involving pitot tubes, which measure a plane's air speed. Still, ""there is nothing new in this case and there is no proof that the pitot tubes caused the crash,"" Garnault told CNN. Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. The plane fell into the sea while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard. Thomas Enders, CEO of Airbus, disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation. ""On behalf of Airbus, I have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement,"" Enders said in a written statement. ""Airbus maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again. Airbus will continue to support the investigation, including the continued search for the flight recorders, which is the only sure way to know the truth,"" he said. Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine. The plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a 2009 report. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys, the BEA said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles.","NEW: Air France-KLM also being investigated .

"(CNN) -- North Korea reiterated its call Monday for a resumption of six-party talks without preconditions, its state-run news agency reported from Pyongyang. The call follows a rare visit to the United States by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kae-Gwan, who met with senior U.S. officials last week. It was the first direct meeting between North Korean and U.S. officials since North Korea pulled out of six-party talks in 2008. In addition to the United States and North Korea, the six-party talks involved China, Japan, Russia and South Korea. The goal was nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula. North Korea has called for the resumption of six-party talks without preconditions before. The United States and South Korea, however, have insisted on some tangible demonstration that North Korea is serious about denuclearization. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said recently, for example, that the United States hoped to determine in its meetings with the North Korean foreign minister whether North Korea is ready to ""take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization.""","A senior North Korean official made a rare visit to the United States last week .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- Working conditions for South Asian migrant workers have improved on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island, but more needs to be done and protection gaps remain, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Wednesday. In an 85-page report, the rights groups said those gaps include ""reimbursing workers for recruiting fees, which often take months or years to repay and are the single greatest factor in creating conditions of forced labor."" The report also found ""lapses in effectively punishing abusive contractors and following through on promises to make monitoring reports public."" Saadiyat Island, a $22 billion cultural project, will include local branches of New York University, as well as the Louvre and Guggenheim Museums. ""For too long, migrant workers in the UAE have toiled in abusive conditions, with private and public developers showing little concern,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Now, finally, Emirati developers and their international partners have stepped up to the plate on Saadiyat Island to start to protect workers, but they will need to do more to curtail the abuses."" HRW first reported on the subject in 2009, when they found widespread exploitation of laborers on Saadiyat Island. The rights group says there have been notable improvements since then, citing ""commitments by leading educational and cultural bodies and UAE development companies to ensure regular payment of wages, rest breaks and days off, and employer-paid medical insurance, and to hire independent monitors to detect and report publicly on violations of workers' rights on the island."" But today's progress report noted that many workers still pay recruitment fees in order to obtain their jobs, adding that almost all the 47 workers interviewed reported paying between $900 and $3,350 to agents in their home countries, a practice that can trap them in debt. The report also found contractors are ""regularly confiscating worker passports and substituting worker contracts with less favorable ones when the workers arrive in the UAE."" In a response to HRW's report, Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC), the island's master developer, said they continue ""to be deeply committed to safeguarding worker welfare on its projects"". In a statement TDIC added that while the company is pleased to see HRW acknowledging the high standards they continue to uphold in the area of worker welfare, they also believe that ""some of the findings detailed are outdated and inaccurate, as the report cites interviews conducted between October 2010 and January 2011."" The statement added: ""Moreover, the company believes the methodology HRW has used in the report is flawed; we call into question the small sample of workers interviewed, as well as the limited number of contractors these workers represent. TDIC therefore firmly believes that this report is not an accurate reflection of the current situation on Saadiyat."" With regard to recruitment fees, TDIC said that they share HRW's concern, but that the fees continue to be a challenge. ""This practice mainly occurs in the worker's country of origin,"" said TDIC, ""making it an extremely difficult problem to address from the UAE. However, as according to TDIC's employment practices policy, should any worker prove they have been charged fees by an agency to work on any of its projects, the company will take appropriate action under its agreement with the relevant contractor to reimburse the worker. By focusing solely on Saadiyat, HRW is shifting the spotlight away from this important issue rather than trying to address it at its core. TDIC therefore encourages HRW to take the lead role in campaigning against this damaging practice on a wider scale and will fully support it in doing so."" A statement from New York University Abu Dhabi said that ""HRW's latest report acknowledges the major steps that we and our government partners have taken to ensure the health and welfare of the individuals who are building NYU Abu Dhabi's new campus on Saadiyat Island."" Josh Taylor, assistant vice chancellor, public affairs and community relations for NYU Abu Dhabi, added: ""We also welcome any new, actionable information that will enable us to accomplish our goals on this front. However, whereas our third-party compliance auditors conduct worker interviews each and every month, it appears that HRW's latest report relies on interviews that took place between 14 and 17 months ago. In a number of cases, the report also fails to indicate which project an individual was working on, which makes researching and/or addressing specific claims virtually impossible.""","Human Rights Watch says more needs to be done to improve working conditions .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If history is any guide, President Barack Obama will reach for the stars during his State of the Union address Tuesday night. But in the end, reality will bring his plans back down to Earth. Obama's ""blueprint"" for 2012 may run into similar partisan roadblocks that trimmed his lofty hopes for last year. ""There are absolutely things that remain undone that need to be done,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney admitted to reporters on Monday even as he touted a ""fairly comprehensive list of proposals"" that he believes the president has achieved. Ambition is taking the fall for unfinished business. ""If you got through a year and you achieved everything on your list then you probably didn't aim high enough,"" Carney said. CNNMoney: 4 things to look for in speech . Among the president's unmet promises from last year's address are pledges to increase investment in clean energy, take action on the status of illegal immigrants, fund new infrastructure projects, overhaul social security and let the Bush tax cuts on the highest income bracket expire. The president submitted proposals to Congress addressing some of his 2011 pledges, including on infrastructure spending and the tax cuts , but Republicans promptly rejected those measures. On other issues, including entitlement reform, a simplification to the tax code, and addressing illegal immigration, no concrete plan from the White House ever reached Congress. But the White House can point to some concrete achievements outlined in last year's address. These include the passage of trade deals with South Korea, Panama and Colombia; an end to the war in Iraq; and a repeal of the ""1099 provision"" that was said to burden small businesses' bookkeeping efforts relating to health care coverage. Even before the president utters the first words of his carefully crafted 2012 speech, Republicans are sending loud signals that there will be little to applaud. ""This year, the president's prospects for hope and change are even smaller,"" Republican National Committee press secretary Kirsten Kukowski said. Read a pre-release transcript of the speech . Some of the president's policy proposals that White House aides describe as ambitious will require congressional approval, and most of those ""may be dead on arrival in Congress,"" Kukowski predicted. But the president's tone is expected to be matched with a call for action. ""He rejects the idea that nothing can get done in an election year,"" Carney said. Seizing on the economy as his principal theme, Obama gave a preview of the speech to supporters in a video released by his re-election campaign. In what he called a ""blueprint for an American economy that's built to last,"" the president said manufacturing, energy, education and values would be the foundation for building an ""economy that works for everyone, not just a wealthy few."" He'll fill in the details during the speech, but a Democratic source briefed on the current draft of the State of the Union gave CNN a preview of what will be proposed: . • A tax code that lets the Bush tax cuts expire and the wealthy pay more . • More refinancing for homeowners in trouble . • Additional tax breaks for companies that create jobs in the United States . • More clean energy incentives . • Enhanced education and job training initiatives . • A renewed call for the so-called Buffett rule, a minimum tax rate for the wealthiest Americans . • The creation of a China task force to monitor trade violations . These proposals come after months of deliberations behind the scenes. The president held a conference call last week with state legislators, mayors and tribal leaders ""to hear their ideas about the state of the union,"" a senior administration official told CNN. Through draft after draft, top aides have described the president as ""very engaged"" in the process. He worked with chief speechwriter Jon Favreau and others on his policy team to ""refine it."" Tweaks will continue until delivery. Looking to draw in viewers beyond the traditional television networks, the White House will host an interactive live-streamed version of the speech on its website at www.whitehouse.gov/sotu. Senior administration officials are expected to take part in a post-address discussion that will include a live audience and questions from Twitter, Facebook and Google. Another sales pitch will involve the president hitting the road Wednesday with a three-day, five-state tour. He'll tackle one of the main pillars laid out in his address each day, according to a senior administration official. On Wednesday it will be manufacturing; Thursday, energy and energy security, and Friday, American skills and innovation. Republicans consider the highly touted tour a tax-funded campaign trip, with convenient visits to states that could be key to the president's re-election efforts. ""Obama's speech won't be as important for the policy agenda he lays out ... as for the political campaign it sets for the next nine months,"" the RNC's Kukowski said. ""Perhaps that's why he will travel to Iowa, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Michigan, all potentially swing states in the election."" The White House brushes aside that criticism and redirects attention to the president's primary goal of fixing the economy and creating jobs. Top aides insist that despite predictions of more gridlock, there's no reason proposals that will be detailed in the State of the Union address can't find bipartisan support. And while some of last year's promises went unmet, Tuesday night's address will be no less ambitious. ""You shouldn't trim your sails because of that,"" Carney said. CNN's Alex Mooney contributed to this report.","White House admits some plans announced last year haven't been carried out .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An online campaign in support of a former U.S. Marine -- arrested for attempting to security-check his pistol while visiting the Empire State Building -- is bringing new attention and a fair amount of scrutiny to one of the nation's toughest gun-control laws. Ryan Jerome, 28, was charged with criminal possession of his .45-caliber Ruger while visiting the famous New York landmark during a September vacation with his girlfriend. Jerome has a license to carry the weapon from his home state of Indiana, but New Yorks state gun laws do not recognize out-of-state permits. With his case still pending, Jerome could face up to three and a half years in jail. Jerome's attorney says its clear his client, who does not have a criminal record, wasn't attempting anything nefarious because Jerome approached security on his own to tell the guards about his weapon. But the law prohibits anyone -- with certain exceptions such as law enforcement officers -- from carrying a firearm in the state unless that person specifically has a New York state-issued permit. Jerome spent two days in a jail cell before he could make bail. ""I was in utter disbelief, I was in shock,"" said Jerome. His arrest is one amid a series of similar instances that have some questioning whether New York state's strict gun laws, which aim to protect public safety, are unnecessarily targeting law-abiding citizens. ""We just don't believe, as I believe most don't think, that he should be prosecuted under such a stringent statute which is clearly designed to get the so-called bad guys,"" said Jerome's attorney, Mark Bederow. Fellow Marines, on a website called leatherneck.com are rallying to Jerome's side and have begun a letter-writing campaign. David Bruce says he's been sending the letters to New York City law enforcement officials. ""We're asking that Ryan Jerome's case be moved from the prosecution file to dismissed file -- it's as simple as that,"" Bruce said. Jerome attempted to check New York's gun laws on his cell phone, but his lawyer says Jerome ""made a mistake,"" when he read the information. ""Its just been a real nightmare,"" Jerome told CNN. Other gun-toting tourists have also found themselves in similar situations . Tea party activist Mark Meckler, who according to the Transportation Security Administration legally checked his unloaded California-registered pistol in a locked box during a preflight check-in at New York's LaGuardia airport, was arrested at the airport in December. Authorities say in Meckler's case, the original charge was reduced to a violation and a fine. Last month, a Tennessee medical student was arrested at the 9/11 memorial after trying to check her gun; she will go to court in March. The head of a prominent New York City gun-control group sympathizes with Jerome, but says the gun laws should not change. ""New York needs to send a very powerful message to gun owners, which is if you decide to have a gun, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that,"" the president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, Richard Aborn, told CNN, ""And one of those responsibilities is knowing where and when you can carry that gun."" As for Jerome, his fate is in the hands of the Manhattan district attorney. Its unclear what prosecutors will do with this case . ""All of our laws allow prosecutors to carefully evaluate the facts and circumstances unique to each case, and exercise discretion in cases where justice dictates leniency,"" said Erin M. Duggan, director of communications for the district attorney's office. She added, ""New York state has enacted rational gun laws for one very simple reason: to protect everyone visiting, living, or working in New York."" Jerome is expected to be back in court in March. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","Ryan Jerome was arrested when he tried to security-check his pistol .

"(CNN) -- Two American tourists who were kidnapped in the southern part of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula were freed Friday, a security official said. They had been abducted by unknown Bedouins, said Gen. Mohamed Naguib, head of security in the region. The kidnappers had demanded that some detainees be released and retried, but it is unclear if these calls were met. Earlier Friday, the country's tourism minister said on Al Hayat Egyptian TV that authorities had located the kidnappers and were negotiating with them. The abductions came several days after kidnappers held a larger group for a day. Twenty-four Chinese workers and a translator were kidnapped by Bedouins while on their way to a military-owned cement factory on Tuesday, the state-run Xinhua news agency of China reported. A group of armed Bedouins had blocked the road on which they were traveling. They wanted the Egyptian government to release prisoners. The hostages were released after a day, the news agency said, after Egyptian authorities intervened. Kidnappings and daylight armed robberies have become increasingly common in the turbulent year since Egypt's long-ruling dictator Hosni Mubarak was overthrown. In particular, wealthy Egyptians have been targeted by hostage-takers demanding ransom. ""Two of our family members, Ismail, (age) 13 and Sara, 8, were kidnapped yesterday. Right after they got out of their house ... on their way to school,"" said Mamdouh Eid, an executive in a construction company and the executive director of the Fan's Committee for the popular Egyptian soccer team Al Ahly. Eid revealed news of the kidnapping of his family, during an interview with CNN about the rampage in a Port Said football stadium that left at least 79 people dead. Hours after he survived the deadly incident, Eid said he learned of the kidnapping of his two child cousins. ""Thankfully, we got them back last night,"" he said. He declined to explain how the children were returned to their parents. ""Its scary. We don't know what we're heading to and if it will ever be the same again.""","NEW: The two hostages have been freed, an official says .

"(CNN) -- A few years ago, when I would tell people that my husband was deployed to Afghanistan, they would often respond with, ""Well, at least he's not in Iraq,"" a comment I always found ignorant and irritating. But now, with the Iraq war ending, I am grateful that my husband's deployments were all to Afghanistan, to the war that the world -- at least temporarily -- forgot. Today I am grateful the name ""Iraq"" is not in my family's scrapbooks, our memories or the stories we will pass on to future generations, though my reasoning has nothing to do with the actual fighting that took place there. I am grateful because, to many Americans, Afghanistan is still the ""good"" war, the one we had to fight. Iraq was the war that many never understood nor supported. The Iraq war was tied up from the start in confusion and wrapped in acronym. There were missing WMDs and deadly IEDs, soldiers with PTSD and TBI returning home only to struggle through deplorable conditions at Walter Reed. There was sectarian violence that stretched from mosque to mosque, fueled by centuries-old religious disputes between groups most of us had never even known existed. Our belief in the goodness of our own people was challenged when perverse pictures from Abu Ghraib appeared on the evening news. There were stories of made-up heroism, shortages of body armor, an array of military contractors who were neither soldiers nor civilians but lived instead in a shady gray area -- and there were terrifying kidnappings that tragically often ended in death. Through it all were earnest-faced troops mugging in YouTube videos and talking to embedded reporters, slogging through their fourth, fifth and sixth deployments away from their homes and their families. The good news -- the neighborhoods that were made safe, the schools and hospitals that were opened, the proud purple-fingered elections -- was often eclipsed by the bad news and the learning curve for Americans was steep, too steep. Pretty soon it all became too much to take. So I am happy to have never had a ""Half My Heart Is in Iraq"" sticker on my car because now, nearly nine years after the start of the Iraq War, people don't shake their heads and look down when I talk of my husband's deployments. They don't suck in their breaths and say to me, ""What a waste."" My family doesn't have to suffer the comments and opinions of others for our part in a war that was never ours to choose -- at least not now, though I suppose that could still change. The thing is, my husband didn't get to decide where he went to fight. He signed up for the Army and the Army told him where to go. In fact, my husband and I, like many in military families, never thought of the two conflicts as being separate wars. To us this war was always one war with two fronts. The bullets and the IEDs killed the same in either country. Where the plane landed and the deployment began was simply the luck of the draw. But now that the war in Iraq is over, there's not likely to be a second ""Mission Accomplished"" banner to herald the end. The ticker tape will stay tightly wound. The confetti won't get thrown and the marching bands will save their energy and their songs for Christmas parades. There will be speeches and praise, kind words and kudos -- and there will undoubtedly be families overjoyed to be together to celebrate the holidays -- even if they have to celebrate a week or two late. But the day the Iraq war ended won't be noted on future calendars because the rightness of our involvement in that country still has yet to be determined. After nine years of Iraqis looking to us to decide their future, the future perception of America's presence there now rests almost entirely with the Iraqis. If their country is better for our sacrifices, history will look kindly on our efforts. But if Iraq falls apart, the time and treasure we spent there -- both monetary and human -- will likely be seen as wasted. So, though I'm glad to not have that Iraq baggage in my family, I worry now for all my friends who do. It is a horrible thing to have given tremendously to a cause that others do not respect. Our nation's mission in Iraq will end this month with full flights of weary soldiers and thousands of tons of gear. Those who make up the last of America's fighting force there will come home, unpack and sleep off some of their exhaustion, and then they'll put their uniforms back on and go right back to work on their military bases. It will seem, in many ways, like a war that never happened -- a nearly nine-year-long bad dream. I hope that, going forward, Americans will keep in mind that the men and women who served in Iraq did so honorably and nobly and that they and their families sacrificed greatly for our nation. They deserve the gratitude of the nation that sent them -- again and again and again -- to war. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebekah Sanderlin.","Rebekah Sanderlin: To many Americans, Afghanistan is the ""good"" war, as opposed to Iraq .

"Rome (CNN) -- An Italian sex scandal that spawned nationwide demonstrations over the premier's alleged abuse of power and paying an underage girl for sex began at a dinner party in Milan with a Moroccan-born dancer nicknamed ""Ruby Heartbreaker."" The dancer -- Karima El Mahrough -- was 17 years old at the time of the alleged sexual encounter with Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, according to prosecutors in Milan. The leggy performer -- who has since appeared in scantily clad photographs across the country -- told the Italian news channel Sky TG24 that she had lied about her age before meeting Berlusconi for a dinner party at his private residence near Milan. ""He knew that I was 24 years old because I told everyone that I was 24 years old,"" she said. ""I didn't want people to know that I was a minor."" It was during that first encounter on Valentine's Day in 2010 that El Mahrough said she received 7,000 euros (about $9,300) after a friend informed Berlusconi that she needed help. Both have denied allegations of having sex. ""Absolutely no,"" said El Mahrough. ""I just arrived in Milan and it was a little difficult living there,"" claiming Berlusconi gave her the money to help support herself financially. The friend ""spoke with (Berlusconi) and explained my situation, my story, my family situation,"" she said. ""And he helped me."" But an investigation into their relationship burgeoned after the prime minister later urged police to release her after she was arrested on theft charges. El Mahrough said that following the arrest she was visited by dancer Michelle Oliveira and regional lawmaker Nicole Minetti, whom prosecutors have tried to link to the allegations against the prime minister. El Mahrough said Minetti then called Berlusconi ""to explain how things went,"" handing her the phone ""so that I could thank him."" In their conversation El Mahrough described the premier as ""bitter"" because ""he had allowed someone to enter his house trustingly."" ""I didn't know about this famous call of the premier to the police,"" El Mahrough told Sky TG24. ""I learned it from the newspapers."" Investigators say they later questioned the dancer's former roommate, who claimed El Mahrough had confided in her, describing the details of her sexual relationship with the Italian premier. Berlusconi, 74, denied allegations surrounding his relationship with El Mahrough as well as his alleged abuses of power, arguing that his phone call to police was a case of mistaken identity. His party has argued that Berlusconi believed El Mahrough was a relative of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and that he called the police station on her behalf to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt. But little is known about the dancer whose involvement in the scandal helped catalyze demonstrations against Italy's premier and his penchant for dinner parties attended by ""pretty girls,"" according to local media reports and accounts by lawmaker Minetti. El Mahrough reportedly told Italian talk show ""Kalispera"" -- owned by Berlusconi -- that she was a victim of child abuse and became a runaway before landing a job dancing at nightclubs. The scandal has made El Mahrough, now 18, a national figure. Meanwhile, Berlusconi has been ordered to stand trial in April where he will face a three-judge panel. All of them are women.

"(CNN) -- A California woman was indicted late Wednesday on charges of sending money to Pakistan to help fund terrorist attacks against U.S. military personnel, federal officials said. Oytun Ayse Mihalik, 39, of La Palma was charged with three counts of giving money to someone in Pakistan who knew the funds would be used to prepare and carry out attacks against American troops, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles said in a statement. Mihalik, a native of Turkey, was accused of sending $2,050 in three wire transfers to a person in Pakistan over a period of three weeks in late 2010 and early 2011, the statement said. Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the attorney's office, would not comment on the identity of the person in Pakistan. A telephone message left late Wednesday by CNN for Mihalik's attorney, Alan Eisner, was not immediately returned. Mihalik has been in U.S. custody since August 27, 2011, after she was detained at Los Angeles International Airport where she was preparing to board a flight to Turkey, the statement said. She had a one-way ticket, it said. Federal authorities say they first questioned Mihalik on August 8 at the airport where she had just arrived from a six-month trip to Turkey. At that time, they allege she lied to agents, saying she had never used an alias to send money via Western Union to a person overseas, authorities said. It was unclear how authorities linked Mihalik to the alleged payments, and they did not say how they identified her alleged use of an alias. Mihalik was initially indicted on August 30 on one count of making a false statement. A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment Wednesday, charging Mihalik with three counts of providing material support to terrorists and one count of making a false statement. The charge of providing material support to terrorists carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison; the charge of making a false statement in a matter involving international terrorism carries a maximum penalty of eight years. An arraignment date has not yet been set. A trial on the initial count of making a false statement was previously scheduled for February 14.","A federal grand jury indicts a California woman for allegedly funding terrorist activities .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A series of explosions in western Pakistan killed four people Sunday, including a young boy, authorities said. Fourteen others were wounded. A blast in Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province left three members of the country's security forces dead, and two more wounded, military and police officials said. The victims were part of a convoy escorting civilians through the Zain Koh area of Dera Bugti, said Ghulam Muhammad Baloch, a police official. Nine people were wounded when militants lobbed a hand grenade at a shop in the provincial capital of Quetta, speeding away from the blast. No deaths were reported in the attack, but one person was in critical condition, said Nazir Kurd, another police official. The attacks came just two days after an explosion outside the home of a former lawmaker in Quetta killed 13 people. Also Sunday, a 7-year-old boy died in a roadside bombing in Pakistan's tribal Bajaur agency, said Islam Zeb, a government official. Three others were wounded in that attack. Journalists Wajahat S.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Demonstrators clashed with police outside the Interior Ministry in Cairo on Sunday as anger mounts over a deadly stampede at a soccer match that killed dozens last week. Protesters outside the ministry threw rocks at police, who responded with tear gas. Fires erupted at a nearby shopping center while more than 200 women demonstrated outside parliament, chanting anti-military slogans and demanding control of the country be handed over to civilian power. Protests have rocked Egypt's capital since a riot erupted at a soccer match in Port Said city Wednesday, killing more than 80. Rival fans battled with rocks and chairs, with a crush of bodies suffocating as crowds attempted to flee and found their escape blocked by a locked steel gate, survivors said. After the riots, throngs of angry protesters rallied in the streets across Egypt, demanding that the military-led government make reforms and improve security. ""Egypt is facing a dangerous situation that is not simple to deal with,"" Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Ahmed Gamal El Din said in a statement Sunday. More than 200 security forces have been injured as clashes broke out nationwide, he said. In Suez, some fired at police with machine guns, he said. Prisoners were at large after attacks on police stations. At least 40 protesters have been arrested nationwide. Every time ""we advance and things start settling, something happens,"" he said. But some protesters argued that police were behind the violence, firing on protesters with gas and live ammunition to retaliate. ""They are spreading false slogans to kill the revolution,"" said a statement from the Egyptian Revolutionary Alliance, a bloc of secular and democratic opposition groups. The alliance staged a protest outside the general prosecutor's office Sunday, calling for his removal from the post and accusing of him of negligence in trials of former President Hosni Mubarak and his aides. Meanwhile, the co-founder of the April 6 Youth Movement who was a major participant in the protests to topple Hosni Mubarak was hospitalized Saturday with a skull fracture, according to a friend. Ahmed Maher was hit in the head with a heavy object while trying to negotiate an end to the latest protests outside the tax ministry, said Waleed Rashed, the co-founder of the youth group. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for his injury. CNN could not immediately confirm Rashed's claim. The military-led government has said that the country is undergoing a ""sensitive and difficult time that is considered the most dangerous"" and crucial to the nation's history. ""The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has always reiterated to the military forces that peaceful protests are a right to all people to state their demands,"" it said in a recent statement.","Official: ""Egypt is facing a dangerous situation that is not simple to deal with""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan was abuzz Friday with political rumor and intrigue about the possibility of a looming clash between elected leaders and the military after Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said he believed plots were under way to topple the government. ""Government, Army on collision course,"" read the headline of the main story on the website of Dawn, a leading English-language newspaper in Pakistan. ""Gilani takes army head on,"" said the top article on the website of The Nation, another major daily. The papers appeared to be interpreting Gilani's comments Thursday, in which he said there were ""conspiracies and intrigues being hatched to pack up the elected government,"" as an implicit attack on Pakistan's powerful military, which has seized power from civilian authorities a number of times in the country's history. Gilani said Thursday that no institution ""can be a state within a state"" and that ""every ministry, including the Ministry of Defense, is answerable to the Parliament of Pakistan."" The Pakistani military denied Gilani's claims Friday, issuing a statement saying the ""Army has and will continue to support democratic process in the country."" Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, chief of army staff, ""dispelled the speculations of any military takeover and said that these are misleading and are being used as a bogey to divert the focus from the real issues,"" the military statement said. Gilani's provocative statements come amid a turbulent period in Pakistan's domestic politics and in its relations with the United States. There is widespread controversy in Pakistan over a scandal -- dubbed ""Memogate"" -- in which Pakistan's civilian leaders were supposedly coming up with a plan to unseat the country's military leadership. The killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. Navy Seals in May during a raid on a compound located only about a mile from the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad enraged the Pakistani public and deeply embarrassed the military. Relations became even more strained in November, after NATO forces killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers in airstrikes near the Afghan border -- an attack the United States insists was an act of self-defense after troops were fired upon. Amid heavy domestic pressure in Pakistan, President Asif Ali Zardari's government made decisions unpopular with the United States, such as stopping the transport of NATO supplies through Pakistan and asking the U.S. military to vacate the Shamsi air base. The Memogate scandal has emboldened Zardari's opponents, who think he favors closer ties with the U.S. military. Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to the United States who resigned in November, is accused of writing a memo setting out the scheme. The plot reportedly called for taking power away from the country's senior military and intelligence leaders, requesting U.S. assistance in stopping a military coup, asking for American backing of the Zardari government, and vowing to make Pakistan's foreign policy favorable to the United States. Haqqani says he didn't write the memo, which allegedly was passed along to U.S. officials by Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz days after a U.S. military raid killed bin Laden in May. Following petitions filed by different people -- including Nawaz Sharif, the head of the major opposition party -- the Supreme Court of Pakistan has been investigating the Memogate scandal for a couple of weeks. Complicating matters further, Zardari traveled to Dubai for medical reasons earlier this month, fueling speculation in Pakistan that the embattled leader may resign. Zardari has since returned to Pakistan. CNN's Shaan Kahn and Jethro Mullen, and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: Military denies prime minister's claim of a plot .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt opens the third round of voting for the lower house of Parliament on Tuesday after Islamist parties performed strongly in the previous rounds last month. The vote is the latest step in a tense and complex process meant to move Egypt toward a more representative form of government after the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak in February . The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has led Egypt's government since Mubarak's fall. It has said it will hand over power to a new government once one is in place. But the transition has not been quick or transparent enough for some Egyptians. A series of protests in Cairo last month resulted in violent and sometimes deadly clashes between demonstrators and the country's armed forces. The unrest appeared to have largely stemmed from a stretch of assaults by police and defiant protests by demonstrators demanding that Egypt's ruling military cede power to a civilian government. The authorities have also cracked down on rights groups. The police last month conducted raids on nongovernmental organizations across the country, including U.S. groups that promote democratic institutions and had delegations observing the parliamentary elections. Egyptian authorities agreed to halt the raids and return all equipment and documents seized after protests from Washington, which provides more than $1 billion per year in military aid to Egypt. And international election observers are continuing their operations. The former U.S. president Jimmy Carter will visit Egypt next week to participate in the witnessing of the elections, the Carter Center said in a statement Monday. He will join a delegation of 40 witnesses from 21 countries based in Egypt since mid-November to witness the three phases of voting, according to the center. The relatively moderate Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party last month won more than 4 million votes in the runoff for the second round of the process. The conservative Al Noor Salafi Party won more than 3 million. The secular Egyptian bloc won 785,000. The second round of voting covered the regions of Giza, Luxor, Aswan and Ismailia regions, which have historically favored conservative Muslim candidates. More than 11 million voters participated. Islamists claimed victory in the first round of elections in other parts of the country that took place earlier in December. Final results for the lower house are expected to be announced January 12. Meanwhile, the ruling military council brought forward the scheduled elections for the upper house of Parliament by nearly three weeks, with voting now scheduled to start in late January, the state news agency MENA reported Sunday. Balloting will be held in two stages instead of three, first on January 29-30 and then on February 14-15, MENA said, citing a decree from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. If necessary, runoffs would be held on February 7 and 22, with a goal of having winners seated by February 28.","Islamist parties did well in the two previous rounds of voting .

"(CNN) -- Iraq agreed to temporarily relocate members of an Iranian opposition group, considered a terrorist organization by the United States, while a U.N. refugee agency begins efforts to resettle the exiles, the United Nations announced on its website Monday. Under the U.N. agreement, Iraq will relocate the residents of Camp Ashraf, also known as New Camp Iraq -- the home of the opposition group Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK -- to a temporary camp. There, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees will begin efforts to resettle the group outside of the country, the statement said. The Iraqi government has said it will close the camp by December 31, and without a U.N. agreement there were no clear assurances the exiles would be protected against attacks by Iraqi forces, or reprisals from neighboring Iran. Iran and the United States consider the MEK a terrorist organization. It has been on the U.S. terrorism list since 1997 because of the killing of six Americans in Iran in the 1970s and an attempted attack against the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. A memorandum of understanding between the U.N. and Iraq was signed Sunday, the same day that the Iranian exiles claimed in a statement that two rockets struck their camp in northeastern Iraq. ""I want to make it very clear that this memorandum of understanding is about voluntary relocation and its implementation is based firmly on all sides acting peacefully and in good faith,"" said Martin Kobler, special representative of the U.N.'s secretary-general and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). Kobler, who signed the agreement, also called on member nations to accept the Iranian exiles in to their countries. The agreement includes ""a clear commitment from the Government of Iraq to ensure the safety and security of the residents at the new location,"" according to the U.N. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton welcomed the agreement, calling it a viable solution and urged the Iranian group to accept it. ""To be successful, this resettlement must also have the full support of the camp's residents, and we urge them to work with the U.N. to implement this relocation,"" Clinton said in a statement released late Sunday. ""All those who want to see the people at Camp Ashraf safe and secure should work together to see that the agreed upon plan is carried out."" Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the National Council of Resistance of Iran, the political coalition that includes MEK, said the group was waiting to see an official document from the United Nations regarding Camp Ashraf. ""We hope that it would officially include the minimum assurances so that it would be acceptable to Ashraf residents,"" Gobadi said. ""Ashraf residents had repeatedly emphasized that they would in no way accept forcible relocation."" Gobadi said his group welcomed Clinton's statement. ""But we reject and consider unacceptable anything contrary to her statement,"" he said. The agreement also calls for UNHCR to immediately deploy a team to the temporary camp and provide ""around the clock monitoring"" of the group until it is resettled outside of Iraq, the U.N. said. Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after Saddam Hussein invited members of the MEK to relocate to Iraq in an effort to undermine the Iranian government, which was at war with Iraq. Since 2004, the United States has considered the residents of Camp Ashraf ""noncombatants"" and ""protected persons"" under the Geneva Conventions, though the group remains on the U.S. terror list. A U.N. commission on refugees has described the residents as ""formal asylum seekers"" against persecution by the regime in Iran. The group believes the current regime in Iraq, under orders from Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, has twice staged deadly attacks against the camp that resulted in the deaths of almost 50 people. More than 3,000 exiles, described as Iranian resistance figures and their sympathizers, live at the camp. Under the plan, the Camp Ashraf residents will be moved to a camp near the Baghdad International Airport. The facility will remain open for an unspecified period of time, though a senior U.S. administration official said last week that there were plans to keep it open until all of the camp residents were resettled.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Pakistan continues to support the Taliban in Afghanistan, a secret NATO report says, according to a journalist who has read it, despite years of Pakistani denials and American pressure to stop backing the insurgency. Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence agency knows the whereabouts of all senior Taliban commanders, Times of London reporter Jerome Starkey said Wednesday, citing the report. Pakistan dismissed the accusation that it is helping the Taliban across the border. ""We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan,"" Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Abdul Basit said Wednesday. ""This is frivolous, to put it mildly."" He added, ""Pakistan has suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much cognizant of this."" NATO downplayed the importance of the document. The classified report is based on the ""opinions or ideals"" of Taliban detainees, and represented only their opinions, not the actual progress of NATO against the Taliban, International Security Assistance Force spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie E. Cummings said. The document says the Taliban depend on Pakistan for support, even though they do not necessarily welcome it, Starkey said. ""It is a marriage of convenience,"" he said. The Taliban see Pakistan as manipulative, but they see no alternative to accepting its support, he said. The Taliban are absolutely confident of victory, he said the report found, based on 27,000 interviews with more than 4,000 detainees ranging from senior Taliban commanders to Afghan civilians. They also include mid- and low-level Taliban, al Qaeda, and foreign fighters, he said. CNN has not seen the document, but has been told by ISAF that reports of its contents are for the most part accurate. ISAF spokesman Cummings said Wednesday not to read too much into it. He said it was ""extremely important not to draw conclusions based on Taliban comments or musings"" and that the report ""should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress"" against the insurgency. A military official in Kabul said such reports have been done for ""several years"" and it was not written by military personnel. And a NATO official noted that the ""Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan has suffered dramatic losses of leadership and resources,"" insisting that ""Taliban momentum has been significantly reversed."" Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby said the report, called ""State of the Taliban 2012,"" is the product of thousands of interviews with Taliban detainees in 2011. ""It's not just a rough transcript, but there's been no analysis applied to it,"" he said. The report was compiled over the course of a year, ""and a lot of things changed during the year. 2011 was a tough year for the Taliban,"" Kirby said. Top U.S. officials have repeatedly suggested the Afghan insurgency gets support from Pakistan. Adm. Mike Mullen testified in September that the Taliban and the Haqqani network, another militant group, had safe havens in Pakistan that they used to launch cross-border attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. ""Because of providing that safe haven, because of connections between Pakistan intelligence and the Haqqanis, Pakistan bears some responsibility for the attacks on us,"" said Mullen, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that it was an important U.S. aim to have ""a positive relationship with Pakistan,"" but said: ""In order for there to be a normal relationship between our two countries it is imperative that Pakistan actively break its ties with the militant extremists using their soil against us."" A month later, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton threw down a gauntlet to Pakistan as she prepared to travel there from Afghanistan. ""Our message is very clear: We're going to be fighting, we're going to be talking, we're going to be building,"" she said. ""And they can either be helping or hindering. But we are not going to stop our efforts to create a strong foundation for an Afghanistan free from interference, violent conflict and one that has a chance to chart its own future."" Relations between the United States and Pakistan -- complicated at the best of times -- have been especially tense in the past year. Islamabad was angered when American special operations forces killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in a cross-border raid into Pakistan, and furious at the killing of 24 Pakistani troops in a November NATO strike which the coalition called a case of mistaken identity. Wednesday's leaked report is consistent with the latest American intelligence analysis of the Taliban. The U.S. intelligence community said Tuesday that Afghanistan's insurgents remain ""resilient"" and senior Taliban leaders ""enjoy safe haven in Pakistan."" The annual threat assessment compiled by all the various American intelligence agencies said Taliban-led insurgents have ""lost ground in some areas,"" but mainly where NATO-led ""surge forces are concentrated."" A U.S. official told CNN the ISAF report includes a summary of comments from ""some of the most motivated and ruthless insurgents that are trying to boost insurgent morale."" ""Some of the stuff there you couldn't even deem 'intel.' It's just comments,"" said the official, referring to intelligence. Starkey, the Times journalist, said the report said it should be treated as informational and not necessarily analytical. The official described the report as ""relatively new"" and ""an internal document for our use that's not meant to be distributed."" The official, who is not authorized to discuss contents of the report on the record with the media and asked not to be named, emphasized that it did not represent the opinions of ISAF. The official declined to say whether the report was seen by top NATO commanders, including the ISAF commander, Gen. John Allen. The leak comes as Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government appears to be moving slowly toward talks with the Taliban. Karzai's government recently dropped its opposition to the Taliban establishing an office in the Gulf state of Qatar to facilitate talks. And it may be opening a separate channel to talk to the insurgency. The Afghan government hopes to hold talks with Taliban representatives in Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks, a senior Afghan official said Tuesday, in a move that threatens to cloud already fragile steps to negotiate an end to the United States' longest war. The senior official, speaking anonymously as he was discussing sensitive diplomatic issues, said there were plans for a meeting between insurgents and Afghan officials in Saudi Arabia. Yet, he added, the plans were at such an early stage that it was not clear who -- including American officials -- would attend or when any talks would be held. The United States has acknowledged that it has held discussions about the opening of a Taliban office in Doha, Qatar, as well as the possibility of transferring some Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay as part of American support for Afghan reconciliation efforts.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Embattled Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari met with Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani -- a sign that, some say, shows tensions between Pakistan's civilian and military leadership are cooling down. The two met on Saturday to discuss the ""current security situation,"" presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar told CNN. A second meeting between civilian and military leadership took place afterward, as Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani convened the Cabinet's defense committee. The meetings come one day after Pakistani and British official denied a report that Pakistani prime minister contacted the British High Commission to express fears that a military coup was imminent in his country. Officials from both countries said such a call never took place. Saturday's meeting signaled an easing of tensions between the military and the president, said retired Brig. Mehmoud Shah. ""It's a good beginning to soothe the tension that's gripping the country,"" said Shah, a military analyst. ""It shows the two sides are prepared to talk and want the democratic system to move forward."" During the prime minister's meeting with leaders, he stressed that Pakistan's sovereignty is non-negotiable, according to a news release. ""We would reject any approach that would tend to compromise our sovereignty, honor and national dignity,"" Gilani said. ""Our contribution and steadfast commitment to stability and peace at home and in our region is unquestionable and second to none. "" For Pakistan, there is a need for national unity, especially between the military and the civilian government, he said. ""Together in complete harmony with each other and other vital institutions we can change the country's destiny and accord, its rightful place in the comity of nations,"" he said. Military officials did not immediately comment on the meetings and their outcomes. The military and the government have been locked in a tense standoff after an alleged secret effort by the government last year to ward off a possible military coup by curbing the army's power with Washington's help. The government denied the accusation but the Supreme Court is investigating the scandal and its findings could threaten President Zardari and his ruling party. A series of events have also added to the furor. The U.S. killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden during a May raid on a compound located only about a mile from the Pakistan Military Academy in Abbottabad enraged the Pakistani public and deeply embarrassed the military. Relations became even more strained in November, after NATO forces said they mistakenly killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers in airstrikes near the Afghan border -- an attack the United States insists was an act of self-defense after its troops were fired upon. Pakistan's government has formally disputed the findings of the U.S. investigation into the airstrike, saying the bombardment went on long after it reported its troops were under fire. And the United States launched its first drone attack in Pakistan Tuesday after more than a month-long lull, killing at least four suspected militants.

"(CNN) -- Rick Perry's decision to pull out of the Republican primary before the South Carolina vote on Saturday could provide just the boost that Newt Gingrich, or even Rick Santorum, needs to edge out Mitt Romney. Should this happen, would it be bad for the former Massachusetts governor? In the long run, it might actually help him. Let me explain. If Romney were to win the South Carolina primary, it's hard to imagine him losing in Florida 10 days later. The bandwagon effect, where voters gravitate to the candidate they think will probably win, will go into overdrive. It already gave Romney a huge push after Iowa and New Hampshire although Santorum is claiming victory in Iowa after new numbers have come in. Romney, nevertheless, is favored to win nearly all of the Republican primaries or caucuses that will be held in February, beginning with Nevada, where Mormon voters made up 25% of caucus participants in 2008. So, even though a very small percentage of the delegates to Republican National Convention will have been allocated, the GOP primary could be all but over by early February, and we could embark on one of the longest general election campaigns in history. The Romney campaign would surely be happy at this development, but a quick end to the competitive phase of the Republican primary contest may not be in the candidate's best interests. When a sitting president is running for re-election, it is at least partially a referendum on the incumbent. This is clearly what the Republicans want. But a short Republican primary gives the Obama team much more of an opportunity to convert this into a referendum on their opponent. Party primaries can be divisive and expensive, but they offer distractions that keep the campaigns, the public and the media from being able to focus solely on one candidate. A perfect example was provided four years ago. Republicans often complain that candidate Barack Obama was not properly vetted by the media during the 2008 campaign. Until June of that year, however, Obama was only part of the story. In the days leading up to the 2008 New Hampshire primary, the public's attention was riveted not on Obama and his qualifications for the presidency, but on his rival Hillary Clinton tearing up at a campaign appearance in Portsmouth. Obama also benefited from the media's fascination with Bill Clinton. One can even argue that conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh's ""operation chaos"" campaign, in which he encouraged listeners to vote for Hillary Clinton to lengthen the Democratic primary fight, actually benefited Obama. It may seem surprising that Romney's dealings at Bain Capital only recently became a campaign issue. After all, he has been an official candidate for president since June. But Romney has been protected not only by all the primary opponents, but also by volatile polls. One after another, a challenger has soared up in popularity. Romney was the presumed front-runner from Day One, so when someone else appeared to be competitive, it became a story. Then, of course, came the media scrutiny of each of these challengers. The result: Stories about Michele Bachmann's church; Rick Perry's decision to support mandated Gardasil vaccines; allegations of sexual harassment on the part of Herman Cain; Newt Gingrich's work for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and Rick Santorum's views on contraception. It is not that Romney was ignored, but he was forced to share the spotlight. Every candidate has some weakness. The success of a campaign will often depend upon how well a candidate is able to deflect attacks. Although primary opponents are likely to point out these flaws, their criticism is usually more muted than that from another party. And the longer a candidate can avoid being attacked full on, the better. Republicans candidates are scuffling among themselves, but they all want Obama out of the White House. Whether they are on the campaign trail or in a debate, none misses an opportunity to go after Obama. Obama is in the position of a dazed boxer. He keeps getting punched but has four opponents he needs to hit back. The longer the Republican primary goes on, the longer each candidate avoids suffering too many direct and powerful blows. Although I doubt that the Romney campaign staff would agree, in the end, a Gingrich victory in South Carolina might be the best thing that can happen to him.

"(CNN) -- The Pakistani government has released from a Karachi, Pakistan, jail 179 Indian fishermen imprisoned for violating territorial waters, officials said Saturday. The fishermen, some of whom had been imprisoned as long as a year, had sailed into Pakistani waters apparently by mistake. They will be transported from Karachi to Lahore, where they will be allowed to cross the border into India, said Aslam Nasir Zahid, a member of the Pakistani-India joint judicial committee, a nongovernmental organization working to investigate the imprisonment of civilians in India and Pakistan. Nearly 300 fishermen remain in Pakistani jails, according to Zahid, and 480 boats are in Pakistani custody. Fishermen from the contentious neighboring countries routinely cross into territorial waters and are routinely arrested and held in jail -- many times without trial. Reacting to the release of the Indian fishermen by the government of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Shah, the head of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum told CNN affiliate GEO news that there are still 41 Pakistani fishermen being held in Indian jails and ""these innocent men have been in Indian prisons for close to 15 years.""","179 fishermen are released after apparently straying into Pakistani waters .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish officials engaged in last-minute shuttle diplomacy with their restive neighbor Syria and repeated calls for restraint ahead of what is expected to be another violent day of protests across the Arab nation on Friday. Turkey's National Security Council met on Thursday in Ankara to specifically address the increasingly bloody crisis, which some analysts fear could spill over to the Turkish side of the border. The council issued a statement calling for Syrian security forces to act with restraint and for the government to implement swift reforms to satisfy demonstrators. ""It is important that necessary steps are taken rapidly and in a determined way in order to establish social peace and stability in brotherly, friendly Syria, to put an end to the violence and to maintain security of life, basic rights and freedoms,"" the council announced. Also, the head of Turkey's national intelligence agency, the MIT, traveled to Damascus on Thursday for high-level talks. The wave of unrest that has swept across the Arab world this year surprised the Turkish government as it was dramatically expanding ties with its Arab neighbors. Syria has perhaps been the greatest beneficiary of what the Turkish government calls its ""Zero Problems"" foreign policy initiative with Turkey's neighbors. In the late 1990s, Syria and Turkey were on the brink of war because of Syrian support for Kurdish rebels battling the Turkish state. But in recent years, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have become close political allies. The two leaders have vacationed together with their wives along the Turkish coast.  And last year, Erdogan lifted visa restrictions on Syrian visitors and announced Syrians should treat Turkey as their ""second home."" When pro-democracy protests erupted in Egypt, Erdogan was swift to call for embattled Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to listen to the voices of his people and step down. But Erdogan has been much more restrained about criticizing al-Assad, even as Syrian tanks encircled the rebellious southern town of Daraa and more than 400 demonstrators were killed across the country in the growing government crackdown. ""Turkey has to reckon that in some cases of the Arab Spring, it just may be on the wrong side of history,"" wrote Turkey expert Henri Barkey, in an article released this week by the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. ""As much as Turkey thought it was on the side of change, it has become a status quo power ... with its own vested interests, commercial concerns, and close ties with regimes."" As the death toll mounts in Syria, a growing number of voices in Turkish newspapers normally sympathetic to the Erdogan government have been calling for Turkey to re-evaluate its cozy relationship with the Assad regime. ""'Zero problems' with neighbors who know how to kill,"" wrote Yavuz Baydar in the pro-government Today's Zaman newspaper this week. ""Ankara should not resort to double standards when it comes to autocratic regimes in the Middle East killing their own people,"" wrote columnist Lale Kemal in the same newspaper. Turkey has also come under fire in Libya from rebels who have accused Ankara of supporting the Moammar Gadhafi regime in Tripoli. Last year, Erdogan received a human rights prize from Gadhafi, and earlier this month, the Libyan opposition movement refused to allow a Turkish ship to dock in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Demonstrators also staged a protest outside the Turkish Consulate in Benghazi. The escalating Syrian conflict may not only embarrass the Turkish government; some analysts warn it could destabilize Turkey. Experts point to Saddam Hussein's crackdown on rebellious Kurds in northern Iraq in 1991, which resulted in a flood of refugees spilling over the Turkish border. Over the past two years, much smaller numbers of refugees fled to Turkey to escape the crushing of pro-democracy protests in Iran -- another authoritarian neighbor that enjoys booming economic ties with Turkey. So far, Turkish officials say they have not seen an increase in the number of Syrians fleeing government persecution. But officials are clearly worried about this possibility. ""You have to think of all kinds of scenarios,"" said Selim Yenel, undersecretary of Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a phone interview with CNN. ""People have asked if we are our reassessing our visa policy [with Syria].  And we're not,"" Yenel said. Instead, Yenel said Turkey's intelligence chief traveled to Damascus on Thursday leading a delegation that is offering to advise the Assad regime on how to implement reforms aimed at satisfying the growing protest movement. ""They were going to talk about public administration, how to reform it economically and politically,"" Yenel said. ""All this has to be done as quickly as possible so people can feel the changes.""","The Arab unrest surprised the Turkish government .

"London, England (CNN) -- A scheduled meeting between Pakistani cricket authorities and three of their country's national players over an alleged betting scandal has been postponed for a day, the team manager told CNN on Wednesday. The meeting will take place Thursday morning at the Pakistani High Commission in London, team manager Yawar Saeed said. He gave no reason for the change. The players -- Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Amir -- were due to head to London on Wednesday morning from Taunton, England, where their squad is preparing for a match against the local team, Somerset, Saeed said. The three players are at the center of the betting allegations, which emerged Sunday in a British tabloid. They and Saeed were already questioned by London's Metropolitan Police over the scandal, he said earlier this week. The newspaper, the News of the World, reported that two Pakistan players deliberately bowled ""no balls,"" or fouls, during their test series with England in London last week. It said the alleged ringleader made 150,000 pounds ($232,800) in the scam. England won the match at Lord's Cricket Ground. It ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke. A 35-year-old man was arrested late Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers and released on bail Sunday, Met Police said. They said no date had been set for a hearing or further proceedings, but that the investigation was continuing. Three people were also arrested Sunday in connection with the scandal and held on suspicion of money-laundering, a representative of HM Revenue and Customs told CNN. The head of cricket's world governing body said Tuesday he wants prompt disciplinary action if anyone on the Pakistan team was involved in the alleged betting scheme. ""The integrity of the game is of paramount importance,"" said Haroon Lorgat, chief executive of the International Cricket Council. ""Prompt and decisive action will be taken against those who seek to harm it. However, the facts must first be established through a thorough investigation and it is important to respect the right of due process when addressing serious allegations of this sort."" Investigators from the cricket council are already in the United Kingdom making inquiries into the allegations, the council said Tuesday. They are working with the Met Police on the criminal investigation, according to the council. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari ordered an investigation into the scandal, his spokesman said Sunday.

"Rabat, Morocco (CNN) -- Morocco's Interior Ministry said Thursday that three Moroccan suspects loyal to al Qaeda have been arrested in connection with last month's bombing at a popular Marrakech cafe, the official Maghreb Arabe Presse news agency reported. One of the suspects was described in the Interior Ministry statement as the main figure in the April 28 bombing that killed 16 people and injured 21, according to the MAP report. The ministry statement described the bombing as a terrorist attack. The bombing occurred around 11 a.m. at Cafe Argana in Marrakech's old city, which is designated by the United Nations' cultural arm as a World Heritage Site. Tourists flock to the old city this time of the year, and it is usually packed with stalls, storytellers and snake-charmers. World leaders, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, condemned the bombing. ""The individuals were absorbed by jihadist ideology, and had allegiance to al Qaeda and had already made several attempts to join some of the hotbeds of tension, especially Chechnya and Iraq, before deciding to carry out terror in the homeland,"" the ministry statement said, according to MAP. The suspects learned on the Internet how to make the two remote-detonated explosive devices used in the bombing, the ministry statement said. The attackers chose Cafe Argana as the target because of its popularity, and dressed as tourists to access the area, the statement said. A preliminary investigation found remnants of explosive materials and tools ""that had been discarded after the terrorist act,"" according to the statement. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat, Salma Abdelaziz and journalist Martin Jay contributed to this report .","The Interior Ministry says the suspects are Moroccan .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Explosions erupted in Tripoli for a second consecutive night Wednesday into Thursday morning as NATO jets struck a vocational secondary school, a Libyan government official said. ""We're not in a position to independently confirm that allegation,"" a NATO official said. The attacks got under way hours after a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged that the United States is providing munitions for allies to use in the air campaign against Libya. ""We have provided material support, including munitions, to allies and partners engaged in operations in Libya,"" Col. Dave Lapan said in a statement. But, as President Barack Obama warned Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday that there would be ""no letup"" in NATO airstrikes, Russia lashed out against the air campaign, calling the bombing of certain Tripoli targets a ""flagrant deviation"" from the United Nations mandate. Obama makes the case for Western leadership . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Wednesday he had spoken with the Libyan prime minister and stressed the urgent need for a cease-fire. The U.N. chief said the special U.N. envoy for Libya, who has been in Benghazi meeting with the Libyan opposition, would return soon to Tripoli to try to secure an agreement. The war has dragged on for more than two months, with reports of horrific fighting and civilian casualties. The Russian Foreign Ministry alleged Wednesday that several ""non-military facilities in Tripoli that had already been bombed, were again attacked in a massive NATO airstrike, leading to civilian casualties."" It said in a written statement that ""this is yet another flagrant deviation"" from the U.N. Security Council resolution 1973. That resolution authorized all means necessary, short of occupying forces, to enforce a no-fly zone and protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to Gadhafi. A barrage of at least 18 rockets struck Tripoli Tuesday, killing 19 people and wounding another 150 in the heaviest onslaught since NATO's aerial strikes began, a government official told CNN. NATO said it had struck a government vehicle storage facility adjacent to Gadhafi's compound. The Russian ministry said NATO has justified its attacks by citing the need to protect civilians but said that it was ""impossible to deny the obvious fact that airstrikes are not stopping military confrontation between the warring Libyan sides, and are only causing additional suffering of peaceful Libyans."" It said the airstrikes are failing to end the Libyan conflict, which was triggered by protests in February and an ensuing crackdown by Gadhafi's forces. Russia, which has been critical of the airstrikes all along, has said normalization in Libya can come only from an immediate halt in military activities, the ministry said. Some have viewed the Libya campaign as a litmus test for relations between the alliance and Russia. The 28 members of NATO work with Russia as equal partners in the NATO-Russia Council, a group that works on a wide array of issues, including security. Obama, who met Wednesday in London with his British counterpart, David Cameron, increased pressure on Gadhafi by repeating that, ultimately, the embattled strongman must go. The mission to protect Libyans from their leader means making sure Gadhafi ""doesn't have capacity to send in a bunch of thugs to murder innocent civilians and threaten them,"" Obama said. ""I do think we have made enormous progress in Libya. We have saved lives. Gadhafi and his regime need to understand there will not be a letup in the pressure we are applying,"" Obama said. But he and Cameron said it will take time to reach a solution in the North African country, ruled with an iron fist by Gadhafi for 42 years. ""We may have to be more patient than people would like,"" Obama said of the apparent stalemate. In an effort to break the monthslong standoff, South Africa President Jacob Zuma plans to visit Tripoli next week for talks with Gadhafi, according to a statement on the South African leader's website. Zuma will meet Gadhafi Monday in ""his capacity as a member of the African Union high-level panel for the resolution of the conflict in Libya,"" the statement said. The panel also includes Uganda and Mauritania. It is the second such trip for Zuma, who was part of an African Union delegation that visited the nation last month. That visit, which included talks on a cease-fire, did not succeed. The Libyan government lashed out Wednesday at Obama and Cameron. ""It is illegal and illegitimate to speak about regime change under the pretext of protecting civilians,"" said a government official. ""It is up to the Libyan people to decide when and if Colonel Gadhafi should go -- not the U.S. and the U.K."" Russia's official RIA Novosti news agency reported that Gadhafi's government may ask Moscow to mediate the conflict. Meanwhile, in Tripoli, daily life has become more onerous. One woman said Wednesday that she had waited more than three days on line to get a half-tank of fuel for her car. The woman said that, while waiting in the line on Tuesday night, she saw a man a few cars ahead of her reach the fuel pump and present his number to a police officer, who rejected it as fraudulent. When the man protested, the police officer fatally shot him, she said. Witnesses torched a police car in retaliation, she said. Life outside the capital also appears precarious. The same woman said about three dozen Gadhafi soldiers on Saturday broke into her family's farm near Zwara -- just east of the Tunisian border -- and moved in. One of the soldiers told the farm caretaker they were taking over civilian properties to use as command posts and weapons storehouses because they feared being attacked by NATO if they were to use military facilities, said the woman, who asked not to be identified because she fears reprisal. A number of residents of the city of Yefren, about two hours southwest of Tripoli, had taken up residence in caves in order to avoid pro-Gadhafi forces, said an elderly man who cited safety concerns in declining to be identified. Nearby residents avoid seeking help from Yefren's hospital, he said. ""Any injured person who tries to enter the hospital is detained by the brigades,"" he said. ""We try to treat our wounded and give them first aid and protect them inside the mountain so they won't be killed or kidnapped by Gadhafi's brigades.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- From his Toyota Land Cruiser, Kent Alexander couldn't stop clicking his camera. Endless stretches of windswept sand clashed with the vibrant blues, reds and yellows of the billowing dresses of the women. Alexander, the general counsel for the humanitarian agency CARE, felt he was riding through pages of National Geographic magazine. The harshness of the terrain and its cruel consequences for the people of the Sahel became apparent when Alexander stopped and visited villages with a CARE delegation. He saw women walking three miles with pails to fetch water, diamond droplets in the drought-stricken land. In the Sahel, a region that runs south of the Sahara Desert across Africa from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, people are gaunt from eating just one meal a day, most of the time, millet. They are suffering from severe malnutrition and heading towards famine, the United Nations fears. Alexander has seen poverty before -- in 1989, he helped found Hands on Atlanta, which grew to become one of the world's largest community based volunteer organizations with more than half a million volunteers. But he'd never seen anything as abject as he did in Niger. On a five-hour drive from the capital, Niamey, to the town of Konni, Alexander listened to the audiobook, ""The Hunger Games,"" a novel that opens with the bleakness of a post-apocalyptic town called District 12. Niger felt like District 12 on steroids. ""I'd seen the poorest parts of Atlanta and it was stark,"" Alexander says, back in his fifth floor office at CARE USA. ""But the starkness in Niger doesn't compare."" The needy in Atlanta had solid housing. Fans. Refrigerators. Television sets. In Niger, there was nothing. No electricity. No plumbing. No food. The West African nation of 17 million people ranks second to last on a United Nations Human Development index. Alexander took the job with CARE about a year ago, after almost 11 years as Emory University's general counsel. A whole other world opened up for a man who'd made a successful living as a lawyer in Atlanta. At CARE, Alexander deals with employment to taxes to regulatory issues in the myriad nations where the agency works. He's traveled to India and the West African nations of Ivory Coast and Mali, before the coup in March. ""It's one thing to be a tourist, but another to be with an NGO,"" he says, using the commonly used acronym for a non-governmental organization. CARE has been working in Niger since 1974, when it first responded to famine. People there lead hardscrabble lives in the arid, landlocked nation where only 42 percent of the population have access to safe drinking water and only 15% of women can read or write. Niger is the worst country on earth in which to be a mother, according to a report by Save the Children. The charity's annual Mothers' Index uses statistics covering female and child health and nutrition, as well as prospects for women's education, economic prosperity and political participation in its assessment of 165 countries. CARE has been running several programs helping villagers to stand up on their own. Many focus on empowering women and girls through education and microlending. This year, life has been even tougher. ""Niger is again facing a crisis of a failed harvest because last season the rains did not come,"" says Ertharin Cousin, executive director of the World Food Program. ""Because the rains failed last season, what you're seeing is that the hungry poor, the most vulnerable populations, are now at the point where they have depleted their assets. And as a result, they have no food."" The food shortages are further aggravated by thousands of refugees fleeing fighting in northern Mali. More than 15 million people face hunger and starvation across the Sahel this year; 4 million in Niger, says the World Food Program. The thing about the Sahel, says Alexander, is that the crisis doesn't seem dire to people watching from afar. It's unlike the Horn of Africa food emergency, where women from Somalia walked 100 miles carrying children to reach a refugee camp in Kenya. Or where children were skull and bones with distended bellies. Where starving people died in front of cameras. ""The Sahel hasn't reached that point but it's moving in that direction,"" Alexander says. ""It's a slow train wreck in motion."" Here's the other thing, he says. If people donated small amounts of money now, there would not be a need for millions later to save lives. Villagers thanked Alexander and his colleagues for CARE's work in helping them with wells and plant gardens so they could grow vegetables instead of eating only grains every day. They spoke about the hunger in their bellies as matter-of-factly as an American would describe an ordinary day at work. In one of the villages, as Alexander saw dozens of children crowd behind the Land Cruiser. The tail gate was open and the driver was standing by a cooler containing leftover drinks from lunch earlier. ""Kent, this is the face of poverty,"" said Alexander's colleague, Philippe Leveque, director of CARE France. Alexander thought Leveque was overreacting. It was more than 100 degrees that day. Who wouldn't clamor for a cold drink? Then, he says, he took a closer look. The cooler was shut tight. The driver was not handing out drinks but empty cans and plastic bottles. The cans would turn into toy cars and planes; the bottles, receptacles for precious drops when the rains finally come months from now. ""Our trash was their treasure,"" Alexander says. In America, it's a good deed to recycle. In Niger, it was a gift. This was the face of poverty in the Sahel. It was a jolting lesson for Alexander. Alexander looks out the wall-to-wall windows in his office. Above, he sees clear, blue skies. In front of him, dormitory buildings of Georgia State University, architecturally dull and painted in drab colors. Yet, Alexander no longer sees them as unattractive. Everything seems relative. Across from his office, Trina Trice, a senior executive assistant, finishes a meager lunch of half a cup of black beans and a smidgen of frozen broccoli, every morsel cleaned off the bowl. All week, she has been surviving on $1.50 of food a day in a campaign aimed to help people understand what extreme poverty feels like. Trice says she has little energy. ""Last night I was so tired I didn't even eat dinner,"" she says, adding that she could not imagine having to walk for miles for water, especially in her weakened state. Alexander says it's the kind of insight that he hopes will help bridge what the United Nations calls an alarming lack of donations for the Sahel food crisis, especially because Niger is rarely on the evening news. He says it's hard for people, understandably, to fathom the scope of the crisis from far away. He is glad he was able to see the situation firsthand. It's been several weeks since Alexander returned home from what he called a profound trip. He's still unpacking, he says. He doesn't mean his suitcase.","Kent Alexander launched Hands on Atlanta in 1989 and had seen poverty before .

"(CNN) -- Russia's prime minister Vladimir Putin will not going to Zurich to help his country win the 2018 World Cup and has complained of ""unfair competition"" in the bidding process. Putin was expected to go to the Swiss city to put the case for Russia, but is sending his deputy Igor Shuvalov in his place. The Russian bid has gathered pace in the buildup to Thursday's vote to decide the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Putin was expected to join other political heavyweights like former U.S. president Bill Clinton and British prime minister David Cameron in last-minute lobbying of FIFA executive members. But in a speech broadcast on Russian television, Putin confirmed he would stay at home and also appeared to criticize corruption allegations made against executive members by British media organizations. Blog: Which countries will win the right to host World Cups ? ""I would like to note that recently we have watched with disappointment as an obvious campaign was being unleashed against members of the FIFA executive committee,"" he said. ""They are being dragged through the mud and compromised. I interpret this as unfair competition. We believe that such methods of competition are entirely unacceptable. ""Under these circumstances, I think it would be best not to go out of respect for the members of the FIFA executive committee, so that they could make their decision in peace and without any outside pressure."" The former Russian president said he had spoken with FIFA president Sepp Blatter on the telephone and put the case for his country to host the World Cup for the first time. ""The world football championship has never been held either in Russia, or anywhere else in eastern Europe,"" he said. ""Russia has both the will and the capabilities, including financial, to organize this major sport event."" Russia is competing against England and joint bids from Spain and Portugal and Netherlands and Belgium for the right to host in 2018. Australia, Japan, South Korea,Qatar and the United States are battling it out for the 2022 rights. The 22-man FIFA executive committee will make its decisions on Thursday.","Vladimir Putin will not be going to Zurich to back Russia's 2018 World Cup bid .

"(CNN) -- Two prisoners have confessed to digging a tunnel that led to the escape of 63 inmates last week, Yemen's state-run SABA news agency reported Sunday. Dozens of suspected al Qaeda militants escaped Wednesday from a jail in the Yemeni city of Mukalla, a senior security official said. An Interior Ministry official said 63 members of al Qaeda had managed to break out of Almakla prison, according to SABA. He said three inmates were killed, another two were arrested, and a prison guard was killed. He asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Some of the escapees had already been convicted; others were awaiting trial, the official told SABA. They escaped through a 35-meter (115-foot) tunnel, he said. Witnesses said armed militants began attacking the prison at about 8 a.m. and fired heavy artillery before the escape. The prison warden, his deputy and a number of guards have been suspended for questioning, SABA said Sunday. Mohammed Qahtan, spokesman for Yemen's largest opposition bloc, Joint Meetings Parties, said he thinks security officials loyal to the ruling family are responsible for the escape and that the government would create chaos to stay in power. Yemen has been consumed by unrest for months as protesters have demanded an end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Saleh and other senior officials were wounded June 3 in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace and taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment. Saleh was expected to make a public appearance within the next two days, presidential adviser Ahmed al-Soufi said Sunday afternoon. He wouldn't say whether Saleh would be making that appearance in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa or in Saudi Arabia, where he has been treated for his injuries. Al-Soufi added that Saleh still has ""light burn marks"" on his face, but denied some reports claiming the president's face had been disfigured by the attack. In recent days, the Yemeni government's control has been receding, said Christopher Boucek, an associate in the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""There are instances where you can say that the Yemeni government is instigating some of this chaos -- with the goal to demonstrate to the United States, Saudi Arabia and others that this regime -- the government of President Saleh -- is the best to fight al Qaeda."" Boucek said the Yemeni government is more concerned with protecting itself from the popular revolt than with going after al Qaeda. As a result, he said, the government has repositioned its counterterrorism forces, retreating from areas such as Abyan province where it had lost ground, and circling the wagons. However, a Yemeni official briefed on security operations rejected Boucek's conclusion. ""What about the blood of 66 soldiers?"" he said, citing the number of soldiers who he said have died in Abyan province alone in recent weeks. Another 291 soldiers have been wounded in operations there that killed six of the most wanted al Qaeda operatives and 40 other militants, he said. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country.

"Washington (CNN) -- The voice of embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi was heard on Libyan TV on Friday in an attempt to assure his people that he is alive and in a place where ""you cannot kill me."" The audio message was broadcast several times over the course of the day and expressed gratitude to people around the world who were concerned for his safety. ""Tell the crusader cowards that I live in a place you cannot reach me,"" Gadhafi said. Libya's combative leader also condemned Thursday's attack that reportedly killed three people. Gadhafi left this message to NATO: ""I live in the hearts of millions, and even if you kill my body, you cannot kill my soul that lives in the hearts of millions."" The audio message was released after the Italian foreign minister raised the possibility that the Libyan leader may have been injured after weeks of NATO airstrikes in the country. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he did not have any evidence as to Gadhafi's fate, but Monsignor Giovanni Martinelli, the Catholic archbishop of Tripoli, told him that Gadhafi was wounded, the Italian ANSA news agency reported. Martinelli said Gadhafi was most likely not in Tripoli anymore, Frattini said. However, Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said Friday that Ghadafi was in ""good health and high spirits"" in Tripoli. Four rockets struck Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound Thursday and killed at least three people, according to a Libyan government official. The Libyan government took journalists near the site of the blast, where smoke could be seen still rising from the compound. NATO military spokesman Mike Bracken said NATO had struck a command and control center but did not know whether anyone was inside. A top Libyan opposition leader urged formal U.S. recognition at the White House on Friday, one day after the interim council secured strong support from Britain. Mahmoud Jibril, president of the Libyan Transitional National Council's Executive Bureau, and his delegation met with top Obama administration officials. During the meeting, National Security Adviser Tom Donilon told the leader of the Libyan opposition group that the U.S. views the group ""as a legitimate and credible interlocutor of the Libyan people,"" according to a White House statement released after the Friday meeting. The statement stopped short of formal recognition of the Transitional National Council. In an interview on CNN's ""Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer"" on Thursday, Jibril said his main message to Donilon in Friday's meeting would be to clear up ""misperceptions"" about extreme elements in the opposition and ask for formal recognition. Officials have said there are no plans to recognize the council out of concern of alienating Libyans that are not part of that group. They do not anticipate recognizing any one group as the official group until there is an election in Libya, officials have said. ""Ultimately, of course, it will be the people of Libya, not the international community, who will choose their leadership."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday. ""But we do applaud the (council) for its commitment to a democratic future for Libya,"" Carney said. In talks Thursday with the council's chairman, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, British Prime Minister David Cameron invited the group to establish a formal office in London. Cameron said Britain would also boost its presence in Benghazi, the de facto rebel capital. The United States has not recognized the opposition formally, although it has provided aid. Italy and France have recognized the opposition group. As the opposition sought greater support, the International Criminal Court at The Hague in the Netherlands said it will unveil Monday the names of those who are ""most responsible for crimes allegedly committed in Libya."" The names will be submitted to the court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, who has been seeking warrants for three individuals in crimes against humanity allegedly committed since February, when the Libyan uprising erupted. Libyan  state television broadcast video late Wednesday that it said showed  Gadhafi meeting with tribal elders in a Tripoli hotel, marking the  strongman's first public appearance in nearly two weeks. The camera  panned from a television program bearing the date of May 11 to the group  of more than a dozen men, including Gadhafi. Gadhafi, wearing  sunglasses and dark clothing, had not been seen on television since  April 30, the same day a NATO airstrike hit the Tripoli  compound reportedly housing him and one of his sons. Libyan officials  said at the time that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi was killed but that his  father had escaped. Gadhafi  has been firm in his attempt to retain power in Libya. Loyalist forces  and rebel fighters, aided by NATO airstrikes, have been fighting each  other for weeks. The bloodshed continued Friday. Libyan state television reported Friday that NATO airsrikes hit a guest house in the eastern oil town of al-Brega, killing 11 people and injuring about 45 others. Ibrahim condemned the attack, calling NATO ""barbaric"" and inhumane"" in its actions for striking attendees of a religious conference while they were asleep. He showed a video that showed the imams in prayer and then bodies being taken away. ""Now is this protection of civilians?"" Ibrahim asked. ""Is this legitimate under any Security Council resolution to kill people in their sleep?"" NATO's military office confirmed that NATO conducted an air strike in al-Brega earlier Friday but said the target was clearly identified as a command and control structure, which was being used by Gadhafi regime to coordinate attacks against the civilian population. And Ahmed Bani, a rebel military spokesman, denied that civilian casualties were caused by NATO strikes. All civilians have left the al-Brega area, Bani said. The remaining population are pro-Gadhafi forces and have taken up positions in civilian neighborhoods, hiding equipment and ammunition, he said. In the contested western city of Misrata, a doctor said rebels were able to maintain control of the airport and a civil defense base beyond the airport. The doctor said that at least 10 people, including two babies, were killed and at least 20 were injured Friday in sporadic shelling. A rebel spokesman, who asked to be identified only as Mohamed, also said rebels were controlling Misrata's airport and civil defense base, which are about 17 kilometers (10 miles) from the city center. In Jibril's first official visit to Washington, the opposition leader is scheduled to meet Friday with Donilon as well as other senior administration officials and members of Congress. Jibril said Thursday that the United States should turn over some of Libya's frozen assets to his group because ""a human tragedy is in the making right now."" He said Libyan rebels are facing a ""big hurdle"" in getting the U.S. government to free up some of the $30 billion-plus in frozen Libyan assets to help those suffering under Gadhafi's regime. ""Time is the crux of the matter, because having solved this problem in a matter of four or five weeks might be too late,"" Jibril told a group gathered at the Brookings Institution. He said he wanted to clarify a misunderstanding about the council: that it was not a political organ but an administrative one that was managing the situation in Libya until the fall of Gadhafi's regime. ""The political question of who should rule Libya and how he or she should rule it, this is for the Libyan people to decide through a political democratic process based on constitutional grounds, based on an active civil society, based on equal rights and natural human rights for everybody,"" he said. In March, Jibril met privately with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she was in Paris for a meeting with the Group of Eight foreign ministers. At the State Department on May 5, Clinton said, ""Clearly on our agenda is looking for the most effective ways to deliver financial assistance and other means of supporting and helping the opposition.""

"(CNN) -- A white tiger mauled a zookeeper to death at a New Zealand wildlife park Wednesday as a group of tourists watched in horror, police say. The zookeeper at Zion Wildlife Gardens in New Zealand could not be saved by other staff. The attack took place at the Zion Wildlife Gardens near Whangarei, about three hours north of Auckland. Two zookeepers had gone in to clean an enclosure at the park, when one of two white tigers inside lunged at a keeper, said Sarah Kennett, spokeswoman for Northland Police. The second keeper and other zoo staff tried to pull the tiger off the man but failed. He died shortly after, Kennett said. The tiger was put down, the park said.  Watch park officials, visitors react » . A group of eight tourists who were on a guided tour of the park witnessed the Wednesday morning attack, Kennett said. ""This is an incredibly sad day,"" the park said in a statement, adding that it would provide counseling to its employees. The Zion Wildlife Gardens is home to several endangered tigers and lions. It is best known in New Zealand as the setting for the popular television series ""Lion Man."" In February, an employee needed surgery after he was attacked by a white tiger, according to local media reports. Last year, the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry released documents to CNN affiliate TVNZ that said animals at the park were kept in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Inspectors were so concerned about the conditions that they considered having 40 cats put down, the documents said.","White tiger mauls a zookeeper to death at a New Zealand wildlife park .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia said Wednesday that it blamed ""unfriendly"" actions by Britain for a recent diplomatic spat that led both nations to expel each others' diplomats. ""The British side has recently took an unfriendly step, groundlessly declaring persona non grata a diplomat at the Russian Embassy in London. We were compelled to take a similar step in response,"" a statement on the Russian Foreign Ministry said. ""It is regretful that the actions of the British side were undertaken at a moment when our relations with Britain have just started to improve. The initiators of this incident bear full responsibility for its consequences."" The statement comes after the United Kingdom expelled a Russian diplomat on suspicion of spying, and Russia kicked out a British embassy staffer in Moscow in retaliation. Britain asked the Russian to leave on December 10 ""in response to clear evidence of activities by the Russian intelligence services against U.K. interests,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Tuesday. Russia told the British diplomat to leave Moscow on December 16, Hague said. Hague said there was not ""any basis"" for the expulsion.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Opposition fighters continued to push west, entering territory loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, but were quickly beaten back, rebels told CNN, as diplomats arrived Tuesday in London to discuss the crisis. The setback for the rebels highlights the tenuous nature of their recent gains and suggests they might face more resistance in the days to come. As they moved into Umm el Ghindel -- near Sirte, Gadhafi's birthplace -- rebels began searching homes and found that Gadhafi's forces had armed residents in the area, they said.  As they were talking to residents, asking them to join the opposition, gunfire broke out. Rebels told CNN they refused to fire back and began a hasty retreat.  A stream of vehicles could be seen fleeing the area. CNN could not independently confirm details of the report. Earlier, a wounded rebel with bandages on the left side of his head and face described what happened Monday about 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) from Sirte, near the city's main entrance. He said he and a group of fellow opposition fighters came across a group of Gadhafi forces who raised a white flag -- a suggestion that they would not shoot. But as the opposition approached the group, Gadhafi forces fired on them indiscriminately, killing some of the opposition members and wounding others, the rebel told CNN's Arwa Damon. Vehicles were destroyed as well, he said. Rebels credited coalition airstrikes with helping them regain ground, noting that they had encountered little resistance as they headed west over the weekend. But they said Monday that they need more airstrikes to advance further. Coalition officials say they are enforcing a U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that creates a no-fly zone above Libya and mandates the protection of civilians. Taking Sirte would be a symbolic victory for the rebels, who regained control of several significant towns over the weekend as coalition airstrikes continued. Rebels said the fight to take over Sirte could be their toughest and bloodiest battle yet. Opposition forces claimed to have gained control of the town of Ras Lanuf on Sunday. The opposition also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of Brega. Those victories marked a comeback for the ragtag group of amateur soldiers who are unified by one mission: toppling Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. On Monday, opposition troops and Gadhafi's security forces battled over the town of Nawfaliya. Rebel forces told CNN they had gained control of the city. CNN could hear explosions and see plumes of smoke in the area of Nawfaliyah and Sirte. In Misrata, where rebel fighters have said they have been under siege for weeks, CNN's Nic Robertson saw evidence of heavy fighting and damage Monday when the government organized a trip for reporters to the city. Government forces said they were in control of Misrata, though they did not allow Robertson and others into the city center, which rebels have said they control. Meanwhile, diplomats from around the world began arriving in London Tuesday for a conference on the crisis in Libya. More than 40 foreign ministers, representatives from regional groups and top diplomats are expected to attend, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a speech about Libya Monday, making his case for military intervention amid tough calls for him to clarify the United States' role in the U.N.-authorized military mission. He stressed the United States has a strategic interest in stopping the Libyan leader, and said ""history is not on Gadhafi's side."" Despite the pressure for more international action, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov complained Monday that the coalition's actions seemed to expand beyond the U.N. resolution's scope. ""There are reports -- which go undenied -- that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on Gadhafi's troops and support the military actions of rebels. There is an obvious controversy there,"" he told reporters in Moscow. ""We believe that the interference into what is, essentially, an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution."" Russia abstained from voting on the U.N. Security Council resolution but did not veto it. Libyan government officials have also argued that coalition forces target only troops loyal to Gadhafi. ""The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them. And no one is even talking to them or saying, 'Where are you going?' or 'Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities?' "" Moussa Ibrahim, a Libyan government spokesman, told reporters in Tripoli Sunday. He accused NATO of ""starving the Libyan population to get Libya on its knees to beg for mercy."" ""They are trying to weaken our spirits. They are not trying to protect civilians,"" he said. NATO, which has 28 member countries, formally approved plans Sunday to take control of enforcing the U.N. Security Council resolution. The coalition enforcing the resolution has been led by the United States, the United Kingdom and France. ""Our mandate is very clear. We're there to protect civilians against attacks. No more, no less,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN. Rasmussen said military commanders will make decisions on day-to-day operations within the framework NATO members agreed upon over the weekend. He declined to discuss specific rules of engagement, but stressed that NATO also is enforcing an arms embargo in Libya. ""We are not in Libya to arm people, but to protect people,"" he said. On Monday, Libyan state television displayed images of injured people in a hospital and destroyed buildings as it reported that civilians were wounded when bombs struck the central Libyan city of Sabha in the early morning hours. CNN was unable to independently verify that report. U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at the Pentagon Monday that there have been no confirmed civilian casualties in Libya as a result of coalition activity. Also Monday, video footage emerged online purporting to show forces loyal to Gadhafi abusing prisoners. CNN was not able to confirm the authenticity of the video or determine exactly when and where it was shot. In the clip, soldiers are seen taunting and slapping prisoners, who are crouched in the back of a truck with their hands bound. Qatar announced Monday that it would recognize the Transitional National Council, composed of opposition representatives, as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani lawmakers on Monday passed a resolution supporting the country's democratic system, a vote that came after weeks of public speculation and political intrigue about the possibility of a coup in the volatile nation. The vote came the same day Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to face a contempt of court hearing this week, a notice related to the government's failure to reopen thousands of corruption cases against politicians and bureaucrats, including President Asif Ali Zardari. The resolution that was voted on Monday by the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, was put forward Friday by the Awami National Party. That party is part of the governing coalition led by Gilani's Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). ""The army and the judiciary, they both have to protect democracy in Pakistan,"" Gilani said in a speech Monday night, after the vote. ""They can't remove democracy. They can't pack up the system."" The resolution calls for support for the democratic system in general -- something a majority of lawmakers are unlikely to vote against -- without naming any political parties or individuals, suggesting that it was designed to bolster the government while avoiding the risk of hurting the prime minister or the PPP. ""This house endorses and supports the efforts made by the political leadership for strengthening democracy and reposes full confidence and trust in them,"" part of the resolution reads. Two days earlier, the embattled Pakistani president, Zardari, met with Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani -- a sign, some say, that shows tensions between Pakistan's civilian and military leadership are cooling down. Zardari and Kayani met to discuss the ""current security situation,"" presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar said. A second meeting between civilian and military leadership took place afterward, as Gilani convened the Cabinet's defense committee. The meetings came a day after Pakistani and British official denied a report that Gilani had contacted the British High Commission to express fears that a military coup was imminent in his country. Officials from both countries said such a call never took place. Saturday's meeting signaled an easing of tensions between the military and the president, said retired Brig. Mehmoud Shah. ""It's a good beginning to soothe the tension that's gripping the country,"" said Shah, a military analyst. ""It shows the two sides are prepared to talk and want the democratic system to move forward."" During the prime minister's meeting with leaders, he stressed that Pakistan's sovereignty is non-negotiable, according to a news release. ""We would reject any approach that would tend to compromise our sovereignty, honor and national dignity,"" Gilani said. ""Our contribution and steadfast commitment to stability and peace at home and in our region is unquestionable and second to none. "" For Pakistan, there is a need for national unity, especially between the military and the civilian government, he said. ""Together in complete harmony with each other and other vital institutions we can change the country's destiny and accord, its rightful place in the comity of nations,"" he said. Military officials did not immediately comment on the meetings and their outcomes. The military and the government have been locked in an uneasy standoff after allegations of a secret effort by the government last year to ward off a possible military coup by curbing the army's power with Washington's help. That compounded tensions created by the U.S. killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil in May, which deeply embarrassed the military, and NATO airstrikes in November that killed two dozen Pakistani soldier near the Afghan border, putting further pressure on relations with Washington. A Supreme Court panel also held a hearing Monday to investigate an unsigned memo sent to the Pentagon that allegedly called for Washington to help avert a military coup and curb the military's powers. The memo enraged military leaders who are cooperating with the Supreme Court. The court is investigating to determine whether Zardari was aware of the memo. The government has denied involvement, but the Supreme Court's eventual findings could threaten Zardari and his government. The president also faces pressure from the Supreme Court on another front. The court is pushing the government to pursue old corruption charges against thousands of politicians and bureaucrats, including Zardari. The politicians were granted amnesty by a decree issued by then President Pervez Musharraf in 2007. In 2009, the Supreme Court ruled the decree was unconstitutional, but the government has yet to pursue and reopen the cases. The Supreme Court is running out patience and last week threatened to censure the government if it did not taking action -- including the possibility of disqualifying Gilani.","NEW: Lawmakers pass a resolution supporting ""democracy"" and the Parliament .

"(CNN) -- England beat India by a crushing 319 run margin with a day to spare in the second test at Trent Bridge to take a 2-0 lead in the four-test series. Tim Bresnan was the hero, taking five wickets after hitting a brutal 90 to set India a near-impossible target of 478 runs to win the match. The fourth day started with England in a commanding position, having turned the test on its head. At one stage India had reduced England to 128-8 during the first innings, but it was the home side that went on to dominate the next two days with both bat and ball. Bresnan's quick-fire 90 in the morning session helped England reach a huge second innings total of 544 runs. And with such a big score to chase India needed to start well, which they failed to do. Bresnan dropped India's opening batsman Abinhav Makund first ball, but it didn't mark a change in fortunes for the visitors. After tea they had slumped to 129-8 when Harbhajan Singh, whose 46 was one of the few bright spots of the Indian innings, was caught off Bresnan.  But it was down to man-of-the-match Stuart Broad to bowl Sreesanth for the final wicket. After two emphatic victories England will be confident of becoming the best test side in the world, a position currently held by their opponents.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan wrapped up a first series whitewash over top-ranked England on Monday by winning the third and final Test in Dubai by 71 runs, making history in the process. The result, sealed with more than a day to spare, meant Pakistan became the first team since 1907 to win a Test after scoring less than 100 in their first innings. South Africa can now become the world's No. 1 Test nation if they whitewash New Zealand in March's three-match series. ""I just can't explain this in words,"" Pakistan captain Misbah Ul-Haq told the host broadcaster after the match. ""Getting out for 99, nobody thought we could come back. ""We should now learn to play well outside Asia, and this team can do that."" England collapse hands Pakistan victory . England had resumed day four on 36-0, seeking 324 to win -- which would have been the team's second-highest final-innings run chase. However, the batsmen continued their poor tour and collapsed to 252 all out as in-form spinner Saeed Ajmal and fast bowler Umar Gul took four wickets each. Wicketkeeper-batsman Matt Prior offered some resistance with an unbeaten 49, a score that opener Alastair Cook matched. England captain Andrew Strauss said the defeat should serve as a warning ahead of a two-match series with Sri Lanka, which starts at the end of March. Pakistan hammer England in Dubai . ""When they were ahead, they didn't allow us to come back,"" he said. ""We're a lot better at the end of the third Test, than at the start of the first. Test cricket is difficult by its nature. I've got great faith in our players but this is an eye-opener. ""There were some fantastic performances by some of the guys. We've got a lot of cricket coming up. There will be accusations flying about. I've got to try be ready for the Sri Lanka series."" England added only 12 runs before Strauss after was trapped leg before wicket by left-armer Abdur Rehman. Jonathan Trott followed as England slipped to 85-2 and Kevin Pietersen continued his poor form by also making 18 before being removed by Ajmal. Ajmal, who was the series' top wicket-taker with 24, denied Cook a half century before Gul tore into England's middle order. His first victim was Ian Bell for 10, while Ireland-born Eoin Morgan made 31 to leave England 159-6. It capped a disappointing series for Pietersen, Bell and Morgan, who scored less than 200 runs between them in the three matches. When Ashad Shafiq caught Stuart Broad for 18 off the bowling of Gul, the writing was on the wall. Graeme Swann (1) fell to Gul soon after and Ajmal ended a stubborn ninth-wicket partnership of 34 when he had James Anderson caught at slip for nine. A miserable series for England concluded when Rehman dismissed last man Monty Panesar for eight. Panesar was one of England's few positives for the tour, taking 14 wickets in two Tests with his left-arm spin while Broad and Swann claimed 13 each.","Pakistan whitewash England in a series for the first time with Dubai victory .

"(CNN)  -- India and England tied one of the most extraordinary matches in World Cup cricket history in Bangalore Sunday. Co-hosts India set England an imposing 339 for victory, but Andrew Strauss' men came close to pulling off a remarkable triumph with the captain leading from the front with an superb innings of 158. Two runs were needed off the last ball from Munaf Patel, but Graeme Swann could only heave it for a single to leave England on 338 for eight wickets. ""We're happy and devastated at the same time but privileged to play in a game like this,"" said Strauss after a titanic struggle which ebbed and flowed. Had England been successful, it would have been the biggest successful run chase in World Cup history, but while Strauss and Ian Bell (69) combined for a third wicket stand of 170, England were in command. But Zaheer Khan returned to remove Bell, who was suffering from cramp, and Strauss in successive balls. With Matt Prior going to Zaheer in the next over, India were suddenly favorites until a late flurry from Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan and Swann. 14 runs were still needed from the last over by Patel, but a six by tailender Ajmal Shahzad lifted England. Patel, who took two wickets 70, found himself at the heart of the action, having earlier dismissed England opener Kevin Pietersen in unusual fashion. Pietersen had looked impressive in making 31 in an opening stand of 68 with Strauss and thumped back a Patel delivery, which looked headed for the boundary. But the medium pacer, taking evasive action, threw out a hand and succeeded in knocking the ball into the air to fall into his grasp for a remarkable caught and bowled. Pietersen was stunned, but with the exception of the dismissal of Jonathan Trott for 16, India had little to applaud until Zaheer's late wickets insured a thrilling climax. Earlier, Sachin Tendulkar set yet another record in his glittering career as  became the first man to make five centuries in World Cup competition, moving ahead of compatriot Sourav Ganguly and Australian pair Mark Waugh and Ricky Ponting. It was his 47th hundred in one-day internationals, added to his 51 in Tests. He faced 115 balls and hit 10 fours and five sixes in his 120 to delight the packed M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. He also shared a second-wicket stand of 134 with Gautam Gambhir (51) while Yuvraj Singh smashed a quickfire 58. James Anderson eventually dismissed Tendulkar with Yardy taking the catch, but England's premier paceman had an afternoon to forget as he finished with one wicket for 91 in his 10 overs, the worst World Cup performance by an England bowler. But Bresnan, who removed the dangerous Virender Sehwag to end his opening stand of 46 with Tendulkar, took a string of late wickets to end with five wickets for 48. That put a brake on the Indian batsmen, who had threatened to amass in excess of 350 and take the game out of England's reach. The build-up to Sunday's game had been marred by violence as fans, desperate for wickets, came into conflict with local police. The game had originally been scheduled for Eden Gardens in Calcutta, but it failed a ground safety inspection. The ground in Bangalore had a capacity of 38,000 and tickets could have been sold many times over. ""What is unfortunate is that too few tickets go to the public as a general sale,""  International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Haroon Lorgat told AFP.

"(CNN) -- England batsman Jonathan Trott has been named the ICC's cricketer of the year for 2011. The 30-year-old headed off teammate Alastair Cook, who won the Test player award, last year's winner Sachin Tendulkar of India and South Africa opening batsman Hashim Amla. He scored 1,042 runs in 12 Tests, including four centuries at an average of 65 per innings, as top-ranked England won series against Australia, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. In 24 one-day internationals, he hit 1,064 runs at an average of 48. ""It's fantastic to be part of a successful team, and I never envisaged winning this award. It's a brilliant feeling to be recognized,"" the South Africa-born Trott said at the awards ceremony in London on Monday. The awards, in their eighth year, covered the period from August 11, 2010 to August 3, 2011. Cook scored 1,302 runs at an average of 51.74 in 12 Tests during that period, including 235 not out as England retained the Ashes -- winning a five-day series in Australia for the first time since 1987. India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the Spirit of Cricket award after allowing England batsman Ian Bell to be reinstated after a controversial run out during the second Test at Nottingham in July. Sri Lanka batsman and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara won both the one-day player award and the People's Choice prize, voted for by the public. New Zealand bowler Tim Southee claimed the award for best Twenty20 international performance after taking five wickets and holding a catch during a victory at home to Pakistan in December.

"(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar fell agonizingly short of his 100th international century as England confirmed their status as cricket's number one team with a 4-0 series whitewash over India. The legendary Indian batsman -- dubbed ""The Little Master"" -- was dismissed for 91 at The Oval in London as England won the fourth Test by an innings and eight runs. Their fourth successive victory over India means that England usurped their opponents at the top of the world rankings. Having racked up a mammoth 591-6 declared, England dismissed India for 300 in their first innings and 283 in their second after asking the tourists to bat again. Graeme Swann took six wickets on the final day, including the final scalp of Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, to confirm England's first series whitewash on home soil since 2004. ""We had to work pretty hard for that,"" England captain Andrew Strauss told BBC. ""When you enforce the follow-on, you're always asking a lot of the bowlers especially on a flat wicket. They stuck at it. ""To bowl India out for 300 and 283 on that wicket is quite a performance. You're getting really strong performances from all 11 players. ""It's been up there with the best series we've played as a group. We've had a lot of victories over the last couple of years and we expect to win matches now."" India captain MS Dhoni added: ""It's important we stay together as a unit because the expectation levels are quite high. ""It's about the team rising to the occasion together. That's the way ahead. We are not willing to surrender and we hope the coming years will be good."" Resuming on 129-3 -- still 162 runs behind -- Tendulkar and Amit Mishra put up stubborn resistance in the morning session, England trying six different bowlers in an attempt to break the partnership. Tendulkar went to lunch on 78 not out with an expectant capacity crowd willing him on to his landmark 100th international century. After the interval Mishra was the first to go, for 84, bowled by Swann after he and Tendulkar had put on 144 runs. Just minutes later Indian fans in the crowd were distraught as Tim Bresnan trapped Tendulkar LBW just nine short of his hundred, replays showing the ball was just clipping the leg stump. India's final six batsmen managed just 19 runs between them as Stuart Broad removed captain MS Dhoni and RP Singh with Swann picking up the wickets of Suresh Raina, Gautam Gambhir and Sreesanth.","England complete series whitewash over India to seal world number one berth .

"(CNN) -- As more technology goes mobile, ""where"" has become one of the key pieces of context in daily life. And the answers to ""where"" increasingly are provided through geographic information systems (GIS), a technology that is being explored, debated and celebrated today in public. It's GIS Day, and events are being held in 45 U.S. states and 59 countries. Find a GIS Day event near you . GIS is an umbrella term to describe tools used to gather, transform, manipulate, analyze and produce information about real-world places. It's used to create maps and 3-D models, and to provide information to create more accurate reports and make better decisions. It also powers popular interactive services like Google Street View, or GPS features that help apps on your smartphone know what you mean by ""nearby."" The point of GIS Day is to demonstrate uses of GIS that are making a difference in society, from getting driving directions on your cell phone to geocaching games to the global response to the Haiti earthquake. Presentations, demonstrations and discussions will cover such far-ranging topics as transportation, defense,  education, agriculture and more. Every event is unique. I'll be attending the GIS Day event at the University of California, Berkeley, where I'm hoping to try out the free app GeoBeagle on my Android phone in a geocaching exercise. Some GIS Day events (like the UC Berkeley one) are conference-style and geared toward adults. But many are specifically kid- and family-friendly. For instance, Myford Elementary School in Irvine, California, is hosting a GIS Day event that includes first-graders making ""map hats"" and fourth- and fifth-graders playing geo-""Jeopardy."" Most events are free and open to the public. GIS Day grew out of Geography Awareness Week, an annual campaign launched in 1987 by the National Geographic Society to promote geo-literacy and draw attention to ""the importance of geographic understanding in ensuring our nation's economic competitiveness, national security, environmental sustainability, and the livability of our communities in the 21st century."" Of course, GIS technology isn't all roses and sunshine. When GIS-enabled devices or systems know where you are and where you've been, it opens substantial concerns about privacy, safety, security and equity. GIS technology can pave the way for the more effective or equitable delivery of products and services, or it can empower communities to better look after their own local interests. But it can also enable new types of discriminatory ""redlining,"" or encourage overeager law enforcement agencies to snoop. How much locative information is OK to share, and who should have access to it? Where to draw that line will probably be one of the most important ""where"" questions discussed at today's GIS Day events.","GIS Day aims to show how geographic information systems can aid society .

"(CNN) -- England took a big step towards a Six Nations Grand Slam with a 17-9 win over defending champions France at Twickenham on Saturday, in which Jonny Wilkinson regained the record for the most points in international rugby. Coach Martin Johnson's team clinched a third successive victory in this year's competition courtesy of fullback Ben Foden's only try of the match two minutes after halftime, with the scores level at 9-9. Replacement fly-half Jonny Wilkinson then gave England an unassailable eight-point lead with a 51st-minute penalty that took the 31-year-old Toulon player back above New Zealand's Dan Carter on 1190 overall. Defeat for France ended coach Marc Lievremont's hopes of achieving a second successive Grand Slam. Will French barbs derail England's rugby revival? Unbeaten England next play host to Scotland on March 12, and victory at Twickenham will see the team able to clinch a first Grand Slam crown since 2003 in the closing match in Ireland. ""It was a good performance in that we didn't play well in the first half, but we were able to change our game in the second period and we could have had three tries,"" Johnson, who was captain of that World Cup-winning side eight years ago, told reporters. ""It wasn't as spectacular as our win over Italy a fortnight ago but I am very happy with the win."" Both teams converted three penalties in a tense first half, as England's Toby Flood and his French counterpart Dimitri Yachvili both registered a trio of successful kicks. The crucial moment in the match arrived early in the second half after Yachvili's attempted clearance was charged down, resulting in a five-meter scrum. Winger Mark Cueto attempted to advance beyond the French try-line before the ball was fed to Foden, who touched down to put England 14-9 ahead. ""I think the English are better than us at the moment.

"London (CNN) -- Television cameras are to be allowed into courts in England and Wales for the first time, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke announced Tuesday. The new law will allow the filming only of judges delivering summaries, not victims, witnesses, defendants or juries, the Ministry of Justice said in a statement. It will also permit filming only from the Court of Appeal, with the possibility of later expanding to Crown Courts, which handle serious criminal cases such as rape and murder. The aim is to ""improve transparency and public understanding of court,"" Clarke said. Lawyer and broadcaster Mark Stephens, of the law firm Finers Stephens Innocent, praised the move, saying England and Wales were among few countries in the world still to have a blanket ban on cameras in court. ""This is a very welcome, if cautious and tentative, step towards opening up the court system,"" Stephens told CNN. ""It helps the 'open justice' principle -- the very soil in which justice is planted in this country, in which justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done."" Seeing the process in action would help people understand why certain sentences are given, he said -- a subject that has been widely debated as many of those accused of involvement in rioting in England's cities last month have appeared before the courts. The ban on filming in courts in England and Wales dates back to 1925 and will require the passage of new laws to overturn, the Justice Ministry said. No such ban exists in Scotland, although cameras are not widely allowed into courtrooms. The ministry said consultations with the judiciary are planned that would cover newer technologies that could provide for live broadcasts. It did not say when the government planned to introduce legislation or when it would take effect. Legislation announced by the government is generally passed quickly by Parliament. Filming in courtrooms has been tried already in courts of appeal, Stephens said, although the footage was not broadcast. The trial reassured many members of the judiciary that their concerns could be dealt with in cooperation with broadcasters, he added. ""Clearly there will need to be safeguards in some cases involving the young and the vulnerable, but in most cases I see no reason why there should not be a virtual public gallery,"" he said. ""It will have the effect of instilling a greater -- and justifiable -- sense of pride in, and comprehension of, the way in which our justice system works,"" Stevens said, adding that cameras would boost public scrutiny of judges and court proceedings. Justice Secretary Clarke also announced plans to publish much more information about each court's performance. Data that will be compiled will include ""the sentence given, the court, the age group, gender and ethnicity of those sentenced, and the time from when the offence was committed to when the case was complete,"" he said. The government wants ""to allow everyone to see what is happening and how the system works,"" Clarke said. Court-by-court statistics will start to roll out later this month, he said. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","The government plans to overturn a ban in England and Wales dating back to 1925 .

"(CNN) -- Spinner Saeed Ajmal tore through England's batting line up as Pakistan took control of the first Test in Dubai, in the first clash between the two countries since the spot-fixing scandal of 2010. Ajamal took 7-55 as England were dismissed for just 192, having won the toss and elected to bat. By the close of play Pakistan had reached 42-0, trailing their opponents by just 150 runs. The last time the pair came face to face was two years ago in England, during a controversial series that eventually saw the prosecution of three Pakistan players for their part in a spot-fixing betting scam. Former captain Salman Butt and fast bowlers Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif were found guilty of deliberately bowling no-balls in a Test match at London's Lord's stadium and all three are currently serving custodial sentences. Both sides insisted in the lead up to their series, played in the United Arab Emirates due to the ongoing ban on Pakistan playing matches in their home country, that they were keen to move on from the incidents. And it was Pakistan who dominated proceedings in Dubai as Ajmal claimed a seven-wicket haul for the first time in his career, accounting for captain Andrew Strauss, Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell in the space of ten deliveries. Only wicketkeeper Matt Prior looked comfortable at the crease as he compiled a diligent 70 not out, with Eoin Morgan contributing 24 and Graeme Swann 34. Ajmal then took three of the final four wickets as England were bowled out in just 73 overs. At the close Pakistan openers Mohammad Hafeez and Taufeeq Umar were unbeaten, compiling 42 runs between them.

"(CNN)  -- It was Rahul Dravid, not Indian teammate Sachin Tenduklar, that claimed the batting honors Saturday, but England remained in charge of the first Test at Lord's. Dravid reached his first Test century at the home of cricket, while Tendulkar made 34 as he bid for his 100th century in Tests. Despite their efforts, India were bowled out for 286 and England had extended their lead to 193 by the close of the third day, having reached five without loss in their second innings. The 38-year-old Dravid was left undefeated on 103, 15 years after he was dismissed for 95 on his debut at Lord's. His 33rd hundred in 154 Tests and fifth against England helped India avoid the follow on. Tendulkar, who received a standing ovation in probably his final Test series in England, looked in fine touch, but eventually fell to Stuart Broad, who led England's attack with four for 37 in 22 overs. He was well held by Graeme Swann at slip, to the delight of the bowler. ""Of course it was lovely to get Sachin but I'd say the same about any leader of any batting line-up,"" Broad told Sky Sports. England, looking to win the four-match series by two clear wins to overtake India as world number one in Tests, were further boosted when India's leading strike bowler Zaheer Khan did not come out for the start of their second knock. Zaheer pulled his hamstring on the first day and has been receiving extensive treatment for the injury.

Until that happens in the real world, we'll give them the same opening-day pass that Steve Jobs got for iPhone 4 connection glitches). It also has what's being called Google Beam, an app that lets users share contacts, apps, websites and other data between two Android phones by simply holding them near each other. And while there's nothing as sexy as Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice-activated ""personal assistant,"" the phone does feature ""voice typing,"" which allows users to speak to create text messages, e-mails and the like. The Galaxy Nexus features a big, 4.65-inch display screen (the new iPhone 4S's is 3.5 inches), 32 GB of storage and a dual-core 1.24 GHz processor. It has a 5-megapixel camera, which is on par with the iPhone 4 but lags behind the 4S's 8-megapixel version. Google and Samsung counter with claims of zero shutter lag (a frequent iPhone complaint), autofocus and panoramic photo capabilities. Early response to the phone, and the operating system, has been positive. ""While hardware junkies like myself may have spent the past few weeks drooling over the Galaxy Nexus, the onstage demo of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich proves that the software powering the device is just as impressive,"" Chris Velazco wrote for TechCrunch. Google says that Ice Cream Sandwich is the first operating system optimized for both smartphones and tablets. They say it has dramatically improved the touchscreen keyboard, made notifications more interactive and created resizable widgets, among other upgrades. All of which is well and good, of course. But the question remains: Is this the phone to go head-to-head with the market's 800-pound gorilla, the iPhone? The Android system as a whole has come on like gangbusters. Phones running the system make up about 43% of the multibillion-dollar smartphone market, compared with the iPhone's 18%. But that's spread out over dozens of phones from multiple manufacturers and ranges from top-of-the-line offerings to cheap, slapped-together handhelds. Google basically takes bids each year for a manufacturer to make its Nexus phone. That's after the company's attempt to produce its own, the Nexus One, fizzled and died in remarkably short order. No single Android phone has captured the public's imagination like the iPhone, a fact that Google would love to change. ""Ice Cream Sandwich could provide the critical push in the race to catch Apple,"" Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who is based in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg Businessweek. ""Apple's software is still on the cutting edge.""","Google, Samsung unveil Galaxy Nexus phone and Android 4.0, or ""Ice Cream Sandwich""

"(CNN) -- The United States announced tougher sanctions against Iran on Monday, joining Britain and Canada in a coordinated effort to tighten the screws around the country's suspected nuclear weapons program. The new measures target Iran's petrochemical industry and its oil and gas business, said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The United States also named Iran as a ""primary money laundering concern."" Clinton said she expects additional sanctions by other international partners and that taken together ""these measures represent a significant ratcheting up of pressure on Iran, its sources of income and its illegal activities."" Britain cut all financial ties with Iran, the first time it has cut an entire country's banking sector off from British finance, the British Treasury announced earlier on Monday. Similarly, Canada said it was implementing a series of tougher sanctions, prohibiting almost all financial transactions with the Iranian government. The moves come days after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about ""the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program,"" the British Treasury statement said Monday. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" ""The IAEA's report last week provided further credible and detailed evidence about the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear program,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""Today we have responded resolutely by introducing a set of new sanctions that prohibit all business with Iranian banks."" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird also cited the recent IAEA report as ""yet more proof that the current regime in Tehran poses the most significant threats to global peace and security today."" ""Canada is implementing, as of right now, a series of even tougher measures under the Special Economics Measures Act. These expanded sanctions prohibit almost all financial transactions with the Iranian government, add individuals and entities to the list of designated persons and expand the list of prohibited goods,"" he said in a statement. Also Monday French President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to various leaders and heads of state, urging ""new sanctions of unprecedented magnitude to convince Iran that it must negotiate,"" according to a statement. France recommended that the European Union and its member states, as well as the United States, Japan, Canada and other willing countries, freeze the asset of Iran's Central Bank and suspend purchases of Iranian oil. Iran's nuclear program, the French president said, risks nuclear proliferation and ""could spark a military escalation in the region with catastrophic consequences for Iran and for the world."" Pentagon denies bunker-busting bomb is intended for Iran . The European Union already has an extensive set of sanctions in place. France, as one of the member states, is pushing to increase them. According to European diplomats, next week the EU is expected to pass further sanctions similar to what the United States announced, but France wants the international community to move beyond that, collectively. U.S. officials had been considering action against the Central Bank of Iran but became concerned that a full sanction could have a negative effect on the world economy because of the potential impact on oil prices. A number of congressional members have been calling for sanctions against the bank amid questions about how much the current restrictions are working. U.S. sanctions already prohibited American companies from doing business with Iran. ""Let me be clear: Today's actions do not exhaust our opportunities to sanction Iran. We continue actively to consider a range of increasingly aggressive measures,"" said Clinton. Following Monday's announcement, senior officials with the U.S. Treasury Department spoke to reporters on a conference call, stressing the decision to designate an entire jurisdiction, like Iran, as a ""primary money laundering concern"" is rare. The action will create a chilling effect and should serve as a wake-up call to banks and financial institutions around the world still doing business with Iran, they said. On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors issued a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program."" But the U.N. agency's resolution did not threaten action to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. CNN's Jamie Crawford, Jill Dougherty, Alex Felton, Elise Labott and Niki Cook contributed to this report.","The United States names Iran as a ""primary money laundering concern""

"(CNN) -- Two members of the England coaching staff have been banned from their crucial Rugby World Cup clash with Scotland on Saturday for illegally switching the match ball during a win against Romania. Kicking coach Dave Aldred and fitness coach Paul Stridgeon will not be allowed into the match at Eden Park after changing the ball before two of flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson's conversions in England's 67-3 victory on October 24. The Rugby Football Union (RFU), the body in charge of English rugby, acted swiftly to ban the duo and Rugby World Cup Limited (RWCL) confirmed no further sanctions will be brought against the 2003 world champions. ""RWCL recognizes that the RFU has investigated this matter fully and taken appropriate action and therefore no further action is required,"" read a statement from RWCL, the organization in charge of the tournament which is being held in New Zealand. ""RWCL accepts the RFU's assurances that it will abide by both the Laws and the Spirit of the Game going forward, however it must be pointed out that any similar breaches in future will be dealt with severely."" The RFU confirmed on Thursday the incident had occurred, but claimed the two coaches involved had incorrectly thought there was an issue with the balls being used. ""Two members of the RFU RWC 2011 team management, David Alred and Paul Stridgeon, mistakenly thought that there was an issue with some of the match balls used in the England v Romania RWC 2011 match,"" read the RFU statement. ""Those team management members took it upon themselves to substitute balls during the match in contravention of both the Laws of the Game and the Spirit of the Game."" The Pool B contest between Martin Johnson's England and Scotland, led by former England coach Andy Robinson, is key to both team's hope of reaching the quarterfinals. Scotland need to beat group leaders England by eight points and score four or more tries in Auckland to avoid elimination at the pool stage for the first time in their history. Argentina, who finished third at the 2007 tournament in France, are currently second in the group, with Scotland third, and Santiago Phelan's team will be hoping for a bonus-point triumph over Georgia to secure their third appearance at the quarterfinal stage.","England have banned two coaches from their World Cup clash with Scotland .

"(CNN) -- The deaths of three men who residents say were mowed down by a car while protecting businesses from looters have heightened fears in Britain's second largest city. Jittery residents said they peer over their shoulders as they scuttle down the streets. Businesses that remained opened all night close at the first sign of darkness. And the distraught father of one of the victims, who tried desperately to revive his dying son, appealed for calm. ""Blacks, Asians, whites. We all live in the same community. Why do we have to kill one another?"" said Tarik Jahan. ""What started these riots, and what's escalated them? Why are we doing this?"" Jahan's son, Haroon, was killed early Wednesday in Birmingham, along with two brothers, Shazad and Munir Hussein -- both in their 30s. The 21-year-old was struck by a car while he kept watch outside a gas station following a break-in, according to the father. ""I heard the thud and ran around and I saw three people on the ground. My instinct was to help the three people. I didn't know who they were; who'd been injured,"" he said. ""I helped the first man and somebody from behind told me my son was lying behind me. So I started CPR on my own son."" He struggled to revive his son, his face and hands covered in blood. ""Why? Why? The guy who killed him drove directly into the crowd and killed three innocent guys,"" he said. ""Why? What was the point of doing that? I don't understand."" British police have not tied the deaths to the riots, but residents say the victims were among a group that lined up outside storefronts to stop rioters from breaking into properties. ""I remember passing by there a few hours before it happened, and there were lots of Asian kids, calmly watching guard outside shops, not disturbing anyone,"" said Esther Kiilu, a resident of neighboring Rowley Ridges. ""They looked like they were sons of the owners and their friends."" Kiilu said a few hours after she got home, she saw television reports of the deaths along the street she uses daily. Residents held a vigil Wednesday night outside the gas station where the three were killed. ""It was a huge group of people, just quietly holding candles,"" Kiilu said. The victim's father, who addressed reporters hours after his son was killed, urged rioters to end the violence. ""Step forward if you want to lose your sons,"" he said. "" Otherwise, calm down and go home. Please!"" As soon as he finished addressing the crowd, two sides started arguing, prompting police to step in and separate the groups. ""You guys have got nothing better to do, go home, men,"" the father told the two bickering sides. A man has been arrested in connection with the deaths, which police are treating as a murder inquiry. Birmingham, like many other areas in Britain, was roiled by riots that began Saturday, spurred by the shooting death of a man who protesters said was killed by police. ""I just want things to return to normal, this has just got out of hand,"" said Hilda Siviter, who lives in Bewdley, a small town near Birmingham. ""All this trouble is being caused by a huge group of lazy guys who can't be bothered to go out and get a job, and they suddenly see free things and decide to take advantage,"" Siviter said Thursday. Lawmakers are concerned that rioters could use the opportunity to stir up tensions. ""What we don't want is for other elements to now hijack what's happened and make this something else and make this more serious,"" said Shabana Mahmood, the member of parliament for Birmingham. In addition to the three deaths in Birmingham, police on Wednesday identified a man fatally shot in a vehicle in south London as Trevor Ellis. Ellis died Tuesday, a day after he was shot in the head in Croydon, police said, without linking his death to the riots. Initial inquiries indicate he had traveled with friends to the area, where a dispute ensued with a group of nine people. The dispute led to a pursuit involving three vehicles, after which Ellis was shot, police said, appealing to witnesses to come forward. Analysts say a mix of economic and social tensions has been at play in the unrest, with deprivation a key factor. The rioters and looters have been from diverse ethnic backgrounds and span a wide range of ages. CNN's Dan Rivers contributed to this report from Birmingham, England.","NEW: ""I started CPR on my own son,"" the victim's father says .

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A leader of the United Arab Emirates discounted concerns about a nuclear-armed Iran in a CNN interview Monday, saying Tehran would find the ultimate weapon to be of little use. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Emirates' prime minister and vice president, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that he did not believe Iran would build a bomb. ""What can Iran do with a nuclear weapon?"" Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, asked. ""For example, will they hit Israel? How many Palestinians will die? And you think if Iran hits Israel, their cities will be safe? They will be gone the next day."" Tehran has long insisted that its development of nuclear technology is strictly peaceful, aimed at producing civilian electricity. But it has refused international demands to halt its production of enriched uranium, bringing it under increasing sanctions in recent years. And the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency reported in November that it has credible information that Iran has carried out work toward developing a nuclear bomb. The UAE lies just across the mouth of the Persian Gulf from Iran, with barely 80 kilometers (50 miles) separating the two nations. ""Iran is our neighbor,"" Al Maktoum said. ""They are Muslim, and we lived next to each other for thousands and thousands of years. I don't believe that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon."" But other countries -- notably Israel -- are more concerned about the prospect. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called a nuclear Iran a ""grave, direct threat."" Israel is widely believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, though it has never declared itself a nuclear power. Western analysts say Iran could spur an arms race among other countries in the region if it develops nuclear weapons.","""What can Iran do with a nuclear weapon?"" Al Maktoum asks .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Iran's efforts to develop its nuclear program have been stymied by a raft of challenges from international sanctions and set back by the 2010 Stuxnet cyberattack, two new reports from a Washington nuclear think tank conclude. The reports by former weapons inspector David Albright's Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) say Iran has been forced to use inferior parts and weaker metals, according to officials the group has spoken to at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), because sanctions have limited access to needed materials. ""Ten years after the start of construction at the Natanz enrichment site, the probability that Iran will build tens of thousands of centrifuges seems remote based on their faulty performance,"" one of the reports notes. ""Even with advanced centrifuges, Iran may be blocked by sanctions from building advanced centrifuges in large enough numbers."" The Natanz enrichment site was crippled when a computer virus attacked a portion of the centrifuges. But the ISIS report notes enrichment numbers have rebounded to a higher level than before Stuxnet, after a brief dip. The IAEA noted in recent reports, however, that not all the centrifuges are necessarily enriching. Albright's report says that the Stuxnet worm may have decreased the lifespan of aging centrifuges, even if they were not broken right away, by forcing them to spin at altered speeds. However, despite the challenges, based on ISIS assessment of Iran's production of enriched uranium, the report concludes the Iranians have more than enough for the stated goal of providing for its research reactor, and Iran appears on a trajectory ""to producing weapons-grade uranium for nuclear weapons.""","New reports cite the effects of international sanctions on Iran's nuclear efforts .

"(CNN) -- England went into the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals on Saturday after a dramatic late 16-12 victory over Scotland at Eden Park in New Zealand. Needing to win by more than seven points to reach the last eight, Scotland led 12-3 with 24 minutes to go. But Jonny Wilkinson found his touch to deny Scotland a famous victory, kicking a penalty and a drop kick before Chris Ashton scored a try with three minutes to go. Scotland picked up a bonus point, but need Georgia to beat Argentina by more than seven points on Sunday to reach the quarterfinals. 'Auld enemies' bring rivalry to New Zealand . ""It's tough to take. We knew it would take an extraordinary effort to beat England today but once again we slipped at crucial times. It's been the story of the last couple of weeks,"" said Scotland captain Alastair Kellock. ""I'm gutted, gutted."" England were unbeaten in four Group B matches and move on to a quarterfinal against France, whom they beat in the semifinals in Paris four years ago. ""Full credit to Scotland, we knew this was going to be an incredibly tough game and they made it that way,"" said England skipper Lewis Moody. ""We've come up on the right side of the result, but it was a tough game."" France went through despite losing for the second time in Group A, going down 19-14 against Tonga in Wellington on Saturday in the biggest upset of the tournament so far. The Pacific Islanders needed a bonus-point win, but fell short as Les Bleus went through in second place behind unbeaten New Zealand -- who face Canada on Sunday. ""We played really bad rugby,"" France captain Thierry Dusautoir said. ""Congratulations to Tonga. They played with their hearts. ""We made too many mistakes and just couldn't play a good game. Now we have got to sit down and talk about what we did today."" Tonga's only try came in the 27th minute through scrumhalf Taniela Moa, with Kurt Morath converting for a 10-6 halftime lead. Morath made it 19-9 in the 71st minute after two second-half penalties, as France replacement Fabrice Estebanez was sin-binned, but a late try by Vincent Clerc made it safe for the 2007 tournament hosts. Two-time world champions Australia clinched a quarterfinal place by beating Russia 68-22 in Nelson, but could lose Drew Mitchell for the rest of the competition. The winger scored two of the Wallabies' 10 tries before suffering a suspected torn hamstring . Russia coach Nikolay Nerush stood down after a fourth successive defeat in the nation's first World Cup appearance, but can take some heart after his side scored three tries against a team who had conceded just one in three previous matches. Ireland can regain top spot in Group C by beating third-placed Italy on Sunday, meaning Australia would play world champions South Africa in the last eight. Italy can also go through with a victory which would eliminate the Irish depending on bonus points, and give Nick Mallett's team a clash against the Springboks side he once coached. Wales and Fiji will battle for second place in Group D on Sunday, with the British side needing just one point to progress.","England reach World Cup quarterfinals after dramatic 16-12 victory over Scotland .

"Port Stanley, Falkland Islands (CNN) -- Amid escalating tensions over the Falkland Islands, Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner accused Great Britain of militarizing the South Atlantic and said Tuesday her country would file a protest at the United Nations. ""I have instructed our chancellor to formally present before the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. General Assembly this militarization of the South Atlantic, which implies a great risk for international safety,"" she said during a speech in Buenos Aires. ""We're going to file a protest,"" Fernandez added. Speculation in recent days had been that she would cut the Falklands air link to the South American mainland by banning the airline LAN Chile from using Argentinian airspace to fly to the islands from Chile. The Saturday flights are the only scheduled air service to the Falklands and carry fresh food as well as passengers. The president made no such announcement in her speech Tuesday. Argentina already bans Falklands ships from its ports, an action joined by other South American and Caribbean nations. ""I guess we were all kind of relieved that there wasn't anything particularly concrete. It seems to be another burst of hot air really -- and to that degree -- we're relieved,"" said John Fowler, a journalist and Falkland Islands resident. Britain and Argentina fought a war over the Falkland Islands, which Argentina calls Las Malvinas, in 1982. Though Britain won the war, expelling an Argentinian military force, Argentina still claims the territory, which has been under British rule since 1833, as its own. Britain maintains that the 2,500 residents of the Falklands have the right to determine their allegiance, and so far that has been staunchly British. ""We support the Falklands' right to self-determination, and what the Argentinians have been saying recently I would argue is actually far more like colonialism, because these people want to remain British, and the Argentinians want them to do something else,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron told U.K. lawmakers last month. Addressing Cameron directly in her speech, Fernandez said: ""I simply want to ask the prime minister of England to give peace a chance."" Tensions between London and Buenos Aires were raised even higher this month when Britain sent Prince William to the Falklands as a military helicopter pilot. The prince's deployment comes as Britain is making other moves to support its 1,700 personnel at the Mount Pleasant military complex in the Falklands. The Royal Navy is sending its top-of-the-line warship, the destroyer HMS Dauntless, to the South Atlantic in the spring on what the British Defence Ministry calls a routine deployment, according to British media reports. Additionally, a British nuclear submarine is headed to the Falklands, according to those reports. ""We are having what in game theory is called tit-for-tat ... I don't see an end in sight right now, but I'm sure that war is not the end,"" Federico Merke, a professor of international relations at San Andres University, said after the president's speech. So why, besides supporting the Falklands' inhabitants, does Britain want to hang on to the islands? The answer may lie in the lucrative fishing grounds around the islands as well as a growing oil drilling industry. Argentina, of course, has economic interests as well, but analysts say the current standoff has much to do with internal politics. ""The government is being squeezed from lots of different areas, so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the Malvinas issue,"" Mark Jones, an expert in Latin American politics at Rice University in Texas, told CNN. ""It's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on."" CNN's Dan Rivers and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","The Argentinian president asks Britain to ""give peace a chance""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's major microblogging sites have suspended comments sections after being ""punished for allowing rumors to spread"" of a coup attempt in Beijing, state-run media reported Saturday. Sina's Weibo and Tencent's QQ -- Chinese versions of Twitter, which is banned in the mainland -- will stop use of comment function on the popular sites to ""clean up rumors and other illegal information spread through microbloggings,"" according to Xinhua. The comments sections will be disabled until Tuesday. The microblog sites have been ""criticized and punished accordingly"" by officials in Beijing and Guangdong, state media reported. Authorities also closed 16 websites and detained six people, Xinhua reported, for allegedly spreading rumors of ""military vehicles entering Beijing and something wrong going on in Beijing,"" a spokesperson for the State Internet Information Office told Xinhua. An unknown number of people who also reported rumors were ""admonished and educated"" but ""have shown intention to repent,"" Beijing police told state media. China's Internet was rife with rumors of an alleged coup attempt last week after the shock dismissal Communist Party politburo member and Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai earlier in the month. Cyberspace discussions on Bo's fate have been censored. On Weibo last week, bloggers who type in Bo's name, or even his initials BXL and homophones, typically got an automatic reply: ""Due to relevant regulations and policies, search results for 'Bo Xilai' are not being displayed."" China's censors fuel online frenzy . Zhang Zhi An, an associate professor of journalism at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, says the government's actions are ""not surprising."" ""The government worries the information could have some mobilization functions, that it will make people worried about the stability of society,"" said Zhang who was attending a conference on microblog activism at Fudan University in Shanghai on Saturday. ""The information that was posted hints that there is a very big struggle in the Central Party, and I think the Party can not accept this information. ""This is a very clear sign to netizens that they must be responsible for their posts online,"" Zhang said. ""If it is not true, if it is fake, if it comes from your imagination, we will take actions to punish you."" This is the second time the government has taken serious action against China's microblogs, according to Zhang. The first time occurred in 2009 when dozens of Twitter-like sites were simply closed by the government. Since then, two main players have emerged in the market - Sina Weibo and Tencent's QQ. The platforms have experienced explosive growth in recent years and in many ways have become alternative information sources for the country's 500 million internet users who post information that is not reported in China's state-controlled media. Yet the platforms have been a source of ongoing concern for officials who fear that they could be used to mobilize protests or other movements that could jeopardize social stability, Zhang said. In an effort to try to prevent the spreading of rumors or other information deemed sensitive or inaccurate, the government recently implemented a policy requiring all microblog users to register their accounts using their real names. Sina Weibo and other micro blogging platforms were supposed to have implemented the real-name registration policy by March 16. On that day, only 19 million of Sina's 300 million users had registered their names, according to Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting.

"(CNN) -- The list of those on the program for superstar pop singer Whitney Houston's funeral covers the spectrum of the entertainment world. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in the 1992 hit movie ""The Bodyguard,"" will speak at the service on Saturday, according to a source with knowledge of the funeral plans. Gospel singer Kim Burrell told CNN's Jason Carroll she will sing, ""I Believe in You and Me,"" a selection made by the Houston family. The song was included in the soundtrack from ""The Preacher's Wife,"" a 1996 film starring Houston. The ceremony also will feature performances by Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and Aretha Franklin, who is Houston's godmother. Singer Roberta Flack will attend, but it was unclear whether she would perform. Houston's ex-husband, Bobby Brown, has been officially invited to the funeral, according to Houston representative Kristen Foster. Brown was openly emotional at a show in Mississippi on Saturday night following news of Houston's death, then pulled out of a performance in Nashville on Sunday night and flew to Los Angeles. He will rejoin New Edition Thursday night for a performance in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, according to a New Edition publicist. Brown considers performing as therapy to get him through a difficult time, a source close to Brown said. Foster said gospel singer Donnie McClurkin, actor-director Tyler Perry, producer Clive Davis, composer and music director Rickey Minor and Houston's cousin, Dionne Warwick, are among those on the program for the funeral. Minor, who worked with Houston, told CNN that he will be involved with the funeral's music and that the New Jersey Mass Choir will perform. The funeral in Newark will be in a much smaller, more intimate setting than the concert halls and arenas Houston packed during her heyday. The funeral will be made available for television and web streaming from New Hope Baptist Church, the house of worship where the singer grew up. There will not be a customary funeral procession, Newark police Director Samuel DiMaio said Thursday. Houston's family and her body will arrive at an undisclosed time, he said. ""I would advise the public that there really is going to be nothing to see here at the church,"" DiMaio said. ""The best thing to do would be to stay home and watch the service on television. .... The funeral is not gonna be the traditional procession that we would normally have."" A perimeter will be set up for four blocks in two directions, and two blocks in the other directions, DiMaio said. The closest the public will be able to get is a staging area two blocks away. Because of the police perimeter, a large screen will not be erected outside the church for the public to view the service. The church had said earlier it hoped such a screen could be in place. Authorities have no security concerns, DiMaio said, but the priority is protecting the privacy and safety of the family and invited guests. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced that he plans to have the state's flags fly at half-staff on Friday. Since then, Christie has been standing his ground against critics who disagree with his choice to use a tribute typically reserved to honor public officials who have died, or fallen soldiers and first-responders. One Twitter user weighed in, ""Our flag is to be used to honor true American heroes, the ones you just disrespected."" To that response, Christie seemed to agree to disagree. ""Many in the state are mourning the loss of a cultural icon in NJ's history,"" he wrote. ""We are recognizing her for those contributions."" Gospel singer and pastor Marvin L. Winans, a longtime friend of the Houston family, will give the eulogy at New Hope. Winans officiated at Houston's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown. Asked why no public memorial service was planned, Winans told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night the family didn't ""want to have a parade."" ""I don't think knowing Cissy (Houston's mother) and the Houston family ... it was a matter of public or private as it was, 'This is my daughter,' 'This is my sister,' 'This is my mother,' 'This is my friend,' and we want to do this with dignity."" The family's thinking, Winans told ""AC360,"" is ""we loved her when she was Nippy (a nickname) in New Jersey. The world loves her because of her voice. But if Nippy could not sing, the Houston family would love her."" Although the family is not commenting on Houston's burial location, her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey. The cemetery confirmed that Houston's father, John Russell Houston, is buried at Fairview. Publicists and entertainers as of Thursday had confirmed a dozen celebrities and personalities will be in some of the 1,500 coveted, ""invitation-only"" seats. Among those on the guest list are singer Chaka Khan, actress Angela Bassett, Bebe & CeCe Winans, songwriter Diane Warren, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, pop singer Darlene Love, Bishop T.D. Jakes, Antonio ""L.A."" Reid, hip hop artist Ray J and singer Brandy. Chaka Khan was a close friend of Houston. Reid produced many of Houston's songs and Jakes co-produced Houston's last film, ""Sparkle,"" which is scheduled to be released this summer. Houston and Jakes are listed as producers. Jakes will also be speaking at the funeral. He said Thursday, ""I think the major focus is to comfort the family and not to try to provide answers for which there are no answers. ""People often try to reconcile in their own minds why did this happen, and I think, sometimes, over the years, I've learned that when you really try to over-answer and speak on behalf of God, you get yourself in trouble."" He said he wants to encourage Houston's family to ""use their faith as a catalyst to continue on their journey, to learn life lessons from the gift of Whitney Houston. Both her strengths and weaknesses teach us something about life and cause us to reflect on ourselves.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Additional information received recently by a United Nations watchdog group raises new concerns about the intent of Iran's nuclear program. ""Based on the agency's analysis of additional information which has come to its attention since August 2008, including new information recently received, there are further concerns which the agency also needs to clarify with Iran,"" the confidential report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated in a section about a potential military dimension to the program. The report, obtained Friday, does not elaborate on the new information. However, it does discuss possible nuclear activities tied to Iran's military ""including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile."" The IAEA assessment appears to be in sync with a new U.S. intelligence community report. According to a U.S. official, the National Intelligence Estimate concludes that Iran has resumed research on building a warhead. The official, who is familiar with the report but is not authorized to speak for attribution about the sensitive document, said there is no indication Iran is manufacturing any components, but ""research on weaponization is moving forward."" The new National Intelligence Estimate updates a controversial assessment in 2007, which indicated Iran had stopped work on its weaponization program in 2003. Many western intelligence services disagreed with the U.S. conclusion at the time. At a recent U.S. Senate hearing, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper appeared to allude to the latest assessment, telling senators that Iran ""continues to advance its uranium enrichment capabilities along with what appears to be the scientific, technical and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons if its leaders choose to do so."" Iran claims its uranium enrichment program is intended for civilian energy purposes, however the United States and others maintain Iran is seeking to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. The new IAEA report indicates that Iran is continuing to enrich uranium despite a U.N. prohibition. Former nuclear weapons inspector David Albright said he would have expected the enrichment rate to be higher based on earlier performance. He said the Iranians might be having ongoing problems with centrifuges, some of which could be after-effects of the STUXNET computer worm that reportedly infected the system last year. Iran continues to use the less sophisticated IR-1 centrifuge machines. But according to the report, Iran has notified the IAEA of its intentions to install two new 164 centrifuge cascades comprised of IR-2 and IR-4 centrifuges. Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, says the more advanced machines should significantly increase the production of enriched uranium at a lower failure rate. The IAEA chastised Iran for its continued stonewalling of the agency. ""Iran is not providing the necessary cooperation to enable the agency to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear materials in Iran is in peaceful activities,"" the report said. Albright noted a tonal shift in the latest assessment. ""The IAEA seems to be running out of patience with Iran,"" said Albright, adding, ""this could lead to more sanctions"" against Iran by the international community.","New report indicates concern about a possible military dimension to the program .

"Moscow (CNN) -- The lower house of the Russian parliament gave preliminary approval Friday to START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between Russia and the United States. The State Duma voted 350-58 in favor of the accord Friday. It needed 225 votes to pass. Two more readings are required before the treaty can go to the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, for consideration. The first of those two readings will happen in mid-January. The U.S. Senate approved the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, by a 71-26 vote on Wednesday. The treaty is considered a critical component of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the Obama administration's attempt to ""reset"" relations between the United States and Russia. It would resume inspections of each country's nuclear arsenal while limiting both the United States and Russia to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers. The accord ""will strengthen our country's security (and) international stability, consolidate the non-proliferation regime, and become an additional factor encouraging positive trends both in our relations with the U.S. and on the international arena in general,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during the debate that preceded the vote. Lavrov, however, criticized a resolution passed by the U.S. Senate stating that treaty should not be interpreted in a way that could restrict the development of America's missile defense system. The resolution, which references language in the treaty's preamble highlighting the link between strategic offensive and defensive weapons, ""is a random interpretation of the principles and norms of international law,"" Lavrov asserted. ""This treaty must be adopted in full, without any exemptions,"" Lavrov said. ""The link between strategic offensive and defensive weapons was documented in a legally binding form."" President Barack Obama, who recently called the treaty ""the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades,"" discussed the accord with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev during a phone conversation on Thursday. ""President Medvedev congratulated President Obama on the Senate's approval of the new START Treaty, and the two leaders agreed that this was an historic event for both countries and for U.S.-Russia relations,"" a White House statement said. The pact ""will enhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them,"" Obama added. The U.S. Senate's approval of the treaty gave Obama a key victory on what has been considered one of his top foreign policy priorities. The treaty will ""serve as the basis of our security in the coming years,"" Medvedev said.

"(CNN) -- If there is one institution that has made a point of desperately trying to keep women in their place, it's organized religion. Whether it's Christianity, Islam or Judaism, women are often relegated to secondary roles, their contributions seen as insignificant. In the Catholic Church, that is taken a step further by refusing to even allow women to become priests. Now, some Catholic churches are alienating women by refusing to allow girls to serve as altar servants. In South Riding, Virginia, at Corpus Christi Catholic Church, the Rev. Michael Taylor announced that the church will no longer train girls to be altar servants. That angered one woman at the church, who spoke to the Washington Post about the decision. According to the Post: ""Taylor, who did not return phone calls for comment, wrote in the parish bulletin that he hoped the church would 'create opportunities, and perhaps clubs' for girls as a way to help them find ways to serve the church, rather than serving at the altar."" The Roman Catholic Church of Phoenix has also ceased allowing girls to serve as altar servants, angering some there by taking such a hard-line stance. It would behoove these priests and archbishops to actually open up their Bibles and realize that were it not for women, there might never have been Christianity. The Catholic Church regards Peter as its first pope, teaching that it was Jesus who gave Peter and the other disciples the direction to create the church. According to Matthew 16:17-20, Jesus said to Peter: ""Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."" Yet the Bible also records that when Jesus was crucified, his disciples were scared to death of being killed themselves, so it was left to the female followers of Jesus to stand guard to pray and weep as he hung on the cross. John 19:25 says Jesus' mother, Mary, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene all were standing vigil. No men. No disciples. No apostles. When Jesus was thirsty, the women, not a male disciple, gave him something to drink, before he died. When Jesus wasn't found in the tomb, who made that discovery? A woman, Mary Magdalene, not one of his disciples. When Mary went to get Peter and another disciple to show them that Jesus was gone, they saw for themselves, and went back into hiding ""with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders"" (John 20:19). Who was left to be visited by two angels and Jesus? No, not one of his male believers, but a crying Mary Magdalene! According to the account in John 20, Jesus told Mary, ""Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"" When Mary Magdalene did as ordered, the disciples, the fervent male followers of Jesus, didn't even believe her. The Gospel of John records that Jesus had to show up for them to even believe that he had died and risen to heaven. Now just imagine the Christian faith if women had not been standing guard. If women weren't as vigilant in believing in Jesus Christ, there might not even be a Christian church today. That means no popes, no cardinals, no archbishops, no priests and no altar boys. When I was an altar boy for years at Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church in Houston, the role was simple: to serve as a helper to the priest. Folks, there is nothing I did as an altar boy that a young woman couldn't do. Nothing. This decision by Catholic Church leaders in Arizona and Virginia is nonsensical and unnecessary. All it does is drive a wedge through believers in the body of Christ, instead of expanding ways in which people can serve the church. Such ignorance is one of the reasons why nondenominational Christian churches are growing at a faster rate than those associated with a denomination. As long as churches erect barriers to serving for believers, they will not be seen as welcoming places to worship. Allowing women to serve as altar servants is the right thing to do; it's biblical. If women were good enough to stand guard and care for Jesus Christ, I'm sure their female descendants are good enough to care for the church he commissioned. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Organized religion has long tried to keep women in their place, says Roland Martin .

"(CNN) -- As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in the constitutionality of the health care reform law, CNN spoke with two experts on opposing sides of the issue. Ron Pollack is the founding executive director of Families USA, a 30-year-old nonprofit supporting ""the achievement of high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans."" The group worked with the Obama administration and members of Congress to help pass the Affordable Care Act. (Karen Harned of the National Federation of Independent Business is against the health care reform law. Read her viewpoint here). The following interview with Pollack is edited for clarity and brevity: . CNN: From your perspective, what does the Affordable Care Act accomplish? Pollack: ""ACA moves us very close to achieving health coverage for everyone. The only people who would be excluded would be people who immigrated to the country and do not have documentation. Those who currently have coverage in the workplace will continue to do so. In fact, small businesses, which have the greatest difficulty paying for health care coverage for their workers, are already receiving tax credit subsidies to make such employer-supported insurance more affordable."" Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' CNN: What is your message to the Supreme Court as they take on this legal challenge? Pollack: ""I think that the claims that have been made challenging the constitutional validity of different portions of the ACA are very weak claims. It's my hope that the justices protect the law and allow the law to go into effect. It's reform that's way overdue, it really is going to help the American public, even if much of the public is not even aware of the provisions that have yet to be implemented. And it's my hope that the court allows these provisions to go into effect. I think as these provisions do, they will be very popular."" CNN: Does the fact it is an election year make this health care issue more politically charged? Pollack: ""We took 16 of the key elements of the ACA and compared them to the Massachusetts health reform [supported by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, now a leading Republican candidate for president], and they're virtually identical. This criticism of the ACA is more political than it is substantive. The reforms that were adopted in Massachusetts truly were a model for the ACA and even Gov. Romney at one point not too long ago indicated that he thought it would be a good model for the nation. ""Much of the ideas that are not considered controversial were ideas that were originally introduced by Republicans. Having this new marketplace called exchanges -- that's a Republican idea. It's creating a private marketplace for private insurance. I don't think that, innately, these are controversial items. They've become controversial because of the politics of the moment. If President Obama supports something, Republicans will oppose it, not because they opposed it in the past."" CNN: What are some of the major changes? Pollack: ""50 million uninsured -- most people can't grasp that figure -- will get coverage in two main ways. The law provides for an expansion of the Medicaid program. If you either live alone or in a household that has income below 133% of the poverty level, then you will be eligible for Medicaid. In 42 states, you could be penniless and not qualify for coverage -- adults with no children. The ACA creates a floor under which nobody can fall. Two families, two viewpoints on health reform . ""The second change is for people with incomes just above 133% [of the poverty level]. For many of those people, it's unaffordable -- $14,000 on average for family coverage. The new law allows you to go into a new private marketplace -- called exchanges -- and you can select an insurance plan that's in the exchange. You will get a tax credit subsidy to make the premiums more affordable. ""Right now, people seeking insurance when they have pre-existing conditions, are told: 'We're not going to sell insurance to you.' Or if they can get insurance: 'We're not going to cover the condition that drove you to desire the coverage. We're not going to cover your diabetes, your asthma.' That affects huge numbers of people. The people who need insurance the most are going to get this protection. The companies also cannot charge discriminatory premiums. ""A huge portion of the population that has insurance is limited on how much the insurance will pay out. Those limitations come in two forms -- we're not going to pay out more than 'x' number of dollars per year, and we're not going to pay more than 'y' dollars over the life of the insurance policy. The ACA eliminates both of those. ""A significant portion of the premium does not actually go to your health care -- instead [it goes] to advertising and marketing, administrative costs, agents' fees, profits. The ACA now places limitations on how much can be spent for those nonhealth benefit costs from your premium dollars. For small plans, at least 80 cents on the dollar must be spent on actual coverage. For larger plans, it's 85 cents on the dollar. The law is going to create some cost efficiencies."" CNN: You argue seniors also benefit under the law. Pollack: ""There are a host of insurance market reforms that are very valuable. For senior citizens , you don't think of them as uninsured. However, seniors have significant gaps in coverage. Two of the most prominent gaps are dealt with in the ACA. ""For prescriptions, three-quarters of the cost is covered. Then around $2,500, you go into a no-coverage zone, euphemistically called the 'doughnut hole.' At that point, you're on your own. The ACA eliminates that hole in coverage. ""Medicare requires out-of-pocket cost for preventive care. Now there's no out-of-pocket costs. It tries to move Medicare from a sick-care coverage to a health-care coverage. You can get you checkup each year, tests, screenings, that some people don't get because they have to pay out of pocket and as a result, the condition does not get diagnosed in a timely manner.""","Ron Pollack is the founding executive director of advocate group Families USA .

He says criticisms that the health law is unconstitutional are ""very weak claims""
People with pre-existing conditions need the law's protections, Pollack says ."
