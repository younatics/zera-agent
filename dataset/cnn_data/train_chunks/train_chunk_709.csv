The new uniforms to be worn by the U.S. snowboarding team may be a patchwork of patriotic red, white and blue, but the designs are not made in the USA.Their uniforms, unveiled by manufacturer Burton Tuesday night, are built around the competition jacket with squares of stars, stripes and plaids.The company is now defending its choice to use foreign labor and fabrics to produce the uniforms, which will be worn in 2014 in Sochi. A patchwork of countries: The women's (left) and men's (right) uniform's various elements come from China, Taiwan, Japan and Italy . Fox News reports that Vermont-based Burton claims it's impossible to produce uniforms of high technical standards without going abroad. 'To achieve this level of performance and function, Burton turned to its best, long-standing and most trusted technical partners around the world to produce the uniforms, to ensure that our high technical and design standards were met,' Burton Snowboards said in materials obtained by Fox News. 'For example, the original quilt was sourced in the U.S. and brought back to Vermont to be deconstructed and reconstructed for jacket fabrication with Vermont-based designers.' The design was inspired by a handcrafted patchwork quilt spotted at an antiques fair, according to the company. The way the fabric is printed, no two items with the quilt fabric are quite the same. The uniform includes base-layer henleys, warm-up pants, fleeces and five-pocket corduroy snowpants. Men and women competitors will wear more or less the same look. High-tech: A polyester henley t-shirt and pants made of a waterproof corduroy pant fabric that was developed in Taiwan and sewn in Vietnam . 'The vintage quilt and flag print of . the jacket combined with the corduroy pants give the uniform an . 'heirloom hippie' vibe that lines up with snowboarding's laid-back . culture while paying respect to America's longstanding creative . heritage. It will stand out in Sochi for sure,' said Greg Dacyshyn, . chief creative officer, in a statement. The . fabric, however, is high-tech with exterior layers of proprietary . waterproof and breathable laminates developed in conjunction with the . U.S. Army Natick Research, Development & Engineering Center. Various . components of the uniforms were made in different places due to the . specificity of the performance materials, Burton said. For example, the . fabric was printed in Japan and the corduroy made in Taiwan. 'And finally, the majority of the . actual snowboards that the Burton athletes will ride in Sochi are being . handmade in Vermont at Burton Headquarters in Burlington. As a global . sport, snowboarding knows no borders. We’re proud that we used our best . vendors from around the world, including our own Craig’s facility in . Burlington, Vt., to ensure our American riders have the . highest-performance gear during one of the biggest competitions of their . lives,' the statement concludes, reports Fox News. Foreign made: Ralph Lauren was criticized for his 2012 Summer Olympic uniform which was made overseas . Uniforms made by Ralph Lauren for U.S. athletes at the 2012 London Summer Olympics were criticized for being made overseas. Olympic athletes are outfitted during their competitive events by individual, sport-specific manufacturers.

Jailed: Sergeant Alexander Blackman was jailed for at least ten years for murdering a badly wounded Taliban insurgent . The Royal Marine jailed for at least ten years for murdering a badly wounded Taliban insurgent should have his sentence halved to a maximum of five years. That is the overwhelming view of the public in a poll conducted for The Mail on Sunday – the first survey since the sentence was imposed on Sergeant Alexander Blackman. A total of 39 per cent disagree with the ten-year minimum life sentence for Sgt Blackman, with 37 per cent in favour. However, almost six out of ten say he should serve a maximum of five years behind bars. And one in three say he should not be locked up at all. The . results of the Survation poll come amid continuing controversy over the . jailing of the Marine, who was dismissed in disgrace for a ‘cold . blooded killing’ that had ‘tarnished’ the good name of the British . Forces. The sentence . has also divided politicians. Senior Tory and former Defence Minister . Sir Gerald Howarth criticised the sentence and said he believes five . years is sufficient punishment for Sgt Blackman. Sir . Gerald, MP for Army garrison town Aldershot, told The Mail on Sunday: . ‘The Afghanistan war is as brutal as any we have seen – and only one . side is fighting in accordance with the Geneva Convention. The Taliban . routinely string the limbs of our dead soldiers up on trees. ‘The highest standard of discipline must be maintained in the Armed Forces and this man obviously committed an offence. But ten years is too much. Five years would be more appropriate. The court should have paid greater attention to this soldier’s fine record in the Army and that he had done several tours of duty in Afghanistan.’ Sgt Alexander Wayne Blackman: A total of 39 per cent disagree with the ten-year minimum life sentence for Sgt Blackman, with 37 per cent in favour . Senior Tory and former Defence Minister Sir Gerald Howarth criticised the sentence and said he believes five years is sufficient punishment for Sgt Blackman . Sir Gerald was backed by Left-wing MP and former soldier Eric Joyce, who argued: ‘It is ridiculous to treat Sgt Blackman like someone who has carried out a premeditated murder in civvy street. ‘I doubt whether the judge has the first idea of what it is like to be on the battlefield when bullets are flying around. If the legal system cannot make allowances for that, then it should be changed. Clearly, this man should go to jail, but five years is enough.’ But former Lib Dem leader and ex-Royal Marine Lord Paddy Ashdown, who was an MP for Somerset, where Sgt Blackman lives, strongly disagreed. He said: ‘I am content with the judge’s decision. We go into these countries to defend the law so we cannot break it. If we do so, the law must take its natural course and it has.’ Asked whether they agree with the ten-year minimum jail sentence, the Survation poll suggests narrow opposition to the ruling among the public. However, the strength of feeling that he has been treated too harshly emerges clearly in response to a more detailed question. When asked what punishment Sgt Blackman deserves, 35 per cent of voters say no jail sentence, 23 per cent say he should serve five years, 20 per cent back ten years, and 22 per cent say he should serve more than ten years. A family friend said Sgt Blackman’s wife Claire was ‘incredibly grateful’ for the public’s support.

Anne Wojciki, the estranged wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, says her genetic testing startup 23andMe will continue to operate despite being ordered to stop providing its most popular service - health-related DNA tests - after being pursued by the Food and Drug Administration. On November 22, the FDA demanded the company stop marketing its DNA testing device, which uses a person's saliva to gather ancestry data and determine whether they are prone to certain medical conditions. At issue is the fact the device is used to diagnose diseases, but 23andME do not have government approval to give out such information. The agency warned that erroneous results could cause customers to seek unnecessary or ineffective medical care. The FDA dispute follows a $5 million class action lawsuit filed by a customer, who claimed its ads are misleading and that the results are not supported by scientific evidence. Sergey Brin - who founded Google with Larry Page - and wife Anne Wojcicki - CEO of genetic testing company 23andMe - confirmed they had separated in August. Wojcicki has said her startup will continue to operate despite a government order to stop its most popular service, DNA-tested health results showing whether people are prone to certain diseases . California start up 23andMe uses a saliva sample to DNA test people for ancestry information and whether they are prone to over 250 diseases and health conditions. However the FDA say they do not have government approval to give out such medical information . 23andMe customers receive a tube in the mail which they returned to the company with a saliva sample. For $99, they receive back DNA test results detailing their ancestry and whether or not they are at risk to more than 250 diseases and health conditions. 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki says her company is now complying with FDA requirements . Founded by Wojcicki in 2006 - along with Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza, who have both now left the company - 23andMe has for years walked a fine line with the FDA, because it sits on the border of giving scientific information and providing a medical test. Both sides have struggled to determine how the company should be regulated. Now, in order to comply with the FDA but keep the company running, 23andMe say customers will still be able to download their own raw data, but it will be 'without interpretation'. 'We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our long-term mission to help people everywhere have access to their own genetic data and have the ability to use that information to improve their lives,' Wojcicki said in a statement. 'Our goal is to work cooperatively with the FDA to provide that opportunity in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefit to people and the validity of the science that underlies the test. 'The company will continue to provide consumers both ancestry-related information and raw genetic data without interpretation. 'In addition, the company will continue to conduct research using its database of genetic and phenotypic data, and also will continue its educational efforts.' In a letter published Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg insisted that regulatory review of 23andMe is necessary, but that the agency saw value in 23andMe's approach. 'We agree that access to tests through a direct-to-consumer model will allow consumers to take a more active role in certain aspects of their health,' she wrote. 'The agency’s desire to review these particular tests is solely to ensure that they are safe, do what they claim to do and that the results are communicated in a way that a consumer can understand.' 23andMe is based in Mountain View, Calif. For $99, customers send back a spit kit to 23andMe containing a saliva sample (pictured) which is used for a genetics test. The company will continue to provide customers with the 'raw data' of their test results, however it will be 'without interpretation' In August it was reported Wojcicki and Brin, one of Sillicon Valley's highest-profile couple, were living apart. A spokesman for Brin and Wojcicki confirmed that 'they have been living apart for several months' 'They remain good friends and partners,' the spokesman said. Brin and Wojcicki, both 40 years old, had been married for six years and have two children. They are not yet legally separated. 23andMe was underwritten by a $3.9 million investment from Google in 2006, along with Genentech, New Enterprise Associates and Mohr Davidow Ventures. Brin has separately invested in the company over the years as well.","23andMe is a California-based startup that uses saliva samples to perform DNA tests tracing ancestry data .

His widow Deanne is struggling to come to terms with his death . Tragic: Ronald Westbrook, who had Alzheimer's, was shot dead as he tried to get into a stranger's home . 'I can't imagine him feeling threatened by my husband, that's what surprises me,' Mrs Westbrook said. 'I think he was so cold. He was looking . for help when he was ringing that doorbell at their place. I think he . just wanted somebody to help him.' Her husband, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force had taken to collecting other people's mail as part of his deterioration from Alzheimer's. His night time ramblings led him to the porch of Joe Hendrix, 34, who had recently moved to the property and had already been spooked by strangers hammering on the door. As Mr Hendrix's financee called 911 the 34-year-old confronted the stranger outside his house and, when Mr Westbrook walked towards the house without identifying himself, Mr Hendrix fired. When police arrived Mr Westbrook was dead, with his beloved rottweiler standing guard over his body.

I was prepared for the Alzheimer's to get . worse and for me to take care of him here. And I was going to do it,' Mrs Westbrook said. 'I understand the man who shot him is real upset, and I think he should be,' she added. 'He shot an innocent man. He should have stayed in the house like a normal person would.' On November 19 a stranger appears at the  home Joe Hendrix's fiancee is renting at about midnight and begins demanding to speak to the previous tenant. Frightened and home alone with two children, she calls Mr Hendrix and police but the man disappears before they arrive.

He was shortly afterwards spotted shopping for books in a nearby Waterstones, a retailer with 300 branches, before popping into Caffe Nero, which has 600 branches . Politicians from all major parties were keen to be seen visiting their local shops, advertising their presence to their followers on social media. Mr Cameron said of the event: 'Small businesses are the lifeblood of our country - essential for building a resilient, sustainable economy and a central part of my long-term economic plan for Britain. 'They account for 99 in every 100 businesses and keep more than 11 million people in work so this isn't about sentimentality, it's about the future of Britain, creating jobs and turning our economy around. 'I'm determined that we back them in every way we can - that's what today is all about and that's what this Government is about.' But political opponents suggested that Mr Cameron's actions spoke louder than his words. Responding to the message by Aylesbury Waterstones, shadow business minister Toby Perkins tweeted sarcastically: 'Tell him thanks for his support for #SmallBizSatUK.' Mr Perkins added: '@david_cameron probably thinks @waterstonesayl IS a small business! #SmallBizSatUK.'

The group were in Miss Bean's car in the parking lot at about 2am when a vehicle with two people in it backed into them, knocking the fender off. Ms Warren, a Criminal Justice graduate from Cal State Sacramento, got out to inspect the damage and words were exchanged, according to Tiffany Renee. A man who was in the car then opened fire, shooting Ms Warren in the head and hitting Miss Bean in the side. The car that had run into them drove away, and one of the attackers fled on foot police said. No arrests have been made. Both women were taken to hospital, where Ms Warren was declared dead and Miss Bean is said to be in serious condition.

Ken Barrows, whose apartment looks over the parking lot where Ms Warren was shot, said he heard arguing followed by gunfire. 'I heard the arguing ... it wasn't really that bad,' Mr Barrows told ABC 7. '[It] didn't really catch my attention. And then I heard gunshots and that's when I looked out the window.' Tiffany Renee, who had been in a relationship with Ms Warren for five years, said: 'She was the most loving, compassionate, kindhearted person that you would ever meet, with the biggest smile ever.'

Scores of grey seal pups are feared to have died after being swept from beaches by last week’s devastating surge tide. The National Trust confirmed that 263 pups were reported missing on Thursday night from a breeding colony at Horsey Gap, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. A rescue operation is under way after about 190 of the pups were washed up alive on nearby beaches, along with the bodies of several others. The rest are feared drowned. An unknown number of pups are also missing from the National Trust reserve at Blakeney Point in north Norfolk, along with 20 from an offshore colony at Scroby Sands, near Great Yarmouth. Tragedy: A dead seal pup washed up on Heacham beach in Norfolk after being swept from a breeding colony by strong tides . The RSPCA rescue centre at East Winch, near King’s Lynn, took in 17 pups on Friday and 20 more yesterday – on top of the 50 it was already looking after. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘We are concerned about the pups as it is the height of the pupping season and they are vulnerable. Our inspectors are patrolling beaches between Great Yarmouth and Cromer and responding to reports of seals that have washed up. We are taking them in if they are distressed or injured.’ Eilish Rothney of the Friends of Horsey Seals said 130 of the 190 pups that had washed up were under three weeks old and needed their mothers’ milk. She said: ‘It is possible many of them might die.’ A National Trust spokesman said seal pups washed up on beaches should only be approached by wildlife experts from approved groups or RSPCA staff. Survivor: One of the lucky survivors pictured on a beach in Norfolk after the strong tides . Many of the pups that have been rescued are less than three weeks old and still need to be fed by their mothers . The spokesman said: ‘Please do not attempt to move them or encourage them to return to the sea.’ Meanwhile, it has emerged that residents who ignored warnings to evacuate seaside homes at risk of flooding last week were asked to sign disclaimer forms by police. The forms stated that anyone who signed accepted that they were putting themselves at risk from sea water ‘up to a depth of three metres’ by staying in their homes. A clause added that emergency services would be ‘stretched to their capacity’ in the event of flooding, meaning people might not be rescued until waters had subsided. More than 1,000 residents of Jaywick, near Clacton, Essex, were asked to sign after refusing to evacuate on Thursday. Men take pictures of a seal pup as they try to move it away away from a house which fell into the sea during a storm surge in Hemsby, eastern England . This photograph shows the mass flooding experienced across north Lincolnshire following high tides . One villager said: ‘I got the impression they wanted me to sign as  they were worried about being sued if I drowned.’ In the event, the water was kept back by the sea wall at Jaywick when the surge tide struck in the early hours of Friday and no homes were flooded. An Essex Police spokesman confirmed leaflets were handed out in Jaywick but added: ‘It was not done to absolve emergency services of responsibility should the occupants have got into difficulty.’ A clean-up operation was still under way yesterday after 1,400 homes and businesses around Britain were flooded. One of the worst affected areas was Boston, Lincolnshire, where 300 homes were flooded. Five clifftop bungalows were washed away at Hemsby, near Great Yarmouth. The Environment Agency said damage had been minimised by improved flood defences, protecting at least 800,000 homes. Workers assess the damage caused by the sea surge to Scarborough Foreshore, at North Bay, in Scarborugh .

Furious animal-lovers are threatening to boycott the RSPCA after the charity abandoned a free service reuniting owners with missing pets. Distraught owners who call Britain’s largest animal charity to report lost pets are now being directed to a little-known website where they have to pay to post details of their missing animals. Until this month, people who reported lost pets or strays to the RSPCA national hotline or online would typically have the pet’s details passed on to the charity’s network of local centres and branches. Furious animal-lovers are threatening to boycott the RSPCA after the charity abandoned a free service reuniting animals with missing pets (file picture) But now, callers are referred to the Pets Located website – run by  an animal-lover businesswoman based in Northamptonshire – which charges £12 to log lost pets, though listings for ‘found’ pets are free. The RSPCA – which has been accused of ignoring the plight of animals while it pursues ‘naked political campaigns’ on issues such as fox-hunting – said the change was to free up its cruelty hotline to deal with calls relating to sick, injured or suffering animals. But many of the charity’s supporters are mystified as to why it has entered into the new arrangement when there are numerous pet  websites already providing free lost and found services. Di Fowler, an RSPCA volunteer in Hampshire, said: 'I don’t see why anyone should spend money on something you can get free. We work our socks off to fund raise funds and help people with pets. This will give the RSPCA a bad name.’ Dog-lover Belinda Bauer, 50, from Cardiff, is threatening to cancel her direct debit to the RSPCA. She said: ‘The Pets Located scheme charges distraught owners for listing their dogs, when there are well-organised sites offering this service for free.’ Fees: The Pets Located website where animal lovers are charged to find lost pets . Critics have posted comments on social networking sites such as Facebook suggesting the new arrangement must be an RSPCA money-making ploy, a claim the charity has denied. Nick Smith, from Guernsey, said: ‘It really does not go down well for the RSPCA to recommend a website which is charging people when they are most vulnerable.’ And Hannah Brighton complained on the Pets Located Facebook page: ‘Cashing in on distraught pet owners is disgusting. You guys should be ashamed.’ The change has also sparked confusion as to why the charity did not approach the UK’s leading pet matching service, Dog Lost, which has reunited 30,000 owners with their pets. Heartbreak: Missing terrier Rags - her owner received only nine possible matches at Pets Located . Dog Lost also traces cats, horses and other animals and has 10,000 volunteers who search for missing pets and help console owners. Other free sites include Lurcher Search UK, Pets Bureau, Animal Search UK, Petpals, My Moggy,  K9 Search and Found And Lost Pets. Caroline Key, 62, from Birmingham, spent £24 hoping Pets Located could help trace her beloved terrier, Rags, who has been missing since September 2011. She said: ‘It’s a useless website. I’ve never had an email and I don’t know why the RSPCA is using it. It wouldn’t even let me register all of Rags’s distinctive markings and I got only nine possible matches.’ This compared with up to 40 matches on other websites, where no fees were charged. Catherine Inglis, 43, who founded Pets Located and runs a separate telemarketing company in Daventry, Northamptonshire, insisted there were no financial ties between her companies and the charity. She added: ‘It is possible someone only received nine matches. That could be because the person only asked to be told about close matches or it could be people have not found the dog matching that description.’ A spokesman for the RSPCA – which receives around £100 million a year in donations – said it had chosen Pets Located over a year ago as the only national service with ‘the most efficient website reuniting all animals with their owners, not just dogs or cats’.","Callers to the RSPCA now being directed to the Pets Located website .

Eleven more inquiries are to be held into the conduct of British soldiers while serving in Iraq, it has emerged. It comes after the High Court ruled that any allegations of Iraqi civilians dying in British custody must be investigated under human rights laws. In response, the Ministry of Defence has ordered that inquest-style hearings are held into the deaths of 11 Iraqi civilians who were killed while British troops operated in the country after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. Further inquiries: The conduct of British troops will be scrutinised at 11 hearings into the deaths of 11 Iraqi civilians during Iraq invasion (stock image) With each individual hearing taking approximately three months, the inquiries will cost the public purse around £2million, The Sunday Telegraph reports. The MoD inquiries will follow the format of an inquest and will be chaired by a former judge of QC. The High Court did reject demands for open inquiries but its ruled that the deaths must still be investigated under Article Two of the European Convention on Human Rights — the right to life. This has now opened the way for 160 . further cases of alleged British involvement in the deaths of Iraqis to . be brought forward for inquiry. Hearings could also be held into . nearly 800 allegations that British troops broke Article Three of the . Convention on Human Rights prohibiting torture. Jailed: Sergeant Alexander Blackman was jailed for at least ten years for murdering a badly wounded Taliban insurgent . A ministry spokesman said: 'We welcome the decision of the High Court to reject demands for a public inquiry into all allegations of wrongdoing by British forces in Iraq, which it argued would not be a reasonable or proportionate use of taxpayers’ money.' But the action has drawn criticism from MPs and military leaders alike. Colonel Tim Collins, who led 1st Bn the Royal Irish Regiment during the Iraq invasion, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The Human Rights Act has a lot to answer for. It has turned into a bean feast for ambulance-chasing lawyers. They are trying to apply the rules that you would to a fairground, to Her Majesty’s Armed Forces.' While Julian Brazier MP, a former SAS reservist who sits on the Commons defence committee, told the newspaper: 'I am firmly in favour of the military processes that are in place examining allegations of breaches of the Geneva Convention. This feast for human rights lawyers is an abuse of process, demoralising for the Armed Forces.' This latest revelation comes after the mounting backlash against the sentencing earlier this week of Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, for killing an injured Taliban captive in Afghanistan. Blackman was sentenced to life, serving a minimum of ten years, and was dishonourably discharged from the Royal Marines. Many have spoken out in his defence and have called for his prison sentence to be shortened. Lord Ashcroft has now also thrown his support behind Blackman, The Sunday Times reports. In a tweet yesterday, the former Tory party treasurer said: 'If asked, I would contribute towards the legal costs of Sergeant Blackman's appeal.' Support: Lord Michael Ashcroft is the latest to throw his support behind Sergeant Alexander Blackman - even offering to pay the legal fees of his appeal .","Inquest-style hearings will be held into the deaths of 11 Iraqi civilians .

Child safety campaigners hit out at Tesco yesterday after it emerged that its mobile phone network was the only one of Britain's main operators that had failed to apply a 'porn filter' Child safety campaigners hit out at Tesco yesterday after it emerged that its mobile phone network was the only one of Britain's main operators that had failed to apply a 'porn filter'. Experts said the supermarket's failure to install the filters on its phones showed shortcomings in the initiative unveiled by Prime Minister David Cameron in July. Mr Cameron succeeded in persuading . all mobile companies to agree that networks should protect children from . being able to find inappropriate content online. The companies signed . up to an agreement that means parental controls are automatically . switched on within phones. In . a speech to the NSPCC in July he announced: 'On mobile phones, it’s . great to report that all of the operators have now agreed to put adult . content filters onto phones automatically. 'And to deactivate them you . have to prove you’re over 18 and operators will continue to refine and . improve those filters.' Vodafone, O2, EE and Three have all introduced the filters but Tesco Mobile, which has 200,000 customers in Britain, has not. Britain’s . largest retailer also faced criticism for cultivating a family-friendly . image at the same time as failing to . install the filters. Tesco Mobile offers what it calls 'family perks' - special deals for customers who take two or more contracts out at once, such as parents who sign their children up for a phone contract when they take one out for themselves. A crossbench peer in the House of Lords . made the revelation during the second reading of the Online Safety Bill, . a Private Member's Bill she introduced in May. Dangers: Vodafone, O2, EE and Three have all introduced the filters but Tesco Mobile, which has 200,000 customers in Britain, has not (file picture) Baroness Howe of Ildicote said her bill would create a legal requirement for all mobile phone companies to install adult content filters, reported The Times. 'My Bill goes further than the Prime Minister has done so far. 'It introduces the missing element of legislative compulsion so that the industry really does make child internet safety a priority.' 'What we require is a robust system that affords children the same legal protections online as they enjoy offline, that delivers credible age verification and that covers all mobile phone operators and internet service providers.' Nola Leach, Chief Executive of the Christian charity CARE, urged the government to support the bill. 'The shocking revelation about Tesco Mobile shows that it is not enough to rely on voluntary agreeements with profit-making companies to keep our children safe. 'The law needs to be changed to protect children when using the internet,' she told The Times. Odd one out: Tesco faced criticism for its Mobile arm not yet introducing the porn filters David Cameron announced in July - despite Vodafone, O2, EE and Three having done so . She said the case of Tesco Mobile showed that a voluntary approach was not working and . as a result, 'children are being exposed to sexually explicit material . that the Prime Minister wrongly assured their parents they’d be safe . from'. John Carr, secretary of the Children's . Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety, told The Times: 'We don't have . anyone who can check the veracity of statements that companies make. We . need something urgently.' Tesco Mobile is jointly owned by Tesco . and O2 and runs on the O2 network in the UK. Industry sources told The . Times that the blocks should have operated on the Tesco Mobile network . as standard, but technical faults had so far prevented the network from . being able to apply them. Embarrassment: The revelation about Tesco may cause red faces in Downing Street after David Cameron gave assurances that all the major mobile operators had agreed to install porn filters . A spokesperson for Tesco Mobile told MailOnline that the reason the filters had not been installed was . because some of their old systems needed upgrading, but that the firm . was making these changes as a matter of 'absolute priority'. She . said: 'We currently direct our customers to our free parental controls . service which provides robust content management and this service can be . switched on at any time. 'From early 2014 we will also automatically . filter adult content on all handsets and customers will have to advise . if they wish filters to be removed.' The .

Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the 23,000-strong Magistrates’ Association in England and Wales, said courts were being closed, staff numbers were being ‘decimated’ and JPs themselves were ‘walking away’. Mr Monkhouse claimed magistrates had even been told by the Courts & Tribunals Service not to ‘engage’ with adult defendants to find out more about their background before passing sentence. In an article for Independent Monitor, a magazine for prison watchdogs, he explained: ‘The thought is a five-minute conversation with an offender is going to multiply up into extra days’ sittings.’ Mr Monkhouse pointed out that colleagues in youth courts were encouraged to talk to defendants. ‘By what logic  does an offender reach the age of 18 and suddenly be excluded?’ he asked. A magistrate for more than  a decade, Mr Monkhouse said that discussions could lead  to the disclosure of issues  such as substance abuse or homelessness. However, courtrooms ‘increasingly are focused more towards cost  and efficiency than justice’. Since Coalition cuts took hold, 89 magistrates courts across England and Wales have closed, along with 48 county courts used for civil cases.

Europe’s biggest brothel spanning nearly 20,000 square feet, costing £3.8million and employing nearly 100 working girls is poised to open in Germany. Building work is already underway on the ‘mega bordello’ as it has been dubbed in the German media as prostitution continues to flourish in the country where the world's oldest profession has been recognised since 2001 as a legal one too. But for many residents of the city on the border with France, the house of ill repute is one too many in a community already overflowing with sex parlours. Red light alert: Building work on the brothel in Saarbruecken is under way . The centre-left SPD mayoress, Charlotte Britz, is apprehensive of the social strains on the city, stating: ‘Prostitution has assumed unbearable proportions here.’ And bemoaning the labyrinthine planning regulations in her homeland, she said: ‘Businesses like this find it is easy to get permission. In fact, it is easier to open a brothel in Saarbruecken than it is a chip shop.’ She is calling for the state government to introduce a higher sex tax that would at least pay dividends back into city coffers. Employer: It's thought that around 100 prostitutes will work at the hangar-style brothel . Tentatively named Paradise Island, the aircraft-hangar style building is expected to employ at least half its staff from the Polish, Hungarian, Romanian and Bulgarian prostitutes already operating in other sex establishments in the city. Saarbruecken became a magnet for eastern European working girls when the EU expanded its borders in 2007. There are over 1,000 registered sex workers in Saarbruecken, which has a population of 170,000 (stock image) There are over 1,000 registered sex workers in the city of 170,000 and probably three times that many working under the radar. Much of the custom comes from France where official attitudes to prostitution are not as relaxed as in Germany and the laws governing it more complex.  Huge number of new customers from the nearby cities of Nancy, Metz and the many small towns in-between are expected to break for the border when Paradise Island opens its doors in January 2014. Thomas Blug, media officer of the state of Saarland in which Saarbruecken sits, is deluged with media enquiries from newspapers around the world - both about the size of the brothel and the social tensions it is creating.  ’It is not only about Saarbruecken,’ he says, flustered.  ’This is also a European problem.’ Juergen Rudolf, who owns a chain of mega-brothels in Germany, and who is politely referred to in newspapers as 'King of the Knocking Shops', is behind the latest project. He took full advantage of Chancellor Schroeder's government decision back in 2001 giving legal rights to prostitutes to access health, insurance and pension benefits so long as they paid into the tax system. ‘This will be a great place for men to relax,’ he said, preferring to paint a picture of an establishment more in line with a gentlemen's club than an industrial-scale sex factory.  But prostitute activist groups representing many of the 400,000 registered hookers in the country, say that pimps and enforced prostitution, particularly among migrants, continues to thrive and that efforts to register prostitution have largely failed. Saarbruecken residents are fearful of a rise in street crime and violence when the new bordello opens.  They are also mourning the loss of their city's once enviable reputation for fine dining and a laid-back way of living.","The brothel, being built in Saarbruecken, will employ nearly 100 working girls .

This is because many were thought to have been direct descendants of cold-blooded reptiles such as crocodiles. New research from scientists at the University of Adelaide casts serious doubts on this theory and they claim dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex were actually warm blooded like birds and mammals. The researchers add that if the dinosaurs did have cold blood they have would not have had the required muscular power to prey on other animals as they did throughout the Mesozoic period, and could not have competed well against mammal-like dinosaurs of the same size. Australian scientists believe that dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex (pictured) had warm blood like birds and mammals. They claim that if they were cold-blooded they wouldn't have had the muscular power to chase food or run from predators . Dinosaurs living during the Mesozoic period - between 252 and 66 million years ago - include the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus. The current school of thought believes that dinosaurs behaved like saltwater crocodiles. Large saltwater . crocodiles can achieve a body temperature above 30 degrees by basking in the . sun, and it can maintain the high temperature overnight simply by being . large and slow to change temperature. Scientists believe that cold blooded . dinosaurs could have done the same and enjoyed a warm body temperature . without the need to generate the heat in their own cells through burning . food energy like warm blooded animals. However, Professor Roger Seymour from Adelaide University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences questions how much muscular power could be produced by a cold-blooded crocodile-like dinosaur compared to a mammal-like dinosaur of the same size. In his paper, Professor Seymour demonstrated that a . 200kg crocodile can produce only about 14 per cent of the . muscular power of a mammal at peak exercise and this fraction seems to . decrease at larger body sizes. Professor Seymour questions how much muscular power could be produced by a crocodile-like dinosaur compared to a mammal-like dinosaur of the same size. Saltwater crocodiles (pictured) have a reputation for being extremely powerful animals but aren't as strong as they appear . The saltwater crocodile is the largest of all living reptiles and the largest terrestrial and riparian predator in the world. They live in salt water, mangrove swamps, estuaries, deltas, lagoons and parts of rivers. The males grow to seven metres long and weigh as much as 2,000 kg. They have the strongest bite of any animal today and are ambush predators. Saltwater crocodiles are about 50 per cent muscle but produce less power than a mammal at peak exercise. Saltwater crocodiles can weigh over a tonne and being about 50 per cent muscle, have a reputation for being extremely powerful animals. However, they are not as powerful as they look. Scientists at Monash University, the University of California and Wildlife Management International in the Northern Territory drew from blood and muscle lactate measurements from the crocodiles. Professor Roger Seymour of the University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said: 'Much can be learned about dinosaurs from . fossils but the question of whether dinosaurs were warm blooded or . cold blooded is still hotly debated among scientists.' 'The results further show that . cold blooded crocodiles lack not only the absolute power for exercise, . but also the endurance, that are evident in warm blooded mammals,' said . Professor Seymour. Cold blooded crocodiles lack the power for exercise and the endurance that are evident in warm-blooded mammals. A crocodile-like dinosaur could not compete well against a mammal-like dinosaur of the same size, said Professor Seymour . 'So, despite the impression that saltwater crocodiles are extremely powerful animals, a crocodile-like dinosaur could not compete well against a mammal-like dinosaur of the same size. 'Dinosaurs dominated over mammals in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Mesozoic. To do that they must have had more muscular power and greater endurance than a crocodile-like physiology would have allowed.' His latest evidence adds to that of earlier work he did on blood flow to leg bones, which concluded that the dinosaurs were possibly even more active than mammals.","For decades scientists believed dinosaurs were cold blooded .
Australian scientists now claim that if the dinosaurs did have cold blood they would not have had the muscular power to prey on other animals ."

A criminal gang that killed and skinned cats before selling them to restaurants as rabbits has been caught by Chinese officials. The group, operating for more than a year, bought strays for 10 Yuan (£1) and sold them on for a mark up to markets and diners all over the country, it has emerged. Operating from a secret warehouse in the city of Huai'an, eastern China, they had a network of transport links that would liaise between them and their clients. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Slaughter: Animal hygiene officers broke an operation where stray cats are killed, skinned and sold as rabbits . A lorry would arrive two or three times a week to transport hundreds of cats to customers, neighbours claim. Residents told local media they have reported the warehouse a number of times but nothing was done. Last week, in an early morning raid, hygiene officers surrounded the slaughter house before arresting several suspects. They also found 60 live, caged cats and more than 30 dead cats in a freezer during the 4.30am raid. Horrific: More than 30 dead cats were found in a freezer in the operation that has been running for over a year . Criminal: Officers raided the warehouse in Huai'an, eastern China, at 4.30am last week to find the horror .

It is the latest incident in a long-term battle to crack down on the slaughter of cats and dogs in China - where the household pets are a regular feature on restaurant menus. Although cats are only a delicacy in the . south of the country, the scale of killing felines is . just as high as that of dogs - and China does not have laws against it. Long-term problem: It is the latest incident in a long-term attempt to crackdown on cat and dog slaughter .

Sparse turnout: Oswald was buried a day after his death in a sparsely attended funeral that included his Russian wife, Marina, his mother and reporters - a few of whom stood in as pallbearers because there were not enough people to carry the casket (pictured) Many see Oswald a confused loner who changed the fabric of world history and came to the cemetery in a quiet part of Fort Worth as part of their remembrance of Kennedy. Other visitors see Oswald as a cog in a complex conspiracy to murder the president. 'There are so many theories and nothing is clear,' said Anna Olivares, 43, who traveled from Wisconsin to commemorate the assassination anniversary. Olivares believes Oswald killed Kennedy, but does not believe he acted alone. Recent surveys show that a majority of Americans think there was a plot to kill Kennedy. Oswald was buried a day after his death in a sparsely attended funeral that included his Russian wife, Marina, his mother and reporters - a few of whom stood in as pallbearers because there were not enough people to carry the casket.

Kennedy, his wife Jackie sit side by side, as they ride through Dallas moments before Kennedy was assassinated, November 22, 1963 . Unexpected: The convertible that the Kennedys were riding in had been equipped with a glass cover but the President felt he was better able to connect with voters without the barrier . 'There were no mourners. There were no friends,' Mike Cochran, an AP reporter at the time who served as a pallbearer, told Reuters. The police officer Oswald shot dead, J.D. Tippit, was buried that day in a different part of Texas. The state funeral in Washington for Kennedy was also held that Monday as Americans united in grief and watched it on TV. Soon after the caisson carrying Kennedy's coffin arrived at Arlington National Cemetery, 81 percent of American homes with a television had their sets tuned in, ratings agency Nielsen said. The spot: A museum now occupies the space that used to be the Texas Book Depository, and this is the window on the sixth floor that was Oswald's hiding spot . Clear shot: Lee Harvey Oswald was positioned in the Sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository, (the building on the left) when he fired at the motorcade . Moving on: In preparation for today's celebration, road crews on Thursday repaved the area of Elm Street where the President was shot . Hugh Aynesworth, a former Dallas . Morning News reporter who witnessed the assassination, Oswald's arrest . and Oswald's murder, said the fact that Oswald never faced trial fueled . the speculative fires of many conspiracy theories.

Numerous . events were held around Dallas this year to mark the milestone . anniversary, including panels with those who were there that day, . special concerts and museum exhibits. Investigation: There are many conspiracy theories about the assassination, many of which persist today. The official version of events concludes that Oswald acted alone and used this bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight .

It sounds like the plot of a romantic comedy - but whether or not it's going to end like one has yet to be seen. A man from New Zealand has launched a Facebook campaign to track down an American woman he met at a New Year's Eve celebration in Hong Kong at the start of this year. Reese McKee, 25, from Wellington, captured a photograph of the woman but knows little else about her - simply that her name is 'Katie' and that she's from Washington, D.C. He explained that he was wandering around admiring the lights as he welcomed in 2013 when he spotted a girl crying at the side of the road and approached her. Who is she? Reese McKee, right, has launched a Facebook search for a woman named 'Katie', left, whom he met in Hong Kong on New Year's Eve. When they parted, she said: 'Find me' 'She was lost. She'd lost all her friends,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I just cheered her up. I sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at.' The pair spent the night dancing, drinking and chatting until 6 a.m., when she reconnected with her friends and they parted ways. Before she vanished into the night, she told him her name and that she lived in 'D.C'. She posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request: 'Find me.' On a Facebook campaign, he explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone - 'and the good memories came sweeping back'. But he had few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address - he had some recollection of it containing the words 'kitty cat' - he had no luck. He spent months looking for her and asked for help in a similar way on Facebook in June. Search: He launched a Facebook search to find her - but so far he has not discovered who she is . 'But the timing wasn't right,' he told the Herald. 'I think this time of year people have hope for the magic [of Christmas].' And it seems that people are catching on - with more than 4,000 people offering their support to him before he removed the Facebook page. But while the story has gathered . international attention - as well as questions over whether or not it is . a hoax - the mysterious Katie has yet to be identified. Before removing the Facebook page, McKee explained why he was looking for her. 'I was hurt a long time ago,' he wrote. 'The . hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it was . too much. For too long, this has effected my relationships, and I've . failed people. Chance meeting: The pair met at New Year fireworks in Hong Kong (pictured) when he spotted her crying alone and befriended her. They went on to dance and party before saying goodbye . 'Somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent, and this is a step towards putting that right. 'While the main aim of this event has . been to reconnect with the now infamous ""Katie"", it's also about me, . finding myself and who I know I can be. I hope to find her. And along the way, find myself.' But he said he has no illusions and that he wouldn't be surprised if Katie had another boyfriend but that he was 'foolishly optimistic'. 'The chances are billions to one, but I like those odds,' he wrote. 'The is me putting all my chips on the table because it's go hard or go home and I am not going to give in.' He added: 'Even if I could just find her and say thanks, because it's been a life-changing year and it all started that night, really.' Do YOU know 'Katie'?

When Nelson Mandela chose to make a symbolic trip to Brixton, an area often seen as the centre of Britain's struggle for black rights, in a detour from his state visit in 1996, he was mobbed. Thousands of people turned out to catch a glimpse of the man who did more than anyone else to bring freedom to South Africa appearing in South London. He was hailed a 'saint', a 'hero', an 'idol"", a 'godhead', someone who is 'bigger than Michael Jackson'. 'Nelson Mandela we love you': A man holds a colourful homemade banner as crowds in Brixton wait to catch a glimpse of anti-Apartheid hero Nelson Mandela on his visit to the South London district in 1996 . Brixton's first black mayor, Lloyd . Leon, 75, told MailOnline: 'I didn't sleep last night because I couldn't . stop thinking about it. 'When Mandela came to Brixton it was like he was coming home. We welcomed him like a brother. 'To see him in person was special, it made me so emotional. Here was an icon of struggle, a man who made freedom happen. 'At that time Brixton was the centre . for black people in Britain. I can't express what it meant to me . personally and all the people I knew. 'As I remember he did a tour of Brixton police station, the Brixton Rec and met people and it was wonderful.' Lambeth's . current mayor, Councillor Mark Bennett, said the town hall will be . flying the South African flag, along with the Union Flag, at half mast . in honour of Mr Mandela. He told MailOnline: 'It was a great moment for Brixton and Lambeth and something many people here had a personal connection to. 'There . are still many people speak fondly of shaking his hand or even being in . the crowd when Mandela visited and that was an important moment for . many of them, some of whom were themselves victims of intolerance and . injustice in Britain. 'Nelson Mandela symbolised something we can all aspire to. 'I . met him at the Labour Party conference in 2000, shook his hand and had a . couple of minutes with him which were some of the most important of my . life. 'Mandela taught forgiveness and tolerance - a message that was especially important in Brixton.' Carnival atmosphere: The ANC leader waves to crowds as he arrives at the Brixton Recreation Centre .

I remember the thousands and . thousands of people that were here to see him, I remember the carnival . atmosphere that we had and just the sense of one love. 'Brixton . chooses people and I think Brixton actually chose Nelson Mandela to . come here, so I think it was a match made in heaven myself. For . Brixton’s history it’s a major event – I can’t really think of anything . that’s been more significant as far as positive things go. 'The . sense of respect for the man who’s a great icon – we can only be . thankful that he came to Brixton. I hope that he’s at peace.' Brixton . resident Tim Donaghy told the Brixton Blog: 'I was up bright and early so I made sure I . got a front row place because I didn’t get a ticket to get in the Rec. 'I . was outside the Jacaranda as it was then – now it’s that Craft Beer . place. It was really good, I got really close to Mandela and Prince . Charles. Someone put a girl over the railings with flowers to give to . Nelson Mandela and the security got in a flap and put Mandela and . Charles in a car to whiz them off to Trafalgar Square where he was . giving a speech at South Africa House. Mandela shares a moment with Prince Charles inside the recreation centre: Those unable to get tickets to see him inside lined the route his car took as it went through Brixton on its way there and back . 'Everyone . chased the car. There were shoes everywhere on Brixton Rd because . everyone lost them when they were running. Everyone followed the car up . to Trafalgar Square.' 'We . were so proud he was coming to Brixton – he’s the greatest man of our . lifetime. He came to Brixton for a personal thank you. Through that time . [apartheid era] no one would buy anything South African and everyone . was going on all the marches.' Sian Williams recalled: 'We stood on a market stall to get a good view (see below). We still have the T-Shirt. Aubrey Nunes told the Brixton Blog: . 'That day when Nelson Mandela came to Brixton was the most important day . in the history of Brixton. I was an agent between the anti-racist and . the anti-apartheid movement in London. 'I . took my kids off school that day, which I’d never done before. It was . truly special. Whoever played the national anthem only played the first . half – it was a terrible mistake. 'I . feel very proud that Brixton was singled out, it was such an honour.

Man's best friend: Although German Shepherd Olla used to be scared of the wind he now works with owner Shaun Hesmondhalgh helping other problem dogs . A dog that was once so terrified of anything that moved that his owner feared it might be kinder to put him down is now helping other animals get over their problems. German Shepherd Olla would get so easily frightened that the sound of running water, the wind in the trees and even litter bins would make him howl in terror. However, since the three-year-old dog was taken in by dog behaviour consultant Shaun . Hesmondhalgh, he has put his past . behind him and now can even help his owner work with other dogs. Olla was originally housed as a puppy with his brother from the same litter, but the family who owned the dogs were unable to control them.Mr Hesmondhalgh, 43, of Bolton, Lancashire, said: 'When you home two dogs from the same litter together, they can become out of control, and this is what happened with Olla and his brother Beau. 'They were like two adolescent young males who were throwing their weight around. 'They had to be separated as they were totally out of control.'Mr Hesmondhalgh came across Olla when he was looking for a dog to be part of his new business, The Way of the Dog, but soon realised he may have bitten off more than he could chew with the then two-year-old. He said: 'He came to live with me and my wife Wendy and he was incredibly nervous and frightened. 'It soon became clear how much damage had been done by him relying on his brother so heavily. 'He couldn't make sense of the world around him because Beau had made all the decisions and he was used to following. Scared: German Shepherd Olla would get so easily spooked that any new experiences would make him howl in terror . New leash of life: Mr Hesmondhalgh said that Olla had gone from crawling on his belly in fear out of what he might come across, to a happy and relaxed dog who loves running through the water . 'He had to become responsible for his own actions, but he hadn't developed as a full adult dog and had a real dysfunctional development.' Mr Hesmondhalgh, who served nearly 25 years as a dog trainer in the Royal Air Force, found that Olla was unable to cope with new experiences. 'He would walk along with his belly on the floor in fear of what he might come across,' said Mr Hesmondhalgh. 'He didn't have any confidence and I was new so he didn't know who I was. 'Supermarket shopping trolleys, running water, and even litter bins would spook him - they were all alien concepts. The wind in the trees would make his head spin. 'He would just let out a high pitched scream and refuse to move. It was a clear sign of a dog showing that he was terrified. Re-trained: Mr Hesmondhalgh, who specialises in dog behaviour, set about a strict training regime with Olla, in which he said 'patience, persistence, and being calm' were key . 'It was really difficult showing him that everything was OK and he wasn't going to be attacked.' Mr Hesmondhalgh, who specialises in dog behaviour, set about a strict training regime, in which he said 'patience, persistence, and being calm' were key. But months after rehoming Olla, Mr Hesmondhalgh began to worry that it was cruel to keep putting him through the daily stress. He said: 'About four months after I'd taken him in I was thinking should he go or should he stay. Pride: Mr Hesmondhalgh said Olla's self esteem has improved and he loves to meet new people . 'I was struggling to know what to do with a dog that couldn't cope with life. But I just had to find the key to the door, and the hard work has really paid off. 'The defining moment was when I had to physically restrain a dog that was trying to bite him. I stopped him from coming to any harm and I think that's when we really turned a corner. 'He has been able to build trust in me in time, and he now knows he's safe in my care and can make his own decisions.' Now, 18 months on, Olla joins Mr Hesmondhalgh in his daily work helping other dogs who need help with their development. Mr Hesmonhalgh said: 'Now he's a totally different dog. He's ready to meet people and he will walk down the street no problem. 'For a dog who was terrified to walk across a stream, he's now amazing and will run and jump through the water. He loves it. 'I have been able to see the self esteem growing and I do believe that he shows physical pride and sticks his chest out. 'He wants to know that he has done well, and he really needs that support. 'He's turned into a really happy and relaxed dog and he's now a partner in the business and helps me work with other dogs, who have their own set of problems.' Mr Hesmonhalgh is also a member of the British Institute of Professional Dog Trainers, a committee member of the British Police and Services Canine Association and is working towards accreditation with the Kennel Club Accredited Instructors Scheme. In his 24 years in the RAF Police, he trained dogs for a variety of purposes, from counter terrorism and force protection to competition, winning awards at a national and international level. He added: 'It takes a lifetime to train a dog. 'I will have to manage Olla's emotions for the rest of his life now but it's about making sure he's as safe as he can be and he has as many pleasurable experiences as possible.'","Olla was so terrified that owner feared it might be kinder to put him down .

They're all fans of hula hooping. The childhood past-time has resurged in popularity as a means of keeping fit in recent years. But now the trend has been given a new twist in the form of a pop up class in London where hundreds of fitness fans got into the groove in unison. Organised by the website Fitness-freak.com, the pop up classes at London's Shoreditch Town Hall were lead by 'Marawa the Amazing'. Get into the groove: Marawa the Amazing from Britain's Got Talent led the hula hooping pop up event . All body workout: Mastering the technique can improve core strength and flexibility . She's a globe-trotting 'hoop master' who can spin 133 hoops around her body at the same time and was once a finalist on Britain’s Got Talent. Tracey Cooper, who writes the blog The Brunette That Sweats attended the class and said it was a fun but effective workout. She writes: 'Our masterclass began with a Marawa talking us through the basics, most of us in the room openly admitted we were novices, so we learnt how to keep the hoop spinning. Optimistically we all tried to keep our hoops up and our pelvises rocking whilst Beyoncé warbled on for a whole track. 'Marawa taught us lots of tricks... spinning one hoop above our heads, whilst whittling our waists at the same time.' Fun fitness: Hula hooping can burn 400 calories an hour and you can do it in your own home if you can't get to an organised class . She added: 'If you turned up expected a high intensity sweat fest then you were always going to disappointed. That said, I definitely felt it in my abs and thighs the next day and you only have to look at Marawa to see how good hula hooping is for you, she is a walking testament.' Singer Grace Jones, 65, became another 'walking testament' to the hobby when she famously swung a hoop round her slim waist while performing at the Queen's Jubilee concert last year. Hula hooping is under-going a revival thanks to pop up classes like this as it actually dates back centuries. There's evidence that the Egyptians and ancient Greeks whirled hoops around their waists for fun and fitness. Fitness Freak's pop up events were so successful they have organised another class in York Hall, Bethnal Green on 9th December. Meanwhile, smaller classes are regularly held at gyms across the capital and other parts of the UK. And while those who attend group workouts will attest it's more fun trying to whirl a hoop round your waist while in the company of your friends, you can of course gain the benefits of hula hooping by doing it in your own home. In the swing of it: This month's pop up events were so popular another is planned in December . Twirl yourself fit: There are hula hooping classes on offer around the UK . All you need is a hoop - that can be bought weighted for a more intense work out - and enough room to swing. Master the technique and you'll get an all body workout strengthening your abs and core, improving your flexibility and raising your heart rate. As a result, a study by the American Council of Exercise (ACE) found that more than 400 calories can be burned in an hour by hula hooping. John Porcari, one of the researchers who worked on the ACE study concluded: 'Hooping compares pretty favourably with most other group classes, in terms of heart rate and calorie burn.' Star fans: Grace Jones swung a hoop round her slim waist as she performed in 2012 while Michelle Obama is pictured hula hooping on the lawn of the White House, right . He added: 'Before we did the study, I didn't imagine the heart-rate averages would be so high. I was really impressed by how intense of a workout you can get hooping and how many calories you can burn.' The Only Way Is Essex star Lucy Mecklenburgh told the MailOnline earlier this year that she's 'hooked' on hula hooping after taking up a regular class similar to the Fitness Freak pop up that involves combining hula moves to music. She said: 'I loved hula hooping as a child but I'd completely forgotten how much fun it is '""Dance hooping"" takes it to a whole new level and it works out my entire body out, strengthening my core and burning calories as well as, if not better than, any other boring exercise.' Meanwhile Kelly Osbourne Tweeted in May that she's a happy hula in her home. 'All about hula-hooping right now!' she wrote. 'Five mins in the morning, five mins at night...'

He is the eminent surgeon on the TV show Botched Up Bodies, happy to condemn and correct the blunders of other doctors who have devastated the lives of their victims. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that one of the NHS patients of craniofacial surgeon Niall Kirkpatrick was left horribly disfigured. Mr Kirkpatrick is lead clinician  at the Craniofacial Unit of London’s Chelsea & Westminster Hospital and specialises in reconstructive facial surgery for the NHS. He lives in a £2.2 million home with his family in West London and is believed to earn more than £350,000 from his NHS job, private consultancy and TV work. But in February this year, Imperial College Healthcare Trust was forced to make a six-figure payment and issue a grovelling letter of apology to former City solicitor Jan Middleton, 55, after it accepted that repeated errors following surgery in 2009 had left her severely damaged. Miss Middleton’s surgeon and consultant was Niall Kirkpatrick. Mr Kirkpatrick denies that he was responsible for Miss Middleton’s condition, but the Trust admitted guilt. It accepted she had not been adequately advised about the risks of the surgery, and that those treating her failed to provide adequate antibiotics to prevent infection. When infection arose, it conceded, they failed to act quickly enough to prevent it spreading. For Miss Middleton, of West London, the apology is too little, too late. In 2012, while struggling with the recurring infection that has spread since her first surgery, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and has been given less than a year to live. She is speaking out now after seeing Mr Kirkpatrick criticising the work of other surgeons on the Channel 5 programme. ‘I’d be interested to see his face if he was presented with me and my face, and told this had been done by another surgeon,’ she said. Defiant: Botched up Bodies's Dr Niall Kirkpatrick denies the treatment was inadequate . ‘He no doubt has skills  as a surgeon but I think it is wrong of TV producers to continue to make shows featuring him after what happened to me.’ Miss Middleton was referred to Mr Kirkpatrick in 2008 after a scan revealed a non-cancerous brain tumour. Mr Kirkpatrick and David Peterson, a consultant neurosurgeon at the Chelsea & Westminster, advised Miss Middleton that she should have an operation to remove the tumour. The six-hour procedure, which involved a bone graft and the installation of a titanium plate, was carried out at Charing Cross Hospital on January 8, 2009. Miss Middleton was advised she would need three months off work. She has not been able to return. In the wake of the surgery, infection set in. It spread and ate steadily into her face, bone and brain. Discharge also seeped forcefully from a wound. ‘My hair fell out in clumps,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t see properly out of my left eye. I had blackouts and  terrible headaches.’ In March 2009, she had the first of several operations to reduce the build-up of fluid behind the wound. Mr Kirkpatrick sent specimens of the discharge for testing. The Trust later accepted that Miss Middleton was not prescribed appropriate antibiotics after her first operation in January 2009 – and guidelines recommending the appropriate length of time they should be taken for were not followed. When the infection was discovered, there was again an unacceptable delay before antibiotics were prescribed. On September 9, 2009, Miss Middleton underwent a further operation to remove the plates, screws and dead bone that survived from the first procedure. The left side of her face was then reconstructed. During that surgery, a swab of her forehead revealed that she had developed two serious and drug-resistant infections. Yet incredibly, she says, she was never told of the risks of the original operation, or, as problems persisted, that her face would never look the same after the reconstruction. 'So happy': Miss Middleton before her surgery ordeal . ‘It wasn’t until one of Mr Kirkpatrick’s medical team cruelly said to me, “Oh well, you’ll just have to see it as an opportunity to develop other aspects of your personality,” that it struck home. My face had been ruined for ever.’ Eventually, Miss Middleton abandoned trust in her surgeon and turned to other specialists.‘I was told the radical surgery I had had could have been avoided in the first place,’ she said. ‘I learned that inappropriate antibiotics were used and they were not prescribed for long enough.’ By 2011, Miss Middleton was so distraught that she approached Dignitas, the Swiss euthanasia clinic, while considering ending her life. She said: ‘My life had been blown apart. Everything I had worked for – my career, my ability to travel .  .  .  it was all gone. But despite the fact  I will never have the life I once had, the instinct to survive took over.’ However, in 2012, she learned that she had pancreatic cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy. Mr Kirkpatrick strenuously denies that her treatment was inadequate. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She has been impossible to treat.  She refused to have much of the treatment we recommended. The Trust did not consult with me before admitting liability.’ Miss Middleton, however, insists she never refused treatment before the September 2009 surgery. She added she had contacted broadcasting watchdog Ofcom with details of her case, referring to  Mr Kirkpatrick’s appearance on Botched Up Bodies. However, she claims Ofcom was not interested in investigating because she had not featured on the show. In the meantime, Miss Middleton is trying to come to terms with her fate. She said: ‘The other day I found a picture of me in a garden looking happy. It’s like you have one kind of life one moment, then someone pulls the rug and it is gone.’ Imperial College Trust said: ‘An out-of-court settlement has been agreed in this case. The Trust has admitted there were some shortcomings in the care provided to this patient in 2009 and we have apologised to the patient for this. ‘All staff involved in this patient’s care were given robust extra training where the investigation showed it was required.’ lJan Middleton has donated  part of the fee for this interview  to The Face Trust, which supports research that will lead to the first full face transplant in the UK.","Niall Kirkpatrick left one of his patients horribly disfigured .

An ink sketch by Beatle John Lennon - drawn in a 'light-bulb moment' - is expected to sell for thousands of pounds in an online auction next month. The drawing has officially been valued at between £6,000 and £10,000, but an expert has said previous artistic works by Lennon have sold for £100,000 and that this offering could 'go through the roof'. The double-sided doodle, which features surreal characters in red ink on both sides of a piece of paper, measuring five inches by ten, was hand-drawn by the late musician in 1964. This rare sketch by Beatle John Lennon is expected to sell for thousands of pounds in an online auction . The double-sided doodle, on a piece of paper measuring fives inches by ten, was drawn by Lennon in 1964 . Music memorabilia expert Ted Owen said: ‘What’s lovely about it is he’s obviously been sitting down at the dinner table or out to dinner somewhere, picked up a piece of paper and had an idea. ‘It’s the lightbulb moment. This took him into a whole different genre of being an artist.’ The front of the paper features three characters, including one smoking a cigarette. The reverse side has varying forms of head and face shapes. Similar characters appeared in Lennon’s book, In His Own Right, which was produced in 1964. The sketch, by Lennon (right), is to go on sale with a copy of In His Own Right and a picture of the Beatles . The doodles will be sold in a frame with a copy of the book and a promotional photograph, showing all four Beatles, at its press launch. It will be auctioned on Cashintheattic.com on December 4. Mr Owen said: ‘What’s nice about this is that it’s early. It’s before he started marketing his artwork. The sketch was drawn by Lennon in 1964, the year that The Beatles conquered America . 'What a lot of people don’t recognise is that John Lennon was a brilliant artist in his own right. Some of his work fetches up to £100,000. 'I . would reckon that it’s got to be somewhere in excess of six, seven, . eight, nine or ten thousand – it’s a wide estimate but it’s rare. It . could go through the roof.’ Lennon's sketches are not the first of the band's doodles to go up for auction. A . rudimentary doodle drawn by Paul McCartney when he was a teenager in . the late 1950s fetched £3,764 when it was sold in March this year. In May 2011 John Lennon's handwritten lyrics for the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, including a rough sketch by Lennon of four people in a room with windows draped in curtains, sold for £145,644 in a US auction. One Beatles fan paid £3,000 pounds at auction for this scrapbook signed by the Fab Four . And in June 2010 Lennon's handwritten lyrics for Beatles hit A Day In The Life sold for £810,273.78 when they went under the hammer. A scrapbook autographed by The Beatles recently sold at auction for £3,200. The book was owned by a young fan who met the fab four backstage during a recording of 'Thank Your Lucky Stars.' It was snapped by an American at the sale in Wareham, Dorset. The winning bidder, who did not want to be named, said: 'I have never bid in an auction before, but have loved the Beatles since I was three. 'I will never sell them and intend to leave them to my niece if anything happens to me.' The Beatles perform on the Ed Sullivan Show in New York . In 1964, the year that John Lennon drew his prized sketch, The Beatles had become international stars and were embarking on their first ever world tour playing to thousands of hysterical fans in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong. As Beatlemania hit its peak, the group took the US by storm, leading the 'British Invasion' of the US pop market. On February 7, the group  left Heathrow airport to the sound of four thousand fans waving and screaming as their plane took off for New York. Shortly after their arrival, the band famously performed on The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by approximately 73 million viewers, and managed to achieve six simultaneous songs in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in April of that year - a record no other act has managed to equal. It was in 1964 that The Beatles played themselves in mock-documentary A Hard Day's Night, which premiered in London in July. They had already released the accompanying album of the same name, which featured hits including its eponynmous title track and And I Love Her, followed in December with Beatles For Sale, their fourth album in just 21 months which included the track Eight Days A Week. In August the group were introduced to Bob Dylan, a meeting which would go on to have an influence the future musical output of both acts. Lennon was still married to his first wife Cynthia during this period, and the couple had their son Julian the year earlier. Lennon had been encouraged to keep both the marriage and child a secret from fans as manager Brian Epstein feared it could threaten the ban's commercial success.","Valued at between £6,000 and £10,000, but expert says Lennon's artwork has previously sold for £100,000 and this sale could 'go through the roof'

A 23-year-old party girl who knifed her boyfriend in their Manhattan apartment last year has been found guilty of murder on all counts in the stabbing of her boyfriend. Yekaterina Pusepa said the bloody brawl began with a fight over a purse that her boyfriend Alec Katsnelson left unattended while she went to the bathroom at a bar in May, 2012. After an argument, the couple returned to their Gold St pad where Pusepa stabbed him in the chest with a nine-inch steak knife, piercing his lungs and nicking his heart. The Latvian-born woman was charged with attempted murder last year. She now faces up to 25 years in prison  when she returns for sentencing in the new year. Charged: Yekaterina Pusepa, 23 (pictured on the night of the alleged attack) was charged with attempted murder after stabbing her boyfriend during a brawl in their Manhattan apartment last year . Yekatrina Pusepa was found guilty on all counts earlier today in the bloody stabbing of her boyfriend. Pusepa . was photographed in her blood-stained shirt after the attack. Dressed . in a black blazer and beige pants with her hair tied in a braid, Pusepa, . 23, stared stoically as Justice Marcy Kahn polled the jury, but bowed . her head as they all replied 'guilty'. She then clasped her hands together and broke down sobbing as the panel filed out of the courthouse inn Manhattan Supreme Court. Defense lawyer Kevin O’Connell said he would file a notice of appeal. 'We were disappointed in the verdict,' he said. The jury started deliberating Wednesday morning and delivered their verdict at 10:35 a.m. Prosecutors claimed Pusepa stabbed her boyfriend in a jealous rage after he received a text message from . another girl. Pusepa, however, denied the claim, saying she knifed Katsnelson after he beat her, New York Post reported. '[I] . asked him to look over my clutch, which had my phone, my keys and all . my belongings,' Pusepa told jurors about the incident at watering hole, Ryan Maguire’s, where the pair had been drinking. 'When I came out, I found my clutch . was unattended in the middle of the bar. 'I . went to go look for him, and he was outside. At that . point, I told him I wanted to go home because it frustrated me. I asked . him to take care of something and he was being irresponsible. 'I said I wanted to take my things and go to my girlfriend’s house.’ However, the pair ended up going back to their own home together where they brawled. Testified: Yekaterina Pusepa claimed in court yesterday she held the knife to scare off her boyfriend after he punched her in the head . She claimed they had a tumultuous relationship and her former flame was violent. 'He was kicking me and started punching me, then hit me upside the head, and that’s when I grabbed the knife,’ she said. 'He kept hitting me, asking, ‘Is this the s–t I like? Is this the s–t I like?’ He went to go swing at me again. That’s when I stabbed him.' Pusepa also told jurors that her only intention when she reached for the blade in the early morning hours was to frighten off her beau. 'I picked up the knife just to scare him . . . I didn’t mean to hurt him,' she testified, according to New York Daily News. 'I was trying to get him off of me, make him get off of me.' Pusepa said 'everything went in slow motion' after she plunged the knife into Katsnelson's chest. She said he pulled the blade out before staggering downstairs to the street. She followed him down, covered in blood. On the stand, Pusepa claimed that she knifed Katsnelson in a frenzy trying to protect herself from yet another vicious beating after months of violence. 'He was kicking me and started punching me, then hit me upside the head, and that’s when I grabbed the knife,’' she said. 'He went to go swing at me again. That’s when I stabbed him.' Kermani noted that on the night of the attack, Pusepa told one responding cop that a black man had stabbed her lover, and told another officer that the victim was suicidal and grabbed her own hand to stab himself with the knife she was holding. 'I was just scared and in shock. I was just not in the right state of mind,' she said. Lovers tiff: Yekaterina Pusepa (right) claimed she was frustrated her boyfriend didn't look after her purse while she went to the bathroom at a night club on the night of the fight . New York Daily News reported the pair met at a nightclub in late 2011 and their relationship was initially 'purely sexual'. Katsnelson was arrested in March last tear for roughing her up, but she took him back in spite of a restraining order. They gave their relationship another chance and Pusepa fell pregnant. She had an abortion after learning the child would have to be placed in foster care due to her situation. After the May incident, Pusepa first claimed that Katsnelson grabbed the knife and plunged it into his own chest in a suicide attempt, but then she changed her story to say she stabbed him in self-defense. She also initially Pusepa told one responding cop that a black man had stabbed her lover. 'I was just scared and in shock. I was just not in the right state of mind,' she said.

The hunt for the last remaining Nazi war criminals follows the 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, a former guard at the Sobibor camp who died last year . Nazi hunters are to hang posters in major German cities and offer rewards of £20,000 in a bid to bring the last war criminals of the Third Reich to justice. The Simon Wiesenthal Center believes members of the public may have vital information to help with the last round-ups to ensure murderers do not die peacefully in their beds. The posters feature a photo of the entrance to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where 1.3million people are thought to have died, and the slogan, 'Late. But not too late! Operation Last Chance II.' They will appear in the cities of Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne from Tuesday and will display a hotline number for people to call. Germany is being targeted following claims that up to 50 Auschwitz guards may still be alive. One, Hans Lipschis, was charged in May on suspicion of participating in murder and genocide after being arrested in Stuttgart. Operation Last Chance II was launched in December 2011 to help step up prosecutions following the  conviction of John Demjanjuk in Munich following decades where only the top officers were prosecuted. An Ukrainian-born S.S. man, the retired car-plant worker from Ohio . was deported to Germany and convicted in May 2011 of . 28,060 counts of being an accessory to murder at the extermination camp of Sobibor in Nazi-occupied Poland. The posters feature a photo of the entrance to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where 1.3million people are thought to have died, and the slogan, 'Late. But not too late!'

He attended the 18-month court . proceedings in Munich - birthplace of Adolf Hitler's Nazi movement - in a . wheelchair and sometimes lying down. Demjunjak denied the charges and was sentenced to five years in prison but was freed because of his age and died in a nursing home last year. The Wiesenthal Center's top ten most wanted list has only two suspects under the age of 90. 'Every single prosecution is an important reminder that justice can still be achieved for the victims of the Holocaust,' said Efraim Zuroff, director of the Wiesenthal Center’s Jerusalem office. Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is launching a final campaign to bring Nazis to justice for their parts in the Holocaust . Alleged Hungarian war criminal Laszlo Csatary, 98, denies that he was involved in the murder of 15,700 Jews by helping to deport them to Auschwitz . 'This also is an important contribution against forgetfulness of future generations. 'The advanced age of the perpetrators should not be a reason to discontinue prosecution, since the passage of time in no way diminishes their guilt, and old age should not protect murderers.' Mr Zuroff told the Times: 'Justice at this stage does not make a pretty sight. These people are very elderly. 'But what I tell the people is, do not think of some old frail person, think of someone who, at the height of his physical powers, used all his energy to kill innocent men, women and children. 'We are talking about people involved in mass murder, day in, day out, so it is important to prosecute.' Last month 98-year-old Laszlo Csatary was arrested in Hungary for helping to deport Jews to Auschwitz. Prosecutors say Laszlo Csatary was . the chief of an internment camp at a brick factory in Kosice - a . Slovak city then part of Hungary - in May 1944. He is alleged to have overseen the deportation of 15,700 Jewish detainees to concentration camps. The . pensioner is also accused of beating them with his bare hands and a dog . whip. He also allegedly refused to allow ventilation holes to be cut . into the walls of a railcar crammed with 80 Jews being deported. Hans Lipschis is among the 50 Auschwitz personnel thought to still be alive in Germany today who are now being investigated following the Demjanjuk conviction. Lipschis admits he served with the SS at Auschwitz but claims he was only a cook. He was deported from the U.S. in 1983 for lying about his Nazi past when he immigrated to Chicago in the 1950s.","The Simon Wiesenthal Center launches poster campaign in German cities .

The six-year-old cat, who weighed 31.4lb when he was rescued at the start of August, had made good progress with his diet and exercise plan.

The Cat Shoppe in Nashville, which took Buddha in when his owner died earlier this year, paid tribute to the moggy on its Facebook page today. 'Buddha lived life to the fullest and had such determination,' the Cat Shoppe said in a statement. 'Our bouncy Buddha cat has been stilled but his spirit lingers on ... We hope that his story inspires owners of obese cats to help them get them on a path to a healthier weight.' The cat developed a loyal following as pictures and videos of him exercising were posted online. When he was handed over to animal welfare in August, staff quickly realized his weight was putting his health at peril, ABC reported. Fans of the cat were able to come to the Nashville rescue center and have their photo taken with him - even though he appeared to sleep through most of the sessions. When his health took a turn for the worse however he was placed in foster care. 'Buddha was diagnosed as having a congenital heart defect. The way it was explained to us is that his heart walls were thickened. The weight certainly put added stress on his heart,' Penny Adams, a volunteer photographer at the rescue center, told the Tennessean.

A man who has spent more than half his life in prison for killing his parents when he was 14 will be freed if he completes counseling and learns the skills he'll need to return to society, a state parole board ruled. ‘I've stayed out of trouble. I've tried to get myself prepared to move forward,’ said Jeffrey Dingman, on Thursday, who had just turned 14 when he and his 17-year-old brother, Robert, shot their parents to death in Rochester in 1996. Testifying against his brother in 1997, Jeffrey said the teens ambushed their parents as they arrived home from work on a Friday afternoon, hid the bodies in the attic and basement and spent the weekend playing and partying with friends before returning to school on Monday. Hearing: Jeffrey Dingman, right, leaves a parole board meeting at the New Hampshire State Prison in Concord on Thursday . They were arrested after their parents' worried co-workers called police. Robert Dingman is serving a life sentence after being convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges. Jeffrey, now 31, got 30 years to life in a plea deal that made him eligible for parole early next year. Had the board granted immediate parole, he would have been released on February 7, but meeting the terms of his conditional parole likely will take several months beyond that, said board chairwoman Donna Sytek. Trial: Jeffrey Dingman, aged 15, in 1997, looks on as then New Hampshire assistant attorney general John Kacavas shows the .22 caliber pistol that was used to kill Jeffrey's parents, Vance and Eve Dingman . Murder case: Dingman arriving at Strafford County Super Court in Dover, for his trial, in 1996 . She and other board members said they were pleased that Jeffrey had done well in prison and at the halfway house where he's lived for the last year, but they worried that he lacks the life skills to succeed in society because he went to prison so young. They said they were concerned that he's had little experience with everyday activities such as managing money, using a cellphone or going to the movies. ‘I don't want to just throw you out there cold,’ said board member Mark Furlone. ‘For 16 years, you've been insulated from the real world.’ Dingman earned his high school equivalency degree while in prison and now walks 40 minutes each way to a full-time job at a steel mill. He said he has saved most of his paychecks, has done some shopping for himself and - in response to a question from Furlone about his cooking skills - said he can heat up canned food. But when asked whether he has any support in the community, he answered ‘not really.’ Dingman's aunt, however, told the board that wasn't true. Speaking through tears, Elizabeth Landry of Greenfield, New Hampshire, said she misses her sister and brother-in-law, Eve and Vance Dingman, every day, but wants to help her nephew. ‘My husband and I are willing to help Jeffrey at a second chance at life,’ she said. ‘We truly mean it from the bottom of our hearts. We forgive him.’ Furlone said he was troubled by a statement Dingman submitted to the board last month in which he described being convicted for ‘my involvement in my parents' murders.’ ‘That's pretty flat to me,’ Furlone said. ‘I don't see a lot of ownership.’ Dingman responded: ‘I killed my parents. I take responsibility.’ His lawyer, Mark Stevens, later described his client's remorse as ‘profound’. ‘He's wracked by it,’ he said. ‘He thinks about it every day and has every day since it happened.’ During Robert's trial, Jeffrey Dingman calmly admitted wounding his parents but said his brother instigated the killings and finished off both parents, taunting each before firing the fatal shots. He said Robert asked their father, already shot once, ‘How about another one?’ and told his mother . ‘Die, bitch!’ before shooting her in the head. Decision time: Dingman, center, arriving with his lawyers for the parole board meeting . Prosecutors said Robert chafed under his parents' rules and curfews, and Jeffrey described being yelled at repeatedly by his mother and hit by his father over bad grades. But family members denied the boys were abused and described the parents, both 40, as devoted to their sons. Vance Dingman's sister, Darlyn, told The Associated Press last week that she opposed Jeffrey's release. ‘Personally, we wish he had fried, but that didn't happen,’ she said. ‘He should not be let out. He's as guilty as his brother.’ At the brief parole hearing, Sytek noted the brutality of the crimes and asked Dingman to describe how he has evolved since then. Speaking in a gravely but nearly monotone voice, Dingman described himself as a better decision-maker. ‘I guess I grew up,’ he said. ‘I don't just act. I try to be a better person.’ Jose Delgado, who was waiting for his own parole hearing on Thursday, lives at the same halfway house as Dingman and has known him for about a year. He said Dingman stands out as a hard worker who has learned his lesson. ‘He's very smart, very humble, very polite,’ he said. ‘He's one of the sweetest people out there.’","Jeffrey Dingman, with his brother Robert, murdered his parents in 1996 .

Dropped the case: The court-appointed guardian, Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, has dropped her attempt to force Amish girl, Sarah Hershberger, 11, to have chemotherapy treatment . A court-appointed guardian is dropping her attempt to force an 11-year-old Amish girl with leukemia to resume chemotherapy after she and her parents fled their home to avoid treatment. The move filed in court Friday will likely bring an end to a month's-long fight between Sarah Hershberger's family and a hospital that began when her parents decided to halt the treatments because they were making the girl sick. The guardian, an attorney who's also a registered nurse, was given the power to make medical decisions for Sarah after an appeals court ruling in October said the beliefs and convictions of the girl's parents can't outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child. But the guardian, Maria Schimer, decided to drop the effort because she doesn't know where Sarah is now and it has become impossible to monitor her health or make any medical decisions, said Clair Dickinson, an attorney for Schimer. ‘It didn't make sense to drag this on any longer,’ he said. Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable, but say she will die within a year if she halts chemotherapy. The hospital went to court after the . family decided to stop chemotherapy and treat Sarah with natural . medicines, such as herbs and vitamins. Sarah's . father said the family doesn't oppose modern medicine and that they . didn't make their decision based on religious reasons. Disappeared: The Hershbergers fled their farm in Homer Township, Ohio, to avoid their daughter Sarah getting treatment, which they say is making her sick and are worried it will make her 'infertile' They end chemotherapy, he said, because it was taking too great of a toll on their daughter and she feared the treatments would make her infertile. Sarah and her parents left their home in rural northeast Ohio just days before the state appeals court allowed the guardian to take over medical decisions. The family left the country in late September before returning to an undisclosed location outside Ohio. Schimer's attempts to meet with the family were rebuffed, Dickinson said. The guardian's decision to withdraw from the case still needs final approval from a county court. ‘The . judge's approval of this resignation will pave the way for the family's . return home, which will allow Sarah to receive the family's preferred . treatment under the best possible conditions,’ said Maurice Thompson, an . attorney for the Hershbergers. Can be treated: Doctors at Akron Children's Hospital believe Sarah's leukemia is treatable, but say she will die within a year if she halts chemotherapy . Sarah's last known chemotherapy session was in June, but she has undergone alternative-therapy treatments and is doing well, her family has said. Her grandfather, Issac Keim, told the Akron Beacon Journal that his granddaughter Sarah recently celebrated her 11th birthday and seems vibrant and healthy. According to Mr Keim, blood and imaging tests indicated that Sarah’s cancer is gone. Thompson, who leads the libertarian 1851 Center for Constitutional Law in Ohio, said the case came down to fundamental principles and constitutional rights. ‘We made it clear to our opponents that they were in for a protracted battle,’ he said. Andy Hershberger, the Ohio girl's . father, said this past summer that the family agreed to begin two years . of treatments for Sarah last spring but stopped a second round of . chemotherapy in June because it was making her extremely sick. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn, some forms of modern medicine . Sarah begged her parents to stop the chemo and they agreed after a great deal of prayer, Hershberger said. The family, members of an insular Amish community, shuns many facets of modern life and is deeply religious. They live on a farm and operate a produce stand near the village of Spencer in Medina County, about 35 miles southwest of Cleveland. Hospital officials have said they are morally and legally obligated to make sure the girl receives proper care. They said the girl's illness, lymphoblastic lymphoma, is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but there is a high survival rate with treatment.","The move filed in court on Friday will likely bring an end to a month's-long battle between Sarah Hershberger's family and Akron Children's Hospital .

Barnhill brazenly used his full name for the account, which has photographic evidence of potentially illegal behavior. The girl told police that Barnhill took nude pictures of her and that six other women had also prostituted themselves for Barnhill. A search warrant affidavit filed in federal court alleges sex trafficking of a minor and production of child pornography. The Washington Times reports that in the apartment, located at 3066 Stanton Road Southeast near St. Elizabeth's Hospital police also found marijuana along with a large number of condoms and nine pairs of women's high heeled shoes.

Prosecutors say he told the girl he had to take photos of her injuries, even though she protested she didn't have any. He made her take off her bra and boxer shorts and photographed her. At a hearing Thursday, it was revealed Washington had hundreds of similar pictures on a digital camera, some of domestic violence victims. Authorities say the two cases are unrelated. D.C.

One of Britain's leading family judges said the greatest pain of family breakdown is inflicted on children. File picture . The impact of divorce should be counted not in money but in sheer pain and human suffering, a High Court judge has said. Sir Paul Coleridge said the real cost of family breakdown comes in the pain of parents who part and the children who are affected by it deep into their adult lives. He called for parents to learn  ‘personal restraint and self-imposed boundaries’ to replace the taboos against divorce and single parenthood that have faded from life in Britain over the past five decades. Sir Paul, who sits in the family court as Mr Justice Coleridge, said in a speech published on the eve of a conference of his think tank, the Marriage Foundation, that the greatest pain of family breakdown was inflicted on children. ‘That is where I encounter it, day in day out, in the arena of the family courts,’ Sir Paul said. ‘Let it not be forgotten that 50  per cent of all children are not living with both parents by the time they are 15. ‘There are millions of them and it is they who are the real victims and casualties. ‘Their parents are too, of course, but the children are given no choice, are never consulted and only rarely considered before it and its effects are dumped into their young lives, slowly to release their legacy over the whole course of their upbringing and way beyond into their adult lives.’ Sir Paul said: ‘Let us never forget, when we are debating in a theoretical way, the pros and cons and ramifications of this subject, what the real cost of family breakdown is and what it looks like. Sir Paul Coleridge, said: 'Children are given no choice, are never consulted and only rarely considered' ‘It is not measured primarily in money but in sheer pain and human suffering for all the adults and  children involved. And in lives permanently affected to a greater or lesser extent.’ Sir Paul said families were no longer held together by unwritten rules which forbade husbands and wives to split, or unmarried women to  have children. ‘In the old days society was held together by rigid taboos and stigmas which prevented parties from divorcing and stigmatised illegitimate children,’ he said. ‘These taboos were indiscriminate in their application and led to much inhuman behaviour and unhappiness. I am genuinely thankful they have evaporated and been consigned to the scrap heap of history in favour of individual choice. ‘However, if we are to enjoy freedom to choose we must be helped to understand and make the right choices for ourselves and our children. ‘A society without boundaries is not the only alternative to nasty taboos. ‘If we are not to have restraint by taboo, we must have personal restraint and self-imposed boundaries born of a sophisticated understanding of what makes us all, as individuals and as a society, happy and fulfilled.’","Leading family judge warns of the impact of divorce on youngsters .

Wartime codebreaker Alan Turing is set to be pardoned posthumously for his criminal conviction for homosexuality. The Government will not stand in the way of new legislation needed to pardon him and it could be passed within three months, it was confirmed yesterday. While Gordon Brown gave a public apology for his cruel treatment in 2009, at the time ministers said it was not possible to overturn his 1952 conviction for gross indecency. Pardon: Professor Stephen Hawking is among 11 signatories of a letter urging David Cameron to forgive Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing's conviction for the then crime of homosexuality in 1952 . Mr Turing, a brilliant mathematician, helped Britain win the Second World War through his work at Bletchley Park, where he invented the machine which cracked the Enigma codes used by German U-boats in the Atlantic. But despite his crucial work – which some historians believe may have shortened the war by two years – Mr Turing was convicted of gross indecency for having a relationship with a 19-year-old. At that time homosexuality was illegal, and he chose to be chemically castrated with injections of female hormones rather than go to jail. He committed suicide two years later. Heritage: A sculpture of mathematician Alan Turing at the Bletchley Park museum where he had been head of a code-breaking unit . Codebreaking: Alan Turing led a team at Bletchley Park (pictured) to read and crack Nazi codes using the above computing machine, saving thousands of lives in WWII . In the House of Lords yesterday, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, a whip, said the Government would not stand in the way of a Bill brought by Liberal Democrat peer Lord Sharkey, which offers him a full parliamentary pardon. He said: ‘The Government know that Turing was a hero and a very great man. They acknowledge that he was cruelly treated. They must have seen the esteem in which he is held. ‘The Government therefore is very aware of the cause to pardon Turing given his outstanding achievement and therefore has great sympathy with the objective of the Bill.’ If there were no amendments, the bill could be passed in the House of Commons as early as October, he said.

He followed this up with a post to Instagram, stating, 'Putting Toronto mayor Rob Ford through a Valerio workout. The BodyPro training system!!!” The posts were deleted not long after he was contacted by the media. He deleted his entire Twitter and Instagram accounts later Wednesday.' The tweet was sent out under Moscariello’s alias 'Valerio Mosca,' the name he uses with the Team Body Pro Athletics website, the bodybuilding supplement company Mutant Nation and on several socia media accounts including Facebook Youtube, Twitter and Instagram. On his arrest in 2005, Moscariello admitted to possessing 27 units of anabolic steroids and to operating a website that distributed them. In January 2010, he got a 12-year ban for supplying performance enhancing drugs to Amanda Galle. 'His 12-year sanction means that he is ineligible to participate in any sport at any level and in any role. This prevents him from coaching, training or competing, and restricts competitive athletes from associating with him as a coach or trainer,' the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport (CCES) said in a press release.

Responding to the picture he posted online, Moscariello told Toronto's National Post that, 'It was a joke picture and has been blown up for no reason. 'I do wish him luck. I should not have posted a joke picture like that I didn't realize what this caused. I'm sorry. I wish the mayor luck on his journey. In addition to the clarification of the ill-judged picture, he refused to answer questions on his drug conviction or if he was continuing to work with Ford. Tight fit: Rob Ford's weight was revealed to be 336 pounds on Tuesday and it was claimed that the mayor is keen to lose up to 40 pounds in a bid to improve his health . However, this contradicted an earlier telephone interview in which Moscariello had labeled the Ford enthusiastic about his training and that he had been working out the night before. He even gave away the mayor's weight, which was 336 pounds. 'He’s got the discipline and he’s got the drive. I really think he can lose the weight, but he has to give it his all. I want him to give me 100%, not even just 99%. Without 100% I won’t take him on. 'But if he gives me 100%, if he comes to the gym, I’ll beat him up [through a rigorous workout]. I’ll beat him up until he can’t take anymore,' Moscariello told the National Post. 'With Rob, I think the problem is what he eats. He’s on the go, he’s here and there and he doesn’t eat what he should. If Rob eats proper food, he will change. But you need to do this every day. Every day.' 'You are what you eat. 'You’d be amazed how agile he is. He knows how to move 300 pounds around easily.' It is believed that Moscariello was introduced to Ford through bodybuilder Jerry Agyemang, who Ford hired as a driver earlier this month. Moscariello since-deleted Twitter reveals that he was speaking of training Ford as early as November 16. He mentioned this during a conversation with Canadian porn actress Nikki Benz.","Rob Ford is working with trainer Valerio Moscariello - who has a drug trafficking conviction in the United States .

Cabin crew on a British Airways transatlantic passenger jet used up five extinguishers putting out a ‘serious’ electrical fire sparked by the plane’s in-flight entertainment system. The drama happened as the Boeing 747 Jumbo was cruising at 30,000ft over the North Atlantic en route from Dallas, Texas to Heathrow with 275 passengers on board. The electrical blaze happened in the cabin service’s director’s small office - located under the stairs in the lower level of the jumbo jet - when the control system for the aircraft’s in-flight entertainment system burst into flames. Fire: The drama happened as the Boeing 747 Jumbo, like this one, was cruising at 30,000ft over the North Atlantic en route from Dallas, Texas to Heathrow with 275 passengers on board. (File photo) It triggered an alarm and other warning systems. Cabin crew grabbed extinguishers to tackle the blaze and five were emptied over a five minute period before it was brought under control. BA said of the emergency: ‘It took about five minutes to fight the fire. ‘It was an electrical fire and they are a little harder to extinguish. I believe they used five extinguishers.’ The drama was classified as a ‘serious incident’ in the official Mandatory Occurrence Report (MOR) submitted by BA to the Civil Aviation Authority and obtained by the Daily Mail. That report says the incident is subject to an investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch. Such MOR reports have to be submitted after ‘any incident which endangers or which, if not corrected, would endanger an aircraft, its occupants or any other person.’ The fire erupted during an eight and a half hour flight aboard flight BA 192 on a Boeing 747 jumbo jet from Dallas. Emergency: The fire was caused by an in-flight entertainment system (file picture) The flight left Dallas at 4.45pm on October 13 out of Dallas landing 07.25am next day in London. But details of the drama have only now emerged. The official ‘MOR’ report refers to a ‘fire’ in the passenger cabin and an ‘electrical smell’ in the cockpit. It logs the fire as a ‘Serious incident’ adding: ‘In-flight entertainment system (IFE) caught fire in cabin.’ There were no injuries. British Airways said: ‘Our crew are highly trained to deal with a wide range of incidents. They were able to quickly bring the situation under control and the flight continued to London and landed safely.’ BA denied suggestions that the plane was on the brink of being forced to make an emergency landing: ‘At no time did the flight crew discuss or consider ditching the aircraft.’ It also rejected suggestions among the aviation fraternity that the crew were ‘down to their last two extinguishers.’ London bound: The plane was heading from Dallas, Texas, to Heathrow Airport back in October . A BA spokesman insisted: ‘It is not correct to say there was only two extinguishers remaining after the fire was put out. 'There was a range of fire fighting equipment remaining to provide adequate cover, should it have been required. ‘ . He added: ‘Ultimately, this was a small fire that was brought under control very quickly by crew. The flight continued as normal throughout.’ Earlier this month frightened passengers on board a British Airways flight told how they heard their pilot making a Mayday distress call 36,000ft above the Atlantic on November 14. The captain radioed for help when smoke filled the cockpit of the plane carrying 220 passengers - and accidentally turned on the public address system. The Boeing 777 was flying from London Heathrow to New York but had to make an emergency landing at Ireland’s Shannon Airport. No danger: BA denied suggestions that the plane was on the brink of being forced into an emergency landing . After putting on oxygen masks the crew immediately contacted air traffic control. They switched on the cabin address system, and the start of their Mayday call was heard by passengers. Passengers were told there had been an electrical fault. It is believed the smoke was caused by a fan in the cockpit which overheated. British Airways said of that incident : ‘We flew engineers to Shannon who inspected the aircraft and it was brought back to Heathrow where it was fixed in the following days, and returned to service.’ Another Boeing 777 - on the same route - made an emergency landing at Shannon five days earlier just an hour into crossing the Atlantic. Again the cause was a burning smell in the cabin - which is understood to have been caused by a faulty oven. The Aviation Herald warned that electrical burning was what killed all 229 people on board a Swissair flight over the Atlantic in 1998. In that case, a fire is thought to have begun in the cockpit and spread to equipment before it could be brought under control.","The incident happened on a flight between Dallas, Texas, and Heathrow .

Dead bottlenose dolphins are continuing to wash up along beaches along Florida’s east coast. Since Sunday, officials say the Georgia Aquarium’s Conservation Field Station has picked up three dead dolphins along Flagler County beaches. Capt. Tammy Marris, of Volusia Beach Safety and Ocean Rescue says a 3-foot dolphin was found in Wilbur-by-the-Sea Monday. Scroll down for videos . Sad sight: This was one of three dolphins that turned up dead along Flagler County beaches since last weekend . Silent killer: Scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say morbillivirus is likely causing the deaths . Last month, at least seven dolphins were . recovered on Volusia County beaches and another four on beaches in . nearby Flagler County. Scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say morbillivirus is likely causing the deaths, The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. A team of researchers is investigating. The measles-like virus affects the marine mammals' lungs and brain, causing skin infections, pneumonia and brain disorders, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   The dolphins can infect one another when they come up for air and breathe together. The average number of strandings between New York and Florida from July 1 to December 1 is 113. This year 936 strandings have been reported. Since January, more than 1,200 dolphins have stranded in that area. Experts say it is impossible to vaccinate the animals for morbillivirus, according to ClickOrlando, and they expect to find more dead dolphins in the coming months. No end in sight: This year 936 strandings have been reported, and scientists expect to continue finding dead dolphins . But there was also some good news this week for marine creatures that have found themselves stranded on Florida shores. Pods of 35 pilot whales slowly swam Thursday into deeper water off Florida’s southwest coast, raising optimism that the strandings of whales on Everglades National Park beaches may soon end on a positive note. NOAA fisheries official Blair Mase said this afternoon that the three whale pods were nine miles north of their original location and continuing to move offshore. They were in 18 feet of water about six miles offshore, still several miles from the 900-to-1,000 foot depths they usually call home, Mase said. ‘They are in deeper water, and they are getting closer to their normal home range,’ Mase said. ‘Even though we are hopeful, this situation could go either way. There is a chance they could come back inshore again.’ Silver lining: A U.S. Coast Guard inflatable boat guides a group of stranded short-finned pilot whales to deeper waters in Everglades National Park, Florida December 5 . Majestic creatures: A pod of pilot whales that were stranded in the Florida Everglades swam out into deeper waters while rescuers tried to chase the rest out to sea by banging on pipes and revving their boat engines . Heartbreaking: Dead pilot whales lie on the beach in the Florida Everglades . Mase said the total of dead whales has reached 11, with five still unaccounted for. She said wildlife workers were surprised Thursday morning to discover that most of the live whales had moved out of the shallows on their own sometime during the night. By early evening Thursday, most crews had left the scene, but a Coast Guard cutter was to remain stationed with the whales overnight Thursday. About 15 vessels carrying about 35 personnel were involved in the effort to track the whales, which were first spotted Tuesday in extremely shallow water in the Everglades park south of Naples. Wildlife workers had planned to try using noises such as banging on pipes and revving boat engines to herd the whales out to the open ocean. But that turned out to be unnecessary, and the workers simply used positioning of the boats to prevent any of the whales from turning away from the open sea, Mase said. Teams from NOAA, the National Park Service, the Coast Guard and state wildlife agencies were working to prevent any more whales from stranding. The animals had not been cooperating Wednesday, when most were in about 3 feet of water. Casualties: The total of dead whales has reached 11, among them 4 that had to be euthanized . Circle of life: Vultures and dead pilot whales that beached themselves and became stranded in Everglades National Park, are seen on the southwestern Florida coast December 5 . The short-finned pilot whale is known for its close-knit social groups: If one whale gets stuck or stays behind, the others are likely to stay or even beach themselves as well. Escort: The whales were in 18 feet of water about six miles offshore, with some 15 vessels tracking their progress . Pilots are among the smaller of the whale species, with adult males reaching up to 18 feet in length and females 12 feet. The species is also the one most commonly involved in mass strandings. According to NOAA, there was a stranding of 23 pilot whales at Ft. Pierce, Florida, in September 2012 and one involving another 23 whales at Cudjoe Key, in May 2011. The last one in the Everglades area was in 1995. Federal officials were notified about the whales Tuesday around 4pm. Because of the remote location, workers were unable to access the site before dark. They arrived Wednesday morning and discovered 45 whales still alive. ‘There were some that were very compromised and in very poor condition,’ Mase said. Federal officials euthanized four whales Wednesday, but no more were put down Thursday. Mase confirmed Thursday that sharks had begun to feed on the dead whales. Necropsies were completed Thursday, and scientists will look for disease or other signs to indicate how whales got stuck in the shallow Everglades waters. ‘It may take weeks and weeks and even months to get those results back,’ she said.","In November, at least seven dolphins were recovered on Volusia County beaches and another four on beaches in Flagler County .

On Monday Neighbours heard shouting and raced outside to see a man with a blade and her slumped at the wheel of her crashed car. Two of them brought the knifeman to the ground while others tried to save Mrs Evans’s life. She was pronounced dead by paramedics and police who had raced to her bungalow, which is close to her brother-in-law's home. Friends said Mrs Evans, a retired cashier known as May, had found happiness with her husband David, who she had lived next door to for 20 years. Neighbours said that May had previously been married for more than 30 years to John Olloman, who died six years ago from cancer. The couple had a daughter, Yvette, whose child Mrs Evans had been going to collect, and a son, Mark, who suffered from spina bifida and died around 10 years ago. Murdered pensioner May Evans' relationship with her new husband had developed from a mere friendship, according to a neighbour. She said Mrs Evans had first known her husband as a neighbour, as their bungalows backed onto one another across a garden. 'They had been seeing each other for a couple of years,' he said. 'She kept it relatively quiet, I think they were good friends and it developed from that, after Olly died.'

Mrs Evans' family visited the floral tributes, but were too upset to talk.

The hosts of the morning talk show program took part in the national 'No Shave November' campaign where men across America tossed out their razors for the month in an effort to raise money for various charities that support men's health. 'We didn't just do this to look terrible, we did this to raise money,' Matt Lauer said  Monday's show. Lauer didn't really think he looked terrible, however, as he announced that he would be keeping it for the winter. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . The big reveal: Viewers suggested which looks the anchors should try out, and while a couple of them were game, Lauer decided that he wanted to keep his beard . Spot the difference: Lauer decided that he just wanted the barber to give him a close trim and not actually shave the beard (before at left and after at right) To mark the end of November, razor producer Gillette arranged for four top barbers to come in to shave the hosts and viewers were able to weigh in on styling options- choosing between a goatee, mustache, mutton chops or a chin curtain. Al Roker said that he would try out the goatee that was suggested for him, but Lauer announced he would be disregarding the same suggestion completely and opting to just have the barbers trim the beard and allow him to keep it for the winter. 'My dad wore a goatee in the last few years of his life and he always looked good,' Roker said. Willie Geist, who had the most trouble growing a full-fledged beard, initially said he would sport the suggested mustache for a few hours before shaving it off completely. That cut off may come quicker as he did not take to the mustache- and knew that his wife would not either. 'I cannot go home with this,' he said. 'I'm going to transition into a different form of media, the adult form,' saying how he thought he looked like a porn star. He's not a fan: Willie Geist (before at left and after at right) said that he looked like he was a part of the 'adult entertainment' industry and immediately knew that he would have to shave it off before going home to his wife . Carson Daly, who was joining remotely from Los Angeles, said he would do the same for the suggested goatee. Daly clearly had the fullest beard of the bunch, as Lauer joked earlier that it took him only seven hours to grow it completely. Not everyone loved the beards as internet commentors took the anchors to task during the Thanksgiving Day parades, saying that Lauer and Roker looked like they were homeless hobos. ‘Somebody do something! A homeless man got hold of a microphone and is covering the parade! Oh no. Wait. It's just Al Roker. Oh,’ wrote @brettfaultless. While No-Shave November, or Movember, initially began as a way to raise money and awareness for prostate cancer, but the Today Show embraced a larger concept for the challenge with each of the hosts picking a different charity to support. Embracing it: Roker said that his kids likened him to 'Black Santa' with the full beard (left) but decided to stick with the goatee (right) like his father had for a few years before his death . Lauer stuck with the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Roker chose the American Cancer Society, Geist chose the American Heart and Stroke Association and Daly chose the Breast Cancer Research Foundation as his mother has survived the disease that also targets men. Gillette donated $100,000 to the cause, splitting it among the four charities. While Lauer didn't actually shave off the beard Monday morning, he did take part in the on-air prostate screenings that were held one week into the challenge. He and Roker went to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, where Dr. David Samadi, a urologist, carried out a rectal exam on each of the men in an examination room off-screen. Natural: Carson Daly, who was in his LA radio station at the time, said he had no trouble growing a full beard . Playful: Daly joked around with his new look but said that his 'dream is to play for the Yankees' so he would have to shave to be a member of clean-shaven team . The Today Show has a history of giving out on-air exams, starting with former anchor Katie Couric who underwent a colonoscopy live on the show in 2000 following her husband's death from colon cancer two years earlier. While Couric and both of the male co-hosts were given clean bills of health, one of their counterparts over at ABC discovered she has breast cancer after having an on-air mammogram. Amy Robach is now undergoing treatment for the disease and is scheduled to return to work at Good Morning America today.","The morning show anchors did not shave for the month of November .

Clay figurines made by people living in Ghana 1,400-years ago, have gone on show in Britain for the first time. The figurines, which include two-headed humans, a chameleon, crocodile and man on horseback, are thought to have been used to invoke the help of ancestors to cure illnesses, archaeologists said. The clay models measure up to 31cm in height and show the costumes and weapons worn and used by the people living in Ghana at the time. Clay figurines made by people living in Ghana 1,400-years ago, are to go on show in Britain for the first time. The figurines, which include two-headed humans, crocodile (pictured) and man on horseback. The precious clay figurines were excavated by archaeologists from the universities of Ghana and Manchester and the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board (GMMB). They have just gone on show at the Manchester Museum - the first time they will be seen publicly outside Ghana. The team of experts believe the figurines were used to invoke the help of ancestors to cure illnesses. Using computed tomography scanning techniques at the University of Manchester, the experts revealed hidden channels within the objects. They believe these channels had a medicinal function and were used for liquid ritual offerings. The clay models measure up to 31 . centimetres in height and show the costumes and weapons worn and used by . the people living in Ghana at the time. The figurine on the left shows that the people used animals to travel long distances, while on the right is a Janus-like model with two 'human' heads . Professor Insoll from the University of Manchester, told MailOnline: 'The figurines seem to have been offered libations - perhaps of blood or beer - and perhaps had sacrifices made to them. 'They might have been used to make herbal medicines more powerful, which might then have been drunk or applied to the body. It is still relatively early in the research so we cannot say for certain.' The figurines show people with congenital conditions including anencephaly (the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull and scalp that occurs during embryonic development,) which still affects children in Africa today - while others show clothes and symbolic animals that had symbolic roles. Some figurines in the collection were also possibly ‘scapegoats’ and were intended as the focus or recipient of disease and misfortune rather than their human keepers. The figures have been dated to between the 6th and the 14th centuries. 'The representations of the people in the figurines suggests that both . men and women used them - but not children perhaps - as they are very . rarely represented and might not have had the ritual status and . maturity to use them,' Professor Insoll told MailOnline. A model of a combined human and animal head. Professor Insoll said the figurines seem to have been offered libations - perhaps of blood or beer - and perhaps had sacrifices made to them . Further analysis by the team, led by Professor Benjamin Kankpeyeng and involving Professor Insoll, will show what liquid ritual offerings were actually used. The figurines were found in a village called Yikpabongo in Koma Land in the north of Ghana and come from two mounds thought to be used as a shrine by the makers of the objects. While the models are thought to have been relatively common, 'the way they were . deposited suggests they were thought of as spiritually valuable, perhaps . as ancestors,' said Professor Insoll. Because the figurines are highly sought after in the art market, some mounds in the region have been illegally excavated but Professor Insol told MailOnline there could possibly be as many as several thousand mounds to discover, that could hold similar treasures. The mounds have been added to the International Council of Museums Red List, a register of archaeological material at risk. Professor Kankpeyeng said: 'These figurines are unique to the region and offer an insight into aspects of past human beliefs, ways of understanding and creativity. 'This has not always been possible, where there is no tradition of making representations, or when they simply have not survived. The experts think both . men and women used the figurines - but not children - as they are very . rarely represented and might not have had the ritual status and . maturity to use them. The figurine on the left shows a seated woman,  while the one on the right is a type of lid with what is thought to be a Janus figure on top .

The models include channels used for a medicinal function that were used for liquid ritual offerings to find out what the offerings were, it is thought the liquid could have been blood or beer. They could have been used to make herbal medicines more powerful, which might then have been drunk or applied to the body. The figurines might also have had sacrifices made to them. Some figurines in the collection were also possibly ‘scapegoats’ and were intended as the focus or recipient of disease and misfortune rather than their human keepers, according to the experts. 'Their exquisite and consistent appearance obviously required a great deal of skill, suggesting those who made them were a specialist occupation.' Professor Insoll said that little is known about the people who made the figurines and they are not thought to have any connection with Koma Land's current inhabitants. 'In fact, we know little in general about . the past in this part of Ghana, because there are few historical . sources before the late 19th century and oral traditions are scarce,' he said. 'But archaeology is unlocking some of the secrets of the past, and this project shows what can be achieved. 'We . now know the figurines may have had ritual and medicinal functions and . the mounds  they were found in were perhaps medicine shrines, or places . for disposal of material considered dangerous if disposed of correctly. 'We . also know these people were farmers, who traded with cowry shells, used . iron tools and lived in villages, with complex religious beliefs' By examining the figurines, the archaeologists, including Professor Insoll who is pictured left, now know the models have had ritual and medicinal functions and . the mounds they were found in were perhaps medicine shrines, or places . for disposal of material considered dangerous . He also said that the horse or camel figurine indicates awareness that animals could be used by people for long distance travel. Speaking about the illegal trade of the ancient figures, Professor Kankpeyeng said: 'The people of the villages of Koma Land have a keen sense of the figurines as part of their heritage and deeply resent the unethical trade in such material.' Professor Insoll said: 'The . people of the villages of Koma Land in Ghana are involved in the . fieldwork (to collect figurines) and have a keen sense of the figurines as part of their . heritage. 'So we are proud that this exhibition actively involves Ghanaian archaeologists and museum curators who are coming to Manchester to support it,' he said.

Disney-owned Marvel Comics, the publisher of X-Men, Spiderman, and The Incredible Hulk, has come under fire for manufacturing 'sexist' T-shirts that portray women as weak, and men as strong. Two T-shirts based on the popular Avengers comic franchise use the same 'hero' slogan, but play off deeply ingrained traditional gender roles. A blue shirt for boys declares, 'Be A Hero,' while a red shirt for girls says, 'I Need A Hero.'

Wimbledon legend Steffi Graf returned from America to say farewell her dying father days before he passed away from pancreatic cancer. Peter Graf, 75, died in a clinic in the German city of Mannheim on Saturday.  He was 75. Steffi and her father, her former coach and ex-manager, were once inseperable and she credited him with driving her to the top of world tennis, winning 22 world titles in a stellar career. Close: Peter Graf (right), with Steffi, smiling at the US Open in Flushing Meadow, New York, in 1987 . But the pair fell out when he was sentenced to more than three years in jail in 1997 for tax evasion. In . recent years the pair had come closer together again and her farewell . six days before he died was seen as proof of a total reconciliation . between them. Steffi, 44, is now back in the US by the side of her . husband Andre Agassi and their children. Steffi . wrote on her website: ‘Our good father and grandfather, Peter Graf, has . gone in peace from us. We grieve quietly and look back on many . beautiful moments we spent together. 'We have to thank our father for a . very happy childhood and a great sense of family. We wish you all a . peaceful holiday season.’ That's my girl: Peter Graf admires one of the seven Wimbledon women's singles trophies that she won . After he died his widow Britta issued this statement on Sunday: ‘After a full life my beloved husband, our good father and grandfather left us peacefully. 'We remember in our sadness and with great thanks his life and please ask for understanding in our wish to say farewell privately within the family.’ Fellow German tennis star Boris Becker offered his condolences on Twitter, tweeting 'RIP Peter Graf'. Britta, his second wife, was instructed by him during the week to request doctors to switch off machines that were keeping him alive and this was done early on Saturday. He slipped into a coma shortly afterwards and died at 1pm. Happy family: Steffi with husband Andre Agassi (right), their daughter Jaz Elle (left) and son Jaden Gil (second right) at an NBA game between the Miami Heat and the Sacramento Kings in Miami, Florida, in 2006 . Steffi was introduced to tennis by Peter when she was just three years old, in 1972. At the time Peter was an aspiring coach and made his living from car and insurance sales. He had real expertise in tennis, though, and guided Steffi to victory in the European 12s and 18s. There was no looking back after that. Her father imposed a strict training regime - even limiting her social life to keep her focussed. And it paid huge dividends. Steffi, with the additional help of coach Pavel Složil, quickly became a major challenger to the dominance of Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, with her breakthrough year being 1987, when she won her first grand slam - the French Open. Her relationship with her father soured enormously in 1995, however, when she was accused of tax evasion by the German authorities. As her father was her official financial manager, he was held responsible. After being found guilty, he was sentenced to 45 months in jail, but was released after serving 25. In 2001, following romances with German tennis player Alexander Mronz and race driver Michael Bartels, Steffi married fellow tennis star Andre Agassi. They have a son, Jaden Gil, and a daughter, Jaz Elle, born in 2001 and 2003 respectively.","The pair had fallen out when he was sentenced to more than three years in jail in 1997 for tax evasion .

The party is a grand one, a vast room, buzzing with conversation and the glamour of the capital's movers and shakers. I'd hesitated to attend. 'Not my sort of thing,' I'd blustered, when the impressive 'stiffie' invitation had arrived, with its embossed writing and matching ribbon. 'No,' insisted friends and family, 'you should go. It'll be a great opportunity for networking, meeting people who can advance your career.' Wallflower: Jenni said she won't make herself the centre of attention at Christmas parties . So, here I am, surrounded by the editor of this, the manager of that . . . good grief, there's the Home Secretary and could that be the Leader of the Opposition? I brace myself to go over, smile, charm, show them how brilliant and interesting I am. Except I can't. I scan the room, desperate to find someone I actually know, before finding a quiet corner, sitting down with my drink and hoping someone will come and talk to me. I am the wallflower. I realise that with my persona as the confident presenter of a major national radio programme, thought to have nerves of steel when questioning the toughest of subjects and listened to by millions, the role of wallflower seems an unlikely one. But shy and somewhat retiring on a personal level, I most definitely am. When, on these occasions, someone does eventually spot me, and sidles over out of chivalry or sympathy to chat, I automatically switch to professional mode, and do what I've always done best. I offer the platform to them, and interview them, giving them the opportunity to set out their talents and achievements, while I sit back and listen. There is nothing like a Dame: But she doesn't like to show off about her title . Of course, this talent came in very handy as I was starting out as a young journalist. But today, despite a long career in television and radio and being recognised with the title 'Dame', I’m afraid I haven't progressed. With Christmas and the party season approaching, I know I'll still be trying to avoid the big events and, if I have to go, I'll still seek out familiar and congenial chums with whom to have a chat and, if they're not there, I'll turn again into the hopeful wallflower, ready to question anyone who joins me about themselves. I dread to think how many fabulous opportunities I might have missed because I’m congenitally incapable of showing off. I might have been the UK equivalent of Barbara Walters - a world famous political interviewer for more than half a century and fabulously rich to boot - if only I could have learned to blow my own trumpet. Or maybe I could have been an Oprah Winfrey, my contemporary in age - she's about to turn 60 and I'm 63. She has just starred in a movie, set up her own TV company and is considered by Forbes magazine to be the most wealthy and powerful 'celebrity' woman in the world. As interviewers, there's probably not much between us. She even commented, during a recent interview I did with her in a London hotel, on my 'insightful' questioning. I'm absolutely certain I could have lured Lance Armstrong into spilling the beans on his drug use or had Tom Cruise dancing on the sofa - two of her most memorable recent journalistic scoops - given the opportunity. It was during my encounter with Oprah that I realised what a difference to one's confidence and, consequently, one's prospects the ability to show off can make. Within seconds of the start of our conversation, the subject had turned to her: she was telling me about her humble background in America's deep South. 'My reluctance to blow my own trumpet, has let me down on a number of occasions' Her great-grandmother was a slave, she pointed out, instantly highlighting the phenomenal leap she has made. Her mother was a maid, until Oprah had enough money to help her retire. She acknowledged her luck in being born into the era when the civil rights movement began to bite and gave her the opportunity for non-segregated education. But she was quick to point out that, when she started nursery at three, she could read and knew lots of big words, thanks to her grandmother using the Bible to teach her. She wrote a letter to her teacher, including all those words - even the biblical characters Meshach and Abednego. She was immediately put into the A-stream and, of course, was top of her class. She knew how to push herself forward without embarrassment or shame from babyhood. And here she was, doing it again, while, typically, I remained silent. I could have told her that I, too, was considered a bright little girl: my mother told me I was able to read by the age of three. I would read the cereal packet on the breakfast table, because books weren’t allowed at meal times. She was so worried about me scouring the Daily Mail every morning - an adult publication, she thought - she bought me the Children's Newspaper to satisfy my hunger for material. Powerful: Jenni wonders what might have been if she was more like Oprah Winfrey . I was so desperate for education, they had to send me to the local Convent School, even though we weren't Catholics, because it was the only establishment that would take me at the age of three. It would never have occurred to me to show off about such promising beginnings. (OK, I just did, but it's taken me 60 years to do so!) I know my reticence on these matters, my reluctance to blow my own trumpet, has let me down on a number of occasions. As a sixth-former I desperately wanted to study drama at Bristol University. I was called for interview. Faced by a panel of inquisitors, I mumbled my responses to their questions and, even when asked about my favourite playwrights, played down my considerable knowledge. They rejected me. I made it to my second choice - Hull  solely on the basis of academic achievement. They didn't subject potential students to an interview! Something similar happened when I first applied to the BBC. I was unsure and nervous. I managed to answer questions about technical matters. My dad had coached me in the workings of a microphone, but this avid reader of newspapers and follower of current events fell to bits when asked about the whereabouts of the Prime Minister. That little voice in my head, yet again, said: 'Don't get above yourself. You don't belong here.' I failed to show off my knowledge. Rejected again. I don't think it's a problem confined to my generation. My children and their contemporaries, never told by their parents that they're anything but bright and as good as anybody else, are still reluctant to be seen as 'bigging themselves up'. There is, I believe, a cultural phenomenon at play here. In America, children are encouraged in school to 'show and tell'. They stand up in front of the class and learn how to speak in public and show themselves off to their friends. It's a culture that says: 'If you've got it, flaunt it.' In this country we still don't talk about what we've achieved or what we've earned. Saucy show-offs . Boasting on social networks gives a similar thrill to sex, say Harvard researchers . Every woman I've asked about their concept of power after they've appeared on the Woman’s Hour Power List - a list of the 100 British women considered to wield real power in this country - has played down the idea they're powerful and, rather apologetically, confessed, maybe, to influence. I don't, though, see it overall as affecting one gender more than the other. My dad would never disclose how much he earned in case it was more than the next man and would set him apart. And I've known plenty of boys who can't shake off that essentially English trait - boasting about yourself just isn't done. When I went to Buckingham Palace in 2011 to be declared Dame Jenni for my services to radio by the Queen, still at the back of my mind was my mother's cautionary voice: 'Don’t show off. Don't get above yourself. A working-class girl from Barnsley is bound to get found out sooner or later.' Perhaps it's because, in America, wealth and power is the fulfilment of the 'Dream' - to be lauded. We still seem to build up our icons and then, at the merest hint of them 'getting too big for their boots', we bring them down. It's time we stopped and took pride in what we've created - as a society and as individuals - and learned to show off about it. So, here's me taking my own advice. I really think I've done rather well, don't you? (Ooh! Sorry!)","Despite long career in broadcasting and title 'Dame' she still can't show off .

Witnesses reported hearing as many as nine shots fired at Donald Gist Jr., whose sister is Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin’s wife, in the brazen daylight murder. One witness said there were multiple bullet wounds to his head. Authorities have fingered violent career criminal Arthur Givens, 40, as the main suspect in the killing, and have issued a warrant for his arrest as they hunt him down.

Mr Givens reportedly hit Mr Gist with multiple rounds in the horrifying attack. One witness decribed the grizzly scene to News14 Carolina. ‘I just walked up here and seen a guy laying on the ground, look like he got shot in the head a couple of times,’ said Sheba Kennedy. Scene of the crime: Authorities descended on the parking lot of Queens Mini-Mart, in Charlotte's Uptown neighborhood . Gathering evidence: Homicide detectives interviewed eyewitnesses and gathered evidence from the scene of the horrifying execution .

A local resident who spoke to NBC Charlotte was outraged by the shocking slaying. ‘It . makes me mad, it makes me very mad,’ said Kevin Biddle. ‘Because this . don’t make no sense.

A Pearl Harbor survivor trying to fly to a remembrance ceremony this week almost missed it entirely. Ewalt Shatz, 90, is upset with United Airlines after he was bumped from his Los Angeles to Honolulu flight despite explaining the nature of his trip, he claims. United Airlines disputed his version of events to MailOnline. The World War II veteran told flight staff he was flying back for the ceremony but was told the plane was overweight and he would not be allowed on-board, he told KREM. He made it!: Pearl Harbor survivor Ewalt Schatz takes a picture as the USS Halsey gets ready to pass the Arizona Memorial during the 72nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor at the WW II Valor in the Pacific National Monument . Mr Shatz told them he is a Pearl Harbor survivor trying to make a special ceremony at the Pearl Harbor Memorial but was coldly rebuffed, he explained. Moving ceremony: A vintage WWII airplane files over the USS Arizona at the ceremony commemorating the 72nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Saturday, Dec. 7 . ‘I thought that they just overbooked the deal and they were trying to get rid of a couple of customers and somebody had my seat,’ he said. ‘And that’s what made me mad because I paid for that seat and somebody else is sitting in it.’ 'I was surprised,  I didn't know which way to go,' he told Hawaii News Now. 'Here I am at LAX with all these people and it's all new to me, I was just lost I didn't know what to do - which is an awful feeling.' United spokesperson Rahssaan Johnson confirmed to MailOnline that Mr Shatz was bumped from the flight, but under very different circumstances than described by the vet. Rough weather over the Pacific Ocean forced the plane to carry extra fuel, leaving the flight under a weight restriction that saw 41 people bumped from the plane. When Mr Shatz tried to check-in at a self-service kiosk he was refused. A United employee soon explained the weather and fuel dilemma. 'The agents took him aside and said 'we can put you on American Airlines flight, we can get you there a few hours late, but you’ll get there tonight,' said Mr Johnson. The agent booked Mr Shatz on an American Airlines flight to Honolulu at no extra charge and then provided him with a ride to the AA terminal, the spokesperson added. The airline apologized and offered a number of options to reimburse Mr Shatz for the inconvenience but has yet to hear back from him, Mr Johnson further explained. By the time Mr Shatz arrived in Hawaii, news of his delay had jumped the pond. Local veterans who caught wind of the delay gave him a hero’s welcome at Honolulu Airport, the station noted. Mr Shatz made the ceremony. Despite vowing never to fly United again, the 90-year-old is scheduled to depart Sunday from Honolulu aboard a United flight, Mr Johnson noted.","Ewalt Shatz was bumped from the United Airlines flight along with 41 others because the plane was 'overweight'

A personal trainer jumps down onto the subway tracks to save an unconscious man as a train barrels down. A trucker stops to pull a driver from a burning car. A quick-thinking plumber uses his belt as a tourniquet to save a woman badly injured in a crash. In New York City, which often has a keep-to-yourself, don't-get-involved reputation, at least a dozen Good Samaritans this past year were willing to risk their own safety to save a stranger. ‘It's the way I was brought up: Always look out for each other,’ said Dennis Codrington, the personal trainer who, along with two others, helped pull up a bleeding, unconscious man who had fallen onto the tracks of the No. 1 train late one February night. Savior: Dennis Codrington, 24, who rescued a man . after he fell onto the subway tracks, stands near the site of the incident . on the Columbus Circle subway platform . Codrington was headed home from a party when he saw the 6-foot-tall man at the edge of the platform and then disappear. About 55 people are struck by New York subway trains and die every year, and the 24-year-old Codrington wasn't going to let this guy be one of them. So he and the two others jumped down to hoist the bleeding, heavy stranger up - as the time clock flashed that another train was due in the station in one minute. In the nick of time: Codrington and two others jumped down to hoist a heavily bleeding, 6-foot-1 stranger up a minute before a train was due to pull into the station . ‘It was really nerve-racking,’ Codrington said. ‘But we couldn't leave him there.’ Miami emergency room doctor Ben Abo found himself in a similar dilemma at a New Jersey commuter train stop in Greenwich Village during his summer vacation to New York City. The 32-year-old was headed back to Jersey City, where he was staying, when a straphanger took an extra step and fell off the platform. ‘He went down right over the edge. He was walking as if the platform was still there and wanted to take another step,’ Abo said. The man fell head-first and lay on the tracks, bleeding heavily. Abo looked to see if a train was coming and jumped in, yelling for the two dozen people on the platform to pull a fire alarm and get help. Sweating, he heaved the man up overhead, back onto the platform, as someone helped from above, and he then tried to pull himself back up, too. He felt a gush of wind and saw headlights reflecting off the wall. ‘I said to myself: “You have one chance to get up,”’ he said. He made it and set to work trying to stop the bleeding, while a crowd gathered around him - holding up smartphones to take video. Psychologists say some people have the right mix of qualities it takes for risky heroic acts - altruism, courage, knowing the right thing and being reflexive about it, as well as the ability to inhibit fear that stops most people from getting involved. Average Joe: Plumber David Justino, pictured with celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, used his belt as a tourniquet to stop a tourist from bleeding to death after an out-of-control taxi struck her, severing a leg . Grateful: Injured British traveler Sian Green said on the Today Show that if it weren't for the strangers who came to her aid after the collision, she would have been dead . ‘It's not one hero gene. It's a very complex set of characteristics that converge and that person is unique, and thank God for them,’ said psychologist Dr. Rachel Yehuda at Mount Sinai Medical Center. Ervin Straub, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, who has studied altruism extensively, said crowds in a big city can work against such heroism by creating a ‘diffusion of responsibility.’ ‘When there are a bunch of people around, there is often a “Why me? Somebody else can do it,”’ he said. ‘But if someone else developed a strong sense of responsibility, they are not likely to wait. By seeing the others' passivity, their feeling of responsibility may kick in.’ A gaggle of videotaping onlookers surrounded 44-year-old plumber David Justino this summer as he tried to stop a tourist from bleeding to death after an out-of-control taxi struck her, severing one leg and badly injuring the other. First responder: Ben Abo, a Miami, Florida emergency room doctor visiting New York rescued a man who fell onto the tracks in the 9th street PATH station seconds before a train arrived . He used his belt as a tourniquet and poured bottled water over her severed limbs, which were gushing blood. ‘I had no choice,’ he said. ‘I had to help her, someone had to.’ Truck driver Alex Mitchell, 37, of Queens, was alone on the Long Island Expressway two months ago at about 1am when he saw a man in an SUV driving erratically, then crash into a tree. Mitchell pulled over and ran to the scene. ‘There was a flickering of lights, and by the time I got there, it was a big ball of fire and smoke,’ he said. He reached the man, yanked him up and helped him away from the burning vehicle. ‘The only thing I was thinking was, “We have to get out of here before this thing goes up,”’ he said. Both Mitchell and Justino have since contacted the people they saved to see how they're doing; the tourist, Sian Green of England, is healing. ‘There's good people in this world, very good people in this world that I can't thank enough,’ Green said on NBC's Today show in September. ‘They saved my life. If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be sitting here right now telling this story.’ Quick-thinking action: Truck driver Alex Mitchell, 37, of Queens, pulled a man from a fiery car wreck on the Long Island Expressways . The driver saved by Mitchell was released from the hospital and later charged with driving while intoxicated. Mitchell said the man, who has four kids, found out his name and left a note at his office thanking him. Abo got a ‘thank you’ and a pat on the back from police. Then, covered in the injured man's blood, he boarded another train and went home to Miami. He doesn't know what happened to the man he saved. Neither does Codrington. ‘The last time I saw him, he was bleeding profusely and not conscious,’ Codrington said. ‘I wish I knew whether he was alive.’","Dennis Codrington, 24, rescued a bleeding, 6-foot-1 stranger who fell onto tracks a minute before train came .

Fired: Language teacher Michael Griffin lost his job at a Catholic school on the day he applied for a same-sex marriage license . A gay teacher claimed he was fired from the Catholic school he has worked at in Pennsylvania for 12 years after applying for a marriage license. Michael Griffin, who returned to the Holy Ghost Preparatory School he attended as a child to teach French and Spanish, said his sexuality was no secret at the Bensalem school. But on the day he arrived late after applying for his marriage license, the principal allegedly told he he had no choice but to fire the teacher. 'I really didn't think that it would happen. At our school we talk about it's a community. Our motto is ""One heart, one mind"",' he told 6ABC. Mr Griffin said he had arranged to come in late on Friday, but when he returned to the private boys school he was called in to see school president Father James McCloskey and principal Jeffrey Danilak. They said it wasn't a secret that the teacher was gay, before saying to Mr Griffin, ""I presume this is a same-sex marriage'. When he confirmed that it was, Mr Griffin was told that if he went through with the marriage the school would have 'no choice but to terminate my position'. 'I can't believe it's over like that,' he said. His partner, Vincent Giannetto, said: 'We applied this morning and on the same day he's fired . from his job. So it kind of flipped things upside down for us.' A spokesman for the school told 6ABC that it had no comment. Mr Griffin believes he was fired because of the teachers' code of conduct at the school. Code: Michael Griffin believes the school let him go because his marriage plans went against the Catholic faith, which teachers must abide by . It reads: 'Although, the School welcomes teachers from other denominations and recognizes their rights to religious freedom, as employees of a Catholic institution, all teachers are expected to uphold lifestyles compatible with the moral teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.' Although he needs to find a job, Mr Griffin said his treatment at the school has made him reluctant about working there again. 'The school to me has shown their true colors so I don't know if I... I certainly don't want to work there again after I've seen how they treated me,' he said.","Michael Griffin claims Catholic School told him he would lose his job if wedding went ahead .

Palestine's first-ever sex shop has opened for business after it was given the green light to start trading by Muslim scholars. The Ramallah-based online store - called Karaz, which means 'cherries' in Arabic - went live this week stocking vibrators, candy G-strings and lubricants, amongst other products. After obtaining a supporting fatwa from local sheiks, the website's founder, Ashraf Alkiswani, now hopes to attract customers from across the Arab world. Love is the universal language: Karaz, . Palestine's first-ever sex shop, based in Ramallah, has opened for . business after it was given the green light to start trading by Muslim . scholars . He told The Guardian: 'It's not about just sex. It's about love and the joy of expressing that love. 'It's about trying to build bridges across gaps that separate the husband from the wife by improving sexual harmony, which in turn will lead to happier marriages, less divorce and less infidelity. 'In that sense, it is a social project.' According to Islamic teachings sex is exclusively reserved for married couples, so the unmarried 30-year-old Palestinian-American businessman admitted he was a little nervous about asking the sheikhs for their approval. But he had two stories up his sleeve which compelled him to start his business, and that he felt sure would win the support of the Muslim scholars. One was of a couple who, on their wedding night, were on the one hand so nervous, and the other so keen, to 'begin [their] sexual journey' that they didn't even think to use foreplay, with the unfortunate result that the bride ended up in hospital with bleeding for three days. The second was a tale of a 25-year-old mother of five who, after being shown how to use a condom with her fingers as an example, went on to have sex with the prophylactic on her hand. Mr Alkiswani says he departed the mosque with the unanimous approval of the sheikhs for his venture. Contrary to the belief of many non-Muslims, the religion's teachings encourage sexual intimacy within marriage - and not just for procreation. Islamic law allows women to divorce their husbands on the grounds of a lack of sexual fulfilment and, as Mr Alkiswani points out, a pronouncement by the Muhammad, the Muslim prophet, says: 'Not one of you should fall upon his wife like an animal; but let their first be a messenger between you.' 'And what is that messenger? Kisses and words,' added the entrepreneur. Modest: The store went live this week stocking . vibrators, candy G-strings and lubricants, amongst other products. Its . appearance is rather different from the sex shops those of us in the . West may have seen . However, befitting the comparatively less wantonly promiscuous nature of Islamic culture, Karaz is not like the sex shops those of us in the West may be used to. 'Pornography and raunchy schematics are not used to sell our products,' the website says. It adds: 'We currently live in a time where love making is cheapened by risqué marketing advertisements. That’s what sets Karaz apart, in a league of its own. 'Our aim is to provide a range of tasteful products to help rekindle the purity and passion between married couples. 'Karaz is proud to help foster healthy relationships and open communication by offering a wide spectrum of marital aids that help husbands and wives achieve and maintain an intimate lifestyle.'","Ramalla-based online shop hopes to attract business across the Arab world .

Former US Olympic hurdler Lolo Jones run to the 2014 Winter Olympics as a bobsledder looks to be a success - and she may have found a new talent pipeline for Team USA. Her team was one of several American bobsled teams to medal Saturday at the bobsledding World Cup in Park City, Utah. Americans took home 10 medals in all, against the best racers in the world. No U.S. women's bobsled team had swept the podium in a World Cup race in nearly 13 years - until Saturday, when the American dominance was on full display. New track, same result: The United States' Jamie Greubel, right, and Lolo Jones push their sled during competition at the women's bobsledding World Cup . Ms Jones and her fellow Americans, including former sprinter Lauryn Williams -whom she recruited to the sport, put on an impressive show in sweeping the events. Elana Meyers and Aja Evans won their second gold medal in two days, and Jamie Greubel and Lolo Jones tied for second with Jazmine Fenlator and Ms Williams to complete the U.S. sweep. And with the Sochi Olympics less than two months away, here's a very good sign for the U.S.: Out of the 18 medals awarded in bobsledding and skeleton at Park City over the weekend, against the best racers in the world, American sliders took 10 of them. 'It was a good day,' said 2010 Olympic bobsled gold medalist Steven Holcomb. A good weekend, to be precise. A very, very good weekend, to be more precise. The last time American women's bobsledders swept a World Cup race was Feb. 17, 2001, in Park City, when Jean Racine, Bonny Warner and Jill Bakken were the pilots going 1-2-3. Multi-talented: Lolo Jones competing in the hurdles at the 2012 London Summer Olympics (left) and posing before Saturday's bobsledding World Cup event (right) 'It feels great to be on the podium,' said Ms Jones, who won her second World Cup medal as a push athlete. 'With bobsled you never know when you are going to be on the podium and how long it will be before you are back on again. It makes you cherish the moments when you are doing well. Our drivers are doing outstanding this year.' A schedule quirk calls for certain sliding disciplines to race twice at various World Cup stops this winter, and in Park City, women's bobsled was due for the double-up. So after winning gold Friday night, Meyers and Evans were back at it early Saturday and finished two runs in 1 minute, 38.61 seconds, good enough for a 0.63-second margin of victory. Greubel and Jones finished in 1:39.24, the same time as Fenlator and Williams, an Olympic gold medalist and former world champion in track who was making her World Cup debut. Early reviews for the sprinter-turned-bobsledder were smashing. Still a winner: Jamie Greubel, left, and Lolo Jones, right, hug during a flowers presentation Saturday following the women's bobsledding World Cup . 'I'll tell you something: Lauryn Williams is a rising star in what I see in bobsledding,' longtime bobsled analyst John Morgan said during the race broadcast. 'She's got the build for it, the speed, the explosion. ... Lauryn Williams, welcome to bobsledding.' Ms Williams' push was critical for Fenlator, who did not have anything close to a flawless drive down the track. But the speed Williams helped generate at the top was more than enough. And one sled later, Ms Jones also had a big push to get Ms Greubel started. 'It's so awesome to be here,' Ms Williams said. Ms Greubel and Ms Fenlator both edged longtime German star Sandra Kirasis by 0.01 second in the standings. Meyers also assumed the series driving lead from Canada's Kaillie Humphries, who was seventh. Also earned rave reviews: Jazmine Fenlator, front, and Lauryn Williams compete during the World Cup, they also medaled . The World Cup standings determine the starting order for the Sochi Games, and the earlier start position typically means a racer would be seeing better ice conditions. In the four-man race, Mr Holcomb had a dominant second run to pull away from what was a three-sled tie at the midway point. Mr Holcomb, Curt Tomasevicz, Chris Fogt and Steve Langton finished two runs in 1:34.76, 0.35 seconds better than German driver Maximilian Arndt. Russia's Alexander Kasjanov drove his sled to a third-place showing, 0.36 seconds back of Mr Holcomb. 'It was a great race and that's what we're all here for,' Mr Holcomb said. The series shifts to Lake Placid, N.Y., next weekend.","Former US Olympic hurdler Lolo Jones bobsled team was one of several US teams to medal .

Two students attending the same middle school in Connecticut have landed in trouble after posting images of guns on their Instagram accounts on the same day. One of the students, a 13-year-old boy, was charged with disorderly conduct for sharing an image of two firearms Thursday morning accompanied by a note that read: 'I think I'm ready to go to school :-).' In a separate incident, investigators said a boy put up a picture of a pistol on his social media account and wrote, 'Colt Anaconda .357. Damn I love revolvers.' Chilling coincidence: Two 13-year-old boys attending the same middle school in Connecticut posted images of guns on their Instagram accounts on the same day . Both teens attend John Read Middle School in Redding, Connecticut, which was named this week a school of distinction for the highest overall performance, according to The Redding Pilot. In the first case, Redding Police Chief Douglas Fuchs said a student spotted the Instagram post depicting the two guns at around 8.30am and contacted school officials. The unnamed 13-year-old gun enthusiast was then removed from class by a resource officer. The photo of a Colt was posted by his schoolmate at around 5.30pm Thursday, but was later taken down. In both cases, investigators determined that the middle schoolers did not have any firearms in their possession on school property. The 13-year-old boys insisted that they never intended to hurt anyone. Police officers have seized the two weapons featured in the 13-year-old's Instagram pictures, which turned out to be pellet guns, The Courant reported. Chief Fuchs said one of the facsimile pistols had its tell-tale plastic tip removed, making it appear more realistic. The 13-year-old has been charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and released to his parents. Good school: Both teens attend John Read Middle School in Redding, Connecticut, which was named this week a school of distinction for the highest overall performance . According to detectives, the John Read student who posted a photo of the Anaconda revolver pulled the image from the Internet. No charges are expected to be filed in that case. Schools Superintendent Dr. Bernard Josefsberg and John Read Principal Diane Martin sent a joint letter to parents Friday addressing the incidents, according to The Redding Pilot. 'Whatever was going through the minds of these two boys when they pressed ""Send,"" they now know that those photos in this place at this time are not joking matters,' the missive read in part. 'As they should have known, Redding school officials and Redding police understood their behavior as possibly threatening, potentially sinister and most certainly disruptive.'

At barely five feet tall, Rivera is lucky to be alive. 'I was running, then I was on the ground and then was listening to the paramedic,' she said. 'I’m surprised I made it out alive.' Rivera has been running for about five years. 'I’d thought that the run would make me feel better after work,' she said. A female passerby called 911 and used Rivera’s phone to dial numbers that reached Rivera’s boyfriend and her family. The 71-year-old female driver of the Toyota SUV - similar to this one - involved in the accident was also hospitalized, but released a short time after . 'I want to really thank her, whoever she was. And I am glad the driver is all right.' Surprisingly, Rivera remains unperturbed by the accident and said she will run the same path again. Her sister, Shannon Rivera, posted on Facebook that her sibling was 'hardcore'. 'My sister, the survivor of flying deer. Most hardcore sister to have,' she wrote. Barely five feet tall, Rivera already had been jokingly nicknamed 'The Hulk' by her friends. 'I guess now they can really call me that,' she said.

Andrew Disilvestre, whose home backs up to the path where Rivera was running, noticed what he thought looked like a single car accident on his way home Thursday night. Then, on Friday morning, something else caught his eye out his back window. 'I noticed some big vultures flying around and noticed a dead deer,' said Disilvestre. News4 told him that the deer had hit a jogger before it fell to the ground. 'It's certainly an anomaly... that's a surprise,' said Disilvestre. 'I might look out for deer next time I'm jogging.' Virginia is a major deer-hunting state. In the 2010 hunting season, more than 5,700 deer were recorded as being killed. While residents say they are well-versed in vehicle accidents involving the animal, the story of a flying deer hitting a passer-by was a first. 'That' pretty amazing,' said Michael Valmont, who works out at a gym near the accident scene. 'I don't know what the statistics are for that but it's pretty low.'","Krystine Rivera, 27, decided to go for a seven-mile run on Thursday night after having an off day at work .

An Indiana town is battling to buy back a blind woman's home after an investor bought it for $43 at a tax auction - without her knowledge. Dolores Pittman, 67, was stunned to learn that her home of 55 years in Cedar Lake had been snapped up by Clayton Pullins after the church that owned the land had failed to pay taxes on it. Pullins wanted to charge her $300 a month for the rent - which she could not afford. But this week, the Town Council unanimously voted to try to buy the land from Pullings so that Pittman, who lost her eyesight to a degenerative disease 30 years ago, does not have to move. Scroll down for video . Battle: Dolores Pittman, pictured, faced being kicked out of her home of 55 years after it was sold at a tax sale without her knowledge. Now the town is trying to buy it back from the buyer . Now they are hoping that he accepts their offer to pay a fair market price, which would be determined by an independent appraiser. If not, they will use municipal condemnation powers to buy the land, council President Randell Niemeyer told the Chicago Tribune. Ms Pittman, who has lived at the home since she was 12, was shocked when she received a letter from Pullins - unaware that the home had been bought or was even up for sale. Her family had bought the . house from a church that owned the property beneath and around the home, and initially paid $10 a month to the church to lease the land beneath their house. But in the 1970s, Pittman was told the land had been sold to the town. In fact, the church still owned the little section of land and stopped paying taxes on it. Home: Land beneath the house, pictured, was owned by a church, which failed to pay taxes on it . Due to these outstanding payments, the property went to a tax sale in 2009, where it was snapped up for the minimal amount by Pullins. Deal: The town is hopeful that the new buyer, Clayton Pullins (pictured), will take the deal . 'For some reason . nobody told this lady and or anybody else the land was on a tax sale, . consequently the man who bought it only paid $43 for land,' John Petalas, the town treasurer, said. If the town successfully buys it from Pullins, they will offer Pittman a 'life estate', which would allow her to live there for the rest of her life. After that, the land would be used by the surrounding park. 'Mrs. Pittman has lived there a long time, and this is an arrangement that, to me, serves the public interest, and a human interest,' Niemeyer said. 'She'll be able to stay there for the rest of her life.' Pullins' attorney has not responded to requests for comment. Pittman said that she was hopeful she . would stay in the house - but she was packing up just in case, with the . intention of moving to a rented house two miles away if she had to. 'That's . all I ever wanted in all this - to stay here the rest of my life, or . until I had to go to a nursing home,' she told the Tribune, becoming . emotional. She had planned . to pay for rent and utilities at her new home with donated money that . people have donated as her plight received media coverage.

Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bentleys are being rented by 16-year-olds in Tower Hamlets, East London, for their National Record of Achievement (NRA) ceremony, a prom-like event that marks the end of compulsory schooling.

'Showing off': These students drive past the school and into the playground in their hired Mercedes-Benz . These Lamborghinis, Ferraris and even . Bentleys on the gritty streets of East London were rented by . 16-year-olds to celebrate leaving school, and they proudly admit it's . all about 'showing off' and getting time in the 'spotlight'. The vehicles can cost up to £300,000 to buy, yet one bedroom flats in some parts of the borough are worth as little as £70,000. The group wanted to head to their National Record of Achievement (NRA) ceremony in style, and found this spectacular to attend their prom-like celebration. 'It's showing off, basically. Playing music, going from area to area to area,' said Foyzur Rahman, a pupil at Swanlea School, who attended the ceremony this year and split a £400 fee with a friend to rent an Audi S4 for four days. 'Showing off your car, just everyone looking at you. It's like your spotlight,' Rahman said. 'When every NRA comes you just feel excited for the kids,' said Ibrahim Hussain who went through the rite of passage last year and works part-time at his brother's car-hire business, which rents out vehicles for the ceremonies. 'Certain people obviously don't want to spend the money, you can understand that, their parents might be not working. But certain kids, obviously, they're crazy, they'll save up from young and they just want to hire it,' Hussain said. Tough upbringing: Reyaz Rahman, 16, poses in Tower Hamlets, in front of homes that are worth less than some of the cars on show .

Larking about: Tahmina Ahmed, 16, poses in front of a Rolls Royce hired by friends for a parade of 'supercars' to celebrate leaving school . Tower Hamlets is home to the largest Bangladeshi community in Britain, and the majority of pupils taking part are of Bangladeshi origin. Abdul Hasnath, a senior youth worker with the Osmani Trust youth and community organisation, said the prom-like celebrations probably caught on 14 or 15 years ago, with pupils hiring limousines, but have gotten more lavish - and expensive - since. 'It was quite small at that time, but obviously now it's probably the biggest date on their diaries, including Eid (the Muslim holiday) and everything else.' he said.

Cashing up: Boys from Morpeth School exchange money to pay for the hire of a 'supercar', as they split the costs so they can afford one on their graduation day . The students, who at 16 are too young to drive, were chauffeured through the neighbourhood either by drivers connected with car hire companies or by friends or relatives. Clad in evening wear, they pose for pictures before attending the NRA ceremony at school, during which awards and certificates are distributed, and then head out for the night. Many of those in the more expensive rides switch later to 'after-cars' - saloons or larger vehicles - which they can travel in together, often getting involved in road races. Videos of the day, set to pounding hip-hop and R&B soundtracks, are posted on YouTube. Good crowd: Morpeth School students pose for a group photograph between two super expensive cars on a say they'll remember forever . Springing into action: Stephan Bolompa, 16, leaps out of a Range Rover to have fun with his friends at the prom . Fun times: Rayy Miah sits in the plush car with his friends, although of course none of them are old enough to drive . High-rollers: Students and onlookers watch as a Rolls Royce sweeps into school, with many taking photos om their phones . For some teens, the substantial sums are hard to get together. Stephan Bolompa, a student at Swanlea, said that when he first approached his mother with the price of booking a car, it was too much to take from the family budget. In the end, he was only able to go to the ceremony in a showy ride thanks to a friend's mother, who borrowed a Range Rover Sport for free with the help of a company connection. Getting the vehicle meant a lot to him: 'Just the feeling that you're actually taking part in the ceremony by having a car, it's a good feeling,' he said.","A new craze is sweeping through east London, where teenagers rent expensive cars to celebrate leaving school .

A 15-year-old Indiana girl whose brave struggle with cancer who inspired thousands, including stars like CeeLo Green and Tom Cruise, has died. The purple Sarah Strong campaign began when Sarah Crane of Michiana was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer in July, one of the youngest people ever to be diagnosed with such an advanced form of the disease. Over the last five months she endured multiple surgeries and two intensive rounds of chemotherapy but the cancer did not respond to treatment. Gone but not forgotten: Sarah Crane, 15, lost her battle with cancer Saturday afternoon after five months of treatment . Sarah Crane's grace and courage in the face of such an ordeal inspired her whole community, who turned out en masse in purple 'Sarah Strong' t-shirts to raise money for the Crane family in fun runs, parades, cookouts and car washes. The teenager's death has triggered an outpouring of grief from people around the country who were touched by Sarah Crane's story. 'No matter what, I'm still going to wear my shirt for Sarah,' 13-year-old Nick Matthews told WNDU today. Sarah was a sophomore at Elkhart Memorial High School when she became one of the youngest people ever to be diagnosed with such an advanced form of colon cancer. Community united: Sarah's hometown rallied around her and her family, helping raise money with purple Sarah Strong t-shirts . Sarah Strong: Sarah Crane was one of the youngest people ever to be diagnosed with such an aggressive form of colon cancer . Just days before her diagnosis Sarah, a talented athlete, ran a six-mile race. A spider-like bruise appeared on her back and she went to the doctor who diagnosed her with cancer. 'She had run two days before that and it was a six-mile run. Just think about how difficult that must have been,' her track coach told ABC 57. The aggressive disease was relentless, but Sarah refused to give in. Despite the grim prognosis from doctors, she vowed to beat the disease and had embarked on a third round of chemo when her body finally gave out. Just days ago, Sarah's father Dean Crane posted a cautiously hopeful message to Facebook followers about her condition. 'Sarah was handed a terminal prognosis but remained defiant to death and defeat and wished to continue with treatment, regardless of side-effect or pain,' he wrote, adding that his daughter refused to give up if there was even the slightest chance of improvement. Supporter: Miss Indiana USA Mekayla Diehl wears her Sarah Strong purple t-shirt . Worthy cause: Today show hosts Kelly Ripa (left) and Michael Strahan showed their support for Sarah Crane earlier this year . He wrote that at Sarah's next scan, her cancer had not diminished, but had not grown, either - a positive development.'The past several scans and reports showcased an aggressive cancer that refused to respond to any chemotherapy. Strokes and clots had ravished Sarah while the tumors spread from her colon to her liver, lung, bowels, bladder and uterus. 'However, the scan today was different.... there was no movement...In our world, that is a victory. That is an opportunity to glean something positive. Sarah stated ""maybe our prayers are beginning to be answered"" and her subsequent smile reminded me of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland.' Purple hearts: The t-shirts sold raised money to help the Crane family pay for Sarah's hospital care . The Sarah Strong Facebook and Twitter pages were floooded with messages of condolence and love for Sarah and the Crane family. 'It takes a village to raise a child........... not here ............. it took a child to raise this village. Her lessons will live a long time. I thank you for letting us share in her journey and yours. Many prayers for all of you,' wrote one. 'It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you, it's what you leave behind you when you go. #sarahstrong,' tweeted another. Sarah Crane was a twin and also had two other sisters. Her grandmother told ABC57 that Sarah died surrounded by family.","Sarah Crane, 15, has died .

Chemical and radiation experts were yesterday called in following the unexplained death of a man found inside a tent in a field. Police said that there was a ‘strong odour of chemicals’ inside the tent in Port Meadow, Oxford, and officials from the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear team had been sent to the scene. The body was found yesterday afternoon by a passer-by, who became concerned about what he could see and looked inside the tent, before smelling the chemicals and immediately calling police. Discovery: Police said that there was a 'strong odour of chemicals' inside the tent in Port Meadow (file picture), Oxford, and officials from the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear team had been sent to the scene . Within an hour the entire area of Port Meadow had been sealed off and specialist teams began examining the tent and the body for clues to the source and type of the chemicals. Police said the identity of the dead man was not yet known. The chemical involved in the alert was suspected to be hydrogen sulphide, which can lead to death within minutes when inhaled. Residents living near Port Meadow said that emergency services including police and ambulance staff, had been gathering in the nearby area of Jericho at a rendezvous spot set up by police. All other access points for the meadow were also closed off and a police helicopter was seen hovering over the site. Oxford University student Rami Koujah, 22, who lives nearby said: ‘The whole of Port Meadow is closed off. Someone from the emergency services told us there had been a chemical spill.’ Sushila Dhall, chairman of Oxford Pedestrians Association, added: ‘I tried to get onto the meadow but I was turned away and was told there had been a toxic spillage. There were people in full-body suits and police are stopping people from going onto the meadow.’ Police said the death was being treated as unexplained but 'at this time' there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances. Probe: Within an hour the entire area of Port Meadow (file picture) had been sealed off and specialist teams began examining the tent and the body for clues to the source and type of the chemicals . Superintendent Steve Hockin, of Thames Valley Police, said: 'Early indications are that the chemical involved in the death of the man is hydrogen sulphide, but emergency services are working together to examine the scene and recover the body as safely as possible.' A police spokesman said: ‘Thames Valley Police is currently attending the scene of an unexplained death in a field at Port Meadow, Wolvercote, Oxford.

New sounds: Grout first got interested in Arabic music while studying opera at McGill University in Montreal, Canada . Grout became a favorite to win the competition early on, with her performances of classic Arabic songs. While some questioned whether an American who can barely speak Arabic should be allowed to compete in a Middle Eastern talent competition, there was still overwhelming support for Grout - especially amongst the judges. 'You don't speak a word of Arabic, yet you sing better than some Arab singers,' said judge Najwa Karam, a popular Lebanese singer. 'We have for so long imitated the West, and this is the first time that a person who has no link whatsoever to the Arab world, an American girl who does not speak Arabic, sings Arabic songs.' Karam said Grout's third-place achievement is something that's made her 'very happy'. 'It shows music is universal. When it comes to the arts, there are no barriers between us and any other people in the world.' Come again? Jennifer Grout at her audition - where she did not understand the judge's introduction . Susan Boyle moment: American Jennifer Grout blew away a giggling audience by covering Umm Kulthum . Foreign singers have always learned English to conquer the pop market - but it rarely works the other way round. Swedish 1970s pop icons ABBA launched their career in English instead of their mother tongue to win over more foreign fans. Colombian diva Shakira (above) had a huge audience in Latin America but hit the big time when she released her fifth album Laundry Service in English in 2001. Spanish-American crooner Enrique Iglesias was born in Madrid but sang his hit single Hero in English, earning himself global fame. Puerto Rican singer Enrique Martín Morales had limited success in a boy band - until he adopted the stage name Ricky Martin for his hit Livin' La Vida Loca (the crazy life). Iceland's postmodern darling Bjork sings in English, earning her an eclectic audience all over the world. And radio stations in France have even tried to stop singers deserting their mother tongue - by dictating that at least 40 per cent of playlists must be in French . Jennifer - from Cambridge, Massachusetts - is the daughter of a pianist and a violinist and started studying music at the age of 5. She says her ethnic background is English, Scottish and Native American. She was studying opera at McGill University in Montreal when she first discovered Arab music. In 2010 she found a video by the Lebanese singer Fairouz and got hooked on Arabic music, buying a traditional lute-like instrument called an oud. 'I've been working on it and practicing a lot and I listen to it all the time,' she told the show. 'I get a translation or I have one of my Arab friends do a translation for me. 'It was a little bit strange for my family in the beginning, but now they totally support what I do.' She asked for a one-way ticket to Morocco for her college graduation gift and she has been living there since last year. For a brief period, Grout moved to Paris to busk on subways. 'I would step onto the train and hold out my hat and start singing Arabic music,' she told the New York Times. 'Some days I made decent money, other days hardly anything. But, eventually, I figured out which train lines had the most Arabs on them. Once a man on the train shouted at everyone to be quiet so that he could listen to me.' She won over the audience on the talent show by singing Baeed Anak (Away From You) by Umm Kulthum, one of the most celebrated singers in Egypt's history. She also sings in the Berber dialects of traditional communities in Algeria, Morocco, Lybia, Mali, Niger and Tunisia. She told Good Morning America: 'About 30 seconds into it, I think everybody was very surprised. I felt really proud, because the audience went from not taking me seriously to like, wow she's good.'

Waters was hired by AP in 1952. He remained in Southeast Asia and covered conflicts that included the Korean War, the French-Indochina War and Vietnam. He was wounded in Korea, hurt in a helicopter crash in Laos and suffered an eye injury from a bamboo trap in South Vietnam. During the French-Indochina War, Waters covered the fall of the French to the Vietminh. He was one of the last three newsmen to leave Hanoi before it was overrun by the Vietminh in 1954. Waters captured this May 10, 1955 photo of a child sitting in a basin awaiting the return of his parents who were nearby searching the ruins of what was once their home in Cholen, the Chinese community of Saigon .

Under constant surveillance and forbidden to take pictures, Waters hung his camera around his neck and as he walked around, aimed his body and snapped his shutter. Once his film was smuggled out of the country, it provided the first photos from Hanoi under Vietminh rule. In his book, Mizu-San, published in 2011, Waters wrote, 'Very few people can say that they accomplished their life's goal before they were 30 years old. That's what happened to me. It's been a good ride.' Waters was transferred to St. Louis in 1962 and worked there until he retired in 1987.

"'It could be devastating to him' to lose the chickens, pediatrician Dr. Emily Forrest said . By . Alexandra Klausner . PUBLISHED: . 09:46 EST, 7 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:08 EST, 7 December 2013 . An adorable and vivacious autistic 3-year-old from DeBary, Florida may be torn away from his therapeutic pet chickens who've helped him smile and learn to communicate. The Orlando Sentinel reports that the city council made a decision on Wednesday to end the one year trial program on Dec.31 granting residents the right to own backyard coops. J.J. Hart's family learned of the council's heart-wrenching decision and are willing to do anything they can to help their son, diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, keep the chickens that 'helped him find his voice.' J.J. Hart may lose his pet chickens who have proved to be therapeutic in dealing with his autism . Two years ago when the Hart family discovered their child had autism, J.J. gazed at the world with a blank stare. He seldom spoke or laughed and would throw temper tantrums. Today, J.J.s jovial nature is a far cry from the J.J. his parents once knew. They attribute J.J.s positive changes to the pet chickens which J.J. calls 'ducks'. 'He's now doing amazing,' said his mother, Ashleigh Hart. 'He's now going to a new preschool, and he's able to communicate much better. And it all has to do with the chickens. He plays with them. He cuddles with them. And he runs around the yard with them. … It's made a tremendous difference.' What happens if they take away his chickens? J.J.s father Joe Hart is not going to let that happen. Giving up the chickens is 'not an option,' said Joe to The Daily News. The Hart family hired Longwood attorney Mark Nation to reverse the council's decision. They're like family: J.J.'s chickens have helped him to smile . Several Central Florida government are allowing residents to have backyard coops. Residents may gather fresh eggs and keep the chickens as pets. For J.J., the chickens are more like family. Nick Koval, a DeBary council member defends his decision to disallow chicken coops. He thinks chickens 'don't belong' in residential homes or communities. 'It's unfortunate, and I sympathize,' Koval said. 'But we spend a lot of time and money establishing codes and ordinances for the protection of the citizens and taxpayers of this community. And I believe that they [chickens] belong in agricultural areas.' Chicken's may not be the most conventional pet but they have been therapeutic for him . In December of 2012, DeBary enacted a one-year test run allowing families in residential areas to keep three chickens. The program was created after the Hart family, who purchased chickens after researching the positive affect of animals on autism, asked for permission to keep their chickens. keeping a coop is no easy task. Residents wishing to maintain chickens must obtain a city permit. It also costs between $500 and $800 per year to keep a coop with proper fencing. The DeBary council's decision to discontinue residential coops will affect the only two loving homes in the community who decided to care for chickens. One application for a backyard coop was from the Hart's and another was from a woman who wanted to use the chickens for eggs. Ashleigh Hart and Joe Hart hired a lawyer to reverse the city council's decision that even the mayor disagrees with! The Orlando Sentinel spoke with Dr. Emily Forrest, a developmental behavioral pediatrician for Florida Hospital for Children. She specializes in autism and noted the benefits of keeping animals. Even though dogs and horses are more commonly used for autism therapy, she didn't discredit chickens.The Daily News reported that the family thought of getting the boy a dog, but it was unappealing to him. 'It could be devastating to him"" to lose the chickens, Forrest said. Forrest spoke about how change can drastically alter an autistic person's life--especially a young child. 'In this case, this boy has made a connection with these chickens, and it's helped him out,'Forrest said. 'I think chickens are unconventional, but if a child has made progress, then it's really sad for him that he has to stop because of a city ordinance.' Even the town's mayor, Bob Garcia, is on J.J's side. 'It had so many benefits for this child,' Garcia said. 'And it would have shown that we're a community that is compassionate and understanding.' He wanted the program to continue to 2015.","J.J. Hart's chickens have been therapeutic for him and helped him to find laughter .

The mayor, who remains in office but has been stripped of most of his powers, weighed 330lbs earlier this year but says he has quit drinking and adopted a healthier lifestyle . Yesterday he denied allegations he offered $5,000 and a car to suspected drug dealers to buy back the video, court documents suggest. On Wednesday, courts released remaining sections of the 472 page police document covering their investigation into the Mayor's alleged drug abuse, which includes suggestions of heroin use, blackmail and kidnapping. The mayor addressed the issue during an appearance today on a Washington-based sports talk show to make NFL picks on WJFK-FM. 'Number . one that's an outright lie and number two you can talk to my lawyers . about it, but I'm here to talk about football guys,' Ford said. In police wiretaps of alleged gang members one is heard telling another that he rejected the offer for the tape and planned to meet the mayor and ask for '150,' meaning $150,000. Elsewhere in the recordings the men spoke about delivering drugs to Ford and having pictures of him using drugs. On one wiretap on April 20, an alleged . gang member is heard saying, 'Rob Ford was smoking his rocks today' and . that he would post a picture on Instagram.

One afternoon in October, in the watery no-man's land between Thailand and Myanmar, Muhammad Ismail vanished. Thai immigration officials said he was being deported to Myanmar. In fact, they sold Ismail, 23, and hundreds of other Rohingya Muslims to human traffickers, who then spirited them into brutal jungle camps. Roma Hattu, a Rohingya Muslim woman who is nine months pregnant and been displaced, experiencing labour pains. Myanmar authorities have begun segregating minority Muslims from the Buddhist majority . As thousands of Rohingya flee Myanmar to escape religious persecution, an investigation in three countries has uncovered a clandestine policy to remove Rohingya refugees from Thailand's immigration detention centers and deliver them to human traffickers waiting at sea. The Rohingya are then transported across southern Thailand and held hostage in a series of camps hidden near the border with Malaysia until relatives pay thousands of dollars to release them. Three such camps were found, two based on the testimony of Rohingya held there, and a third by trekking to the site, heavily guarded, near a village called Baan Klong Tor. Thousands of Rohingya have passed through this tropical gulag. An untold number have died there. Worried: Bozor Mohammed from the Rakhine state in Myanmar listens during an interview at his house in Kuala Lumpur . Some have been murdered by camp guards or have perished from dehydration or disease, survivors said in interviews. The Thai authorities say the movement of Rohingya through their country doesn't amount to human trafficking. But in interviews for this story, the Thai Royal Police acknowledged, for the first time, a covert policy called 'option two' that relies upon established human-smuggling networks to rid Thailand of Rohingya detainees. Ismail was one of five Rohingya who said that Thai immigration officials had sold him outright or aided in their sale to human traffickers.

'It seemed so official at first,' said Ismail, a wiry farmer with a long narrow face and tight curly hair. 'They took our photographs. They took our finger prints. And then once in the boats, about 20 minutes out at sea, we were told we had been sold.' Ismail said he ended up in a camp in southern Thailand. So did Bozor Mohamed, a Rohingya whose frail body makes him seem younger than his 21 years. The camp was guarded by men with guns and clubs, said Mohamed, and at least one person died every day due to dehydration or disease. 'I used to be a strong man,' the former rice farmer said in an interview, as he massaged his withered legs.

Mohamed's elbow and back are scarred from what he said were beatings administered by his captors in Thailand while he telephoned his brother-in-law in Malaysia, begging him to pay the $2,000 ransom they demanded. Some men failed to find a benefactor in Malaysia to pay their ransom. The camp became their home. 'They had long beards and their hair was so long, down to the middle of their backs, that they looked liked women,' said Mohamed. What ultimately happens to Rohingya who can't buy their freedom remains unclear. A Thai-based smuggler said some are sold to shipping companies and farms as manual laborers for 5,000 to 50,000 baht each, or $155 to $1,550. 'Prices vary according to their skills,' said the smuggler, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The site of a suspected human trafficking camp is seen near Baan Klong Tor in southern Thailand October 30 . The Arakan Project, a Rohingya advocacy group based in Thailand, says it has interviewed scores of Rohingya who have passed through the Thai camps and into Malaysia. Many Rohingya who can't pay end up as cooks or guards at the camps, said Chris Lewa, Arakan Project's director. Presented with the findings of this report, Thailand's second-highest-ranking policeman made some startling admissions. Thai officials might have profited from Rohingya smuggling in the past, said Police Maj-Gen Chatchawal Suksomjit, Deputy Commissioner General of the Royal Thai Police. He also confirmed the existence of illegal camps in southern Thailand, which he called 'holding bays'. A tent is seen in the woods outside a suspected human trafficking camp near Baan Klong Tor, in southern Thailand on October 30, 2013 . Tarit Pengdith, chief of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand's equivalent of the FBI, was also asked about the camps discovered. 'We have heard about these camps in southern Thailand,' he said, 'but we are not investigating this issue.' Besieged by a political crisis and violent street protests this week, Thailand faces difficult questions about its future and global status. Among those is whether it will join North Korea, the Central African Republic and Iran among the world's worst offenders in fighting human trafficking.

The former wife of NBA star Dwyane Wade is in the midst of an apparent meltdown as she has taken to the streets of Chicago carrying a sign saying the Miami Heat guard has left her homeless and ranting about his '$90 million contracts' in an apparent attempt to humiliate him. Wade's former bride, Siohvaughn Funches, has been seen carrying the sign, which reads 'NBA Miami Heat star mother of his children on the street,' around Wade's native Chicago, where he and Funches were high school sweethearts and married in 2002. Wedded bliss didn't last, though, and the couple divorced in 2007 after having two children together, Zaire Blessing Dwyane Wade and Zion Malachi Airamis Wade. Scroll down for video . Bitter: Siohvaughn Funches has hit the streets of Chicago in an attempt to humiliate former husband Dwyane Wade . Superstars: Wade and teammate LeBron James at the ESPN Espy Awards . Earlier this month, Funches filed a new lawsuit against Wade - who signed a six-year contract with the Heat in 2010 worth $107 million - over the splitting of proceeds from his many endorsement deals. With his salary and endorsements, Wade made a total of $26 million last year, landing him at the number 12 spot on Sports Illustrated's 'Fortunate 50' list of the top earners in professions sports. The lawsuit, filed on July 9, in Cook County Circuit Court, claims that Wade is not depositing proceeds from his endorsement deals into a joint account controlled by the two of them - as required by their 2008 divorce settlement.

If you are caught staring at a head-turning outfit, it's normally the wearer who notices your gaze, not the clothes themselves. Until now. A forward-thinking Chinese fashion designer has used complex sensory technology to create a dress that moves, changes shape and even lights up when it is looked at. Montreal-based designer Ying Gao installed her high-fashion creations with eye-tracking technology so that they activate when they sense someone's gaze. Scroll down for video . Worth a closer look: Designer Ying Gao's gaze-activated dresses transform before- and because of- your eyes . Look but don't touch: A base of glow-in-the-dark thread shines through a shredded overlay in a creation that fuses fashion and technology . Gao's loose white and ivory shift dresses are made from shredded and ruched super-organza- the world's lightest fabric. They are sewn with photoluminescent thread and contain tiny eye-tracking electronic devices. The gaze-activated dresses have small motors sewn into them that can move parts of the dress and make them change shape. Sensory technology is used to transform the garments from pale, ethereal dresses into luminescent art works that resemble jellyfish. Tendrils: The ivory pieces of ruched super-organza are engineered to react by moving and lighting up. The dress has tiny motors sewn into it . Phosphorescence: Ying Gao said she was recreating strands of DNA (left) and jellyfish (right) in her conceptual artwork . Ying Gao explained the concept to Dezeen: 'We use an eye-tracking system so the . dresses move when a spectator is staring, she said. '[The . system] can also turn off the lights, then the dresses illuminate.' Gao said she was inspired by an essay by Paul Virilo and told TIME it is, 'about speed, light . and disappearance, so while creating these dresses, I must have . unconsciously related to it as the movement of jellyfish.'

As more of her belongings were removed today, his were delivered - and it was the most obvious sign yet that the . TV chef’s marriage split from the art collector may be permanent. When Nigella Lawson moved out, her husband Charles Saatchi had played down photographs of him grabbing her by the throat and tweaking her nose at a restaurant as a ‘playful tiff’. But she appears to have dashed any hopes he may have that the marriage of the couple - who have a £14million marital home in Chelsea, west London - can be reconciled.

In and out: The arrival of the removal teams at the £14million marital home in Chelsea was the clearest sign yet that the TV chef’s marriage split may be permanent . For the second day today there was a van outside their home, sent . to take away not just her clothes but also her precious cookery . utensils and recipe books – everything, it seems, but the kitchen sink. Glum: . Nigella Lawson seen leaving the rented Mayfair flat where she has been . staying since her husband was pictured throttling her in a restaurant . They appeared in the middle of the afternoon yesterday, evidently while Saatchi was out. Under the direction of Miss Lawson’s . sister Horatia, they trooped in and out of the house removing box after . box, including ones labelled ‘cookbooks’ and ‘kitchen’ as well as a food . processor, clothes and paintings. Other items including Miss Lawson’s . weights and exercise ball, dresses, hats, toys, toiletries and even a . bag of wrapping paper were loaded into the van. One box contained a can labelled . Cannabis – which despite the alarming name is a legal energy drink . containing hemp extract. Miss Lawson was not seen and Saatchi turned up . only after the process was complete. There were so many possessions that . the removal team made two runs. One onlooker said he had been told that some statues had been removed earlier in the day. ‘It looked very much like Nigella is moving all of her personal possessions out of the house – and isn’t going to be back in a hurry,’ he said. Many . items were apparently taken to a storage facility while the rest were . taken to an address some seven miles away in south-west London where . Miss Lawson appears to be setting up home. She was spotted yesterday with Bruno, . her 17-year-old son from her first marriage, before heading back to the . £10,000-a-week Mayfair flat where she has been staying. A man was seen removing a box that had 'cookbooks' written on it from Lawson and Saatchi's house . A Gibson guitar is carefully packed into place among Ms Lawson's other possessions . The . 53-year-old has been seen there several times looking drawn and without . her wedding ring, and while her two children and sister have visited, . there has been no sign of her husband of ten years. Saatchi, 70, has accepted a police caution for assault for the scenes that provoked their split, despite playing it down. The . advertising tycoon turned modern art mogul was photographed grabbing . Miss Lawson by the throat and tweaking her nose outside Scotts . restaurant in central London during an extraordinary 27-minute incident . three Sundays ago. When . Miss Lawson left home after the photos were published a week later, . Saatchi claimed he had simply suggested she moved out to wait for ‘the . dust to settle’.

A plastic box full of personal effects is loaded, including, it appears, a can of Cannabis Energy Drink . A worker removes a box which appears to contain the TV chef's blender . He initially tried to explain the throat-grabbing as a ‘playful tiff’. When further pictures of him twisting Miss Lawson’s nose emerged, he said he had merely been trying to clean her nose. Miss Lawson’s spokesman last night continued to refuse to comment either on the assault incident or on the state of her marriage. But moving her belongings to a different house would appear to signal the start of a divorce between the millionaire celebrity chef and Saatchi, who is said to have a fortune of up to £100million.","Move seems to dash any hopes of reconciliation with husband Saatchi .

Accused: Robert Messer, 37, allegedly had a lengthy sexual relationship with a teenage family friend . A 15-year-old girl who ran away with a 37-year-old family friend before failing to carry out a suicide pact has testified that she first had sex with him when she was in the sixth grade. The teenager said that she had instigated what became a three-year sexual relationship with Robert Messer, a man she had met at church when she was just five years old. After the initial kiss, which occurred as they played video games at his house in Salem Township, Michigan, they went on to have sex 'often' before running away together last month. He was arrested when they were found in a field with superficial wounds on October 29 and he now faces four counts of criminal sexual contact and one count of accosting a child for immoral purposes. Judge Michael Gerou decided on Tuesday . that there was probable cause to send the case to a higher Wayne County . court and Messer will be arraigned in circuit court in Detroit on . November 26. Authorities have previously claimed that he has long groomed the girl for sex. Testifying in court on Tuesday as the judge decided whether to send the case, the girl said that she met Messer as a child and that her mother and his then-wife became good friends. But in middle school, she said she started to have 'emotional feelings' for him and she told him about these feelings, and that she wanted to have a physical relationship, MLive reported. Relationship: The girl, who MailOnline is not identifying as she is an alleged victim of sexual assault, told the court on Tuesday that she had instigated the sexual relationship and that they had sex 'often' She said they began having sex when . she was in the sixth grade and, while she could not remember her exact . age at the time, it would make her about 12 years old. Messer would have . been 34. Defense attorney Jonathan Jones quizzed her on her exact age - if she was 13, the . first-degree criminal sexual contact charge could be lowered to third-degree - but she could not remember. The first time they had sex was at his house. Afterwards, they got dressed and watched a movie, she said. They also had sex at her home in Plymouth Township, she said. 'We would have sex often,' she said. 'I was convinced I was in a relationship with him.' Messer's ex-wife accused the pair of an inappropriate relationship a year ago, but both the teenager and Messer denied it. He and his wife, who have two teenage children, divorced last year. Plot: Messer and the girl ran away in October and slept in his truck for two days after a failed suicide plot . So they went on to continue their relationship before deciding to carry out a suicide pact, she said. On October 27 they left her home at 8am and told her mother they were going hiking. They left behind a note stating they were in love and their intentions to commit suicide, she said. After eating breakfast at his home, watching a movie and having sex, they headed to Maybury State Park in Northville. They decided they would kill themselves with folding knives in the woods, she said, insisting that the decision had been mutual. When they got to the park, they decided against the suicide and drove back to his home - but saw her stepfather's car and a police patrol car. Nightmare: The pair left a note behind professing their love for each other before leaving their homes . 'I panicked and yelled a lot,' she said. Instead they drove to a Salem Township field and stayed there for two days in Messer's pick-up truck. They were then found by police and the girl was treated at hospital for superficial wounds. Messer is being held on a 10 percent of $2 million bond. The maximum penalty for first-degree criminal sexual conduct is life in prison, while third-degree  is a 15-year maximum felony. Soliciting a child for immoral purposes is a four-year maximum felony.","Robert Messer 'started having sex with the girl when she was in 6th grade'

A law-abiding family man was ordered to quit his job after a criminal record check wrongly labelled him a hardened criminal with convictions stretching back a decade. David Reay was wrongly identified as being guilty of offences including burglary, theft and possession of cocaine when details of a criminal with a similar name were given to his new employers after they asked for a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check. Mr Reay, who lives with his wife . Stephanie and six-year-old son Robert in South Benwell, Newcastle, had . just taken up a training post for his new position with the National . Citizen Service as child and adult welfare helpline advisor, when the . mistake occurred. The 33-year-old has now been left in limbo as he cannot return to work while he waits for the verdict of his appeal. Mistaken identity: David Reay was wrongly labelled a hardened criminal following a mix-up during a CRB check . He said: 'I’d got the job and started my two weeks of training when my wife rang and said ""your CRB has arrived and there seems to be a problem with it"". 'I immediately told my employers who said they were sorry but I’d have to leave and they’d keep the post open for me while I appealed against the results of the check. 'That was back at the start of September and I’ve been without work or a wage ever since while my appeal to the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) was dealt with. 'I was left in limbo despite the criminal record obviously not belonging to me as so many of the details were different. I was angry as it could have so easily been sorted out, but I was told I’d have to wait for at least three weeks before I could even chase up my appeal.' Authorities asked Northumbria Police for any criminal convictions linked to Mr Reay as part of the enhanced CRB, which is now known as the Disclosure and Barring Service checks. But the details of a different person from the North East were sent. Appeal: Mr Reay has been left in limbo as he cannot return to work while he waits for the verdict of his appeal . Criminal convictions including burglary, theft, possession of cocaine and drink driving, spanning over a decade, were all on the record. Mr Reay said: 'It was ridiculous, I’ve . never even had a driving licence. We were meant to be taking a trip to . Cadbury World for my son’s birthday but with no wage had to cancel it. Mr Reay, pictured with his six-year-old son Robert, had just taken up a training post for his new position with the National Citizen Service when the mistake occurred . 'I was in limbo not knowing when it would be sorted out.' Northumbria Police moved to resolve the identity error with Mr Reay, who now hopes to restart his training on November 2. A force spokesman said: 'We acknowledge that in this case, due to a human error, Mr Reay’s details were incorrectly matched to another individual with similar details and this resulted in information that did not relate to Mr Reay being disclosed on his Enhanced Disclosure Certificate. 'We have spoken to Mr Reay, and unreservedly apologised, and have advised him that his dispute has been returned to DBS and a revised, accurate certificate will be provided to him as quickly as possible. 'We have also reassured him that his employment will not be affected, and with his permission, have spoken to his employer to explain our error. We will keep Mr Reay updated with progress and advised him he can contact us at any time if he has concerns.' Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'This highlights why the ability of people to check their disclosure before it is sent to employers is so important. 'The process needs to be in place for people to not spend huge amounts of time waiting to them to be corrected, as any delay could do serious harm to their job prospects.'","Police gave authorities details of wrong man in CRB check .

Hospitalty: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam have taken full advantage of Chevening stately home . Nick Clegg was the subject of a formal complaint after refusing to pay a food and drinks bill for thousands of pounds at his official grace-and-favour home. The official in charge of Chevening, the palatial Kent mansion used by the Deputy Prime Minister, protested to the Cabinet after Mr Clegg objected to paying for lavish entertaining at private functions. After a bitter dispute with Mr Clegg, taxpayers were forced to meet part of the bill, with the  Liberal Democrat leader reluctantly paying the lion’s share. Chevening, near Sevenoaks, was built in the 17th Century and has 115 rooms. Mr Clegg shares it with Foreign Secretary William Hague. They are allowed to use the stately home for free, with food and drink supplied, when on official business such as entertaining visiting dignitaries. But they must pay for food and drink when using it privately with family and friends. Well-placed sources say  Mr Clegg, who has taken full advantage of his free access to Chevening with his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, had paid for much of his private entertaining, but had disputed that he was  liable for some costs. It led to a fierce dispute between Mr Clegg and Edward Barham, vice-chairman of the Chevening Trust, which runs the house. Prominent Kent landowner Mr Barham told Mr Clegg he had no right to expect the  public to pay for private gatherings at Chevening. When Mr Clegg refused to back down, Mr Barham fired off two protest letters to Tory Cabinet Minister Andrew Lansley, who in his capacity as Lord Privy Seal is the Minister responsible for overseeing Chevening and other grace-and-favour ministerial homes. Insiders say Mr Barham told Mr Lansley: ‘There is an issue with Nick Clegg and Chevening. You sit round the Cabinet table with him. Can’t you sort it out?’ Palatial: Chevening in Kent is shared by Mr Clegg and the Foreign Secretary William Hague . A source said: ‘Mr Barham was very cross. William Hague pays all his bills promptly, but Clegg wouldn’t. ‘It was explained to him that he doesn’t have to pay when he visits Chevening in his official capacity as a Minister because it can be classified as work. ‘But if he is there with friends and family merely to enjoy himself, it is not work and he must pay. It seems simple enough, but he just didn’t get it. He kept saying, “I am a Minister whenever I am here”.’ Mr Clegg earns £134,000 a year and his wife is said to be paid up to £500,000 as a partner at US law firm Dechert. Complaint: The vice chairman of the Chevening Trust which runs the home, Edward barham, wrote a letter of complaint to Andrew Lansley, pictured, who is responsible for the estate in his role as Lord Privy Seal . Mr Clegg last night vehemently denied any wrong- doing and insisted he had paid in full when using Chevening privately. Mr Barham’s complaints led to negotiations with Mr Clegg over how much of the outstanding food and drinks bill, which amounted to several thousand pounds, he would pay. In the end a compromise was reached, with Mr Clegg paying most,  and the rest coming from his publicly funded Cabinet Office  coffers. The precise amounts paid by the taxpayer and Mr Clegg are not known. When Mr Barham was asked by The Mail on Sunday about the row, he said: ‘Erm  .  .  .  I don’t think I will say anything.  There are no outstanding bills at Chevening and that matter  is closed.’ He then put down  the phone. A Cabinet Office spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ‘The Deputy Prime Minister has always paid and continues to pay for any private events at Chevening.’ A source close to the Mr Clegg said: ‘It is wrong to suggest Nick hasn’t paid his bills at Chevening. Private gatherings are paid for by Nick and Miriam. Official ones are paid for by the Government.’ The Cabinet Office declined to say how many times the Cleggs have used Chevening in the past three years. Last year it emerged that he had invited four Lib Dem party funders to dine there, including James Palumbo, founder of the  Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and who has been tipped for a Lib Dem peerage. Last night, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘Nick Clegg may have settled his bar bill but it appears it took a complaint to get him to do so. I hope he pays up immediately in future.’","Nick Clegg shares Chevening, in Kent, with the Foreign Secretary .

The . judge said: ‘My starting point is that, unless there is very good . reason to the contrary, the [Court of Protection] rules should start off . in the same way [as those governing the family courts], with the same . starting point, and proceed in a similar fashion. 'One . very striking difference is that, in the family court, any accredited . media representative has the right to attend all family proceedings . . . . the starting point in the Court of Protection is completely the . other way round. 'My . feeling is that the starting point should be the same in both, so that . there should be the same kind of presumptive right of media access to .

Controversial case: Wanda Maddocks was jailed in secret after trying to remove her father from a care home . This . month one of the country’s most senior judges, Lord Neuberger, . president of the Supreme Court, praised the Mail for exposing the secret . jailing of Mrs Maddocks by the court, which was set up in 2007 under . Labour’s Mental Capacity Act. It gave the State draconian powers to intervene in the lives of those deemed unfit to look over their own affairs. The Mail highlighted Miss Maddocks’s shock when police arrived at her father John’s care home to ‘cart her off to jail’. She had been sentenced in secret for disobeying court orders by trying to remove him from the home. She served six weeks. The case forced Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, to order that no one else should ever be jailed in private without the sentence and reasons for it being announced outside the closed courtroom. Lord Justice Munby is keen to further open up the family courts – which journalists can now attend but are more often than not prevented from reporting the details of a case. He said that while there were differences between the family court and the Court of Protection, they should be part of a single system. More judgments should be published, so that the public could have confidence that justice was being done.","Senior judge sir James Munby indicates rules should be changed .

The dust has barely settled since last week's launch of Apple's new iPhones, but that hasn't stopped the rumour mill starting up again - this time about the imminent arrival of a second-generation iPad mini as well as an iPad 5. Reports suggest that Apple will launch successors to its current range of tablets at an event on 15 October, and leaked photos hint at what the tablets could look like, including a range of colourful cases. The speculation comes as sales figures show Apple's gamble with colourful iPhones is paying off, with the pink model accounting for 46 per cent of sales - almost more than all the other colours combined. Almost half of iPhone 5C sales are of the pink model, according to iPhoneStockChecker. The blue model is second most-popular, accounting for 32 per cent of 5C sales. In third place is green, at 12 per cent, followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear, accounting for just 1 per cent of sales . The plastic iPhone 5C range, pictured, is the first time Apple has released its handsets in a selection of colours. The strategy was used on earlier iPods, and Apple may be looking to follow suit with a range of colourful iPad 5s, or at least more colourful cases, according to leaked images . Apple announced it has smashed its own records by selling nine million iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets during the first three days - working out as 125,000 an hour, on average, or around 2083 a minute. The tech giant also announced that 200 million devices are now running the iOS 7 software, despite download problems and divided opinion. Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012, yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this year's two - and it wasn't sold in China from launch. Reports from iPhoneStockChecker.co.uk found that the blue model is the second most-popular device, accounting for 32 per cent of 5C sales. In third place is green, at 12 per cent, followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear, accounting for just 1 per cent of sales. Apple could be looking to take this strategy into the iPad part of the business. Experts have already said there could be at least two new iPads released as soon as next month. Apple is yet to officially confirm the date of its next product launch, but analysts have begun pointing towards the 15 October. During the iPhone announcement on 10 September, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new . hardware, software and services that we can’t wait to introduce this . fall and throughout 2014.' The current iPad mini came out in . November 2012 and if Apple follows suit, this would suggest a . mid-October announcement followed by an early-November sale date, all in . time for Christmas. The price of the current iPads is also being cut in various regions, suggesting a new tablet is coming. A new range of iPads are expected to launch on 22 October. These leaked images from technology site Tactus, allegedly show the rear shell of the iPad 5, pictured, with coloured cases. Apple could also unveil a second-generation iPad mini . It's likely the iPad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9-inch screen and not drop to 7-inches, in a bid to stay slightly bigger than Google's Nexus 7 and Tesco's new Hudl. If Apple adds the Retina display seen on its new iPhones and larger iPads, its possible the second-generation iPad mini will be heavier and thicker. However, leaked photos of casing suggest it will be thinner - suggesting Apple will wait to add the high-definition display to later models. According to Apple site, 9to5Mac, the rumoured iPad 5 will also keep the 9.7-inch, high-resolution screen seen on older models. The camera is due an upgrade and is . rumoured to move to an 8MP rear-facing lens, with the possibility of . even a 12MP camera being added.

Leaked images from Tactus additionally suggest the iPad 5 will be thinner than its predecessors. Technology site Expert Reviews believes Apple will stick with its traditional pricing strategy for both models and charge the same price for its new products as it did for the outgoing models. For example, the 16GB iPad 5 is expected to cost around £399, this raises to £479 for 32GB and £559 for 64GB. If Apple additionally follows its . iPad 4 launch and introduces a 128GB iPad 5 model, this should start at . around £639 for 128GB, while 4G-ready models will cost more still. Similarly, the iPad mini is expected . to launch with at around £269 for 16GB and then in £80 increments for . the 32BG and 64GB models. Models with 3G and 4G access will cost more. Because the colourful iPhones have proved so popular, case manufacturer Mophie has created a range of cases in purple, green, pink, red and blue for the older iPhone 5. The cases are known as Juice Packs because they can also be used to give the phone a battery boost. Mophie claims the cases offer 80 per cent more power.

Try telling that to Orchard Goldenboy, who looks as though he’s drawn the inspiration for his rather bouffant hairdo straight from Limahl, lead singer of 80s band Kajagoogoo. But it wouldn’t do to mock his carefully coiffed locks. Because two-year-old budgie Orchard Goldenboy is a chart-topper himself – in fact, he is officially the number one of his kind in the world. Top prize: Two-year-old budgie Orchard Goldenboy has just been crowned best in show at the Budgerigar Society World Championship and (right) Limahl of Kajagoogoo . He has just been crowned best in show at the Budgerigar Society World Championship, the so-called ‘Crufts for budgies’. With his eye-catching feather-cut, he’s a little more flamboyant than the average budgie. And little wonder. He’s a pedigree goldenface grey budgie, bred especially to achieve his distinctive looks by Richard Miller and his father Michael, who live near Carlisle. Pedigree budgies are taller than their ordinary counterparts, usually measuring around 6in. They also have wider faces and large, distinctive neck spots. The Millers have been breeding budgies for more than 20 years. Richard, now  a 30-year-old partner at a law firm, got  his first one aged eight ‘as a means of appeasing’ him after his parents would not buy him a dog. His interest grew from there, and today he and  63-year-old Michael keep around 300 budgies in a 32ft by 10ft aviary. Pedigree budgies can be bought for £50. Following his win, however, Orchard Goldenboy could be worth considerably more. But Richard said: ‘I’m not saying someone would not pay a lot of money for a bird like this. ‘But it would be like selling your  life’s work, it would not be worth it.  You can’t put a value on a bird like this, he is priceless.’","Orchard Goldenboy won top prize at 'budgie crufts'

Plenty of people have installed breadmakers in their kitchens to make fresh loaves, but now a company in Seattle plans on launching a compact home-brewing system so beer fans never run out of pints. Just like a breadmaker, the microwave-sized machine allows users to add a handful of fresh ingredients into it and push a button to make a keg of beer. The PicoBrew Zymatic system costs £992 and claims to brew 'high quality all-grain beer' in a week from three ingredients - water, grain and hops. Scroll down for video . The PicoBrew Zymatic system costs £992 and claims to brew 'high quality all-grain beer' in a week from three ingredients - water, grain and hops . Once the ingredients are poured into the machine, it takes three-and-a-half hours to start the beer-making process - and then the reults can be left in a keg to ferment for a week. The invention, which has exceeded its fundraising target on crowd-funding website Kicktstarter, is the brainchild of two brothers in Seattle. They came up with the idea three years ago and have invested 'thousands of man hours' in designing the machine. The machine takes three-and-a-half hours to make beer wort or unfermented beer, which is then kept in a keg after yeast is added. In just one week the final beer recipe is ready to drink . To work the machine, users start by picking a recipe and filling a five-gallon keg with water - attaching it on the side the the PicoBrew Zymatic. Home brewers then add the grain to the main compartment of the machine (called the step filter) and pour hops into the appropriate hops cages that slot into the step filter, according to the recipe, before selecting the recipe to brew using the front panel screen on the machine. In about three-and-a-half hours the keg is no longer filled with water but contains beer wort - or fermented beer. To work the machine, users start by picking a recipe and fill a five gallon keg with water - attaching it on the side the the PicoBrew Zymatic. Home brewers then add the grain to the main compartment of the machine, called the step filter . The brewer then only has to detach the keg from the machine and chill it to room temperature before adding yeast and sealing it shut. The company says the final recipe will then be ready in a week's time. Bill and Jim Mitchell started their company PicoBrew in 2010 out of frustration with home-brewing kits because they 'take up too much time, are too imprecise and frankly, when you account for all of the clean-up, are not all that fun'. Once the grain is in place, users fill the appropriate hops cages according to their chosen recipe that slot into the step filter. In about three-and-a-half-hours the keg is no longer filled with water but contains un-fermented beer . 'We wanted to make the creation of high-quality beer brewing simple, amp up the art, and tone down the tedium,' said Bill Mitchell, who spent over 19 years at Microsoft, creating computing appliances for consumers. Having built a proof of concept model, the brothers created subsequent models to come up with a new brewing process that allows the pre-loading of ingredients with little human input aside from pushing some buttons and filling containers. As well as building a motherboard, the pair worked on refining the brewing process - especially mash efficiency and hops utilisation - for the next generation models and moved into a lab in downtown Seattle on North Lake Union. Users select a recipe using the screen on the front of the PicoBrew machine. The brothers behind the invention created software that allows users to make recipes by importing existing beer recipes that they like, which are automatically scaled for use in the PicoBrew Zymatic . After three years and a dozen . prototypes, the founding members of PicoBrew have raised over three . times the amount of money they needed on Kickstarter. As home-brewing fans, they said they were frustrated that some recipes could not be easily used for different makers and kits, and have consequently created the PicoBrew Recipe Crafter software.

Cash: Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury is accused of funneling money towards his Highlands constituency . The Lib Dem minister in charge of the government’s spending cuts is accused of funnelling millions of pounds to pet schemes in his own constituency. Danny Alexander faces claims he is shoring up votes in his Highlands seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere. Labour claimed there was something ‘very fishy indeed’ about the number of expensive schemes and tax breaks which benefit Mr Alexander’s ‘backyard’. Since May 2010 several specific projects have received extra money for Mr Alexander’s Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch & Strathspey constituency. As Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he is effectively George Osborne’s deputy and responsible for signing off all government spending. In an apparent admission that money is being redirected to northern Scotland, a senior Liberal Democrat told the FT: ‘This is the pay-off. Danny is loyal to George, and this is what he gets in return.’ Cash secured for his seat includes a tax break for ski-lifts, a bail-out for a sleeper train from London to Scotland and more money to fund exceptions to housing benefit than any other council, the Financial Times said. Just last week the government . announced extra funding to help councils cope with the fall out of . changes to housing benefit rules, which mean some people will lose money . if they have spare bedrooms. The cash is supposed to help some people who might be affected by the so-called ‘bedroom tax’. But Highland Council, where all three . MPs are Lib Dem including Mr Alexander, received £735,000 – 80 per cent . more than the next highest Aberdeenshire which received £412,000. In total Highland received 15 per cent of the entire pot available to 21 local authorities. Deputy council leader David Alston credited meetings with Mr Alexander for securing the money. Cool deals: Ski lifts in Cairngorm Mountains of the Scottish Highlands have seen their VAT rate cut to just 5 per cent while the CairnGorm mountain railway which runs for two kilometers through the Cairngorm ski area has been exempted from the climate change levy . Also last week Mr Alexander unveiled plans to extend a fuel rebate currently only available to people living on islands to include remote rural areas, including the Highlands. Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said: ‘This is very fishy indeed. It seems to be more than a coincidence that, at a time of austerity, funding has gone from the Treasury to so many specific projects that just happen to benefit Danny Alexander’s constituency. ‘The chief secretary seems to be happy pushing through deep tax rises and spending cuts across the rest of the country, so long as his backyard is protected,’ he told the FT. ‘When everyone else is paying higher VAT, is it really a priority to give a big VAT cut to ski-lift operators?,’ Mr Leslie added. Critics have likened the spending to pork barrel politics. But challenged over the claims last . month, Mr Alexander told House magazine: 'I’m an MP from the Highlands, . that’s true. I’m the first Highlander to occupy Cabinet office for . several generations. 'I think that the fact that for the . first time in several generations someone at the top of Government has . had an understanding of one of the most fragile areas of this country is . a good thing. 'That is what gives me insights into issues that are important.' However, the list of specific projects in his seat which appear to have benefited from special treatment is long and growing. In January it was announced that . £50million of UK government money had been found to help pay for the . refurbishment of the Caledonian Sleeper, which terminates in Inverness. At the time Mr Alexander boasted of . ‘having worked hard to deliver £50m of UK government support’, adding: . ‘As someone who uses that route I am looking forward to the excellent . staff service being matched by facilities which will make enhance the . trip and make the London sleeper an experience to savour.’ Travel perks: The Caledonian Sleeper, which terminates in Mr Alexander's constituency, received £50million from the government and last week it was announced a fuel rebate for British islands could be extended to remote rural areas, including the Highlands . The Budget in 2012 was dominated by rows over taxes on pasties and caravans. But it also included a VAT cut for ski lifts, to just five per cent, which caused Mr Alexander to boast: ‘CairnGorm has some of the finest snowsports and outdoor facilities in the UK and hopefully this will help the resort maintain its vital role in our economy here in Strathspey.’ In 2011 a tourist train running up the Cairngorm mountain received a tax break, when the Treasury exempted any ‘non-public service rail operators’ from the climate change levy. However, it is thought that the Cairngorm tourist train was the only project which could qualify. A spokesman for Mr Alexander said: ‘Liberal Democrats are working hard to make sure this government governs for the whole country and is the first for many years to take rural areas seriously. 'It is right that the Government recognises the significant challenges for those living in rural communities up and down the country and does what it can to support them. 'This is in addition to the practical help we are delivering for everyone in Britain through the largest income tax cuts in a generation, freezes in fuel duty and freezes in council tax.’","Chief Secretary to the Treasury is in charge of spending cuts .

Recognising that fitting both a healthy lifestyle and a dating life can be hard with today’s hectic schedules, a gym in London has decided to combine the two. Singles Yoga allows you to take part in a yoga class while getting to meet and interact with other singles in the area, with the added bonus that you’ve already seen them in Lycra. The classes contain a lot of couple and partner work, and are followed with a pub social . Richard Brook Singles Yoga aims to help people connect with themselves, and thus make connections with other singles at a deeper level . The class combines yoga, involving plenty of paired and couple work to allow people connect. The class, held each week at The Albany Club near Baker Street in London, is run by Richard Brook, a trained acupuncturist who also works with other complementary and natural medicines and lifestyle practices such as Tai Chi. He began the singles yoga classes after noticing that yoga seemed to make people more sociable. Richard says: ‘What better way to meet someone then when you are killer relaxed, full of feel good hormones and having engaged with a shared experience together? ‘When I first moved to London I used to follow each class with a social event and people felt more relaxed and able to chat. ‘What I’ve noticed a lot in my classes is that people find it a lot easier to become embodied and keep their energy and attention. ‘The first 10 minutes of a class is generally a sequence that allows you to become focused on your own body. Richard is a trained acupuncturist and also works with other complementary and natural medicines and lifestyle practices such as Tai Chi . Richard demonstrates one of the coupled poses used in the Singles Yoga class . ‘Where it gets interesting is when people have to meet and partner someone else. ‘I think this is similar to how we are in real life and how we are socially with people. ‘We don’t meet people in an embodied place and so you don’t have the same degree of presence about you. Wendy, who goes to yoga once a week, says: . 'Using a yoga class as a way to meet men seems a bit strange. 'Yoga for me is about letting go, being totally in the moment and not allowing myself to be distracted by anything else – it’s about having no ego. 'I want to be free for that hour of worries about my appearance and whether I look fat in my Lycra. The last place I want to be judged by a man is at my yoga class. 'Plus, it is incredibly hard work so by the end of a class I always look so wiped out I’m not sure I’d be in a fit state to go to the pub.' ‘In the singles yoga I work with getting people to partner up and, moving very slowly, into doing the exercises from a focused and embodied place. ‘Ill have them put their attention inside themselves, staying very relaxed and then come into contact with the other person. ‘I think it is very good training for life in general. It’s very common that we meet and engage with people and straight away we tighten up, but if we can stay embodied there can be a great energetic potency between two people. ‘I see a lot of people coming again and again because they have their eye on someone!’ To foster the connections made during the class- which generally lasts for about an hour and a half- the class ends with a pub social where you can chat to the other singles over a drink or three. In response to yoga fans who fear that combining yoga with a quest for romance goes against the aim of conventional yoga to remove all vanity and focus on your inner self Richard says: ‘There are many different types of yoga and this is about helping people connect with others from a non-vain, embodied place. 'Yoga translates to unity and harmony - and this includes the world and people around us' 'Honest connection with people and finding harmony with others in itself is a life skill, and yoga is all about teaching life skills.’ The classes are open to all abilities, and cost £10 for both males and females, and Richard also runs 'Social Yoga' classes where people can make like-minded friends.

Uniformed Romanian police officers have begun patrolling the streets of Paris to help fight a growing tide of criminality among their immigrant countrymen. In scenes which could soon be replicated in Britain, 20 officers have been introduced to help clamp down on Roma street gangs. It follows a 78 per cent rise in the number of Romanians arrested in the France city over the past two years. Twenty Romanian officers have joined Paris forces in a bid to clamp down on Roma street gangs (file picture) In January, the UK is expected to see an influx of Romanians and Bulgarians arriving when EU labour restrictions are lifted. There have been warnings that they will include criminal gangs that often use children to target their victims. Last month a squad of eight detectives from Romania and three officers from Poland joined the Metropolitan Police on raids, interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database. In France it has been reported that Romanian teenagers work with adult gangsters to prey on tourists visiting famous monuments like Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre museum. The Roma gangs use a variety of tricks to try to con money out of people, including pretending to be deaf and dumb, or saying they are involved in charity collections. If these fail, they pickpocket their victims, or threaten them with violence before running off. The situation has become so bad, that the Romanian officers were drafted in last week – mainly because they can communicate with the gangs. There has been a 78 per cent rise in number of arrests of Romanians in Paris over past two years (file picture) A statement issued by police in the French capital reads: ‘Wearing their own uniforms, they are taking part in patrols of public areas and supporting their French colleagues in securing the major tourist and shopping centres.’ The statement says they will ‘contribute to collecting information, and to the identification of Romanian criminal networks’. At present, most of the gang members say they cannot speak a word of French, making dealing with them hugely difficult. Many are illegal immigrants who never carry any kind of identification papers either. Ten Romanian police are now based permanently in France and have helped break up 10 suspected theft rings in less than a year. The scheme has now been extended to officers patrolling the streets with at least 20 officers based in the city. It has led to a five per cent drop in Romanian street crime this year, but the French government said that Romanians from the impoverished eastern European state are still responsible for a massive amount of anti-social behaviour. In France it has been reported that Romanian teenagers work with adult gangsters to prey on tourists visiting famous monuments like Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre museum (pictured) A tourist is pickpocketed in Paris (file picture). French police say the Romanian officers will work with them at shopping centres and the major tourism sites . Many live in vast illegal camps on the outskirts of Paris which the police regularly try to shut down. Children arrested by the police can seldom be prosecuted, and are instead let off with a caution at most, leaving them free to carry on with their crimes. In September, Manuel Valls, the France’s Socialist Interior Minister, said most of the estimated 20,000 Romanians in France had no intention of integrating into society and should be deported. This has led to an outcry among opponents, including many in his own party, who think that eastern European immigrants should be given a chance to build lives for themselves abroad. Attempts to deport them usually end with those sent home coming straight back again. Last month, Paris police smashed a Romanian pickpocketing ring which trafficked hundreds of children across Europe, including Britain. All recruits were threatened with severe beatings if they did not go out to steal. More than 200 children, some as young as 12, were given targets of stealing up to £250 a day before being dropped off in the centre of the city, and ordered to target tourists. Many of the minors involved were arrested, cautioned and released hundreds of times, but were simply sent back out to steal. Gangs of aggressive Roma youngsters have become a routine sight in central Paris, especially around cash points.","20 officers introduced in French capital to clamp down on Roma gangs .

But unlike many other politicians, the outspoken MEP Godfrey Bloom clearly doesn’t take himself too seriously. After a year in which he has grabbed the headlines for outspoken comments about aid to ‘Bongo Bongo Land’ and women being ‘sluts’ for not doing the cleaning properly, the 64-year-old and his wife have posed for a self-mocking Christmas card. Godfrey Bloom holds bongos in their Christmas card and wife Katie does her best 'slut' impression . The MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, who quit the UK Independence Party in September to sit as an independent, clutches bongos given to him by a music shop while his wife Katie is dressed as a ‘slut’. The photo, taken in the kitchen of the couple’s house in a village near Goole, East Yorkshire, will be on cards posted to friends and family. Mr Bloom said yesterday: ‘It’s a little bit of fun and I’m sure the photo will give people a good laugh. 'We have done a few of these photo cards of ourselves over the years, but we only ever send self-deprecatory ones. 'It would be terribly vulgar and naff to send a Christmas card making us look good.’ And if there was ever any doubt about Mrs Bloom’s backing for her gaffe-prone husband, this picture dispels them. Referring to equine physiotherapist Mrs Bloom, 52, whom he calls ‘Commander in Chief', he said of the festive photo: 'It was her idea.' Godfrey Bloom was forced out of UKIP after he hit a TV journalist over the head with a conference programme . He said: ‘She said “why don’t we stick two fingers up at the b*******” and so we did this. It was fun to do.’ It’s been an extraordinary year for the previously little-known politician who has found himself front-page news for his outlandish comments and behaviour. He already had a reputation as a ‘sexist dinosaur’ for comments about women needing to ‘clean behind the fridge’, then he highlighted concerns about spending on foreign aid with a supposedly ‘racist’ speech about helping ‘Bongo Bongo land’ and he followed that up by his jokey announcement at a UKIP fringe meeting promoting women in politics that ‘the room is full of sluts.’ Mr Bloom, who has recently published his autobiography, was finally forced out of UKIP after he hit a TV journalist over the head with a conference programme in an angry on-camera clash. Relaxing at home, the former city investment manager said his wife’s pose with dusters, a glass of red wine, curlers, cigarette in mouth, apron and bright red lipstick, was her best attempt ‘to portray a slut.’ While he always enjoyed playing his pair of bongo drums. Might some of Mr Bloom’s critics take offence again? Well if they do he and his wife certainly don’t care.","MEP Godfrey Bloom poses with bongos in family Christmas card .

Candidate: Karen Whitefield is a campaigns officer for the office and shopworkers' union Usdaw . Labour last night ignored the lessons of the Falkirk scandal and selected another female union employee as its candidate for the troubled Scottish seat. Karen Whitefield is a campaigns officer for the office and shopworkers’ union Usdaw. Her selection comes despite accusations earlier this year that another union, Labour’s paymaster Unite, had rigged votes in favour of its preferred candidate, Karie Murphy. Unite was accused of signing up local people as Labour members without their knowledge. But even after the scandal forced the search for a new candidate, the local Labour party has chosen another female trade unionist – rather than taking the opportunity to distance itself from the unions. Miss Whitefield, who beat two other female selection candidates, was previously Member of the Scottish Parliament for Airdrie and Shotts before she lost her seat in 2011. She said Labour must now work hard to regain trust following the fraught selection process to replace disgraced MP Eric Joyce – who was kicked out of the party after an assault in a House of Commons bar. ‘It’s time to move forward and look to the future,’ she said. ‘I think this will unite us. ‘We will look to the future, and be out there working hard to regain people’s trust, which they have given to us in the past, and to earn that trust for the future.’ In July, Labour leader Ed Miliband launched a ferocious attack on the selection process in Falkirk after allegations that  Unite had rigged votes to ensure Karie Murphy was chosen. Claims: Miss Whitefield's selection comes despite accusations earlier this year that another union, Labour¿s paymaster Unite, had rigged votes in favour of its preferred candidate, Karie Murphy (pictured) She . is a close friend of Unite’s militant leader Len McCluskey, and was . office manager for Labour’s then deputy chairman Tom Watson, who . resigned in the wake of the scandal. Mr Miliband said the claims were fuelling a ‘growing mistrust in politics’, but an internal inquiry was quietly dropped in September after witnesses apparently withdrew their evidence. Mr Miliband has refused to publish the internal report and has rejected calls to reopen the inquiry in the light of fresh evidence. However, leaked documents suggested there was ‘no doubt that [Unite] members were recruited in an attempt to manipulate party processes’. Anger: In July, Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured) launched a ferocious attack on the selection process in Falkirk after allegations that Unite had rigged votes to ensure Karie Murphy was chosen . The report also found ‘evidence that signatures were forged’. And leaked emails also claim that elements of the Labour leadership knew about and ‘approved’ Unite’s strategy, despite it being against party rules. 'Despite Ed Miliband promising to cut his links with his union paymasters, clearly nothing has changed as they parachute in another one of their chosen candidates' Priti Patel . Unite has always denied wrongdoing, but Labour put the local party under ‘special measures’. The councillor who blew the whistle on the claims of vote-rigging was also snubbed in the selection process. Former Falkirk Council leader Linda Gow said she was ‘disappointed’ not to be on the final shortlist. Tory MP Priti Patel last night said the Labour leader was ‘too weak’ to stop union influence. ‘Despite Ed Miliband promising to cut his links with his union paymasters, clearly nothing has changed as they parachute in another one of their chosen candidates,’ she said. ‘If he can’t stand up to the unions, he’ll never be able to stand up for Britain on the world stage.’","Karen Whitefield is an officer for office and shopworkers' union Usdaw .

Bush meat from 40 wild animals including porcupines, gazelles and bats was confiscated in a police raid on a food shop in Paris. The 200lb haul from the Central African Republic, which also included caterpillars, was described as unfit for human consumption. The owner of the unnamed exotic food shop, where five porcupines, 15 gazelles and 20 bats were found in three freezers, is to be questioned on suspicion of selling banned meat. Porcupines were among the haul of animals seized from the unknown exotic food shop in Paris . Mark Powell, of the UK management body of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, said 'Without knowing the specific species concerned of porcupine, gazelle or . bat it is difficult to say whether or not they would be granted an . import licence. ‘But it is highly possible that they would be from . animals on the endangered species list, therefore it would be illegal to . import or sell them.’ It is not known if food authorities would allow the meat to be sold if it was brought through official channels. A source close to the inquiry told Le Parisien: ‘This meat came with absolutely no hygiene guarantees, and is thus unfit for consumption.’ The incident adds to controversy over animal rights in France, where exotic animals are legally used in fine dining. Hundreds of chickens, geese and ducks were recently discovered at an illegal abattoir in Paris (file photo) The raid comes days after 200 animals were rescued from an illegal underground abattoir outside Paris that was ‘covered in blood, from floor to ceiling’. Ducks, geese and chicken were left without food or water and ‘piled on top of one another,’ Christophe Marie from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation told TF1. The animals were to be sold to Chinese restaurants. In France, a maximum three-year jail term can be given for possessing illegal animals and the owner can be fined twice the value of the meat. Endangered species were the subject – along with climate change – of trade talks in Paris last Friday, when more than 500 African and French business leaders met.","As much as 200lbs of animal meat was seized from exotic foods shop .

Fraud: Conmen are using fake bottles, such as the ones pictured, to dupe wealthy wine connoisseurs . Wealthy wine connoisseurs are being duped into buying fake bottles of vintage French wine, it has been revealed. The huge fraud not only sheds light on an increasingly sophisticated counterfeit trade, but highlights how little some self-styled 'experts' really know about wine. One billionaire businessman unknowingly spent more than £3million on between 500 and 600 bottles of counterfeit Bordeaux wine. Others are believed to have spent similar amounts of money - but are too embarrassed to confess to being the victims of fraud. The fake bottles - most of which were picked up in China - were exposed by French customs and fraud agents. They are among thousands proved to be fake at a specialist lab in Bordeaux, run by the French Finance Ministry. Some are outrageous amalgamations of vintage French wine, such as bottles with labels reading 'Luxembourg' and 'produit de France'. However, others are just trying to give consumers a taste of glamour - with 'Chatelet Cheval Blanc' imitating the 1947 Chateau Cheval Blanc, one of France's finest wines. To the untrained eye, some of the labels might appear real - but they are, in fact, too new looking and printed on the wrong kind of paper. Conmen can earn millions of pounds through producing counterfeit wine - with bottles of Cheval Blanc currently selling for a staggering $11,5000 at auction, according to truebottle.com. 'Wines are becoming a currency in themselves,' said Spiros Malandrakis, a senior analyst of the alcoholic drinks market at Euromoniter. 'And . as with every currency, at some point, people want to find ways to . manipulate that and make more money.' Examinations: Authenticity tests are carried out on bottles of wine at a specialist lab in Bordeaux, France . Fake: This counterfeit bottle of French wine features a label reading 'Luxembourg' and 'produit de France' Alarmingly, fraudsters are becoming increasingly sophisticated . as bottle prices rise due to huge . demand in new markets, such as Asia. Many purchase old, empty bottles from the most prestigious . French vineyards, so that the wine passes tests that sample the bottle's glass . or inspect the label. A recent search on eBay revealed several old, . empty bottles were for sale, including a 1958 Chateau Lafite Rothschild, . a 1928 Chateau Margaux and a 1971 Romanee Conti - all of which are some . of the most counterfeited wines. For this reason, several wineries have begun laser-engraving their bottles with unique serial numbers to deter conmen. Deterrence: Many genuine bottles now feature hologrammed or bar-coded stickers that help prevent fraud . Real: Christophe Chateau, of Bordeaux's winegrowers' professional association, holds a bottle of real wine . Others . are experimenting with hologrammed or bar-coded stickers - placed half . on the bottle, half on the 'capsule' (the foil that covers the cork) - . which will shred if removed. The Bordeaux winegrowers' professional association has even created an app - called Smart Bordeaux - which provides information on individual wines and wineries. Bernard Medina, who runs the specialist lab in Bordeaux, performs authenticity tests on suspected counterfeit wine products on a daily basis. Counterfeiting has plagued the wine industry for as long as the beverage has been produced. In . the 18th century, King Louis XV ordered the makers of Cotes du Rhone to . brand their barrels with 'CDR' before export to prevent fraud. In . China, criminals took advantage of the country's weakness: consumers who were new to wine, but had the money to buy counterfeit brands for show. This resulted in an explosion of fake products, whose labels featured the names - or near names - of as many famous vineyards and locales as possible. Today, the counterfeit trade is . becoming increasingly sophisticated as bottle . prices rise due to huge demand in new markets, such as Asia. It . is impossible to know the size of fake wine industry as many sales . happen privately - with many victims too embarrassed to report fake products. However, . experts agree that the quantity of rare bottles from illustrious . vineyards being auctioned is just too high to not include fakes. These include measuring isotopes to determine which country a wine comes from, and measuring the trace radioactivity of bottles to determine their age. Neither of these tests is definitive - but when put together, they can generally identify any fakes. However, counterfeit bottles still make it into both consumer and business markets across the world. Billionaire businessman Bill Koch, whose cellar includes 43,000 . bottles of wine, has become a vocal . crusader against fakes after becoming the victim of fraud. Since starting to collect wine about 40 years ago, he has bought some of the most sought-after beverages in the world - . including counterfeit bottles that purported to be part of Thomas Jefferson's . private collection. In total, he has unknowingly spent a staggering $5million (£3.05million) on between 500 and 600 bottles of fake wine. Mr Koch said one of the main issues affecting the wine industry is that forgeries are dealt with in a quiet, discrete manner. He . said many businessman opt to swallow their losses, instead of admitting . their own ignorance - adding: 'There's a code of silence in the entire . industry'. Fabien Teitgen, who is in charge of winemaking at Chateau . Smith Haut Lafitte in Bordeaux, added: 'I think the ostrich strategy - . hiding yourself and saying we'll figure it out later - is not . satisfying. 'It is best to speak about it openly and let consumers know what means there . are to verify that they have the right product.' However, it is believed not all wineries feel the same way - with some declaring their wine is 'too good to be faked'. Renowned: Bordeaux is known for its fine wine products.

Cheeky: Lulu, a new women-only mobile app that allows users to anonymously rate their male Facebook friends, is being sued in Brazil . A 28-year-old Brazilian man is suing the creators of an app which allows women to anonymously rate men. Lulu was launched in Brazil just two weeks ago and has already overtaken WhatsApp and Facebook to become the country's most-downloaded app. Its women-only network piggybacks on Facebook to allow users to rate their male friends on their character, appearance and sexual performance. But Felippo de Almeida Scolari, 28, from São Paulo, was 'disgusted' after he learned his profile had been reviewed with comments including '#Doesn'tCallTheNextDay', '#ShouldComeWithAWarning' and '#CheaperThanBreadandButter'. After finding out he scored 7.7 out of 10 on app, he has decided to sue its creators, claiming that allowing anonymous and disparaging comments about a person is unconstitutional under Brazilian law. Mr Scolari told The Telegraph: 'I was disgusted because I didn't authorise my details to be used by this app. I have a girlfriend and she learned about it because a mutual friend sent it to us. 'She was annoyed because she didn't like seeing this kind of thing written about me.' Available as a mobile app for Android and iPhone, Lulu describes itself as 'a private network for girls to express and share their opinions openly and honestly'. It syncs with users' Facebook profiles to allow them to anonymously rate the sense of humour, manners, ambition, commitment level and appearance of their male friends on the social network by answering multiple-choice questions. 'We created Lulu to unleash the value of girl talk and to empower girls to make smarter decisions on topics ranging from relationships to beauty and health,' its creators boast on the app's website. But Mr Scolari, who is a legal academic, feels differently about the software. 'It's a question of privacy on the internet,' he sad. 'I want to see the app no longer allowing people to comment anonymously and Facebook no longer giving personal details to any app.' Some Brazilian commentators have likened Lulu to mere bar gossip, a comparison rubbished by Mr Scolari in a statement he released to journalists. 'A conversation in a bar is to Lulu as a bottle of water is to the ocean,' he said, adding that the app's impact must be seen in terms of 'undue exposure, range and potential harm.' Write caption here . Mr Scolari's case is set to go to court on March 26. He is suing the company behind Lulu for R$27,120 (£7,000) in damages, which he says he will donate to a support group for children with cancer. A spokeswoman for Lulu said: 'We are aware of this lawsuit and that the judge said he would not grant an injunction because there is an automatic tool that men can use to remove themselves from Lulu.  It is available at company.onlulu.com/deactivate. 'The tool allows guys to ensure that they do not appear on the Lulu app and blocks them from being reviewed by their female friends. Interestingly, one-third of guys who use the removal tool reactivate themselves within a week. 'The Lulu app is not available in the UK or Europe but we receive requests daily from women who want to be able to use Lulu, like the millions of women elsewhere.' Lulu's chairman, Alexandra Chong, denied that the app violated Brazilian law. 'We designed the Lulu in order to comply with local laws in the United States and Brazil, and we have an excellent team of lawyers and consultants. I'm not aware of any case in Brazil,' she told Brazilian magazine Epoca.","Lulu allows women to anonymously rate their male Facebook friends .

The FA have backed Roy Hodgson after he made a ‘monkey’ joke during his half-time team talk on Tuesday at Wembley. Chairman Greg Dyke says Hodgson has explained the reasoning behind the joke and said the FA backed their manager. The England boss made the quip at half-time during Tuesday's 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Poland, which was intended to convey the need for his side to play the ball more to winger Andros Townsend. Apology: England manager Roy Hodgson has apologised for making a joke about a monkey during the team's World Cup qualifier against Poland on Tuesday night . Nonplussed: Andros Townsend tweeted to say there was no offence meant or taken . Defence: Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to stand up for Hodgson . Tunnel vision: A series of video stills which show Townsend emerging for the second half . Good show: Townsend put in a good performance against Montenegro before he was substituted . Hodgson is believed to have . upset an unnamed player in the dressing room and the word 'monkey' can in certain . contexts have racist connotations. Lord Ouseley, chairman of . anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out, had called on the FA to . investigate but the group later said if no complaint had been made following the the investigation into the comments 'then the matter can only be deemed as concluded'. But Dyke said: 'Roy Hodgson is a man of . the highest integrity, an honourable man who is doing a great job with . the England team. He has and deserves the full support of the Football . Association. 'He has fully . explained to us what he said and the point he was making to the players . in the dressing room at half-time on Tuesday night. He has also . explained the context in which he made his remarks. 'He . has made clear there was no intent to say anything inappropriate, and . he was certainly not making any comments with any racist connotation. Importantly, he has apologised for any unintended offence that may have . been taken. VIDEO: Watch the players emerge from the tunnel at half-time . Clash: The joke came in a half-time team talk during the crunch game at Wembley Stadium . The joke, which is believed to have been told in full at half-time, is as follows. ‘NASA decided they would finally send a man up in an capsule after sending only monkeys in the earlier missions. ‘They fire the man and the monkey into space.’ ‘The intercom crackles “fire the retros”. ‘A little later, “Monkey, check the solid fuel supply’ ‘Later still “Monkey, check the life support systems for the man”. ‘The astronaut takes umbrage and radios NASA. “When do I get something”.’ ‘NASA replied – in 15 minutes, feed the monkey.’ 'Roy has spoken with Andros Townsend . and a number of the players since the game and he has been assured there . are no problems within the squad whatsoever. 'Additionally the FA has not had a complaint from any squad member or player . representative, and we have today talked extensively to the squad. The . FA has been assured by the players that there are no problems and they . understand the point Roy was making and the context in which he was . speaking. 'We will be . making no further comment on this story and will now be giving Roy and . the team our full support as we prepare for the World Cup in Brazil.' Hodgson used the joke as he attempted to . explain to right back Chris Smalling that he wanted to get the ball to . Townsend more often in the second half of the World Cup . qualifier. But Townsend tweeted on Thursday morning to insist that 'no offence' had been meant by Hodgson or taken by him. The winger posted: 'I don't know what all this fuss is about. No offence was . meant and none was taken! It's not even news worthy!' Goalscorer Wayne Rooney jumped to . Hodgson's defence on Thursday morning, he tweeted: 'Seen the story on . roy this morning. He done nothing wrong. This is ridiculous.' He added on his website: 'To be honest it's really annoying that something such as this should see the light of day, all the lads know what type of guy Roy is, and to try and pin a some form of label on him is absolutely ridiculous. 'Roy spoke to Andros straight away who took no offence whatsoever, hopefully that's now the end of the matter.' Hodgson said on Wednesday night: ‘I would like to apologise if any offence has been caused by what I said at half-time. ‘There was absolutely no intention on my part to say anything inappropriate. Success: The England team secured their passage to next year's World Cup in Brazil by the 2-0 victory . ‘I made this clear straight away to Andros in the dressing room. I also spoke to Andros again on Wednesday. ‘He has assured me and the FA he did not take any offence and understood the point I was making in the manner I intended.’ England’s manager is furious and . insists it was an analogy about NASA sending a monkey into space and . cannot be interpreted in any other way. Townsend's father Troy works for the Kick It Out campaign and is believed to have discussed the issue with his son. Hodgson is understood to be distraught . by any attempt to smear his name after successfully leading England to . the World Cup finals on Tuesday. Although he is known for lengthy team . talks to his players at times, Hodgson’s decision to make an attempt to . tell a joke at the break does seem unusual. The 66-year-old is a man of . vast experience but is dealing with a much younger dressing-room in a . modern climate. Star: The remark came as Hodgson urged players to pass to up-and-coming star Townsend . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce did not think that it was an issue, saying: 'We are a politically correct country and we have to be careful . about what we say today. But if we continue to wipe it up and promote . everything in the press, nobody will be able to say a word shortly. 'We'll . have to keep ourselves quiet and not express opinions. We shouldn't be . saying anything wrong but you have to be very careful today. I'm sure . with what Roy said he didn't mean any offence or any harm.' Former England striker Stan Collymore, meanwhile, insisted the joke makes no reference to race. 'If Roy has said that phrase in the dressing room then it is in the context of the story,' he told talkSPORT. 'People . are walking on egg shells, worried about everything they say. Why would . the word ""monkey"" have a racist feel for someone in the dressing room, . or any player? I can’t see the link, can you? 'We’ve . all got the right to feel offence, but this is really spurious. What . are you actually offended by? The word ""monkey""? I don’t see any . reference to race. You have to look at the big picture. 'Is . Roy Hodgson, from what we know of him over the last 30-40 years, the . sort of man to go out of his way to be stupid enough to cause offence? I . would say no.' Relief: Hodgson celebrates at Wembley, and is now in line for a big bonus if England do well next summer .","An unnamed player is believed to have taken offence at the joke .

The study said owners need to be better informed about handling the devices. It recommended that straighteners be put in heat-resistant pouches after use, to reduce the risk of burns. Retail research revealed that one in three women own hair tongs. The number of consumers owning straighteners rose from 4.6 million in 2007 to 5.3 million in 2010. Dr Julia Sarginson, who led the research at the burns centre at Bristol’s Frenchay Hospital, said: ‘Hair-straightening devices can cause significant injuries. ‘Our study shows that infants and toddlers are at most risk, and these are preventable burns that warrant our attention.’ The researchers, whose findings appear in Burns journal, say that straighteners have become more popular over the past decade because of increased availability, a fall in prices and the fashion for straight hair. A popular Christmas gift, they retail for as little as £20. A 2011 review by Electrical Safety Council warned: ‘The hair straightener [may not be] shaped or decorated like a toy... nevertheless, the brightly coloured enclosure might still be considered appealing as a plaything by young children.’ The council advised parents ‘to keep the hot surfaces away from exploring fingers’, even though tongs are being increasingly sold in heat-proof bags or clips. A potential hazard is that the plates can reach 220C, hotter than household appliances such as an iron, at 180C. A further hazard is the length of time it takes for them to cool after use; the researchers say that straighteners can cause burns up to 15 minutes after being turned off. The South West Regional Paediatric Burns Centre in Bristol looked at the growing number of cases and the damage caused. Doctors found there had been 155 cases admitted over a five-year period, and that the number of cases had increased from 20 to 45 a year. Warning: Doctors found there had been 155 burn cases over a five-year period, up from 20 to 45 a year . Eight cases were serious enough to require skin grafts. Seven out of 10 injuries were in children under two. The average age for injured children under five was 17 months for boys and 21 months for girls. Last December it emerged that High street stores were refusing to sell children’s hair straighteners after a dramatic increase in burns injuries. Doctors expressed concerned over an increasing number of girls suffering burns and scars from the appliances. The brightly coloured devices are sometimes decorated with pictures of princesses, fairies and cartoon characters -images more suitable for a toy. The stores - Argos, Tesco and Asda - acted after worrying figures from the National Burns Injuries Database. Argos has heeded health warnings and withdrawn lines such as Disney Princess Rapunzel Straighteners . The statistics revealed the number of children aged under 15 admitted to serious burns units in England and Wales with injuries from adult appliances increased from 162 in 2009 to 252 last year. Items withdrawn by Argos included Disney Princess Rapunzel Straighten and Crimp Straighteners, Disney Rapunzel’s Multi Hair Styler, Hello Kitty Mini Straightener and boy band One Direction branded hair straighteners. Tesco dropped a Disney Fairies Tinker-bell Straightener. Dr Amber Young, a consultant paediatric anaesthetist at Frenchay Hospital Burns Unit in Bristol and spokeswoman for the British Burns Association, said in December 2012: ‘There has to be a health warning about the use of straighteners - and these products should certainly not be marketed to children.’","People owning hair irons rose from 4.6m in 2007 to 5.3m in 2010 .

The number of pensioners being admitted to hospital after poisoning themselves with illicit drugs has soared . Almost 900 pensioners needed hospital treatment last year after poisoning themselves with illicit drugs such as cocaine and cannabis, according to new figures. The number of those aged 65 or over who have been admitted to A&E because of drug use has tripled in the past ten years. More than 50 per cent of those who were rushed to hospital were aged over 75. According to the Sunday Times, experts are blaming the staggering increase on the 'free love' generation - many of those aged 75 or over would have been twentysomethings during the experimental age of the 1960s. The NHS figures show that in total 888 pensioners were taken to A&E with illicit drug poisioning, with 283 of those aged at least 75. David Raynes, from the National Drug Prevention Alliance, told the Times: 'We are getting to the period where people who grew up in the Sixties are of that age. 'People who have used drugs their whole lives will start to hit the NHS.' Drug abuse charity DrugScope has called for more resources to be allocated to treatment services to deal ageing drug users. The figures were released after an earlier study by scientists at King's College London found that illicit drug use among over 50s has soared in the last 20 years. The study found that the number of pensioners using drugs, particularly cannabis, is likely to increase further still over the next 20 years.

They have now been named as school technician Maggie Stewart, her son Damien Stewart,16, and his cousin Dion Walker-Smith, 15. They had been driving to a birthday party. Killed: Maggie Stewart, her son Damien Stewart,16, and his cousin Dion Walker-Smith, 15 . A Scania lorry, a Hyundai Getz, a Peugeot 207 and a Mercedes car were involved in the accident, which happened near a garden centre in Trinity Road, Freasley. All the three occupants of the Hyundai were pronounced dead at the scene, and the male driver of one of the other cars was taken to the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield. Ms Stewart, who would have been 43 today, worked at Kingsbury High School in Tamworth where her son and his cousin were Year 11 prefects.

"By . Thea Jourdan . PUBLISHED: . 19:07 EST, 20 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:39 EST, 21 November 2013 . Holding it all in: But are control pants good for mums-to-be? The night before my third child was born sticks in my memory for all the right reasons. My husband and I had decided to get a babysitter and head out for a romantic dinner a deux, a last hurrah before the baby arrived. As he waited for me to get ready, I pulled on my comfiest pair of granny knickers and a stretchy, maternity bra. Admiring my vast bump in the mirror, I then slipped into an empire-line dress which emphasised my full curves. Happy with what I saw - and proud as punch of my bump - I headed out of the door, arm-in-arm with my husband, who told me, lovingly, that he thought I looked like a ship in full sail. I wasn't remotely offended: he was right, and I felt wonderful. That night, in 2009, it never occurred to me to worry about my wobbly bits. I never once considered whether I had a sleek silhouette or pert behind. I was in a blissful state, thrilled to be nurturing a new life, feeling free of all the usual constraints of fashion. How times have changed. Now the cellulite police have turned their attention to pregnant women. Where expectant mothers could once let it all hang out, they are increasingly expected to look svelte even in the latter stages of pregnancy. And how is this to be achieved? With  maternity shapewear, which lifts bottoms and smoothes out hips and thighs while supporting the lower back and tummy. Pregnancy shapewear is fast becoming a maternity must-have - available in every shape and size for women who feel they need extra help from their underwear to smooth, enhance and reshape what lies beneath. Since the most successful brand, Mama Spanx, was launched in the UK in 2011, sales have soared. Debenhams has their own lines of maternity shapewear, and Primark offers a budget version. And in online chatrooms and maternity blogs, pregnant women seem delighted that  they can squeeze themselves  into the human equivalent of a sausage skin. Why is utterly beyond me. As someone who has carried three children, the most important thing when it comes to what to wear during pregnancy is good old-fashioned comfort. Not so for a happy Spanx customer, however, who wrote a glowing online review of the Power Mama Maternity Shaper, a £28 nylon and Lycra body suit extending from below the breasts to the knees. She writes: 'They are easy to put on. I was worried that it'd be a struggle. No tell-tale visible pant lines and no band at the bottom of the leg so you don't get the  mark under clothing where the shaper finishes. Red carpet-endorsement: Both TV presenter Amanda Holden (left) and Danii Minogue have extolled the virtues of control underwear . 'I put them on and the effect was quite dramatic. I lost the saddlebag hips I seemed to gain during pregnancy and they smoothed my bottom into a rounder, perkier shape. You feel supported all round without feeling squashed. I wanted a smoother shape under a jersey maternity party dress -these do the job.' Control underwear may be many women's secret weapon, but should we really be expecting pregnant women to squeeze themselves into it simply for the sake of fashion? Spanx founder Sara Blakely insists she designed her maternity range to first and foremost provide comfort. 'The fact they make your bottom and thighs look less jiggly and more toned is a side benefit,' the U.S. businesswoman argues. But the pregnant woman on the Spanx packet looks far from comfortable. Photographed wearing a nude pair of maternity control pants and towering stiletto heels, she looks rather like a pregnant pole dancer. She is also, disconcertingly, headless, since the picture is cropped just above the breasts. 'Control underwear may be many women's . secret weapon, but should we really be expecting pregnant women to . squeeze themselves into it simply for the sake of fashion?' So how did this trend for maternity corsetry start? As with so many other bonkers trends, it began on the red carpet. TV presenter Amanda Holden, 42, credited Spanx with allowing her to hide her pregnancy from photographers for six months. Similarly, Dannii Minogue, also 42, extolled the virtues of control underwear, wearing it to firm up her behind when she was expecting her son, Ethan. In many ways, Amanda and Dannii may be typical of the maternity shapewear fan base - older women who need a little more help when it comes to sagging bottoms and dimpled thighs. However, I can't help but wonder if the fact that they were older when they conceived meant they felt uneasy with the appearance of a generous bump after so many years of being red-carpet ready. Can maternity shapewear affect an unborn baby's wellbeing? 'Babies are safely cocooned in the womb,' says London-based consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician, Dr Mike Bowen. 'It's going to take a lot more than support hosiery to cause them even mild irritation.' However, the National Childbirth Trust takes a more cautious approach. NCT policy adviser Elizabeth Duff says: 'It is important not to restrict blood flow anywhere in the body during pregnancy, as the growing baby needs the oxygen that is supplied through the increased blood volume in expectant women. 'Any woman considering wearing tighter clothes for support is advised to talk to her midwife before investing in this kind of shapewear,' she adds. The physical difficulty of removing constricting shapewear could cause other problems, according to Gail Johnson, a midwife and education adviser at the Royal College of Midwives. She tells women to embrace their natural pregnancy shape instead of trying to constrict it. Soaring sales: Mama Spanx is the most successful brand - but maternity shapewear could affect an unborn baby's wellbeing . 'Anything that encourages pregnant women not to go to the toilet when they need to is likely to cause problems and increase the risk of urinary tract infection,' she says. If a woman's pregnancy reaches its third trimester in the summer months, she can expect to feel rather overheated in high-control underwear. There is also the troubling issue of muscle wastage: a garment that supports your stomach and bottom all day, every day, will take the load away from muscles and ligaments. London-based physiotherapist Sammy Margo, a spokeswoman for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, explains: 'What I say to my patients is “use it or lose it”. 'What we find is that women who wear maternity shapewear when they have no physical need can weaken muscles in their bottoms, stomachs and lower backs. 'After the birth of their baby, they are more likely to be injured as they lift  and care for their newborns' she warns. It's perplexing that so many women are relying on maternity shapewear when pregnancy fashion has never  been better. For thanks to High Street trailblazers such as JoJo Maman Bebe and the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite maternity clothing store Seraphine, it is perfectly possible for expectant mothers to look stylish in maternity wear. The trendy outfits  make a feature of a bump without the need for shapewear. Fashion stylist Tamara Cincik, whose celebrity clients include singer Christina Aguilera and top models Lily Cole and Daisy Lowe, says pregnant women should be confident in themselves whatever their shape - but there is one piece of maternity lingerie which she says is absolutely vital. 'A good-fitting bra is important and needs to be resized regularly. I would recommend women are measured for their bras regularly over the course of their pregnancy and afterwards when they're breastfeeding.' Above all else, women shouldn't be made to feel insecure about how they look during the swingeing physical changes that come with pregnancy. And they certainly shouldn't feel some kind of imperative to be teetering around on heels in underwear that is hot, tight and uncomfortably restricting. I for one would be a lot happier if that Mama Spanx model kicked off her stilettos and shapewear and slipped into some roomy PJs and a comfy pair of slippers.","With celebrity endorsements, sales of pregnancy shapewear are soaring .

A 100-year-old woman who has lived in the same one-bedroom New York apartment for almost 50 year has been served with an eviction notice. The New York City Housing Authority claims that Concetta Passione, who celebrated her century on Sunday, has been unlawfully residing in Italy and therefore shouldn't be allowed to keep her $219 a month apartment. Passione and her late husband and two sons were amongst the first people to move into Rutgers Houses in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in 1964. The New York City Housing Authority claims that Concetta Passione, right, who celebrated her century on Sunday, has been unlawfully residing in Italy and therefore shouldn't be allowed to keep her $219 a month apartment in which her son Sebastian, left, also lives . ‘I want to be here,’ Passione told The New York Daily News, with her 73-year-old son, Sebastian, acting as her interpreter because she only speaks Italian. ‘I will never get used to any place else. I’m the first one to come here and now they want to throw me out? It’s not right.’ Although her husband died years ago, Passione’s two sons have lived with her at different times. When her son Paul moved out in 2004, her other son Sebastian, now 73, moved in and he says he pressed NYCHA’s managers to have the lease changed to have his brothers name replaced with his. Passione and her late husband and two sons were amongst the first people to move into Rutgers Houses in Manhattan¿s Lower East Side in 1964 . ‘I provided all the information, all the documentation they wanted and I’m still waiting for them to allow me to be put on the lease. It never happened,’ he told PIX11. Acting on a tip, the Department of Investigation began investigating Passione and claim that from 2000 to 2009, the great grandmother and her son lived in Italy, returning to New York once a year at Christmas. They also claims that she currently lives in Italy and allows her son use of the apartment in breach of rules and regulations. Sebastian, a translator for Social Security, says his mom has made some long trips to Italy, but this is her home.

'If Mr. Passione was on the lease, the family composition would have been recalculated, and the rent would’ve increased,' Loffredo said. 'He’s been asking to be on that lease since 2004.'

Plebgate: Former minister Andrew Mitchell was accused of having called police officers 'plebs' while leaving Downing Street on his bike . A police force has been accused of an extraordinary 11th-hour cover-up over claims three senior officers lied to blacken the name of former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell. In an explosive letter, watchdog Deborah Glass said an internal investigation by West Mercia Police was altered at the last minute to clear them of misconduct. On Tuesday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission suggested officers lied about what Mr Mitchell said in a private meeting about the ‘Plebgate’ row. It said they wanted to heap pressure on him to resign over disputed claims he called Downing Street police officers ‘plebs’ during an argument at the No.10 gates. And it concluded that the trio – Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones – should have faced misconduct hearings. IPCC deputy chairman Miss Glass last night revealed that the first draft of an earlier West Mercia inquiry drew the same conclusion. But within a month, the force changed its mind. In a letter copied to the Home Secretary, Miss Glass said: ‘We had no concerns about the quality of the investigation carried out by West Mercia Police. It was the conclusion we disagreed with. ‘In that regard, I note that in the first draft report submitted to the IPCC in July the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude there was a case to answer for misconduct. Although the final report in August, did not.’ It is not clear who ordered the report to be changed or why. West Mercia Police declined to comment last night. But one senior Tory said its Chief Constable David Shaw would have to ‘consider his position’ if it emerged he had been involved in the decision. The Prime Minister told MPs yesterday that the conduct of the officers, who were representing the Police Federation, was ‘not acceptable’ and backed calls for Mr Shaw to apologise to Mr Mitchell. Mr Cameron said it was only thanks to a recording of the meeting by Mr Mitchell that he was able to show that ‘what the police officers said was untrue.’ Inspector MacKaill is from the West Mercia force, DS Hinton is from West Midlands and Sgt Jones is from Warwickshire. Force of the force: Deborah Glass, deputy chair of Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said an internal investigation by West Mercia Police was altered at the last minute . Mr Shaw, along with the chief constables of the West Midlands and Warwickshire forces, will be grilled by MPs over the issue next week. Tory MP Richard Ottaway said all three might have to resign if they were found to have been involved in a cover-up. He said: ‘[Mr Shaw] has to explain exactly what has happened. If it is apparent that he has been part of the change in the [report’s] conclusions then frankly I think he has got to consider his position. If [the other chief constables] were part of it as well then they are in the same position.’ The investigation by West Mercia concluded there were no grounds for a misconduct inquiry as there was ‘no deliberate intention to lie’. But Miss Glass branded the investigation a whitewash, and warned the incident raised questions about the  ‘honesty and integrity’ of the three officers involved. Her intervention drew an angry response from the Police Federation and the three forces. West Midlands police and crime commissioner Bob Jones yesterday said her comments had been ‘completely unjustified’ and ‘very inappropriate’, and called for the abolition of the IPCC. The former shadow home secretary David Davis said: ‘What the IPCC did here was trust the police, as the public do generally, and unfortunately what this demonstrates is that the police cannot be trusted, actually, to investigate themselves. ‘I’m afraid it is as plain as a pikestaff that what is happening here is the senior officers are trying to prevent their own forces from embarrassment... an attempt to stop embarrassment I’m afraid is a disgrace.’ The Crown Prosecution Service is now considering whether to bring criminal charges following a long-running police investigation into the original ‘Plebgate’ incident in September last year. Mr Mitchell admits losing his temper and swearing after police stopped him riding his bicycle through the gates of Downing Street. But he has always denied using the word ‘plebs’, as claimed in a ‘police log’ which was leaked to the media. Eight people, including five police officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group, were arrested.","West Mercia Police accused of a last-minute cover-up over 'Plebgate'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:09 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:17 EST, 16 October 2013 . Two beer lovers have invented a gadget to ensure a warm beer never has to be endured again. Trevor Abbott and Ty Parker came up with the idea for the Spin Chill while they were waiting for two warm beers to cool in ice. The gadget works by spinning the beer can in ice to increase the rate of heat transfer significantly through convection - the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids. Mr Parker, from St Augustine, Florida, said: 'We've run into the problem multiple times during our college career where we would be stuck with warm beers with only one way to cool them down, throw them in ice water and wait. Scroll down for video . The Kickstarter project is seeking funding for a new invention that promises to chill a warm can of drink in under a minute. Using a basic drill and a device called a 'Chill Bit', the unique Spin Chill process uses convection to cool the beverage . The Spin Chill works by spinning the beer in a cool box full of ice so that the cold from the exterior of the can moves towards the centre. According to the company, this cools the drink down at least 20 times faster than if it was in a freezer. It sounds like a simple concept, but the trick was to do this in such a way that the can doesn’t overflow when the fizzy drink is opened. By rotating the drink, instead of shaking it, air pockets in the liquid remain intact.  These air pockets are what cause drinks to fizz upon opening and overflow. This was an accidental discovery. ‘We were shocked to find that of the two beers we placed in the ice, one spinning and one stationary, that the stationary beer foamed more than the beer that was spun,’ said the creators on their website.’ 'So, we decided to use our knowledge of heat transfer and love of cold beers to create the first Spin Chill prototype.' The Spin Chill works by spinning the beer in a cool box full of ice so that the cold from the exterior of the can cools the liquid inside 20 times faster than if the can was simply placed in the ice box. Its creators said the temperature of the drink can reach freezing in just two to three minutes using the device. The pair both studied mechanical engineering at the University of Florida and were attending a hackathon - an event where participants can come together to create new ideas - when the first Spin Chill was created. The Chill Bit is a drill attachment that fits on to the top of a can or bottle. The 'Beerouette', based on a drill , is a standalone, motorised device that spins the drink while it is submerged in ice . Mr Parker said: 'The initial prototype was hacked together at the competition the next day from a power drill, a baby bottle, and a roll or two of duct tape. 'Since then we have been prototyping, developing and refining the designs as well as creating the next product and have been enjoying travelling around, sharing our story and drinking cold beers with like minded people.' The gadget works by spinning the beer can in ice to increase the rate of heat transfer significantly through convection - the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids. The pair explain on their website: 'It all has to do with the air pocket. A 'carbonated beverage' is one in which carbon dioxide is dissolved in the liquid under pressure. 'When the can is opened, the liquid inside starts to equalise with the pressure in the atmosphere, and the CO2 comes out of solution to do so. 'All carbonated beverages fizz upon opening, but whether they fizz over depends on how fast the CO2 comes out of solution.' Trevor Abbott (right) and Ty Parker (left) came up with the idea for the Spin Chill while they were waiting for two warm beers to cool in ice. Mr Parker said the initial prototype was hacked together from a power drill, a baby bottle, and a roll or two of duct tape . They said that for the carbon dioxide to escape suddenly, it needs gaseous pockets or an irregularity along the wall so when a drink is shake, the air pocket is broken up into millions of small pockets, dispersed throughout the liquid. 'When the container is opened, CO2 in solution has sites all over the place, and it comes out of solution so quickly, that the liquid has no time to get out of the way, and it rises up and out, that is, it fizzes over,' they said. However, the pair explained that when a beverage is rotated, the air pocket stays intact and knocks all the small bubbles off the side of the container, making one larger air pocket. 'There are no nucleation sites dispersed throughout and the usual slow decarbonation takes place at the infrequent irregularities and at the surface,' they added.","The gadget works by spinning the beer can in ice to increase the rate of heat transfer significantly through convection .

More than 50 families were receiving benefits which amounted to a £70,000 a year salary, it has been revealed. Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions show some families were being given the huge sum before the £26,000 benefits cap came in. Fifty-one families had their payouts cut by at least £400 a week which means they were previously receiving at least £900 a week - the equivalent of £46,800 or £68,000 a year before tax. Their benefits have now been capped at £500 - or £26,000 a year - which was introduced in April by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'The benefit cap has successfully addressed the ludicrous situation we were in where people were recieving far more in benefits than the ordinary hardworking family earns. 'It is not right that some families were raking in almost double the amount that the average taxpayer takes home.' Figures show that by October 2008, 28,000 families have had their benefits cut which include 9,000 with more than five children. About 300 families had their benefits reduced by between £300 and £400. The new scheme is expected to save about £6million a year. Statistics show 98 per cent of families affected by the benefits cap have at least one child. 7,730 families, 40 per cent, have at least five children. Department for Work and Pensions said the 'curtain had finally fallen' on the culture of welfare dependency. The radical reforms have led to 36,000 people trying to find work rather than live on benefits, ministers claim. The annual national welfare bill was £208billion and Iain Duncan Smith brought in the cap to reduce the burden on the state. A single mother with eight children who receives £2,000 a month in state handouts has complained she is struggling to make ends meet. Marie Buchan, 31, whose children range in age from 12 to two months, lives in a three-bedroom housing association house in Selly Oak, Birmingham, but says it's not big enough and has applied for a bigger one. And she says her benefits payments, which were reduced from £582 a week to £500 a week in September after the government introduced a cap on handouts, are not enough for her family to survive on. Marie Buchan, 31, from Selly Oak in Birmingham, says she's struggling to survive after her benefits were cut . Now Miss Buchan, who is £2,000 in arrears with her rent, says she fears she may be evicted after falling behind with her rent. Miss Buchan, a tenant of Bourneville Village Trust in the south-west of Birmingham, used to receive £385 a week in child tax credit, £100 child benefit and £97 income support. But the benefits cap, introduced earlier this year by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to reduce the burden on the state, limited her handouts to £500 a week. Mother-of-eleven Heather Frost faced having her £60,000-a-year benefits cut after receiving £2,000 to appear on TV and boast about her life. Unemployed: Heather Frost, pictured with one of her nine daughters at their six-bedroom home . Home: Heather Frost with her family of 11 children (nine daughters and two sons) The 37-year-old, who never worked and claimed around £60,000 a year in benefits, appeared in a documentary series on Channel 5 called On Benefits and Proud. In October, her local council said it would now be investigating her huge hand-outs after reports she was given a substantial fee to appear on the show. Frost, who was receiving £900-per-week in benefits, featured on the documentary which looks at a number of families from across the country who are supported by the state. Earlier this year Sharon Minkin admitted she was caught in a 'benefits package trap' equal to a salary of £70,000 a year. Pictured with her two dogs, Ms Minkin said that she did not want to go to work because it means her children would have to do what thousands of others do when they go to university and take out a student loan . The divorcee said she could not afford to work - because it would leave her worse off. The 49-year-old and her three children live in a spacious semi-detached three bedroom home in Hertfordshire. Her life was funded by the taxpayer but she blamed the government for creating a benefits 'trap' that means she wil would never earn so much money as she gets in handouts.","Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions .

Earning: Sir Ian Kennedy, Chairman of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, earned almost the same as a backbencher's salary for an estimated three days a week . The civil servants who run the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority are even better paid than MPs. Three are on more than the backbench salary of £66,396, while ebullient chairman Professor Sir Ian Kennedy earned almost the same for an estimated three days a week. IPSA agreed to pay an interim chief executive £650 a day for just 50 days’ work last year – the equivalent of an annual salary of £169,000. The figures may at least partly explain why the panel is so willing to offer MPs such a huge rise at a time of austerity. Chief executive Andrew McDonald took home £108,600 last year, which IPSA’s annual report admits is more than three and a half times the average salary in the UK. On top of this, he is sitting on a generous pension pot worth £669,000 that will enable him to retire on at least £40,000 a year, with a lump sum of around £120,000. The civil servant, who is on secondment from the Ministry of Justice, is also eligible for consideration for a bonus, although he was not paid one last year. Philip Lloyd, the recently appointed finance and corporate services director, is on a similarly generous salary of between £105,000 and £110,000, according to the annual report. And John Sills, director of policy and communications, earns between £85,000 and £90,000. His pension pot adds up to £435,000. Sir Ian Kennedy was paid between £60,000 and £65,000 last year, down from the £85-90,000 he received the year before, indicating he worked fewer days in the last financial year, thought to be around three a week. Sir Ian previously chaired the Healthcare Commission and oversaw an inquiry into children’s heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary, where 29 children died between 1994 and 1995. Crackdown: Danny Alexander has spoken out about ways in which civil servants get paid on top of their wage . When Mr McDonald had to take time off for cancer treatment between July and November last year, he was replaced as acting chief executive by Paula Higson, who earned between £30,000 and £35,000 for 50 days’ work. This was understood to be worth around £650 a day and was the equivalent of an annual salary of £169,000. Controversially, she was paid in an ‘off-payroll’ deal, meaning she earned the money not through a normal salary, but through her private limited company. Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has demanded a crackdown on such schemes, which allow some people to save  thousands of pounds in national insurance and income tax.","Chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority last year took home £108,600 - three and a half times the average UK wage .

U.S. Marine Sgt Brian LaLoup was based at the U.S. Embassy in Athens but shot himself after a night out on August 12, 2012 . The family of a U.S. Marine who committed suicide inside a U.S. Embassy in Greece claims their son was buried without a heart after the Greek government performed an illegal autopsy but did not return the body with the organ. U.S. Marine Sgt Brian LaLoup was based at the U.S. Embassy in Athens but shot himself after a night out on August 12, 2012. The 22-year-old, of Coatesville, Philadelphia, had been at a party when he told another officer he thought about ending his life. According to a court filing, he is alleged to have said: 'I don't have anyone who loves me', before shooting himself in the face. The lawsuit claims that instead of seeking medical care, his commander allegedly took him out to drink more. Later that evening Sgt LaLoup went into an unlocked room inside the embassy where the weapons were kept and killed himself, according to the lawsuit. He was drunk and distraught, the court documents say. The family believe his body was left unguarded and an illegal autopsy was carried out on the body before his heart was removed. The body was flown back to the U.S. where a second autopsy was performed. The LaLoups say that is the moment when officials realised the heart had gone but they were not told until after he was buried. The lawsuit says: 'Instead of being honest and up-front with the family and taking the appropriate action to have the heart returned, [the] Defendants decided to lie and conceal this fact from the Plaintiffs. Scene: The U.S. Embassy in Athens where U.S. Marine Sgt Brian LaLoup shot himself in 2012 . 'As a result of Defendants’ failure to act, Sgt. LaLoup’s heart was destroyed by the Greek government.' After an official complaint was made by the family, the lawsuit claims the Greek government sent a heart back to the U.S. but according to the file a DNA test was carried out which found that it was not Sgt LaLoup's heart. His family believe officials have lied to about the missing organ and are seeking damages in excess of £75,000 according to NBC.","U.S. Marine Sgt Brian LaLoup was based at the U.S. Embassy in Athens .

A woman died after being stabbed 20 times in the face and chest by her brother in an apparent 'honour killing' because she went out of the house alone, police in Jordan said. Authorities said the man confessed to slitting his sister's throat and stabbing her repeatedly to 'cleanse the family honour'. Local media said she had become enraged because she spent too little time at home. Authorities in Amman, Jordan, (pictured) say the brother confessed to stabbing his sister 20 times . A police spokesman said: 'People last night found the body of a girl in her twenties. 'She had been stabbed 20 times in face . and chest before she had her throat slit. 'Police arrested her brother, who confessed to committing the crime . because his sister spent so little time at the family home.

Police found her charred corpse in a dumper, after it . had been partially burned with an accelerant. Unmarried women in many Arab countries are still expected to come home before dusk and are often suspected of engaging in sexual activities if they do not. Although there is greater freedom among the expanding middle classes in the Arab world, sex outside marriage is still considered to bring an intolerable shame on a conservative Muslim family. Between 15 and 20 women die in 'honour' murders each year in the Arab Kingdom, despite government efforts to curb such crimes. But not all those who kill the women are brought to justice. In the case of the latest victim, police know that there is no ‘victim family’ to take into consideration and often do not bother filing charges. Murder is however punishable by death in Jordan but in honour killings courts can commute or reduce sentences, particularly if the victim's family asks for leniency.","Authorities in Amman said brother was unhappy at sister leaving the house .

People buying insurance plans through Obamacare's online exchanges may not have full access to some of the nation's top hospitals, it has been claimed. In a bid to cut costs, insurers selling cover on the new exchanges in states including New York, Texas and California will not offer patients access to two renowned cancer centers - Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, according to The Financial Times. Access to Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, one of the top research and teaching hospitals, may also be limited, as the insurers attempt to steer customers away from hospitals or doctors they consider too expensive. Top hospital: Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan, pictured, is among a few that insurers are limiting access to . However, millions of currently uninsured Americans will still be better off than if they had no cover at all. According to the FT, customers with certain plans can elect to see doctors or be treated at hospitals that are 'out of network' but this would likely incur high out of pocket costs and may require a referral to ensure it's a necessity. Some hospital officials are worried about what they call an unintended consequence of the new law. 'We're very concerned. (Insurers) know patients that are sick come to places like ours,' Thomas Priselac, president and chief executive officer of Cedars-Sinai Health System in California told the FT.

The Department of Health and Human Services told the FT millions of families would have vastly increased access to medical providers thanks to the new exchanges. 'Decisions about which private health insurance plans cover which doctors is a decision currently made by insurers and providers and will continue that way,' the spokeswoman said. Mr Priselac urged insurers to offer the top hospitals, which are often leaders in innovation, because the efficiency that innovation affords actually reduces the cost for everyone in the long run.","Insurers selling cover on the new exchanges will not offer access to cancer centers, Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston .

The Washington Redskins helped round out a humiliating year with a stomping from the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday that left stands nearly empty by halftime. Blizzardy conditions drove fans away last night in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, but the faint dusting of snow at FedEx Field left the Skins with no excuse. And most all the footprints in what little snow did fall were on Robert Griffin III's side of the field, proving yet again the once-promising quarterback's team has lost its mojo. Barely snowed: Fans all but abandoned the Washington's FedEx Field on Sunday after the home team's brutal first half against the Kansas City Chiefs . It was the fifth straight loss for the Redskins, and it was enough to make even the toughest players lose faith. 'It's a terrible game to be a part of,' Redskins linebacker Brian Orakpo said. Griffin, too, was forced to be honest with himself and whatever Redskins fans who remain after the devastating season. 'None of us played good today,' Griffin said. 'I didn't play well. We all have to play better. I have to play better.' Nothing to play for: Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III walks off the field after the humiliating game, which his team lost 45-10. Griffin, who was the 2011 Heisman winner and number 2 draft pick of 2012, was replaced by backup Kirk Cousins in what became the team's fifth straight loss . 'None of us played good today,' Griffin admitted. 'I didn't play well. We all have to play better. I have to play better.' The Chiefs were already trouncing the Redskins 38-10 at halftime, when the stands all but cleared out despite the weather being far better than it was in snowy Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Sunday. In fact, fans deserted what was Washington's first snowy home game in decades, and those that stayed had plenty to boo. The Chiefs took the opening kickoff and gained 8, 9, 22 and 13 yards on their first four plays. The Redskins were a team with nothing to play for, and they looked like it. Shanahan eventually pulled the plug on Griffin, inserting Cousins for the final quarter. Meanwhile, everywhere else: Fans in Baltimore stuck to their seats despite far snowier conditions than in nearby Washington, DC during this game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday . Far snowier: Eagles fans in Philly seemed to stick around, too, as major snow crept up the East Coast on Sunday while they hosted the Detroit Lions . Pittsburgh: The Steelers game against the Miami Dolphins in Pittsburgh also got more snow, and stirred more excitement, than the Redskins trouncing . It was perhaps the least interesting among all the East Coast games affected as the powerful, wintry storm that chilled much of North America through the previous week. Griffin, the 2011 Heisman trophy winner, has had a terrible year following his horrifying fall during January's losing game to the Seattle Seahawks, which knocked the Redskins out fo playoff contention. Since the injury, the final among several that unltimately left RGIII with two torn knee ligaments, the number 2 draft pick of 2012 has only fallen further. Bad year: RGIII has seen nothing but drama since this cringe-inducing fall in January ended what could have been a triumphant 2012 season for Griffin . Marital woes? What could have been a good day, the day RGIII was married in July, ended up being terrible for the quarterback after a Hooters waitress exposes purported proof he sent her racy messages on his wedding day . Speculation swirled immediately following his cringe-inducing fall around Coach Mike Shanahan's decision to play the already visibly weakened RBIII him in the first place. Even the day of his nuptials to Rebecca Liddicoat in July only remained a happy one briefly. Rumors soon spread online, along with purported visual proof, that RGIII had been sending racy messages to a Virginia Hooters waitress on the very day of his wedding.

The singer, who was the intended victim of a murder plot two years ago, has revealed how she has a pack of 'protective' dogs to make her feel safe. Miss Stone, 26, already had a Rottweiler called Missy Elliott, and a teacup poodle called Dusty Springfield. Singer Joss Stone bought more 'protective' dogs after being the subject of an intended murder plot. She is pictured with Igor (left) and Maggie and Missy (right) Since the attempted attack, in which two men drove to her village in Devon armed with a samurai sword, she has bought a German Shepherd-collie cross, called Maggie, and Igor, a Caucasian Ovcharka - a large nocturnal breed often used as guard dogs. She said: 'I wanted to have a protective dog because I had this murder thing happen. ‘But I was like ‘You know what, I’m not going to allow that to be a . negative thing in my life. ‘In some way, somehow, it has become . something positive. ‘I said I’m going to get puppies.

'So I did my research on what they’re like with kids. ‘I got Igor when he was seven weeks old. Ovcharka’s are nocturnal, mainly, which is why he barks a lot at night.’ The singer reportedly paid £10m to buy her way out of a contract with EMI last year . Miss Stone told Dogs Today: 'Missy is my most protective dog. Dusty stays with me in my bedroom at night. Dusty sounds the alarm and Missy might eat somebody. Then Igor lives outside. They keep me at home.' Earlier this year Kevin Liverpool, 35, and Junior Bradshaw, 32, were jailed for conspiracy to murder and rob Miss Stone. They were apprehended, when they crashed their car then began asking the star’s neighbours where she lived, carrying a photograph of Miss Stone. The pair intended to find Miss Stone’s home, rob her of £1m they believed she had in a safe, kill her and dump her body in a river. Singer Miss Stone rose to fame in late 2003 with her multi-platinum debut album, The Soul Sessions, which made the 2004 Mercury Prize shortlist. Last year, she reportedly paid record company EMI £10 million to buy her way out of her contract.

Metro-North announced Sunday that new measures are in place to prevent a repeat of last weekend’s deadly train derailment that killed four people. The commuter train operator said Sunday that automatic speed restrictions have been installed where William Rockefeller sped a train at 82MPH into a 30MPH restricted curve, causing it to jump the tracks. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority-owned rail is also implementing other changes meant to make rides safer for commuters. Slowly returning to normal: A southbound train enters the station as train service has begun while track and other repairs continue along the north of the Metro-North Railroad Spuyten-Duyvil stop . ‘Metro-North is taking important steps to improve safety for its customers and employees, and I expect the railroad will continue searching for ways to improve its operations and fully restore its commuters' confidence’ MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F. Prendergast said in a statement. The automated speed controls installed at the Spuyten-Duyvil curve will warn engineers of the impending curve and then automatically lower the train’s speed if the engineer does not, the agency said. The protections will be on all trains as of Monday morning’s commute. Automatic speed restrictions at other high-risk junctures will be in place in the coming months, said the agency. Additionally, conductors will stand in the train cabs with engineers as they approach sharp curves and other areas with speed restrictions. Hard at work: Metro-North Signal Department workers consult circuit diagrams, make wiring changes and test the system at Spuyten-Duyvil . Horrifying: The high-speed train derailment that killed four people has led the MTA to adopt several new safety measures . This measure is likely in response to Mr Rockefeller telling investigators he ‘zoned out’ right before the sharp turn - and to federal regulators insisting last week the train operator make significant safety improvements. The conductors will ‘verbally confirm all speed limits are adhered to,’ the MTA said. In situations where the train’s layout does not permit the conductor to enter the cab - if the locomotive is in the back of the train, like it was during the derailment – speed reductions will be verified by radio. Metro-North was not available to comment on whether an interim back-up plan was in place in the event a radio confirmation could not be immediately made until the automatic speed restrictions are in place next year. Speed limits in several areas have also been reduced to eliminate speed drops of more than 20MPH. The appropriate signage will be in place within a week. The train operator will also conduct more thorough speed monitoring of its fleet through review of train data recorders, having supervisors ride random trains and even the use of radar guns.","The automatic braking system forces trains to slow to 30MPH as they approach the deadly Spuyten-Duyvil curve .

Kobe Bryant returned Sunday from a devastating injury to the Lakers lineup after an eight month absence. Mr Bryant almost had a double-double, with nine points and eight rebounds in his season debut for the Lakers, but the team fell 106-94 to the lowly Toronto Raptors. He began his 18th NBA season by going 2 for 9 with four assists and eight turnovers in 28 minutes. He's back!: Kobe Bryant (24) drives to the basket against Toronto Raptors shooting guard DeMar DeRozan (10) during the second half . The sure-fire hall-of-famer hadn't played since tearing his Achilles tendon in April and underwent months of rehabilitation to return for Los Angeles' 20th game this season. Adoring fans cheered Kobe's every move . and forgave every misstep, but Bryant couldn't rally the Lakers late . despite another huge game by Los Angeles' reserves. The 35-year-old perennial all-star hadn't played . since getting hurt in a home game against Golden State on April 12, . making two free throws on a torn Achilles tendon before limping to the . Staples Center locker room. He had immediate surgery, vowing to return . close to full strength - and after working his way back into practices . with the Lakers in the last few weeks, he pronounced himself ready. The . building had the buzz of a playoff game before the opening tip, with . most fans in their seats with cameras trained on Bryant during opening . warmups. The building erupted in loud applause at every mention of Kobe, . who was introduced last in the starting lineup to the thunderous . strains of 'The Imperial March' - Darth Vader's theme from 'Star Wars.' Still an intense competitor: Bryant reacts to a whistle shortly after turning over the ball in the second half . The . crowd roared again the first time Mr Bryant touched the ball, and he found . Robert Sacre underneath the hoop for an assist on Los Angeles' first . possession. With his wife, Vanessa, and two daughters sitting courtside, he hit a free throw for his first point in the second quarter, . followed shortly by an 8-foot, double-pump, left-handed bank shot for . his first field goal. The Lakers never led, and Toronto improbably snapped its five-game losing streak despite playing without forward Rudy Gay, who is expected to be traded to Sacramento on Monday as the centerpiece of an apparent seven-player deal. Kyle Lowry had 23 points and eight assists, and DeMar DeRozan added 10 of his 26 points in the final 4:35 of the Raptors' first road win over the Lakers in 11 tries since Dec. 28, 2001. His family came to support him: Vanessa Bryant, right, wife of Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, sits with their daughters Natalia Diamante Bryant, left, and Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant, center, . Nick Young scored 19 points for the Lakers, who went 10-9 without Mr Bryant this season, forging a winning record without the five-time NBA champion and with little help from fellow injured former MVP point guard Steve Nash. Xavier Henry scored 17 points off the bench, and Jodie Meeks added 14 for the Lakers. The Raptors had 11 players available after holding out Mr Gay, center Aaron Gray and forward Quincy Acy, all set to head to the Kings in exchange for Greivis Vasquez, Patrick Patterson, John Salmons and Chuck Hayes. That turned out to be plenty, thanks to two Los Angeles natives. Johnson, who attended nearby Westchester High School, went 14 for 17 and surpassed his previous career high early in the third quarter. Mr Johnson didn't take a shot in the fourth, but USC product Mr DeRozan and Mr Lowry held off the Lakers. Mr Bryant added a signature 22-foot face-up jumper later in the period, but also showed clear signs of rust and unfamiliarity with his new teammates.","Kobe Bryant played Sunday for the first time since tearing his Achilles tendon in April .

The influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania will be ‘nothing like’ the levels seen when Poland joined the European Union, the Prime Minister said yesterday. Campaigning in Somerset ahead of tomorrow’s local elections, Mr Cameron said the huge numbers coming from Poland since it joined the EU in 2004 – put at 1.1million – was due to Britain putting no controls on immigration while other countries did. He said: ‘When a country joins the European Union you can put in place transitional controls. You can say to that country, ‘You can’t all come here for the first seven years’. Calming words: The UK will not have 'another Polish situation,' David Cameron, seen speaking in Bridgewater, Somerset, said regarding the possible influx of migrants from new EU nations . ‘The last government, when Poland and a lot of other countries joined didn’t put those controls in place. ‘And because other European countries did we did have an enormous influx of people from Poland and those other countries. ‘This time because the transitional controls have been put in, we are not lifting the restrictions on Romania and Bulgaria alone, it’s happening right across Europe. 'So I don’t think we’ll have anything like the situation we had in the Polish situation.’ Mr Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May have been criticised by Tory MPs for failing to comment on the issue and what the impact may be on the health service and welfare system. Restrictions: The Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured during the Queen's speech at a State Luncheon for The President of the United Arab Emirates today, said the restrictions would apply across Europe . The Prime Minister yesterday said the immigration system was ‘one of the messes we inherited from the last Government’ who ‘didn’t know who was coming in to the country and who was going out.’ He said the numbers were ‘out of control’ with net migration - the difference between the number of people moving to Britain and those leaving - as high as 200,000 per year. ‘Over ten years, that’s two million extra people coming to live in Britain. That’s like two cities the size of Birmingham, that’s the problem we inherited. We’ve got that number down by a third, that’s progress but I want us to go further. ‘If people want to come and work, just as if British people want to go and live and work in Spain or elsewhere that’s one thing. ‘But what we can’t have is a situation where people choose to come and live in a different country because the benefits are generous or because there’s a better chance of getting a council house. ‘You can’t have that sort of benefit tourism and we’ll be taking action on that front.’ Crossing borders: The lack of restrictions on new EU member states under the last government has resulted in 1.1million Polish coming in to the UK since it joined the EU in 2004 . Mr Cameron said the problem needed to be tackled across government. He said: ‘You’ve got the immigration minister thinking about immigration, but actually you need the health minister to be thinking about it, the Home Office minister, the legal affairs minister because having a tough approach on immigration should be across all those things. ‘You shouldn’t have instant access to the NHS, instant access to housing, instant access to benefits, so we’re sorting all those things out so that people who do come here will be people who want to come and work and make a contribution just as you’d be welcome if you wanted to do that in another European country.’ In a Westminster debate last week, Tory MP Philip Hollobone said the public had a right to expect ‘some kind of sensible estimate’ of numbers of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants from ministers. The MP for Kettering said if it was the same proportion as from Poland - 1.1million out of a population of 73million since 2004, there would be 425,000 arriving from Bulgaria and Romania whose combined population is 28million. Migration Watch put it at around 50,000 a year, which also works out as 400,000 over eight years. Even Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who was Europe Minister under Labour when mass immigration was underway, has urged the Coalition to learn from his mistakes. He said: ‘With the benefit of hindsight I hope the mistakes that were made, and there were mistakes made because research ought to have been commissioned. ‘I hope ministers will learn from mistakes made by people like myself and others. I hope that proper research is commissioned and that is something the government has categorically refused to do.’","David Cameron promised restrictions on migrants from new EU members .

A half-tonne rock, suspected to be a meteorite, has today been pulled out of murky lake in the Urals, Russia. Experts believe it may be part of a meteor whose ground-shaking shockwave hurt 1,600 people in Russia in February. The dramatic recovery operation came eight months after a piercing streak of light lit up the morning sky in the central Russian region of Chelyabinsk in scenes some locals said made them think of the onset of a nuclear war. Scroll down for videos… . Scientists have recovered what could be giant chunk of the Chelyabinsk meteor from the bottom of the lake it crashed into in the Urals, Russia . The meteor broke up into multiple pieces as it entered the atmosphere, scattering space debris across the industrial region. Much of the meteor landed in a local lake called Chebarkul that the divers entered in an operation covered live on Russian television. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special casing while it was still underwater. The bolder was then pulled ashore and placed on top of a massive scale for the all-important weighing - an operation that quickly went partially wrong. A meteor fireball, pictured, crashed into Russia in February, It was part of a 656-feet wide asteroid called 2011 EO40. Spanish astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses passed earth as it orbits the sun . A meteor that blazed across southern Urals in February was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century. More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs, as it landed near the city of Chelyabinsk. The fireball measuring 18 meters across, screamed into Earth's atmosphere at 41,600 mph. Much of the meteor landed in a local lake called Chebarkul. Other than the latest find, scientists have already uncovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the February 15 incident. However, only five of them turned out being real meteorites. The rock broke up into at least three large pieces as scientists began lifting it from the ground with the help of levers and ropes. The scale itself broke the moment it hit the 570-kilogramme (1,255-pound) mark. ‘The rock had a fracture when we found it,’ one unnamed scientists told the lifenews.ru website in a live transmission. ‘It weighed 570 kilogrammes before the pieces fell off. And then the scale broke,’ said the scientist. ‘We think the whole thing weighs more than 600 kilogrammes,’ he said. Experts cautioned however that it will . take time before scientists can certify that the rock they pulled from . the lake had indeed come from outer space. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel . reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake . Chebarkul since the February 15 incident.

With its shelves piled high with groceries and signs heralding super low prices this new community supermarket looks like any other major food retailer - but shoppers have to prove they are on benefits to take advantage of the bargains. The new Community Shop in Goldthorpe, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, is selling off food which is not up to supermarket chain standards for knock-down prices to help people on benefits to feed their families. To become one of 500 members able to use the 'social supermarket' shoppers must claim one of a specified list of benefits including Employment Support Allowance, and live within a certain post code. On offer: Staff member Chloe Gough fills shelves at the new Community Shop in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, which provides cut-price goods to shoppers on benefits . Cutting costs: Shelves at the Community Shop are stocked with residual food not needed by large supermarket chains, because it might have damaged packaging or the wrong labelling . Hub: As well as access to cheaper goods, members of the shop are offered tailored support programmes including debt advice, cookery skills, home budgeting and CV writing . Shelves at the discount store are stocked daily with residual food not needed by large supermarket chains, because it might have damaged packaging or the wrong labelling. All the produce is within its sell-by date. The new enterprise, overseen by food re-distributor Company Shop,  is being supported by major retailers, brands and manufacturers, including Asda, Morrisons, The Co-operative Food, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Mondelez, Ocado, Tetley, Young's and Muller. Most of the food comes from food manufacturers before it reaches the supermarket shelves, and may have been poorly labelled, or over-ordered by the retailer, while other goods are donated direct from the supermarkets. Restrictions: Only 500 people can become members of the shop, and must prove they claim one of a specified list of benefits including Employment Support Allowance, and live within a certain post code to join . Future plans: Those behind the scheme then hope to launch a further 20 branches across the country next year, including six in London . Backing: Community Shop is being supported by major retailers including Asda, Morrisons, The Co-operative Food, Marks & Spencer and Tesco . Every little helps: Shoppers can also buy cleaning products and household goods at the store, where reduced products from M&S, Tesco Asda and Morrisons sit side-by-side on the shelves . If the food had not been . re-distributed via Company Shop it is likely that it would have ended up . in anaerobic digestion for waste management and fuel production, as . animal feed, or in landfill. Company Shop director of environment . and social affairs Sarah Dunwell said that 500 people will be given . membership for six months to test whether the social supermarket idea . works. Those behind the scheme then hope to launch a further 20 branches across the country next year, including six in London. Five a day: Fruit and vegetables at the shop, which does not sell tobacco or alcohol are heavily discounted . Supply and demand: A shopper checks out the discounts on offer while Chloe Gough re-stocks the shelves with produce . Supermarket sweep: Those behind the scheme say the stock is 'not cheap food for the poor' and will bring people a huge range of items . Ms Dunwell said: 'We are aiming to fill a gap between food banks and mainstream retail. 'Lots of families are not in an emergency situation but are on the cusp of food poverty.

'This is not cheap food for the poor, it will bring a huge range of foods. 'It takes stuff that will not make it to supermarket shelves and uses it to feed people who need it most. 'While we have people in the UK going hungry it is wrong such foods should be thrown away.' Members will be assessed at the end of six months with the aim being that they no longer need the social supermarket, and as well as access to cheaper goods will be offered tailored support programmes including debt advice, cookery skills, home budgeting and CV writing. Ms Dunwell said: 'With many families . facing tough times in Barnsley, Company Shop wanted to do more to match . surplus stock with people who really need it.

'We are working with Company Shop to see how we can develop our existing relationship to support this project.' Chair of the London Food Board, Rosie Boycott, said she hoped the scheme would be introduced in the capital in 2014.

A father-of-two who lost his leg after falling 100ft off a mountain side has bounced back to scale cliffs five times a week with the help of a prosthetic limb. Craig DeMartino, 48, had his left leg amputated in 2002 after a miscommunication with his climbing partner in the Rocky Mountain range which left him fighting for his life. Falling onto granite rocks, he broke his neck, ripped a hole in his right lung, the vertebrae in his lower back was pulverised. Determined: Craig DeMartino, 48, fell 100ft after a miscommunication with his climbing partner in 2002 . After two months in hospital, his leg failed to heal and doctors offered to surgically remove it. Despite his ordeal, Mr DeMartino, from Loveland in Colorado, USA, opted for amputation in the hope it would give him a better chance to climb, walk and cycle again with the help of a prosthetic limb. Now, 11 years later, he is scaling mountains five times a week. Desperate to get back on the rocks, Mr DeMartino, who lives with his wife, fellow climber Cyndy, and their children Will and Mayah, helped design the prosthetic limb to make it suitable for climbing. Decision: Mr DeMartino, a father-of-two from Colorado, opted to amputate his left leg when it failed to heal after two months in hospital. He got straight to designing a prosthetic limb to climb with . Battle: He was apprehensive at first - and his family never wanted him to risk his life again after the incident . Nonetheless, he was tentative in the months after his operation and his family never wanted him to climb a mountain again. But after completing a climb smoothly, their fears were calmed. Mr DeMartino, who wrote a book about his ordeal titled ‘After the Fall’, said: 'When I realised I was falling it was more surprise than fear. 'You don’t have time to be scared you’re just dealing with the things as they happen. Mission: 'It was a really long process across years to get the fear under control,' he said . 'The rocks and trees and the ground rushed up to meet me so fast, yet I could still see detail in all the things around me, from the pine trees to the grey granite blocks on the ground. 'Once I hit the ground my only memory is the pain that was running through my body. 'I was so badly injured but all I felt was this searing pain in my back. It felt like a long time to get me out yet it was five hours that stretched on in my mind. 'I was in hospital for two months then home for another month before I could really do anything. 'It was such a slow and painful process so I’d deal with the days broken down into small pieces, so I could work through everything.' After the accident Mr DeMartino had to learn how to make his body move and work again and he believes climbing was a great tool to help. He added: 'I love the idea that you are problem solving in a vertical environment, plus when you’re outside, you get to see the most amazing places. 'My leg never healed and was holding me back - I wanted to decide if I was going to climb. Up until that point, the accident had decided pretty much everything for me. 'That was one choice I had to make and it was really empowering to be able to take control of a part of my life again. 'Climbing with a prosthetic limb was a totally new process for me. I’ve learned to make the leg work for me, instead of fighting it all the time and I actually like the process of unlocking the ways to climb things again as a disabled climber. 'At first I would swear it off every time and decide to never climb again but then I would remember one or two small things I liked about the experience and that would be enough. Happy: Mr DeMartino says he was happy to be in control of a choice that has shaped his life . Passionate: Mr DeMartino loves his hobby and his wife Cyndy, a fellow climber, is his biggest supporter . 'It was a really long process across years to get the fear under control. Today I’m as at ease as ever when I climb. 'There is always an element of fear but climbing teaches you to deal with fear and still move forward. 'My wife is a climber as well and she has always been my biggest supporter. From the beginning, whatever I decided about climbing she was behind me. 'You have to work through so many things as your life changes. My parents were super upset with me when I went back in the beginning but they have seen what climbing does and means to me.'","Craig DeMartino, 48, fell off cliff onto granite in the Rocky Mountains in 2002 .

The picture shows the former freedom fighter sitting mute in an armchair, his head propped up by a pillow and the tell-tale marks of an oxygen mask on his cheeks, as South African president Jacob Zuma grins into the lens and squeezes his hand . But the picture has been criticised by some as a shameless publicity stunt on the part of the South African president who has been blamed for exploiting his predecessor's ill health for political kudos. Extraordinarily, he even claimed the former statesman was in 'good spirits and good shape' during the televised visit despite the fact that Mandela could neither move nor speak. Since the picture was taken, Mandela disappeared entirely from public view, sparking speculation over the exact date of his death. President Zuma announced his death yesterday following a long battle with complications relating to a lung infection.

Mandela was married three times and fathered six children - only three of whom, his daughters Makaziwe, Zenani 'Zeni' and Zindziswa, are still alive. Bitter dispute: Makaziwe Mandela, left, and her . sister Zenani, right with Nelson Mandela, are locked in a legal wrangle . with two of their father's oldest friends over a £1million trust fund . set up by the former South African president in 2005 . 'Lost trust': Nelson Mandela is said to have put £1million of his money in a trust fund to stop his family arguing over it . Legal rows: Nelson Mandela, centre, is surrounded by his grandchildren - many of whom supported a legal bid to gain control of a Mandela art merchandise company - at his house in Qunu, Eastern Cape, on his 90th birthday . His daughter Makaziwe, from his first marriage, and Zenani, from his second marriage, have reportedly already become embroiled in a legal battle earlier this year over the control of a £1million trust fund. Mr Mandela's third daughter, Zindzi, is not involved in the court action, the Star of South Africa reported. The money was placed in the fund by Mr Mandela in 2005 to be distributed to his daughters only in the event of hardship as he wanted them to forge a career of their own rather than live off his money. He is said to have set up around 27 such funds over the years after 'losing trust' in his children with the money intended to last generations for 'specific circumstances' and not general use. But Makaziwe and Zanani are demanding access to the fund and have begun legal action against the trust's two directors; 84-year-old lawyer George Bizos, who defended Mandela in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, and 60-year-old Tokyo Sexwale who was a prisoner alongside Mandela on Robben Island.","Picture was taken on April 29 this year, two weeks after hospital release .

Supermarket chain Morrisons has scrapped window cleaning to save money. The retail giant hopes customers will not notice the cutback this winter because it is too dark. The decision to let grime collect on store windows has been blamed on ‘financial constraints’ as the big name retailers struggle in the face of competition from discount chains like Lidl and Aldi. Window cleaning has been scrapped at Morrisons until January to cut costs . The ban on window cleaning has been in force since the start of December and will run until February 2. An email from Maintenance Management Ltd (MML) which manages Morrisons’ cleaners, told contractors that the supermarket was facing a ‘tough end of year in respect of their budgetary position’, the Telegraph reported. The email also blamed ‘financial constraints’ and added that window cleaning was not needed because ‘the weather forecast for this winter shows an increase in snow and frost’. Morrisons has reported difficult trading in the run-up to the traditionally busy Christmas period. Last month it suffered a fresh sales decline as heavy discounting to win cash-strapped shoppers and weakness in convenience and online operations took a toll on the supermarket chain. Like-for-like sales at Morrisons slumped by 2.4 per cent in the 13 weeks to the start of November - undershooting City expectations of a 1.7 per cent. It came after a 1.6 per cent decline in the six months to the start of August, and follows industry figures showing the chain's market share has shrunk to around 11.2 per cent from 11.4 per cent a year ago. The company is pinning its hopes on its ‘Go on its Christmas’ ad campaign starring Ant and Dec to win over shoppers in the next few weeks. Morrisons has reported drops in sales this year and is pining its hope on a recovery this Christmas . But they will increasingly struggle to see into stores from the outside, after the window cleaning was axed. A spokesman said: ‘Morrisons has decided to reduce window cleaning at stores because it is less important to customers at the darkest time of the year; because the water that runs off windows can be a slippage hazard in the winter; and so we can spend money on maintenance activity that our customers do care about at this time of year. ‘We will be restoring the normal service in the spring and the reduction does not affect windows easily seen by customers.’","Retailer has reported drops in sales ahead of busy Christmas period .

People in the UK spend a week working just to pay the interest on the national debt, new figures reveal. Despite a return to economic growth, Britain’s debt mountain continues to grow with interest alone to rise by 50 per cent in just four years. The UK government owes a total of £1.2trillion, and paying the interest is expected to cost £72.5billion by 2017.18. The huge sums spent on servicing the debt is equivalent to the total amount raised from council tax, fuel duty and stamp duty. Chancellor George Osborne used last week’s Autumn Statement to insist better-than-expected growth figures does not mean that the country is 'off the hook'. But details of the rising debt interest reveals the impact on the tax bills on ordinary working people. Someone earning £40,000 paid £708 towards paying interest on the nation’s debt, equivalent to six day’s take-home pay, the Daily Telegraph reported. People on £100,000 paid £2,487 or 10 day’s pay, while someone on a salary £15,000 paid £140 on interest, almost three days’ pay after tax. Soaring national debt will see the charges rise markedly, with someone on £40,000 expected to pay £1,100 towards debt interest by 2018-19. Britain's debt mountain will continue to grow . The UK economy is expected to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from 0.6 per cent forecast in March. As a result, the government will borrow £9billion less than forecast. But the total debts are forecast to continue to rise, and with it the debt interest bill. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects total debt to be equivalent to 75.5 per cent of GDP this year, rising to 78.3 per cent next year, before peaking at 80.0 per cent the next year. Only in 2016-17 will it start to fall and only just, down by a predicted 79.9 per cent, then falling again to 78.4 per cent and then 75.9 per cent. Chancellor George Osborne, who spent today making a sponge cake at a new supermarket in Watford, has warned it will take time to get a grip on the UK's rising debts . Mr Osborne told MPs that while the deficit remains, it adds to our national debt every year. He added: ‘We will not let up in dealing with our country’s debts. We will not spend the money from lower borrowing. ‘We will not squander the hard-earned gains of the British people. ‘The stability and low mortgage rates, lower deficit and falling borrowing have been hard won by this country, but let us be clear: they could easily be lost. ‘That’s why we must work through our plan to secure the British economy for the long term.’","Employees pay the equivalent of several days wage in tax to fund interest .

A 15-year-old boy has been rushed to hospital after allegedly being stabbed at school by another student, police said. Officers were called to Eggbuckland Community College - the school that Olympic diver Tom Daley left in 2009 because of constant bullying - in Plymouth, Devon, at 8.40am today to reports a student had been wounded. The boy was taken to Derriford Hospital with a back injury and has since been discharged. School stabbing: A 15-year-old boy was allegedly stabbed at Eggbuckland Community College, where Olympic diver Tom Daley (pictured) was a former student and claimed to suffer constant bullying such as name-calling and threats to 'break his legs' from other students . Police arrested a 14-year-old boy, also a student at the school, on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Daley left the technology college when he was 14-years-old after suffering constant bullying there, claiming he was called names such as ‘Speedo boy’. He also said he received threats from other students who said they would ‘break his legs’. Superintendent Chris Singer, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said today that the suspect had been taken into police custody. He said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of this incident and would like to reassure people that there is no danger to anyone else. 'The alleged weapon that was used has been seized and the suspect has been arrested.' Stabbed at school: A 15-year-old boy was rushed to Derriford Hospital (pictured) with a back injury after being allegedly stabbed at Eggbuckland Community College by another pupil . In a statement on their website, the school said: 'Before College today, there was a completely random, unprovoked and unprecedented incident involving two of our students which resulted in an injury. 'He was immediately taken to hospital and has since been discharged and is now currently at home with his family. Everyone at the college wishes him a speedy recovery.' They said the principal has been in regular contact with the parents of both boys involved in the incident and messages have been posted to the school's social media feeds to reassure students. 'The parents of those students who witnessed the incident have been notified and appropriate professional support and care is being provided for the small number of students affected,' the statement said. 'The Devon and Cornwall Police are involved in this matter so we are unable to comment further on the nature of the incident.' On their Facebook page they posted: 'Just to reassure students and parents that there was an incident here this morning which was dealt with very swiftly by staff. 'One boy was taken to hospital and is fine. A second boy is being interviewed by police. We have already contacted the parents of those who witnessed the incident.' Daley told the Plymouth Herald in 2009 that the bullying at school started after the Beijing Olympics and got increasingly worse. He said: 'I'd always ignored the ""diver boy"" or ""Speedo boy"" comments when I came back from Beijing last year, hoping they'd get fed up and stop.'

Food prices in the biggest supermarkets will rise if Scotland backs independence, retail giants have warned. Big name stores like Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's absorb the higher costs of doing business in Scotland so that prices are the same across the UK. But if voters decide to go it alone in next year’s referendum, Scotland would be treated like other overseas operations where prices are higher. Costs: Prices in leading supermarkets will rise in an independent Scotland, industry bosses have warned . Longer travel distances between depots and stores in Scotland increase transport costs to good food onto shelves. Companies which sell alcohol and cigarettes also pay higher business rates. There have already been claims that an independent Scotland will pay higher energy, mortgage and tax bills. But the warning that the weekly shop will also be more costly is likely to alarm people who have paid little attention to the debates about currency unions and EU negotiations. A senior executive at one of the Big Four supermarkets said: ‘We would treat it as an international market and act accordingly by putting up our prices. ‘The costs of distribution are much higher in Scotland but at the moment that gets absorbed by the UK business.’ Each of the national grocers have the same prices in stores of the same size, whether it is in Aberdeen or Andover. But the ‘national pricing’ policy would end if Scotland became a separate country, and would instead be treated as a foreign outpost. Morrisons boss Dalton Philips said shoppers in England and Wales should not subsidise prices in Scotland while Asda chief executive Andy Clarke said costs vary across the UK . Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, said: ‘At Asda, we believe in fairness so the price customers pay for a pint of milk or loaf of bread is the same regardless of where they live in the UK. ‘However the cost of doing business in different parts of the country does vary. ‘A yes vote in 2014 could result in Scotland being a less attractive investment proposition for business, and put further pressure on our costs.' Dalton Philips, chief executive of Wm Morrison said: ‘If the regulatory environment was to increase the burden of the cost structure on business, that would potentially have to be passed through to consumer pricing, because why should the English and Welsh consumer subsidise this increased cost of doing business in Scotland?’ A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We’ve got a great business in Scotland and our job is to create the best offer for customers whatever the outcome of the referendum.' The Scottish government insists there is ‘no reason’ for food prices to rise, claiming ‘Scotland would be more competitive and less costly than at present’. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond used his launch of his blueprint for independence to boast that the Scottish food and drink sector would thrive . Last month Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned households in an independent Scotland would pay more for energy. He said: ‘If Scotland votes for independence, and there can be no guarantee of support for renewables in Scotland from English, Welsh and Northern Irish consumers, Scottish consumers and industry could see price rises.’ Last month Alex Salmond launched his blueprint for independence, insisting Scotland’s food and drink sector would thrive. It stated: 'Scotland’s food and drink industry does an excellent job promoting the Scottish brand, but Scotland is constrained by the current constitutional settlement from directly engaging on a level footing with other countries. 'Independence will boost Scotland’s international profile, delivering new opportunities for food and drink exports, as well as attracting new visitors to our country to enjoy our produce.'","Transport and business rates make it more costly to trade in Scotland .

A mother of two who lets her children stay at home says they don't need to go to school because they learn enough 'naturally' by playing computer games and going for walks outside. Maryanna Jacobs, 32, from Gorebridge, Scotland, is one of a new wave of parents embracing 'unschooling', a new philosophy that rejects traditional, curriculum-based, education in favour of letting children choose what they want to do. Rather than sitting down with a workbook and learning key subjects such as maths or English, Miss Jacbos' daughter Rio, nine, and son Bryden, eight, enjoy playing Minecraft on their laptops, baking or going to the shops with their mother. Scroll down for video . 'Unschooled' Rio, nine, and her brother Bryden, eight, learn maths by playing Minecraft on their computers . Mother Maryanne Jacobs, 32, lets her children stay at home in Gorebridge, Scotland, rather than go to school . Miss Jacobs, who has been criticised by education experts for harming her children's chances, says often people cannot 'comprehend' her reasons for choosing to bring them up this way. But she says her children are learning 'naturally' by playing on their own and having 'life experiences' like cooking or playing in the park. She said: 'School is not necessarily the best environment to learn in and when it came to my children I wanted to give them the choice to stay at home. 'And they've not been held back by that - they can both read and write very well, and they're just as advanced as children their age who go to school. 'They pick things up every day and that's how they learn. I don't think it's right to introduce projects and make them sit down to learn something. 'If I tried to do that, they'd be confused.' Miss Jacobs, who lives with her registered disabled partner, Allan, and their two children, says she doesn't believe in . routines or schedules, so there are no set meal times and the children go to . bed when their parents do, which can be between 9pm and midnight. Miss Jacobs, who left school with no qualifications, has been told she is too uneducated to teach her children . Unschoolers believe that children's innate curiosity will drive them to learn, so a curriculum isn't necessary . And while children across the country . are sitting down to the desks for the day's lessons, Rio and Bryden . are engrossed in their favourite computer game, Minecraft, or . collecting feathers and stones in the nearby country park. Their mother said: 'Both the kids have . learnt numbers, words and how to type through their computer games, and . they've learnt a lot about computers too. 'They've learnt maths through things like shopping and baking. 'Numbers are always going through . Bryden's head - he's fascinated with clocks and timetables. Rio is more . of a words person - she learnt through games like Scrabble and Monopoly. 'They've learnt about birds, trees and rocks just by being outdoors.' Miss Jacobs says if her children ask her a question she doesn't know the answer to, they look it up together . Daughter Rio, nine, went to primary school for eight days last year but stopped going because she didn't like it . She added: 'They're naturally curious . and ask a lot of questions, which I try my best to answer. If I can't, . we'll look it up on the computer or we'll find someone who can help.' Miss Jacobs, who left school without any qualifications and did a variety of jobs including working on a market stall before having children, dismisses people who have told her she's 'not educated enough' to educated her children. She said: 'I have been criticised for what we're doing and some can't believe it's legal. 'A lot of people find it hard because people have been going to school for centuries and we're going against that. 'We have a great deal of quality time together and it's made us closer as a family.  It makes me very sad when I hear parents say they can't wait for their children to go to school so they can have some peace and quiet. 'Why have children if you don't want them around?' The children can read and write as well as or better than their peers in formal education, their mother says . Miss Jacobs' children both attended nursery school five days a week but when Rio was four, her mother heard about unschooling and decided to give her children the choice. She said: 'I decided to ask the kids what they . wanted to do about school. 'I said their friends were going but it would . be stricter than home and they'd have to sit for longer periods of time . at their desks. I also explained they wouldn't get days off when they . wanted. 'They both decided they wanted to be at home with their mum. They had that choice.' She said Rio attended primary school for eight days last year but decided it wasn't for her. 'She told me she really . wanted to try it so we took her out and bought the uniform and the bag,' she said.  'She went to bed early, set her alarm and got herself up in the morning. 'Rio went to school for eight days last year so we took her out and bought the uniform and the bag but she didn't like it in the end.' - Maryanne Jacobs, mother . 'None of the children could believe she had never been to school before.' She added: 'Rio didn't like it in the . end. She found some things very frustrating - she was much more . advanced than other kids in her swimming classes but wasn't allowed to . go in to the deep end of the pool. The teachers didn't really know how . able she was. 'She was also taught nursery rhymes like 'Ring a Ring o' Roses' which she found babyish. Miss Jacobs is not concerned about her children's prospects, saying she is bringing them up to be 'free-thinking'. She said: 'I'm bringing the kids up to be . free-thinking entrepreneurs who don't have to work for someone else if . they don't want to and don't feel they have to 'be something' when they . grow up.' Today leading educators said a formal education offered children the best chance. Dr Kevin Stannard, of the Girls’ Day School Trust, said: 'It’s important that we do have an element of choice within our education system, and one size will never fit all, but for the vast majority of children a school environment, with a formal curriculum and experienced teachers, is by far the best option. 'It’s not just the content of a formal curriculum that’s important, it’s also about how you learn and the life skills and attributes you develop while in education. 'Part of a rounded education, for example, is the ability to develop ‘critical thinking’ and to question assumptions you have grown up with, which can only truly happen outside of the home environment. 'It is also much easier to learn skills like ‘collaboration’ when you are actually working alongside a group of classmates each day.' No lessons: Miss Jacobs says her son and daughter have learnt words by playing Scrabble with her . And Julia Harrington, headmistress of Queen Anne's School in Caversham, near Reading, said: 'Schools provide an environment where there can be exciting stimuli, opportunity and support for an adolescent to safely learn and develop their thinking and personalities. 'Teenagers are very creative and, as we all do, benefit from working with those who are more experienced and experts in their subject area alongside their peers. 'Young people need to know how to filter and shown discernment in their processing of information, and it is very difficult to develop this sort of mindset in a vacuum.' - Julia Harrington, headmistress of Queen Anne's, Caversham . 'Research shows that a teenager’s brain demands interaction with other teenagers and will seek it out if it is not there.  In the age of information overload, young people need to know how to filter and show discernment in their processing of information, and it is very difficult to develop this sort of mindset in a vacuum.' The unconventional phenomenon of unschooling began in America but its popularity is now on the rise here in the UK, and Miss Jacobs knows a community of around 200 other parents in Scotland who embrace unschooling or other variations of education that reject formal schooling. While home-schooling your children is legal, the legality of unschooling is unclear, with the Department for Education (DoE)saying that children of compulsory school-age must receive a suitable full-time education, whether in school or otherwise. A spokesman for the DoE said: 'Parents in England must ensure that children of compulsory school age receive a full-time education 'suitable' for their age and abilities. 'This can be at home or at school. It is down to local authorities to decide whether the education a child is receiving is suitable.' A Scottish Government spokesperson said: 'The Scottish Government is supportive of parents’ right to home school if they wish. 'Local authorities, however, have a duty to ensure that parents that are known to be home educating are providing their children with a suitable education.' A spokesman for Midlothian Council, which covers the area the Jacobs family lives in, said they couldn't comment on individuals but said they were 'committed to providing the highest quality educational experiences for all children and young people'. He added: 'There is a very small number of parents who choose to home educate their children and the authority has a responsibility to monitor this provision to ensure that the needs of the children and young people are met.'","Maryanne Jacobs lets her children Rio, nine, and Bryden, eight, stay home .

A foul-mouthed psychiatrist who swore at staff and said a patient ‘can just go and kill herself’ faces being struck off after being found guilty of misconduct. Dr Marinus Klijnsma told a tribunal that his use of inappropriate and offensive language was a ‘dysfunctional habit’ that got worse over the years. Some of his secretaries received angry voicemail messages in which he asked: ‘Where the f**k are you?’ 'Played by his own rules': Psychiatrist Dr Marinus Klijnsma faces being struck off after the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (pictured) heard he swore at and abused staff and patients and took unauthorised leave . In another voicemail he said: ‘Whenever I f**king ring you, you’re not at your f**king desk. You never answer the f**king phone.’ The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard that the doctor made the ‘go kill herself’ remark when he was told that one of his psychiatric patients was going to appear on a television programme. He ‘played by his own rules,’ taking unauthorised time off work . and unapproved holidays, while using NHS facilities for his own private . practice, it heard. Dutch-born Klijnsma admitted to all charges at the tribunal in Manchester in relation to his employment at the Linden Centre and the Gables, in Braintree, Essex, between 1999 and 2011. The doctor, who has also been in private practice at the Priory Hospital, in Chelmsford, Essex, since 2000, was found guilty of misconduct and now faces a ban from the profession. Panel chairman, Dr Bernard Herdan told the doctor: ‘The panel has determined that there is a low risk of repetition, and that you do not pose a direct risk to patients. Misconduct: The panel deemed his fitness to practice 'currently impaired' after he committed the charges while working at the Gables (pictured) and the Linden Centre, both in Braintree, Essex . ‘Indeed, the panel accepts the wealth of evidence that you are a good doctor, and that you are seen by your colleagues as one who provides excellent care and has a strong commitment to the interests of your patients. ‘However, the panel has concluded that in all the circumstances of this case including, in particular, your defiance of the requirements set out for you by the trust and your dishonesty, you seriously compromised the reputation of the profession and your conduct was such as would undermine the public’s trust in doctors.' He continued: 'The panel has determined that the need to uphold proper professional standards and public confidence in the profession would be undermined if a finding of impairment were not made in the particular circumstances of this case. ‘Accordingly, the panel has determined that your fitness to practise is currently impaired by reason of your misconduct.’ Klijnsma abused the trust placed in him by the NHS, using public-funded facilities and resources for the provision of private practice without the North Essex trust’s agreement, the tribunal heard. Faces ban: The tribunal heard that Klijnsma used NHS facilities for his own private practice. Panel chairman Dr Bernard Herdan said that while 'he did not pose a direct risk to patients' he 'compromised the reputation of the profession' He ‘dishonestly’ took fees from patients while working within the NHS and even asked his secretary to help him with his private work, the panel heard. On one occasion he treated a Dutch patient, who had got the ferry from Holland to see him, at the Linden Centre. Klijnsma told the hearing: ‘I offered. I was aware at the time I was offering a private patient in an NHS facility in NHS time. That was wrong.’ ‘I was very aware that what I did was not acceptable.’ Klijnsma described using inappropriate and offensive language towards staff as a ‘dysfunctional habit’ that got worse over the years. The panel heard that a receptionist at The Gables heard a patient comment that she had been waiting to see Klijnsma for 45 minutes. She heard him reply: ‘I suppose you think I have been sitting on my arse all morning.’ On being informed a junior doctor had called in sick he said: ‘He’s a f**king w***er, he can go and play with his willy.’ But giving evidence, he told the panel: ‘It has been a long-standing habit. The kind of swearing that came about under stress or to let off steam. That swearing has got worse in the years leading up to this.’ To let off steam: Klijnsma told the tribunal that swearing was a 'long-standing habit' and came about because of stress (file photo) 'The use of the F-word came out of feeling frustrated I think. It was not meant to insult her [his secretary]. Klijnsma has also admitted to taking unauthorised absences from his work at the Linden Centre between June 2009 and May 2011. On some of these occasions he undertook private practice work despite being contracted to work for the NHS clinic. Simon Jackson QC, for the General Medical Council suggested this formed part of a pattern of the doctor ‘setting his own rules’. He added: ‘On those dates you were absent from duties without authorisation it must follow that you abused the trust placed in you and you would do other things that you weren’t supposed to be doing.’ The tribunal heard that Klijnsma would ‘fly under the radar’ by ignoring annual leave protocol, in one year taking 11 more days holiday than he was entitled to. Mr Jackson said: ‘You were running a system where you were playing by your own rules under the radar.’ The hearing continues.

Hilary Mantel has been praised for her lengthy true-to-life accounts of Tudor Britain - but when it comes to her personal viewing, it seems her tastes are a little less high-brow. The double Booker prizewinner has admitted she was an avid fan of The Tudors, the BBC show panned by critics for its 'sexed-up, dumbed down' version of English history. The series began in 2007 as the 61-year-old author was writing her first novel, Wolf Hall, and received hundreds of complaints from viewers and academics who claimed to spot modern radiators, Tarmac driveways, concrete bollards and Victorian carriages. Scroll down for video . Hilary Mantel, right, was an avid viewer of the BBC series The Tudors, panned by critics as 'sexed-up' and 'dumbed down'. Left, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Henry VIII and Annabelle Wallis as Jane Seymour . Ms Mantel giggled as she told Tanya Gold of the Sunday Times Magazine that she watched the show 'avidly'. She later explained that it was important to see the show because it would have an effect on how the British public thought of the Tudors when her first novel was released in 2009. 'It would condition the world into which Wolf Hall would be born,' she said. And despite enjoying the programme, the author tactfully confessed that casting the slim, brooding Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the obese wife-killer Henry VII was 'stretching it a bit'. 'You never translate your character into the body of some living person you’d seen out there,' she said. 'When you are writing, your characters are flickering constructs, they are always on the move. It’s much more like people you know well in real life. Sexed-up: The Tudors, which began in 2007, was criticised for its historical inaccuracies and the choice of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, left, to play the dark and brooding Henry VIII and Right: Natalie Dormer as Anne Boleyn . Raunchy: The drama contained several explicit sex scenes, including one four minutes into the first episode . Passionate: But viewers claimed they spotted modern radiators, concrete bollards and Victorian carriages . Acclaimed: Ms Mantel's weighty first two novels in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy have each won a Booker prize . 'You are not looking at them fixedly every moment to judge their features, what you do have is a general impression of them, of their energy. This means your concept of who can represent that character is totally flexible. 'There could be exceptions: when they cast Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry in The Tudors, I thought that was stretching it a bit.' Justified: The author said The Tudors conditioned the world into which her first novel was born . With its raunchy explicit sex scenes the BBC drama, which ran for four series, was part of a bid to interest younger audiences in history. But it strayed too far from the truth for some. Leanda de Lisle, a Tudor biographer, said: 'Overall the series is badly written with an extremely cheap feel to it. 'It is hugely disappointing. With inaccuracies in almost every sentence, the BBC is dumbing down the Tudor period. 'The characters talk in completely unnatural ways, addressing their own family members as ""Anne Boleyn"" or ""Mary Boleyn"" so that we, the stupid audience, understand who they're supposed to be. 'Henry VIII was exceedingly powerful, both politically and physically, but Rhys Meyers is pretty, rather than macho and thus completely unconvincing.' Ms Mantel is the only author ever to have won two Booker prizes for the first two books in a trilogy, Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies. Her trilogy is about Thomas Cromwell, a little-known adviser to Henry VII, and the third book is due out within the next few years. Meanwhile the author is putting together a stage version of Wolf Hall with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which will open in Stratford-upon-Avon this week.","BBC show was panned by critics for its 'poor' casting and sex scenes .

After his poor response to the Autumn Statement, colleagues are asking if it’s time to go while George Osborne has advised him to stick to playing ‘chopsticks’. And yesterday, after blustering his way through an interview – with some choice language – Ed Balls took his opponent’s advice, tickling the ivories at a recital. The Shadow Chancellor, who was forced to postpone his Grade 3 piano exam for last Thursday’s statement, performed Robert Schumann’s Kinderszenen – a piece for children – at a North London arts centre. Scroll down for video . The Shadow Chancellor took to the stage to show off his skills after being mocked in the week by Conservative Chancellor George Osborne . Labour Party Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls plays with pianist Lucy Parham on the piano . Hours earlier, he faced questions from Sky News’s Dermot Murnaghan about reports Labour MPs want him sacked. Dismissing these as ‘tittle-tattle’, Mr Balls answered: ‘Frankly Dermot, I couldn’t give a t***.’ He . also refused repeatedly to apologise for the way the last Labour . government piled up debt. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed . Balls remains in deep denial.’ Mr Balls had revealed last month he . postponed his Grade Three exam because it fell on the same day his . opposite number was due give his Autumn Statement. He said: 'We got the time and date for my Grade three exam two weeks ago. And . can you believe it? It was exactly the time when George Osborne is . standing up to do the Autumn Statement! 'So I've decided to put the exam . back to March, because with this concert coming up as well, it's all a . bit stressful.' Then, in . the heated exchanges that followed Mr Osborne's speech on Thursday, Mr Balls . made a series of jokes, including one about the statement being a . Christmas 'turkey'. That riled the Chancellor, who responded with the quip: 'I think he should have gone ahead with the Chopsticks rendition. Out of tune? Ed Balls played at the Celebrity Carnival: Lucy Parham & Friends concert today . Mr Balls, pictured here with Lucy Parham, had revealed last month he postponed his Grade Three exam because it fell on the same day his opposite number was due give his Autumn Statement .

Three . days on and Labour's attack dog, has set himself the target of reaching Grade Eight by his 50th birthday, was tinkling the ivories in his debut . performance at Kings Place, an arts venue in King's Cross, north London. The concert, organised by the pianist Lucy Parham, included performances by the comedian Alistair McGowan and actors Juliet . Stevenson, Edward Fox and Simon Russell Beale. Mr Balls performed a rendition of a movement from composer Robert Schumann's Kinderszenen (Scenes from Childhood) - a piece for children, but far more difficult than Chopsticks. In October 2012, Mr Balls played a piece called Gavotta on the piano for the LBC 97.3 radio station soon after he had passed his Grade One exam. Blowing his top: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls responds to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne following the Autumn Statement to MPs in the House of Commons . And today, Mr Balls claimed Labour was winning the economic argument, saying the massed ranks of Conservative MPs were always going to try to shout down his message. And he said he ‘couldn't give a toss’ about speculation about his chances of staying in the job, insisting he had ‘never been less bothered’ about ‘gossip and tittle tattle’ about his performance in a 20-year career. Mr Balls told the Sky News Murnaghan programme: ‘(We have) a really strong economic argument and that's why 300 Tory MPs were going to shout really loudly from the very beginning. ‘I decided I was going to take the argument back to them and say no, there is not a recovery for most working people, living standards are falling. What happened the next day? ‘The Institute of Fiscal Studies effectively confirmed the Chancellor is out of touch saying living standards are going up because for most people, they are going down - I think we are winning the argument.’","The 46-year-old Shadow Chancellor showed off his skills in concert .

Tragedy: Mandy Shepherd, 27, who suffered from mitochondrial disease, died after collapsing in the bath . A young woman who refused to be beaten by bullies who laughed at her incurable medical condition has collapsed and died whilst taking a bath. Mandy Shepherd, whose illness left her with slurred speech, muscle weakness and drooping eyelids, had been mocked in the street and attacked after callous thugs spotted her symptoms and wrongly assumed she was a drug addict. But despite police being unable to trace one suspect, the 27-year-old vowed not to be scared and carried on taking the same route home whenever she went to volunteer at a youth centre. Tragedy struck after Miss Shepherd suffered a fatal cardiac arrest at her home in Plungington, near Preston, Lancashire. She was discovered lying under the water by her stepfather who went to check on her. Tests revealed her death - two days before she was due to go on a family holiday to Cornwall - was linked to Mitochondrial Disease an incurable illness which she was diagnosed with at the age of 13. Her family have now vowed to campaign for more awareness about the condition and are raising funds for the Children’s Mitochondrial Disease Network after a coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes. Her mother, also Mandy, 55, said: 'Mandy was brave but stubborn.She had her own mind and was very independent and she was very friendly and would do anything for anybody if she could. 'Sometimes she would get frustrated with her condition but she wouldn’t complain, she just got frustrated if she was struggling to do something but she was determined she would manage. She didn’t moan about it. Condition: The incurable disease meant she had slurred speech and drooping eyelids . 'She was only small but you knew she was there. She had a good sense of humour and she was always joining in. 'We knew there was no cure for her condition but we just thought that she would end up bed bound. We didn’t think she would die so young. 'The disorder seems to manifest in different ways and people don’t always have the same symptoms. In recent months her walking really deteriorated, she couldn’t walk very well. 'Mandy had been attacked and abused in the street because people assumed she was under the influence of drugs because of her droopy eyes and because she stumbled when she walked. 'It was sickening - but it used to annoy us more than it did her and she would still walk back the same way. She wouldn’t let anyone stop her.” Stepfather Reg Gandy, 61, said: 'She was going to get as much out of her life as she could and she wouldn’t let anything or anyone stop her. When you consider what she had been through, a lot of people would’ve given up. Family: Her mother, also Mandy (right) said her daughter was 'brave' and 'stubborn' 'One night she had been at the youth centre and was walking home. A man said something to her like that she was a smack head or that she was smashed out of her head. 'She just ignored him and he grabbed her and smashed her against the wall. 'An elderly couple were walking nearby and he ran off. 'At the time we reported it to the police but there was no CCTV and Mandy wasn’t able to give a proper description because it was dark. She was shaken up but she wasn’t going to let it bother her. 'Mandy just put it down to being one of those things and it wasn’t the first time but it was usually name calling. She didn’t let it stop her though and she would still come back the same way.' He added: 'She was an incredibly brave woman. She wouldn’t let anything or anyone stop her doing anything. Her appearance meant she was mocked in the street by passers-by who thought she was a drug addict . 'She was amazing and so strong if you consider what she had been through. She had been affected by the disorder in every aspect. 'She was partially sighted and couldn’t hear properly, she had difficulty walking and her arms weren’t strong. She had a hard life. She just didn’t let the illness beat her but it did in the end.' The hearing at Preston was told Mandy was 11-years-old when her eyelids began to droop. After a routine eye test at secondary school it led to her being referred to hospital where she was diagnosed with Mitochondrial Disease two years later. The disorder - which affects the body’s energy supply - began to affect her speech, hearing and movement and other symptoms included poor growth and muscle weakness. A week after her 21st birthday she was fitted with a pacemaker after suffering from collapsing episodes and went on to develop epilepsy. Strength: She stood up to bullies by walking the same route to the youth centre where she volunteered . In the latter months of her life she was having difficulty getting in and out of the bath and on the day of her death, Mr Gandy decided to check on her. He told the hearing: 'I had gone out of the house and came back, I went out of the house for five minutes at the most. 'I came back and decided to go upstairs to see if she was okay because I had been out for a minute. 'I opened the door and she was lying there in the bath underneath the water on her back, her arms were by her side as though she had just slipped down. Hearing: The inquest in Preston found Miss Shepherd died as a result of her illness, which she was diagnosed with at the age of 13 . 'There was no water anywhere else in the bathroom. There was no evidence she had tried to get out or and there was no water splashed.' Consultant Tim Dawson who carried out a post mortem ruled out that Mandy had drowned and offered a cause of death of natural causes, Mitochondrial Cytopathy with Kearns-Sayre Syndrome. He said: 'I suggest a catastrophic event has taken place leading to cardio respiratory arrest. Whatever happened happened whilst she was in the water. 'When she went under the water she wasn’t breathing. She died and just slipped under the water.' Coroner Mr Simon Jones said: 'This could have happened absolutely anywhere'","Mandy Shepherd, from Preston, Lancashire, had Mitochondrial Disease .

Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith hailed the 'fundamental shift' in the benefits system . Labour signalled an embarrassing climbdown over welfare reform yesterday, as the biggest ever shake-up in the benefits system got under way. In a surprise move, shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne indicated his party now backed the introduction of the new universal credit system, designed to ensure it always pays for people on benefits to go back to work or accept extra hours. Labour voted against the scheme when it was debated by Parliament last year. But yesterday Mr Byrne said the universal credit system was a ‘fine idea’, albeit one with some details still to be ironed out. Shadow employment minister Stephen Timms also said the scheme was a ‘sensible’ idea which would ‘potentially simplify’ the benefits system. The climbdown came as the huge change was launched yesterday with a modest pilot scheme in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. Fresh claimants will be required to sign up to the new system, which will see them receive a single benefit payment linked to their income. Ministers believe the system will make it much easier for people to see that they would be better off in employment. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith hailed the new system as ‘nothing less than the start of a fundamental cultural shift of the welfare system’. He dismissed Labour claims that the system was suffering from delays, insisting it would be rolled out in full by 2017 as planned. But the tiny scale of the pilot scheme suggests ministers have been warned the system is likely to suffer numerous teething problems before it is extended to handle millions of benefits claims. Universal credit will replace a string of working age benefits – including jobseekers’ allowance, working tax credits and housing benefit – into a single monthly payment. Ministers had once suggested that as many as a million claimants could be on the new system in the first 12 months. But the pilot scheme, which will run for six months, is expected to handle about 7,000 claims. The Universal Credit is being rolled out to Jobcentres from today (file picture) The new scheme has been dogged by . persistent reports of problems with the complex IT system needed to . ensure millions of benefit recipients receive the right amount of money. Mr Duncan Smith also rejected . criticism that the system, which has to be accessed online, would be too . difficult for some benefit claimants. He said extra help would be given to . the 20 per cent of benefit claimants who do not use the internet, adding . that computer skills were essential for anyone looking for a job. ‘Ninety-six per cent of all jobs now require some kind of computer . interface, so that means if you cannot go onto a computer you will only . be able to apply for 4 per cent of the jobs in Britain. Labour said the new system was . causing ‘confusion and delay’.

Europe's billion-euro Herschel observatory has stopped working, ending three years of observation of the cool Universe, it was announced yesterday. Instruments on The European Space Agency's (ESA) flagship observatory have warmed to levels that mean it is now 'blind'. The demise of Herschel was expected by astronomers as stores of liquid helium that are vital to keeping the temperature close to absolute zero have finally been exhausted. The Herschel space observatory, pictured over a background image of Vela C star-forming region, has stopped working after three years observing the coolest regions of the Universe . Herschel took thousands of images, including this magnificent picture of the Andromeda galaxy . After 35,000 scientific observations, ESA staff say Herschel has left behind a 'treasure trove of data'. The pioneering observatory was launched in May, 2009, and studied . the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies in a mission to discover . how the Universe came to be. At the time of its launch, Herschel . held 2,300 litres of liquid helium but that has slowly been evaporating . over the past three years. Astronomers confirmed it had . finally run out at the start of the spacecraft's daily . communication with the ground station in Western Australia. The timing of its demise was accurately predicted by experts. Professor Alvaro Giménez Cañete, . ESA’s director of Science and Robotic Exploration, said: 'Herschel has . exceeded all expectations, providing us with an incredible treasure . trove of data that that will keep astronomers busy for many years to . come.'

Made 35,000 scientific observations and amassed more than 25,000 hours of data. The space observatory will be sent into permanent orbit around the Sun. Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel, the discoverer of the infrared spectrum and planet Uranus, and his sister and collaborator Caroline Herschel. Herschel carried the largest and most powerful infrared telescope ever flown in space and its  primary mirror was 3.5metres in diameter - one and a half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope. Its telescope captured thousands of . images of star-forming regions and was able to shine through obstacles . that block visible light. Göran Pilbratt, ESA’s Herschel . Project scientist, said the telescope had given new insight into the . secret workings of the Universe. He said: 'Herschel has offered us a new view of the hitherto . hidden Universe, pointing us to a previously unseen process of star . birth and galaxy formation, and allowing us to trace water through the . Universe from molecular clouds to newborn stars and their planet-forming . discs and belts of comets.' Thomas Passvogel, ESA’s Herschel . Programme manager, added: 'Herschel’s ground-breaking scientific haul is . in no little part down to the excellent work done by European industry, . institutions and academia in developing, building and operating the . observatory and its instruments.' In a demonstration of Herschel's . work, the ESA released images taken of the Andromeda galaxy showing cool . lanes of forming stars in the finest detail yet. The unparalleled power of its . infrared telescope meant it could capture infrared light from some of . the coolest areas of the Universe, allowing astronomers a glimpse of . these regions for the first time.

Insurance premiums are expected to fall as ministers attempt to halt the gravy train for ‘ambulance-chasing’ lawyers. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will say today it is time to ‘turn the tide on Britain’s compensation culture’ as he sets out reforms designed to slash rip-off legal fees and prevent insurers, claims firms and garages selling on details of accident victims. So-called ‘referral fees’ are being banned, and the fees lawyers can make from processing basic claims for minor injuries suffered in road accidents will be cut by more than half from £1,200 to £500. The Government is also imposing new limits on what lawyers can earn from controversial ‘no win, no fee’ cases. Experts predict a 10 to 15 per cent drop in motoring premiums over the next 12 months as the changes take effect. The existing system has pushed up legal costs and damages, and is blamed for a boom in whiplash injury claims, making car cover more expensive for all. Ministers say it has also forced up insurance premiums in other areas, leaving schools, community groups and local authorities fearful of staging events and activities. Mr Grayling told the Daily Mail: ‘We are turning the tide on the compensation culture. It’s pushing up the cost of insurance, and making it more expensive to drive a car or organise an event. It’s time the whole system was rebalanced.’ Referral fees were legalised in 2004 by the last Labour government, leading to a boom in the claims management industry. The cost of personal injury claims doubled to £14billion in ten years. Police, insurance companies, unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms have been accused of conspiring to profit from unsuspecting members of the public. Fees are paid to claims management companies, garages and insurance firms which provide details of accidents to personal injury lawyers in a business estimated to have been worth £3billion a year. Claims managers then bombard . motorists with texts and phone calls offering to help them to pursue . compensation claims for alleged injuries. The . practice of referral fees has also left many hospitals, local councils . and businesses with large legal bills. Personal injury work is worth . around £1.8billion a year for solicitors, while the NHS is paying more . than £1billion a year in damages. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, which has just come into effect, prohibits payment and receipt of referral fees in personal injury cases by solicitors, claims management companies and insurers. Claims firms are also being banned from offering upfront cash incentives or other gifts to those who bring cases to them. Mr Grayling said that fees in ‘no win, no fee’ cases in the civil courts would also be limited. Previously, it has been possible to claim a ‘success fee’ on top of damages from defendants, often doubling what lawyers earn. Now, defendants will have to pay only the damages and the lawyer’s basic fee. From July, Mr Grayling said, a system used to settle payouts for road accidents quickly and simply without expensive court cases will be extended to also include claims for accidents at work and in public places. The so-called ‘claims portal’ will also start handling claims up to the value of £25,000, up from £10,000 now. The minister also promised action to crack down on the spiralling number of whiplash claims. The Ministry of Justice has consulted on proposals to set up independent medical panels to improve injury assessment and allow the more questionable claims to be more easily challenged in court by insurers. Simon Douglas, director of AA Insurance, said: ‘The reforms should go some way towards bringing “no win, no fee” type whiplash injury claims under control and will thus reduce the costs of claims.’","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to ‘turn the tide on Britain’s compensation culture’

Older versions of Apple products - including the iPhone 4 and the iPad and iPad 2 3G models - have been banned in the U.S. after an official ruling claimed the devices breach Samsung patents. The devices are assembled in China and because the ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington bans imports of affected Apple products into America, these devices could be removed from the shelves as early as August. Apple has been given 60 days to stop selling the products but is appealing the decision, which ruled that Apple copied Samsung's 3G technology in its devices. Banned: The iPhone 4, seen here on the right, along with the older model, the 3GS on the left, cannot be imported to the U.S. anymore, a trade panel ruled Tuesday . Apple initially sued Samsung in April 2011 for infringing seven utility patents, three design patents, three registered trade dresses and six trademarked icons with its Galaxy line of products, including the Galaxy S smartphone and the Galaxy Tab tablet. Samsung responded later that month by suing Apple for infringing five patents in South Korea, two in Japan and three in Germany. The companies have then continued to sue and countersue each other since. This latest ruling from the US Trade Commission on Tuesday actually overturned a previous ruling in the same case which claimed Apple hadn't breached patents. The new ruling followed an appeal by Samsung and is considered a 'final' ruling, although Apple can appeal and President Obama could overturn it. In a separate patent dispute in US federal court last year, Samsung was ordered to pay £652m ($1bn) for patent infringement, an award that was later slashed to £390m ($598.9m). Samsung then won a patent dispute on the Galaxy Tab against Apple in the UK in October. Judge Colin Birss stated that Samsung's tablets were 'not as cool' as the Apple's, and 'do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design.' All import bans also have to be validated by President Obama and he has 60 days to invalidate the order. The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington issued the final ruling on Tuesday in one Samsung's suits against Apple. The panel issued a limited import ban and . a cease-and-desist order for AT&T models of the iPhone 4, iPhone . 3GS, iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G. The versions targeted are more than a year . old but are still solid sellers, Reuters reported. Samsung and Apple are engaged in a global legal battle over their smartphones, with Apple arguing that Samsung and its Android phones copy vital features of the iPhone. Samsung is fighting back with its own complaints. The iPhone 4 was launched in 2010 and is the oldest iPhone still being made. It's the second bad court ruling for Apple in as many weeks. A preliminary class settlement which agrees to pay $53 million in refunds to iPhone and iPod Touch customers for voiding their warranties was filed on Tuesday by Apple Inc in the District Court of Northern California in San Francisco. The settlement would refund up to $200 to each customer who was denied repairs or replacement under warranty of their iPhone or iPod because a small red strip located on the outside of the device indicated that they had been in contact with water. Not for sale: The ruling also states the iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G cannot be imported as well because they violate a patent held by Samsung . Jeffrey Fazio, an attorney representing two of the four representatives of the class action, told ABC News that Apple refused to honor standard warranties and AppleCare Protection Plans if a white indicator strip near the headphone or charging jacks had turned pink or red. But 3M,the company that makes the strip (called 'Liquid Submersion Indicators') said humidity alone could have caused the color of strips to turn pink or even red. This meant that a customer who took an iPhone or iPad for repair would have their warranty voided if the liquid indicator strip was red - even if it had never been in contact with water.","Apple's iPhone models and 4 and 3GS and iPad 3G and iPad 2 3G cannot be imported into the U.S. because they violate patents of rival Samsung .

"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 30 April 2013 . Google is trying to upstage Siri, the sometimes droll assistant that answers questions and helps people manage their lives on Apple's iPhone and iPad. The duel begins Monday with the release of a free iPhone and iPad app that features Google Now, a technology that performs many of the same functions as Siri. It's the first time that Google Now has been available on smartphones and tablet computers that aren't running on the latest version of Google's Android software. Google Now on the iPhone and iPad - the new app, launched today, will compete with Apple's Siri . Smartphones and tablet computers running Google's free Android software have been steadily expanding their market share in recent years, partly because they tend to be less expensive than the iPhone and iPad. At the end of 2012, Android devices held about 69 percent of the smartphone market while iOS held about 19 percent, according to the research firm IDC. The technology, which debuted nine months ago, is being included in an upgrade to Google's search application for iOS, the Apple Inc. software that powers the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. It's up to each user to decide whether to activate Google Now within the redesigned search app. Google Now's invasion of Siri's turf marks Google Inc.'s latest attempt to lure iPhone and iPad users away from a service that Apple built into its own devices. Google quickly won over millions of iPhone users in December when it released a mapping application to replace the navigation system that Apple dumped when it redesigned iOS last fall. Apple's maps application proved to be inferior to Google's ousted service. The app's bugs and glitches made Apple the butt of jokes and fueled demand for Google to develop a new option. Apple has been losing to Google on other fronts in a rapidly growing mobile computing market, an arena that was revolutionized with the iPhone's release in 2007. Smartphones and tablet computers running Google's free Android software have been steadily expanding their market share in recent years, partly because they tend to be less expensive than the iPhone and iPad. Apple's Siri personal assistant offer similar services, and is integrated into the iPhone and iPad . At the end of 2012, Android devices held about 69 percent of the smartphone market while iOS held about 19 percent, according to the research firm IDC. Android's success has been particularly galling for Apple because its late CEO Steve Jobs believed Google stole many of its ideas for the software from the iPhone. That led to a series of court battles over alleged patent infringement, including a high-profile trial last year that culminated in Apple winning hundreds of millions in damages from Samsung Electronics, the top seller of Android phones. That dispute is still embroiled in appeals. The rise of Android also is squeezing Apple's profit margins, and has contributed to a 40 percent drop in the company's stock price since it peaked at $705.07 last September around the time that the iPhone 5 came out. Android's popularity is good news for Google because the company's services are built into most versions of the operating system. That brings more traffic to Google services, creating more opportunities for the company to sell ads - the main source of Google's revenue. Siri is billed by Apple as an 'intelligent feature' Since the technology's release in October 2011, Apple has made it a centerpiece of some marketing campaigns that depict Siri and its automated female voice as an endearing and occasionally even pithy companion. When asked for an opinion about Google Now, Siri responded: 'If it's all the same to you, I'd rather Google later.' Google believes its Siri counterpart is smarter because Google Now is designed to learn about a user's preferences and then provide helpful information before it's even asked to do so. The technology draws upon information that Google gleans from search requests other interactions with the company's other services. Knowing a person's location also helps Google Now serve up helpful information without being asked. 'This concept of predicting your needs and showing you them at the right time is unique to Google Now,' said Baris Gultekin, Google Now's director of product management. Lined up for battle: Apple's current iPhone 5 software, called iOS, is expected to receive a major overhaul in June . 'We want computers to do the hard work so our users can focus on what matters to them so they can get on with their lives.' If the technology is working right, Google Now is supposed to do things like automatically tell people what the local weather is like when they awaken to help decide what to wear and provide a report on traffic conditions for the commute to work. During the day, Google Now might provide an update on the score of a user's favorite sports team or a stock quote of a company in a user's investment portfolio. On a Friday evening, Google Now might offer suggestions for movies to see or other weekend events tailored to a user's interests. For international travelers, Google Now might provide currency conversion rates, language translations of common phrases and the time back home. Most of this automatic information is provided in summaries that Google calls 'cards.' Like Siri, Google Now also is equipped with voice technology that allows it to respond to questions and interact with users, though it hasn't shown the wit that amuses some of Siri's users. The Google Now app for iOS isn't as comprehensive as the Android app, which only works on devices running on the latest version of Android - known as 'Jelly Bean.' Some of the Android features missing from Google Now's iOS app include cards for showing airline boarding passes and movie tickets bought though online vendor Fandango. Both of those options are available on the iOS through Apple's built-in Passbook feature that's designed to be a digital wallet. Google vs Apple: The move is the latest in a long running battle for smartphone supremacy . Google Now's expansion on to the iOS underscores Google's ambitions for the service. The company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., views it as a pivotal tool in its effort to peer deeper into its users' brains. In doing so, Google believes it will be able to provide more useful services and also show more relevant ads. For Google Now to become more intuitive, it needs to widen its availability. 'The more you use Google Now, we will have a better chance of understanding what your needs are and providing you with the right information,' Gultekin said. 'It's a virtuous cycle.' Gultekin declined to discuss whether there are plans to make Google Now apps for mobile devices running on Microsoft's Windows system. He also refused to comment on speculation circulating in technology blogs that a Web version of Google Now will be offered as a replacement for iGoogle, a tool that allows people to encircle the Google search engine with a variety of services suited to their tastes. IGoogle is scheduled to close in November.","Google launches Google Now service for iPhone and iPad .

Many humans worry about finding their first grey hairs, but for one type of baby monkey, a distinguished grey coat replaces its fiery fur before it has its first birthday. One wildlife photographer has captured the transformation of an adorable baby silver-leaf langur as its fur changes from vivid orange to grown up grey in central Malaysia. There are a number of theories as to why the creatures are born with such bright fur and they include keeping them safe from predators, stopping them getting separated from their mothers and even sending out a signal to the rest of the troop that they should start to think about childcare duties. Scroll down for video . One photographer has captured the transformation of an adorable baby Silver-leaf langur as its fur changes from bright orange to grown up grey in central Malaysia . There are three main theories: . Professional photographer Thomas Marent, 47, got up close with the animals to capture a baby clinging to his mother in Kuala Selangor Nature Park, Malaysia. The young animals' fur begins to change to grey starting with its head so that for a short period of time it looks quite strange with only its body a bright orange. Adult monkeys have grey-tipped black fur that gives them a uniform silvery appearance as well as a distinctive crest of fur that runs along the top of their head and tufts of hair on their cheeks that obscure their ears. The baby langurs are born with orange fur and turn to silver at approximately three months of age, although some can begin their transformation aged just one month, according to Beth McDonald, a senior keeper at the San Diego Zoo. Writing on the zoo's blog, she said there are three main theories as to why the animals are born bright orange. It is thought that the baby langur's vivid fur makes it easy for their mother to find them, as the young monkeys love to explore. Baby Silver-leaf langurs are born with orange . fur and turn to silver at approximately three months of age, starting with their heads (pictured left), although . some can begin their transformation aged just one month. Their fur gradually becomes darker (pictured right) until their bodies turn grey too . According to the keeper, the babies are intrepid and can venture a little too far from their mothers, but their fur allows them to be found easily. Another theory is that their orange colour helps the babies blend into their surroundings. 'It seems hard to believe that bright orange could be used as camouflage, . unless maybe the orange would make them appear as a bright-colored . flower on a tree. Most predators are colour blind and cannot tell the . difference between orange and green,' she said. Here, the young Silver-leaf langur has almost lost its orange fur - although it is still possible to see some patches on its back . Another theory is their orange colouring makes it obvious that there is a baby monkey in the troop so other adults should start to share the care of the infant. 'A baby . langur can wear a mother out, so having a troop full of babysitters . allows her to rest. The babysitters can also relieve the mother so she . can get something to eat,' wrote Ms McDonald. Silver-leaf langurs live in coastal and mangrove forests in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo and travel in groups of between nine and 40 individuals, with one adult male and a group of females caring for the babies of the troop. They rarely leave the trees, which keep them largely safe from ground-dwelling predators such as leopards and tigers. During the day they travel around 500 metres - some in all female sub groups - but congregate in a single tree to sleep over night. Female silver-leaf langurs typically give birth once every 18 months to two years and a female attract a mate by shaking her head from side to side. Females give birth to a single baby after a gestation period of between 181 and 200 days and the babies are born measuring around 20 centimetres with a strong grip so they can cling to their mother. There are three main theories about why baby Silver-leaf langur's are born with bright orange fur (pictured) but one is that it makes it easier for its mother to find when the infant goes exploring in the forest. Females look after the baby animals collectively . While the baby's fur rapidly changes colour from orange to grey, it does not reach the adult pattern for three to five months after birth. The creatures are classified as 'near threatened' as their natural habitats are being destroyed by logging and the development of oil plantations, while people also hunt them for meat and keep them as pets.","A wildlife photographer has captured .

She was also forced to carry out all the menial chores in the £300,000 house, including cooking, cleaning, sewing, washing and ironing.

Yesterday, after two trials spanning six months and an investigation costing over £4million, Ashar and his wife Tallat, 67, were facing jail after they were convicted of trafficking for exploitation and benefit fraud. Ashar was separately convicted of 13 charges of rape. His wife was cleared of a charge of assault. The girl, who is now 20 and has five brothers and a sister living in Pakistan, recalls meeting the Ashars there and putting her thumbprint on a document believed to be her passport. She arrived in the UK on June 24, 2000, with her passport saying she was 19. She was given free board and lodgings with the Ashars and was initially given gifts such as bracelets. But then she was asked to work and began packing football shirts and mobile phone covers to sell on market stalls before becoming the couple’s personal domestic slave at the home in Eccles, Manchester. For up to nine years, she slept on a concrete floor in the cellar and was regularly berated about her work. The girl spent 49 days reliving her nightmare – a record number of days for a victim of rape in the British judicial system. She gave her testimony by video link in a private room. She was accompanied throughout by two interpreters who had to translate in both sign language and in Urdu. They in-turn were monitored by two other interpreters in the room while a language expert was sat in court. The Ashars also had an interpreter. Their victim told Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester: ‘I was sad and weak because I was working so hard. I had to clean all the time and that was it – that was my life. I’d cook and clean for hours.’ Lights in the cellar would be flicked on and off when her captors needed her. ‘The lady got angry because I was making too much noise, but I wouldn’t know I was making noise. ‘I would be sitting in there crying for hours and hours, sitting alone.’ Property: The Victorian house in Cromwell Road, Salford, where the victim was beaten and forced to carry out household chores .

Neglect: Carly Harper, 24, died after staff failed to act quickly over a serious infection, her parents claim . A mother and her unborn son both died because inexperienced hospital staff failed to provide urgent treatment after a scan showed the baby was dying, her parents have claimed. Carly Harper, 24, was five months pregnant with her first child when her waters broke on May 17 last year. She went to hospital and two days later developed a serious infection and was sweaty with a fluctuating temperature, key symptoms of septic shock. She told staff at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, she was in pain on the morning of May 19, apparently indicating her contractions had started early. At 3.15pm on May 19, when an utlrasound scan showed Miss Harper’s baby boy was dying, doctors chose to induce the birth. But her family claim staff delayed inducing the labour and did not act quickly enough over signs that Miss Harper had a severe infection. It was not until 9.28pm that evening – more than six hours after the scan – that she gave birth to the stillborn boy. She was taken straight to intensive care and placed on a ventilator, but died of multiple organ failure at 9.10am the next day with her family at her bedside. Her distraught parents Robert, 59, and Christine, 53, have now hired solicitors to investigate the hospital, claiming that neither clinicians or nurses knew what to do and disagreed about treatment. They allege that staff were negligent and that this led to the death of their daughter and her child, which she was expecting with boyfriend Alex Dearden. Miss Harper had already been into hospital a month before her death to have a procedure which would prevent her going into premature labour, but it was unsuccessful. Speaking after an inquest was opened into her death, her father, 59, said: ‘How can it be that a healthy, young pregnant woman can go into hospital and for neither she nor her baby to see the light of day again?' Death: An ultrasound image of the baby boy, who was stillborn in May last year . He described how Miss Harper called . him on the day she went into hospital and told him that things did not . look good but he should stay at home. At 1.30am, she called again and said “you better get here fast”’ ‘When I saw Carly in the ICU my first words were ""my god, what have they done to her."" I just couldn’t understand what had happened. 'We were all talking to Carly; trying to encourage her to stay with us but she just wasn’t responding. Seeing your daughter like that is absolutely devastating. 'I just couldn’t understand what had happened. We were all talking to Carly, trying to encourage her to stay with us but she just wasn’t responding.

All we could do was watched as she drifted away from us and then, that morning, she was gone.’ The father of Miss Harper, pictured, said: 'My family and I are still suffering. All summer I tried to bottle it up' Mr Harper, a banker from Heswall, . Merseyside, has not worked since July last year after he was diagnosed with depression over his daughter's death, his solicitor said. He said he believes staff could have done far more to save . Miss Harper and his grandchild. ‘It . was as if the junior staff were left alone to deal with it,’ he said. ‘We witnessed a complete lack of leadership and staff appeared unwilling . to step in to take responsibility for Carly’s treatment. ‘It felt like someone had pulled the rug from under us.

One 24-year-old can tell you exactly what the iconic children’s book character experienced. Abigail Moss suffers from Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS), a rare disorder which affects her sense of vision and perception, causing objects to seemingly grow and shrink around her. She realised that she had the condition, after seeing it feature in an episode of the hit television series ‘House’ and reading about it in a newspaper supplement. Scroll down for video . Abigail Moss, 24, has Alice in Wonderland Syndrome which causes her to feel as though her body is growing and the room she is in is shrinking around her . The disorder, which is named after the classic 1865 novel by Lewis Carroll, causes patients to experience similar symptoms to those Alice suffers when she consumes liquid which causes her to shrink. Ms Moss, the deputy editor of popular website PlanetIvy.com, started to experience the strange hallucinations at the age of five. She said: ‘When I was younger, I would suffer from attacks almost every other day and that was quite scary. What made it worse was that nobody knew what it was.’ AIWS attacks can happen anywhere and at any time and last for about twenty minutes. Ms Moss, whose father also experienced similar hallucinations, said: ‘An attack gradually builds up on you. You feel like the room is shrinking in on you and that your body’s becoming larger. ‘Your arms and legs start to feel longer. Things look further away or seem smaller than they are. Everything feels exaggerated and movements feel faster and sudden. Ms Moss started experiencing the hallucinations when she was five. As a child she had them most days but now it only happens a few times a year . Image shows a drawing of Alice in Wonderland. Ms Moss said: 'An attack gradually builds up on you. You feel like the room is shrinking in on you and that your body's becoming larger.' ‘It feels exactly how Alice did in the book - the way everything feels big or small and strangely out of proportion. I guess that’s why the syndrome’s named after it.’ Ms Moss, from Bath, saw six psychologists - one of whom wrongly assumed she had epilepsy and another who told her that she would ‘outgrow it’ - before she was diagnosed with the syndrome last year. ‘I read about AIWS in a small column in a newspaper and thought “Oh my god, that’s what I have!”. Afterwards I started researching it more online and I then happened to watch an episode of House in which a patient was thought to have the disorder. For years doctors were unable to establish what was wrong with Ms Moss. One thought she was epileptic while another said she would 'outgrow it' Ms Moss was only diagnosed after seeing the condition featured on an episode of the hit television series 'House' (pictured) ‘I rang my dad and we couldn’t believe . that the weird thing we had both suffered from was a real thing and had a . name. Doctors had been baffled by me for years.’ After discovering her disorder, Ms Moss went online to discuss her experiences and received numerous responses from fellow AIWS sufferers across the globe. Her condition has since improved and now only experiences attacks around five times a year, most frequently when she’s about to sleep. She said: ‘Much more research should be done into Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. I don’t think it’s as rare as most psychologists seem to believe. Ms Moss says she was amazed when she learnt her condition was a medically recognised syndrome . Ms Moss said: 'Much more research should be done into Alice in . Wonderland Syndrome. I don't think it's as rare as most psychologists . seem to believe' ‘I’ve spoken to sufferers from around the world and in some cases, their condition genuinely disturbs their lives.’ A spokesperson for AIWS Info, a resource for people with the disorder, said: ‘There is, as yet, no proven effective treatment for Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. ‘AIWS is sometimes a frightening condition for the sufferer. If you suffer from it, please be assured that the symptoms themselves do not indicate that you are ‘going mad’ or have anything serious wrong with you.’ Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is a set of symptoms including the alteration of body image and the alteration of visual perception. It makes the sufferer feel as though parts of their body are changing size and as though the sizes of objects are changing. Other symptoms include the feeling that time is moving too quickly or too slowly, a feeling that the ground is spongy under the feet and a distorted perception of sound. It is most common in children but some people also experience it later in life. Symptoms most commonly occur at night. The cause is not know but the syndrome is thought to be associated with migraines, epilepsy and glandular fever. There is currently no known treatment for AIWS other than to look for an underlying cause that can be treated.

Computer games might be more realistic than ever before with budgets and special effects compatible to blockbuster movies, but children and teenagers of the 80s and 90s still have a soft spot for the Super Mario Bros. Now they can re-live their childhood as a 1980s version of the popular game is available to play online for free. The website, fullscreenmario.com, created by Josh Goldberg, lets users worth through levels as well as skip to favourites, as well as build their own levels from scratch. The website allows individuals to make their own levels using the classic blocks, green pipes and scenery. Here, Mail Online has had a quick go at laying out the beginning of a level. While it is easy to place objects, it is harder to imagine how to create a really great level that is difficult but not impossible to play! 'Full Screen Mario' allows gamers to play the original Mario Bros. in HTML 5, which works best using the Chrome browser, according to the website. Fans can systematically work their way through the game, much like they would have done years ago on a Game Boy or NES, or skip to a specific level that they were perhaps unable to reach when they were younger - which means no using up hard-earned lives battling villains at the end of a collection of levels. But best of all for Nintendo fans who thought they could come up with the ultimate level, the website allows individuals to make their own using the classic blocks, green pipes and scenery such as the distinctive bushes and bubbly clouds. Super Mario Bros was first released in 1985 in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Europe in 1987. The game has been highly influential and popularised the side-scrolling genre seen in many platform games. These are more modern versions of Mario and Luigi . Gamers can add characters, including 'koopa troupers' and mushrooms and save their levels as text files on their computer. Now that the old game is easily accessible again it is available to a new younger audience, although it may not prove popular to generations that have grown up with 3D graphics.

Prime Minister David Cameron described the proposed 11% pay hike as 'unthinkable' An obligatory £7,600 pay rise is expected to be given to MPs this week – despite the furious objections of all three party leaders. The Commons pay watchdog is expected to cause public outrage by pressing ahead with an 11 per cent hike, which David Cameron previously described as ‘unthinkable’. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will sign off on an increase in MPs’ salaries from £66,396 to £74,000 – and try to defuse criticism by toughening its crackdown on perks such as taxis and hotels. But even though Nick Clegg has said that MPs should decide themselves whether to take the increase, and Ed Miliband has vowed to cancel it if he wins the next Election, the watchdog made clear last night that MPs would not be able to turn down the rise. ‘It is automatic,’ a source explained. ‘If they want to, they can give it to a stray cats home, that’s up to them.’ Under the system set up in response to the expenses scandal, MPs no longer have the right to vote on – or veto – what IPSA recommends. The watchdog first floated the idea of the rise in July, saying it should take effect at the start of the next Parliament in 2015. Mr Clegg said at the time that people would find it ‘impossible to understand’ when living standards were being ‘remorselessly squeezed’, while Mr Miliband said that if he became Prime Minister he would limit the wage increase to one per cent, which amounts to about £660 a year. However, after a four-month consultation – including about 200 responses from MPs – IPSA is expected to throw down the gauntlet by sticking to its recommendation of an increase. To limit the fallout, IPSA is likely to propose that the £4.6 million cost of the increase is offset by an intensification of its crackdown on perks. That would include less generous . pensions, lower payoffs when MPs lose their seats and tight restrictions . on free taxis, evening meal allowances and hotel stays – unless they . are booked very late at night. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said people would find the rise 'impossible to understand' at a time when most are being 'remorselessly squeezed' Asked last night whether Mr Cameron would order his MPs to give up the rise, a senior Conservative source would only say: ‘The Prime Minister has been clear he is committed to reducing the cost of politics and that there should be restraint.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘Any rise in MPs’ pay must be considered in the light of the current economic climate and the cost-of-living crisis facing people across the country,’ while Lib Dem sources suggested a review of the pay hike by IPSA after the Election. However, Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, backed a pay increase – though he questioned elements of the perks crackdown. ‘IPSA is an independent body which will come to its own decision on pay,’ said Mr Walker. ‘But the job of the MP requires them to work away from home and it is important that they should be able to travel safely after a late vote.’ Deputy Speaker and Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle called for party leaders to stay out of the process. Mr Hoyle said the new system, whereby an independent body ruled on allowances, had to be respected. He said: ‘I agree that MPs should not vote on their own pay. It should be left to an independent body. It’s not in the gift of the party leaders.’ IPSA declined to comment.","Hike will see MPs' annual salary rise from £66,396 to £74,000 .

Two men ended up nursing their wounds after the man they tried to rob turned out to be a cage fighter. Dean Maundrell and Michael Bennett attempted to ambush Lewis Hawkins, 24, as he returned from a session at the gym. But he fought back, repeatedly punching Bennett, 27, and ignoring 25-year-old Maundrell's empty threat that he was carrying a gun. Wrong target: Dean Maundrell (left) and Michael Bennett (right) were jailed after trying to mug Lewis Hawkins, who was on the way back from a gym session in Swindon . Mr Hawkins then stood guard over Bennett as neighbours called the police and Maundrell fled, only to be caught later by CCTV footage. Will Woodman, defending at Swindon Crown Court, said: 'They came up against the last person they should want to come up against - a cage fighter who knows how to look after himself.' The court heard how Mr Hawkins saw two men loitering in the unlit car . park when Maundrell shouted 'Oi mate, what’s the time? I’m not from . Swindon' and then grabbed his arm. Bennett appeared and the two men stood over him as he tried to get out of his Honda Civic. Maundrell demanded 'Give me what you’ve got' and reached into Mr Hawkins’ pocket and grabbed his car keys. Area: Lews Hawkins was attacked in a car park near Cross Street in Swindon . Bennett then took a swing at his intended victim but missed and was punched in the face in return. The fighter went to walk away but the pair decided to continue in a second round with him. Maundrell . tripped Mr Hawkins and jumped on him and tried to punch him - but the . fitter man blocked the blows before getting free. Tara . Wolfe, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Bennett made an effort to punch him again . but the complainant punched back and Mr Bennett fell. 'Mr Maundrell got in the car and tried to start it. Mr Bennett went over to the car and was described as leaning all over it. No choice: Judge Euan Ambrose told the pair the offenses were so serious they demanded a custodial sentence . 'In order to protect the car Mr Hawkins punched Mr Bennett in the face again, causing him to fall to the floor.' The cage fighter then dragged Maundrell out of his car and as he did so the thug shouted 'I’ve got a gun, I’ve got a gun,' to which Mr Hawkins replied 'Well get it out and shoot'. Maundrell then said 'I’m going to blast you' but, when the victim told him to give him his keys, he threw them and fled. Bennett hid behind a set of bins and Mr Hawkins told him to stay there until the police, who had been called by neighbours, arrived. He was arrested soon after and found with a lock knife in his pocket. Maundrell was caught a couple of months later when CCTV footage showed him close to the scene and he was picked out in an ID parade. The hapless pair, both from Swindon, admitted robbery. Bennett denied possessing a bladed article but was found guilty at trial. At the time, Maundrell was under a curfew for an earlier offence. Jane Malcolm, defending Maundrell, said he had been drinking heavily and could recall little of the incident. She said: 'As a result of excess alcohol he has behaved like a drunken lout. At the time he was at a low place in his life.' Will Woodman, for Bennett, said the men had been drinking all afternoon and had been thrown out of a nearby pub before the incident. Judge Euan Ambrose told the pair: 'These offences are so serious that in each of your cases only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.' Maundrell was jailed for 27 months and Bennett received a 20-month sentence.","Lewis Hawkins, 24, had returned from a gym session when he was targeted .

The group created the wrapping paper in an effort to reduce the problem of waste it creates during the holiday season. Last year, it was estimated that 227,000 miles of wrapping paper went to waste in the UK alone - enough to wrap the world nine times. Each 27 inch by 17 inch sheet has around 700 seeds nestled in rows between layers of tissue paper embossed to hold them in place .

The seeds are in rows down the paper to create a row of vegetables in group. The paper is 100 per cent biodegradable, no glue is used and even the ink is made from vegetables. ‘The paper comes in five varieties of vegetable and we're looking to expand it to include herbs, fruit and wild flowers,’ said Mr Venios. ‘It's cheaper than luxury wrapping paper and it's almost like giving a person a second present in the form of a plant.’ The paper is 100 per cent biodegradable, no glue is used and even the ink is made from vegetables .","Wrapping paper was created in an effort to reduce waste over Christmas .

But repeated exposure to this news can also make you immune to a foul state of mind. This is according to research at Tel Aviv University which suggests frequent coverage of a negative event makes you numb to sadness. Repeated exposure to bad news could also make you immune a foul mood, according to research at Tel Aviv University . ‘A bad mood is known to slow cognition,’ said Dr Moshe Shay Ben-Haim, who led the study. ‘We show that, counter intuitively, you can avoid getting into a bad mood in the first place by dwelling on a negative event.' He added that if you look at a negative headline before work, it's better to read the article all the way through. By repeatedly exposing yourself to the negative information, 'you will be freer to go on with your day in a better mood and without any negative effects,' he said. The emotional Stroop effect refers to the phenomenon where people are faster in responding to the ink colour of neutral words than of negative ones .

This . could be because the negative words are either distracting or . threatening. The result is that fewer mental . resources are available to identify the ink colours. But the researchers at Tel Aviv University suggest that neither explanation appears to predict sustained effects. They suggest that exposure to negative words can lessen their impact with time. The researchers found, after being shown . the same negative word only twice, subjects were able to identify their . colour immediately. The researchers tested the theory using something known as the ‘Emotional Stroop Task’. The task involves showing a number of words and asking test subjects to name the colours that they are shown in. It usually takes people longer to identify the colours of negative words like ‘terrorism’ than of neutral words like ‘table.’ This could be because the negative words are either distracting or threatening. According to both theories, the result is that fewer mental resources are available to identify the ink colours. But the researchers at Tel Aviv University suggest that neither explanation appears to predict sustained effects. After the initial distraction or threat, people should be expected to return to identifying the ink colours of neutral words. But in a series of four experiments involving the Emotional Stroop Task, the researchers showed that these studies are biased by a quirk of the test's design. In most cases, people are shown four or five negative words, along with four or five neutral words, in the test 10 to 12 times. Researchers believe the negative words shown to people in the Emotional Stroop Task put them in a bad mood, but through repetition, the words lose their affective power . The researchers found, after being shown the same negative word only twice, subjects were able to identify their colour immediately. On the other hand, when people were shown the negative words just once, they name the ink colours of neutral words more slowly. Researchers believe the negative words shown to people in the Emotional Stroop Task put them in a bad mood, but through repetition, the words lose their affective power. The researchers' explanation was supported by a questionnaire administered to people after they completed the task. Those who had seen each negative word only once were put in a bad mood and suffered from sustained effects, while those who had seen the negative words repeatedly soon snapped out of the bad mood. The participants who were in a bad mood also took longer to complete the evaluating questionnaire. Researchers claim the study, published in Attention, Perception and Psychophysics, has broad implications for understanding our emotions.","Researchers used the 'Emotional Stroop Task' to demonstrate their theory .

Archaeologists in China have unearthed the skulls of more than 80 young women who may have been sacrificed more than 4,000 years ago. The skulls were found in what appears to have been a mass grave at the Shimao Ruins, the site of a neolithic stone city in the northern province of Shaanxi, China. The women's bodies were not present, suggesting they were victims of human sacrifice and experts believe they could even be related to the founding ceremony of the ancient city, according to state media.

Archaeologists in China have unearthed the skulls of more than 80 young women who may have been sacrificed more than 4,000 years ago, state media reported . The archaeologists believe the skulls were ‘likely to be related to the construction of the city wall’ in ‘ancient religious activities or foundation ceremonies, before construction began,' the official news agency Xinhua reported. There may have been an outbreak of mass violence or ethnic conflict in the region at the time since ‘ancient people were prone to use their enemies or captives as sacrifices,’ it added. The discovery is not the first instance of researchers unearthing remains related to human sacrifice in early China, Channel News Asia reported. Kings and emperors were regularly buried along with their servants and concubines, who were sometimes killed first and on other occasions buried alive. The Shimao Ruins cover more than four square kilometres and were discovered in 1976. The 80 skulls include 40 that the Shaanxi provincial government said had been discovered at the site last year. The government said the skulls were 'placed in a certain regular pattern but without obvious traces of hole pigging for placement'. The skulls were found in what appears to have been a mass grave at the Shimao Ruins, the site of a neolithic stone city in the northern province of Shaanxi, China . Sun Zhouyong, deputy head of the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology, told state broadcaster CCTV that the initial batch ‘show signs of being hit and burned’. ‘This collective burial might also have something to do with the founding ceremony of the city,’ he said. Archaeologists have found more than 100 remains of murals as well as large amounts of jadeware at the site of the ancient city, which sits in the Yellow River basin and is believed to date back to 2,000 BC. They also discovered the pieces of murals, some of which are still on the walls and are composed of geometric patterns in red, yellow, black and orange, with raw products sourced from local iron mines. The largest piece of mural measures around 30cm squared. In 2005 archaeologists at Hongjiang in the central province of Hunan found an altar devoted to human sacrifice as well as the skeleton of one victim. A separate altar was used for sacrificing animals at the 7,000-year-old site, which is believed to be the earliest human sacrificial site ever found in the country. The archaeologists believe the skulls were 'likely to be related to the construction of the city wall' in ancient religious activities or foundation ceremonies, before construction began.

It . adds: ‘Ensure the tone and content of all communications or dialogue is . respectful and non-blaming. The terminology used to describe the . person’s condition should respect individual preferences.’ GPs . and those running weight management programmes for the NHS should . ensure patients have a realistic view of what to expect when losing . weight, telling them there is no ‘magic bullet’. Instead, . obese patients should be advised of the importance of making gradual, . long-term changes to their eating habits and physical activity and how . much weight they might realistically expect to lose.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said . patients were often in denial and GPs should be sensitive – to start off . with. He said: ‘One . of the big problems we have is that primary care – GPs in particular – . have no real training about how to raise weight issues with patients. ‘The abrupt style that many have taken so far have only made matters worse. ‘NICE . is correct to say they should be moderate in their tone.

David Cameron is set to pack the House of Lords with more cronies and failed politicians despite the number of peers already approaching 1,000. Constitutional experts say that ennobling dozens of political allies and donors is ‘unsustainable’, but Government sources say that yet another list of appointments to the bloated second chamber is due. It has also emerged that the Lords has quietly loosened restrictions on its taxpayer-funded budget because of the costs associated with ‘increased attendance’. The upper house currently has 836 members – 200 more than the House of Commons – and all three main parties have called for it to be reduced. However, 30 more peers were appointed to the Lords in the summer, adding a further £1.2million a year to the costs met by the taxpayer. Government sources now say that the Prime Minister will unveil yet another list of appointments as part of a Coalition deal to drastically alter the make-up of the upper chamber. There are currently 216 Labour members, 208 Tories and 89 Lib Dems. The Coalition parties say that when they came to power in 2010 the chamber was unfairly dominated by Labour peers. None can be removed, so the Government says it needs to appoint scores of its own to shift the balance of power and help ensure the passage of legislation through Parliament. Baroness Royall, the Labour leader in the Lords, said there would be ‘great anger and dismay’ in the second chamber and the country as a whole if further appointments were made. Packed: Constitutional experts say that ennobling dozens of political allies and donors is 'unsustainable', but Government sources say that yet another list of appointments to the bloated second chamber is due . Labour peer Lord Grocott said the . last set of appointments in August had meant a ‘very, very substantial . increase in the Government’s majority within this House’.‘For that to be engineered half way through a Parliament is entirely without precedent,’ he added. With 836 members, the House of Lords is now the second biggest legislature in the world.Only the Chinese National People’s Congress, which has nearly 3,000 legislators, is bigger, but it nominally represents 1.3billion people.The Lords has overtaken the European Parliament, which has 766 MEPs, and long ago overshadowed the Commons, which has 650 MPs.The Electoral Reform Society says the Lords is ‘increasingly bloated’ and is on course to hit a membership of nearly 1,000 by the end of the current parliament.There have been a number of attempts to reform the chamber. The latest – Nick Clegg’s House of Lords Reform Bill 2012 – was dropped following Tory opposition. It . also emerged that a target to freeze the Lords budget during this . Parliament was quietly amended this summer so that it is now ‘subject to . the need to maintain the ability of the House and its members to carry . out their parliamentary functions in changing circumstances, including . increased attendance’. A Government source confirmed that a list of new peers was being prepared, adding: ‘It has always been the intention to do the latest round of appointments in two parts. ‘We aren’t going to take any lectures from a Labour Party that stuffed the House of Lords with its duds and retreads.’ Mr Clegg has continued to make appointments to the Lords despite saying that the chamber should be abolished and replaced with an elected House. The Commons political and constitutional reform committee has proposed some reforms to the Lords – described as ‘increasingly bloated’ by the Electoral Reform Society. It calls for legislation to allow the expulsion of peers convicted of a serious offence. MPs who receive custodial sentences of more than 12 months are disqualified from the Commons, but no such provision exists in the Lords. The committee also calls for a stronger ‘voluntary retirement’ scheme to allow peers to leave the chamber, and moves to remove those who persistently fail to attend. It says that in the longer term, the introduction of fixed-term appointments for peers should be considered. Committee chairman Graham Allen MP described reform of the Lords as a ‘large and thorny issue’ on which it has proved very difficult to get political consensus . He called on all parties to ‘engage in dialogue’ to bring forward change.","Government sources say that yet another list of appointments is due .

Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel said Saturday that Afghanistan's defense minister reassured him that a security agreement with the U.S. will be signed in a timely manner. Hagel also said he doesn't think more U.S. pressure would be helpful in trying to persuade Afghan President Hamid Karzai to sign the agreement. The U.S. defense secretary had no plans to meet with Karzai during his stopover and it was not immediately clear what impact the visit could have on the standoff. Scroll down for video . Surprise: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel disembarks from a C-17 military aircraft in Kabul, Afghanistan. Hagel said Saturday that Afghanistan's defense minister reassured him that a security agreement with the U.S. will be signed in a timely manner . Hagel spoke to reporters after meeting with Defense Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi. Karzai . tentatively has endorsed the agreement and a council of tribal elders, . the Loya Jirga, has said it should be signed by the end of the year, as . the U.S. has demanded. Karzai . says he wants his successor to decide after Afghanistan's April . elections. The president has stood his ground in the face of unrelenting . pressure from diplomatic and defense officials. The deal would allow U.S. troops to stay in the country after 2014 to do training and some counter-terrorism missions. Welcome: Hagel, right, is greeted by U.S. Ambassador James B. Cunningham, center, and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, left. Secretary Hagel made a stop in Afghanistan during his six-day trip to the middle east . Without a signed agreement, all U.S. troops would leave at the end of next year, along with all foreign forces.Joining . Hagel at a briefing, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, said he will keep planning for a post-2014 force. But, Dunford said, if the long-delayed deal is not signed before January, he will have to start planning for other options.Dunford said he was more concerned about the psychological effect of Karzai's failure to sign the agreement. The general said uncertainty about the future presence of coalition . forces is causing a loss of confidence in Afghanistan, and said he has . seen real estate prices go down and signs of 'hedging behavior.' Washington . and NATO officials say they want a quick decision on the bilateral . security agreement. Military leaders have said they need time to plan . and coordinate with allies for the post-2014 mission, which could . involve about 8,000 U.S. forces and 6,000 allies troops. Greetings: U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, center is greeted by military personnel after arriving at International Security Assistance Force Headquarters (ISAF) in Kabul, Afghanistan . Karzai has said he won't sign any . agreement that allows continued raids on Afghan homes. Under Afghan law, . any agreement must be signed twice — once to get it to parliament and, . if approved, then by Karzai alone in his capacity as president. During his visit, Hagel also plans to go around the country to see coalition service members. This . past week, U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of . Staff, told reporters in Washington that the White House had not . instructed him to plan for an option that would leave no U.S. troops in . Afghanistan after 2014.

This is Hagel's second trip to Afghanistan since he began as defense chief early this year.During his March visit, there were bombings, security threats, political gridlock and wild accusations from Karzai. A suicide bomber targeted the Afghan defense ministry a day before Hagel was scheduled to go there, and the Pentagon chief had to cancel a planned news conference because of a security threat. In addition, Karzai accused the U.S. of colluding with the Taliban.","Secretary Hagel decided not to meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai .

Tourism, orbiting hotels are among the areas explored so far - but none has exploded more than the moon. Astrobiotic Technology is also vying to mine the moon. Meanwhile, Bigelow Aerospace wants to sell property there, a Japanese firm suggested a solar panel power ring, and on Monday China launched the Chang’e 3 lander, which should touch down on the moon in mid-December. It has even been claimed China wants to turn the moon into a 'Death Star' by planting missile silos on its surface. It will be the first controlled landing since the Soviet Union’s Luna-24 mission in 1976. 'Nine billion. That’s how many people will be alive on the Earth as soon as 36 years from now,' Dennis Wingo, a space entrepreneur and author of the book MoonRush, told Fox News. 'The moon and beyond is an extension of our earthly society, with vast resources in metals and a place to expand human activity.' Moon Express is yet to pick a place to land in 2015. Richards said he is considering a spot in the Southern Hemisphere, near Surveyor 7 - the last robotic mission, which the U.S. soft-landed on the moon in 1968. 'It’s iconic to have the first private robotic lander resting next to the last government robotic lander,' he added.","MX-1 will blast off in 2015 on a mission ahead of plans to mine the moon .

Like Elvis' no-hips-allowed appearance on 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' or the Beatles' arrival in America, or Woodstock, it is considered one of the milestone moments in rock history: Bob Dylan going electric at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. On Friday, the Fender Stratocaster that Mr Dylan plugged in at the festival sold for nearly $1 million -- the highest price ever paid for a guitar at auction. A buyer identified only as a private individual agreed to pay $965,000 at Christie's, including the auction house's fees, for the sunburst-finish electric guitar. Scroll down for video . Record-setter: The Fender Stratocaster electric guitar played by musician Bob Dylan on July 25, 1965 at Newport Folk Festival sold for almost $1million at auction . Mr Dylan's legendary performance at the festival in Rhode Island 48 years ago marked his rupture with the folk movement's old guard and solidified his shift away from acoustic music, like 'Blowin' in the Wind,' toward amplified rock, such as 'Like a Rolling Stone.' The raucous, three-song electric set was booed by some in the crowd, and folk purists saw Mr Dylan as a traitor and a sellout. But 'his going electric changed the structure of folk music,' said Newport Folk Festival founder George Wein, 88. 'The minute Dylan went electric, all these young people said, 'Bobby's going electric. We're going electric, too.' Christie's had expected the guitar, which was sold with its original black leather strap and Fender hard-shell case, to go for far less, $300,000 to $500,000. The previous record for a guitar sold at auction was held by Eric Clapton's Fender, nicknamed 'Blackie,' which sold at Christie's for $959,500 in 2004. Mr Dylan's guitar had been in the possession of a New Jersey family for nearly 50 years after the singer left it on a private plane. An iconic moment: Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival playing the electric guitar sold this week at acution . The pilot's daughter, Dawn Peterson of Morris County, N.J., said her father asked Mr Dylan's management what to do with the instrument, and nobody ever got back to him. Last year, she took it to the PBS show 'History Detectives' to have it authenticated, and rock-memorabilia experts matched its wood grain to close-up color photos of Mr Dylan's instrument at the 1965 festival. Mr Dylan's attorney and his publicist didn't respond to email and phone requests for comment. Mr Dylan and Peterson, who declined to be interviewed, recently settled a legal dispute over the items. The terms weren't disclosed. In embracing electric guitar, Mr Dylan was credited with infusing rock with the depth and complexity of literature. In truth, Mr Dylan had gone electric well before the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Months earlier, he released the album 'Bringing It All Back Home,' one side of which was electric. And the single ""Like a Rolling Stone"" came out just days before the festival. The highest civilian honor: US President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to musician Bob Dylan during a ceremony last year . But his performance at one of folk's biggest showcases -- in front of some of the purest of folk purists -- caused a sensation. Exactly what happened at the festival on July 25, 1965, has become enshrouded in legend, and debate persists over whether those who booed were angry over Dylan's electric turn or were upset over the sound quality or the overly brief set. Backed by a rock band that included Mike Bloomfield on guitar and Al Kooper on organ, Dylan played such songs as 'Maggie's Farm' and 'Like a Rolling Stone.' He returned for an acoustic encore with 'It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.' Legend has it that Pete Seeger, one of the elder statesmen of the folk movement, was so angry that he tried to pull the plug on the electric performance or threatened to cut the cable with an ax. But years later, Seeger said he had nothing against Dylan going electric -- he was upset over the distortion-filled sound system. Christie's also was offering five lots of hand- and typewritten lyric fragments found inside the guitar case -- early versions of some of Dylan's songs. They had a presale estimate ranging from $3,000 to $30,000. But only one of them sold; it went for $20,000 and contained draft lyrics for 'I Wanna Be Your Lover.""","The electric guitar Bob Dylan played at the 1965 Newport Music Festival .

Thin, bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane were estimated to be travelling at around 330 mph (150 meters per second). 'We did a double take when we saw this vortex because it looks so much like a hurricane on Earth,' said Andrew Ingersoll, a Cassini imaging team member at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'But there it is at Saturn, on a much larger scale, and it is somehow getting by on the small amounts of water vapor in Saturn's hydrogen atmosphere.' This spectacular, vertigo inducing, false-color image from NASA's Cassini mission highlights the storms at Saturn's north pole . Scientists are now studying the hurricane to gain insight into hurricanes on Earth, which feed off warm ocean water. Although there is no body of water close to these clouds high in Saturn's atmosphere, learning how these Saturnian storms use water vapor could tell scientists more about how terrestrial hurricanes are generated and sustained. Both a terrestrial hurricane and Saturn's north polar vortex have a central eye with no clouds or very low clouds. Other similar features include high clouds forming an eye wall, other high clouds spiraling around the eye, and a counter-clockwise spin in the northern hemisphere. A major difference between the hurricanes is that the one on Saturn is much bigger than its counterparts on Earth and spins surprisingly fast. At Saturn, the wind in the eye wall blows more than four times faster than hurricane-force winds on Earth.","Hexagon shape is created by a band of upper-atmospheric winds on Saturn .

A two-year-old boy died from meningitis after his parent's desperate 999 call got 'lost in the system' and referred to NHS Direct meaning a paramedic was not sent out until it was too late to save him. Dusan Spivak was rushed to the Royal Derby Hospital a full hour-and-a-half after his parents called the emergency services - but by then medics said it was too late to save his life. An inquest heard how Dusan's family, originally from the Czech Republic, . had dialled 999 at 10.26pm on May 29 last year after a large rash formed . quickly on the youngster's belly at their home in Normanton, Derbyshire. Delay: Dusan Spivak, 2, was rushed to the Royal Derby Hospital (pictured) a full . hour-and-a-half after his parents called the emergency services - but by . then medics said it was too late to save his life . Michelle Summonds, acting service . delivery manager for East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS), said that because none . of the family members spoke English, it was 'difficult' for the . call handler to determine how serious the incident was. She admitted the call handler failed to source an interpreter, which meant he did not grasp how serious the situation was. As . a result, he wrongly chose to involve NHS Direct, when it was the EMAS . Clinical Assessment Team - which deal with more urgent 999 calls - which . needed to be sent details. He . also failed to complete the referral form to NHS Direct. The inquest at Derby Coroner's Court heard a second 999 call, which was properly handled, was made at 10.50pm and led to a paramedic arriving at the scene at 11.29pm. Assistant deputy coroner Paul McCandles, ruled that had the first 999 call been handled correctly, a . paramedic would have arrived approximately 13 minutes earlier. Dr William Carroll, who led frantic . efforts to save the youngster told the inquest the boy had developed meningococcal septicaemia - a . life-threatening infection brought on by meningitis. He said it was a condition that can bring about death very quickly and that 'every minute counts'. Asked if Dusan would have lived had he arrived at hospital sooner, Dr Carroll replied: 'Probably, yes'. Mr McCandles, said it was 'not possible to say' whether Dusan would have survived had the earlier call not been 'lost in the system' and the response been 13 minutes . quicker. It also emerged that a paramedic chose to go against national guidelines when it came to treating Dusan at the house. Paul Whitfield - the first paramedic to arrive - said the boy was so ill it was clear he needed a dose of the antibiotic benzylpenicillin. Guidelines stated the drug should not be administered if the medic is unsure about whether the patient has any allergies. Mr Whitfield said this was impossible to determine as nobody in the house spoke English. Based on the fact the child’s condition was rapidly deteriorating, he instructed a colleague to administer the benzylpenicillin. Mr McCandless said the paramedic was 'between the devil and the deep, blue sea' and that he should be praised for 'bravely' making the call that he did. The inquest was also told about a 'missed opportunity' earlier in the day to uncover the serious nature of Dusan’s illness. Dusan’s grandfather, also called Dusan Spivak, phoned Lister House Surgery Normanton, on the day the toddler fell ill. Mr Spivak explained, via a telephone interpreting service, that Dusan had a fever, pain in his stomach and was struggling to breathe. The receptionist, Claire Nicholas, advised him to fetch some medicine from a pharmacy to 'bring his temperature down'. Giving evidence, she admitted she should have 'concentrated more on the abdominal pain'. However, Mr McCandless did not criticise her actions, pointing out that there had been no clear signs to suggest the Dusan was seriously ill and that she advised Mr Spivak to call back if his condition deteriorated. In delivering his verdict, Mr McCandless said Dusan had fallen victim to a condition that was every parent’s and medic’s 'worst nightmare'. Afterwards, a spokesperson for EMAS said it was 'sorry for the error in the categorisation of the call', and that action had been taken to prevent the incident happening again.","Toddler Dusan Spivak died after developing meningococcal septicaemia .

David Cameron wants select committees to investigate whether The Guardian broke the law by printing information leaked by Edward Snowden . David Cameron backed calls for a full parliamentary inquiry into whether the Guardian’s publication of leaked national secrets has put state security at risk. The Prime Minister encouraged MPs on select committees to investigate whether the paper had broken the law or done harm to our security by printing information leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. And yesterday the chairman of one of them, Keith Vaz, said his home affairs committee would be investigating the Guardian’s conduct. Former defence secretary Liam Fox accused the Guardian of ‘reckless and politically dangerous’ behaviour which may have made Britain more vulnerable to attack. And last night, pressure on the paper increased still further after Tory backbencher Julian Smith was granted a Parliamentary debate in Westminster Hall next Tuesday over the publishing of the top-secret documents. Julian Smith, who earlier this week . wrote to Scotland Yard urging them to conduct an inquiry into the . Guardian, said: ‘I look forward to laying out the reasons why I believe . that the Guardian has crossed the line between responsible journalism . and seriously risking our national security and the lives of those who . seek to protect us.' The Prime Minister said that in agreeing to dispose of information it had obtained from the former US National Security Agency employee, the newspaper effectively accepted its involvement in putting national security at risk. Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the plain fact is that what has . happened has damaged national security, and in many ways the Guardian . themselves admitted that when they agreed, when asked politely by my . national security adviser and Cabinet Secretary (Sir Jeremy Heywood) to . destroy the files they had, they went ahead and destroyed those files. ‘So they know that what they are dealing with is dangerous for national security.’ He was responding to a question from Dr Fox, who said: ‘Can we have a full and transparent assessment about whether the Guardian’s involvement in the Snowden affair has damaged Britain’s national security?’ Pictured: The Guardian's London office. The newspaper is facing increased pressure over its publication of the leaked information . Mr Cameron replied: ‘I think it’s up to select committees in this house if they want to examine this issue and make further recommendations.’ Last week the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said the Guardian had handed a gift to terrorists. Later in the day, Dr Fox wrote to the chairmen of five Commons select committees urging them to carry out an investigation into the Guardian’s ‘reckless and potentially dangerous’ conduct.The letter was sent to Keith Vaz of the home affairs committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind (intelligence and security), John Arbuthnot (defence), Richard Ottaway (foreign affairs) and Sir Alan Beith, chairman of the liaison select committee. He wrote: ‘A free press does not mean the freedom to make the UK, its people or its allies more vulnerable to serious organised crime or terrorism. ‘I am writing to formally request, as both a Member of Parliament and a former Security of State for Defence, that your committee considers the elements of the Guardian’s involvement in, and publication of, the Snowden leaks. David Cameron said the publication had 'damaged national security' and Liam Fox (right) has written to the chairmen of five select committees to ask them to investigate . ‘I would like you to determine whether the vulnerability of the people of Britain, our security services or those of our allies have been impaired by what I believe to be reckless and potentially dangerous behaviour.’ Last week the head of MI5 , Andrew Parker, said the publication of the stolen top-secret documents had handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and had caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services. Security officials say the exposé amounts to a ‘guide book’, advising terrorists on the best way to avoid detection when plotting an atrocity. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also criticised the paper, saying technical details about the operations of spies should not be published in newspapers. But his Liberal Democrat colleague Business Secretary Vince Cable expressed concerns about the level of scrutiny the newspaper was now facing, saying it had performed ‘a very considerable public service’.","David Cameron has encouraged select committees to investigate the paper .

After the pain on Sophie’s back intensified, her mother eventually chose to squeeze the venom, which she suspected had come from a false widow, out herself. Mother Amy Harris was shocked when medics sent her four-year-old . daughter home from A&E with what she suspected was a false . widow spider bite on her back . After the pain on Sophie's back intensified, her mother eventually chose to squeeze the venom out herself . Ms Harris took Sophie to Shrewsbury Royal Hospital, near their home in Baschurch, Shropshire, after the wound started to swell after an hour on Friday. She told of her anger today, explaining that Sophie had come back from school complaining of something hurting on her back. ‘When I looked I discovered a lump of black in the middle with yellow around the outside about the size of a 5p piece,’ the mother said. ‘She said a spider bit her but because she is four and she’s got a wild imagination I didn’t know whether to believe her. ‘I’d read all about these spider bites and showed people on online forums pictures of the wound and they were sure it was a false widow bite. ‘They posted links to people who had been bitten by false widow spider’s and the bites looked identical to Sophie’s.’ When her daughter complained of further pain, Ms Harris decided to take her to the hospital. ‘They said we haven’t been given any warnings so it can’t be that serious,’ she said. A number of false widow bites have been reported across the UK in recent weeks . Ms Harris accused medics at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital of sending her daughter away with a dangerous bite . ‘The doctor checked her breathing and lymph nodes and just said take her home and give her some Piriton. ‘She was in agony and they just sent her on her way - I couldn’t believe I had to be the one to treat her.’ When she got home, the wound got ‘really nasty’ and, fearing the worst, the mother felt she had to deal with it and squeeze it out. Sophie felt better within a matter of hours. Her mother added: ‘I don’t understand why the hospital couldn’t have just done that in the first place.’ Ms Harris has not been able to catch the culprit, but believes a false black widow was behind the bite. She is now worried about her younger children, Thomas, one, and Alfie, two. She said: ‘Thomas isn’t walking yet so I’m not letting him on the floor as much as I would do because I don’t know if I’ve got them all. It’s a big worry. ‘The more I’ve heard about them and the people who have been bitten and needed surgery I felt really lucky that hers didn’t get to that.’ Sophie came home from school on Friday complaining of the pain coming from her back . A spokesman from Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said staff did not know what had caused Sophie’s injury. ‘In a typical A&E Department we will see people coming in with reactions to stings or bites,’ they said. ‘When it is not clear or not known what the cause was, as in this case, we make a clinical assessment of both the site of injury and the effect on the patient. ‘In a case where there is simply a minor reaction, the course of treatment will be to use antihistamines and monitor the situation at home, and if it does not improve we advise people to contact their GP. ‘Generally stings and bites can be treated through self care at home and remedies such as antihistamines.’ Amateur footballer Steve Harris, from Devon, was bitten in bed last week by the false black widow . The . false black widow, which is said to be spreading further north due to . warmer weather, has the worst bite of any spider in the UK. There have been a spate of bites reported across the country in the past few weeks. Amateur Devon footballer Steve Harris, for instance, had to undergo emergency surgery after a bite on his leg last week. The spider is a cousin of the Black Widow and is about the size of a 50 pence piece. It unleashes venom that can kill those who are allergic to it. It first came to the UK more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands. The . Natural History Museum’s Insect Information Service hears of about ten . cases of spider bites each year, although no one in the UK has ever died . as a result of one. The . distribution of the false widow spider is expected to increase . northwards in the UK due, at least partly, to mild summers in recent . years.","Amy Harris had to squeeze venom out of four-year-old daughter's bite .

A 27-year-old school mistress has been banned from teaching for life after she invited a 16-year-old school boy to her home and kissed him. Heather Bartlett, who taught Geography at Hitchin Boys' School, was found guilty of unprofessional conduct after police cautioned her for engaging in sexual activity with a teenager. She was told by a disciplinary panel she would not be allowed back into a classroom after admitting to meeting the male pupil on three separate occasions. Ban: Heather Bartlett was a teacher at Hitchin Boys' School when she received a police caution for sexual activity with a male pupil . The National College for Teaching and Leadership also discovered she was cautioned by Hertfordshire Police on 29 January 2013 for sexual activity with a male aged 13 to 17. The panel said a life-time ban was necessary in the public interest to maintain confidence in the teaching profession and to declare and uphold proper standards of conduct. Giving the final decision on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, Paul Heathcote said: 'Ms Bartlett has admitted all the allegations and that they amount to unacceptable professional conduct, and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute. The panel have concluded the same. 'Ms Bartlett's behaviour was a serious departure from the personal and professional conduct standards of the latest Teachers' Standards, and misconduct which affected the well-being of the pupil concerned. 'Ms Bartlett's actions involved abuse of a position of trust and was compounded by her initial denials on separate occasions to both the police and the school.' He said the panel noted the testimonials in support of Ms Bartlett and found she has shown insight and remorse. He continued: 'However, in view of the seriousness of this case, particularly the presence of sexual misconduct, I agree with the panel's recommendation that Ms Bartlett should be prohibited without the opportunity to have the sanction reviewed.' The decision means that Bartlett is prohibited from teaching indefinitely in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. Bartlett, who was employed at the school  from September 2011 until March 2013, has a right of appeal to the High Court.","Heather Bartlett was a newly-qualified Geography teacher .

Miss De Gerin-Ricard collided with a lorry outside Aldgate East Tube station while she rode home . The family of the first person to be killed on a 'Boris bike' watched as the moment she was knocked off her wheels by a lorry was shown to her inquest. The parents, brother and sisters of Philippine De Gerin-Ricard, 20, wept as CCTV footage was played showing the moment the French-born student died. Coroner Mary Hassell warned the images were 'very very graphic' as she prepared the De Gerin-Ricards and the HGV driver Richard James, who was at the wheel, for the emotional evidence. The family watched the CCTV footage, taken from different cameras, showing Miss De Gerin-Ricard as she collided with a lorry outside Aldgate East Tube station while she rode home to Bromley-by-Bow, in east London, on July 5. She was cycling along one of the London mayor’s so-called flagship commuter cycle routes, though the section she was in provides no segregated space for cycling. The coroner had introduced the footage with a 'very strong warning' that it shows 'Philippine coming off her bike and I imagine it would be very distressing for her family'. Turning to Mr James, she added: 'I know this will be very upsetting for you too.' Mr James, an HGV driver for about 22 years, told Poplar Coroner's Court in east London that  he had been travelling at around 10-12mph in the slow- moving peak traffic at about 7pm. He was approaching the crossroads and the traffic lights were probably on red. There was scaffolding from building works at one side of the road. She was cycling along one of London's commuter cycle routes, though the section she was in provides no segregated space for cycling . Mr James told the inquest the first he knew of the crash was the sound of a 'tinkling or rattling noise which I thought was my mirrors catching the scaffolding.' He added: 'Then I could see a young lady tumbling backwards off her bike. Then I stopped.' His lorry was positioned 'squarely' in the lane, the court heard. Within minutes, an ambulance was at the scene and a bus driver and passers-by had stopped to try to help. Miss De Gerin-Ricard, who suffered a collapsed left lung, died of multiple injuries . Miss De Gerin-Ricard, who suffered a . collapsed left lung, was rushed to the nearby Royal London Hospital but . died of multiple injuries. Asked by the coroner if in hindsight there was anything he could have done differently, Mr James shook his head and said 'No'. Asked if there was anything he could suggest to help with the safety of road cyclists, he told the court: 'Possibly with the bicycle hire scheme - the Boris bikes - they could give reflective clothing with the bikes for the riders.' On seeing the crash, bus driver Richard Brown hit a special button in his cab which contacted the emergency services, he told the inquest. He noticed it was 'very narrow' between the lorry and the scaffolding. 'It did not occur to me that she collided with the lorry but she did seem to wobble slightly, at which point she fell backwards to her right side and into the lorry,' he recalled. 'I really feel there was not sufficient space for Philippine to pass or attempt to pass the lorry. I think the gap was too small to go by the lorry safely.' Asked by the coroner for some potential safety points, he suggested that perhaps roads should be kerbed off for riders at junctions, and high visibility clothes for them would also be helpful. Investigating officer Pc Mike Andrews told the inquest the front of the lorry collided with the rear wheel of the bicycle. Miss De Gerin-Ricard had been riding on the footpath before passing the scaffolding, possibly in a move to try to get past a bus. Pc Andrews said: 'Philippine is coming . down the passenger side of the lorry. The lorry has just started moving . but she is moving faster and is able to move in front of the lorry. 'Their . speeds, at some point, would be the same but the lorry is still able to . go quicker and collides with the rear of the bicycle.' Miss De Gerin-Ricard's mother, Anne Boudet du Mochet (centre), pleaded for road safety for cyclists in London to be tackled 'now and quickly' CCTV of the dreadful moment the student came off her bike was played at Poplar Coroner's Court . There would have been about 3.72 seconds in which Miss De Gerin-Ricard could have been spotted, according to Pc Andrews. He went on: 'As Mr James conducted his pre-movement check in the mirrors, Philippine was riding on the footpath - at best she would have been on the very limit of his view. 'With the other pedestrians at the bus stop and milling around, it would have been quite difficult for him to recognise her as a bicycle rider.' Miss De Gerin-Ricard's mother, Anne Boudet du Mochet, pleaded for road safety for cyclists in London to be tackled 'now and quickly'. Through an interpreter, she told the court: 'I do not reside here - I live in France - but I am speaking for people who still live and will be living in London. 'There were a number of factors that have come together. The accident did happen, but as Philippine's mum I have seen the impact on all those people who cycle. 'The accident Philippine had was the straw that broke the camel's back. 'The problem with cycle lanes here in London is not a new problem. Things have been asked by cyclists - if anything had been done, it has not been helpful to cyclists. 'I have heard the clothing that cyclists wear and what Philippine should have been wearing was discussed here. 'What needs to be discussed is the provisions of lanes for cyclists. Action needs to be taken. 'Today it is my family who is living in this situation and it is also the driver's family too.

Money-saving: Lee Beaumont demanded his mains water was stopped after realising he could save cash by using bottled mineral water . A money saving expert has had his mains water supply shut off after realising it was cheaper if he used mineral water instead. Lee Beaumont does everything in his Leeds home with bottled water - washing, cleaning and even flushing the toilet for less than the cost of his previous monthly bill. The 25-year-old's brave decision came after Yorkshire Water asked him for a £14 per month standing charge, and so instead of paying up he asked them to cut off his supply. He now is now saving cash by buying water in bulk from the supermarket, which he says  more than enough for him and his two-year-old dog Bella. Lee cleans himself using baby wipes and bottled water each day and pops to friends' houses or the gym to use a shower. To avoid any washing up he drinks and eats using disposable cups, plates and cutlery. The cash he is saving will help him pay for the redecoration of his home, he says. 'It's been fantastic for me. It has saved me money,' he told MailOnline. 'In April I used one unit of water, and they charged me £16 including a £14 standing charge so I asked them to cut me off. 'When I need the loo I just take the dog bowl and use that to flush the loo and put more bottled water into the dog bowl for her to drink. This means the dog gets fresh bottled water all day.

He added that he visits the dentist monthly and says he has been told that his teeth have improved since he started using mineral water full-time in May.

ELECTRICITY: Up to £40 a month, now down to £15 a month. His best week was last week - £3.66. Mr Beaumont, who works from home and runs a self-harm support charity, also decided to cut off his gas supply after his boiler broke and he didn't have the £1,000 to replace it. 'It was hard last winter but I've bought myself a new duvet and have an electric blanket if I need it. I also try to live in one room. 'My electricity bill is now £4 per week and I want to get it lower'.

Once again the rumours turned out to be true - Apple has confirmed it is holding another launch event on October 22, just a month after its latest iPhones hit the shelves. Invites have been sent to journalists entitled 'We still have a lot to cover.' The invitation additionally shows a number of colourful leaves about the Apple logo in the background. Experts believe the tech giant could be about to announce a new iPad mini as well as an improved iPad - dubbed iPad 5 - at the Tuesday event. Apple has sent official press invites, pictured, to a launch event taking place in London on Tuesday. The firm is expected to launch its next generation iPads at the event, including the iPad 5 and the iPad mini 2. The design suggests Apple could be introducing colours to its new tablets, in the way it did with the iPhone 5C . This would be almost a year to the day since Apple's CEO Tim Cook unveiled the first generation mini, and the release would see the tablets go on sale in time for Christmas. Apple historically launches products on a Tuesday, making them available for pre-order the following Friday, before putting them on sale the Friday of the week after. This suggests any new devices announced on 22 October will be on sale by 1 November. Leaked photos have already hinted at what the tablets could look like, including a range of colourful cases, and in an investor note analysts state Apple could also be working on a 13-inch model. Barclays Equity Research claimed the latest 64-bit architecture - seen in Microsoft's new Surface 2 tablet - could pave the way for a . 13-inch iPad designed to appeal to laptop users. The 64-bit models are said to be more powerful and can handle more multitasking functions. Rumours in August also claimed suppliers in China had been asked to ship larger displays, potentially for use on new Apple products. A new range of iPads are expected to launch on 22 October. These leaked images from technology site Tactus, allegedly show the rear shell of the iPad 5, pictured, with coloured cases. Apple could also unveil a second-generation iPad mini . Analyst Gene Munster, from investment firm Piper Jaffray, surveyed 799 people about Apple's rumoured iWatch. It found 3 per cent of iPhone owners would consider buying the wearable device. There are said to be around 293 million Apple customers, suggesting this would equate to between eight and 10 million units sold in the first year. Respondents were also asked if they would be willing to buy the iWatch for around $350 (£217) with 12 per cent admitting they'd be willing to pay this price. The rest of the people who said they'd be interested in an iWatch said they would pass on the gadget if it cost this much. Source: International Business Times . During the iPhone announcement on 10 September, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new . hardware, software and services that we can’t wait to introduce this Fall and throughout 2014.' The current iPad mini came out in . November 2012 and if Apple follows suit, this would confirm a . mid-October announcement followed by an early-November sale date, in . time for Christmas. The price of the current iPads is also being cut in various regions, suggesting a new tablet is coming. It's likely the iPad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9-inch screen and not drop to 7-inches, in a bid to stay slightly bigger than Google's Nexus 7, Tesco's new Hudl and the MyTablet from Argos. If Apple adds the Retina display seen on its new iPhones and larger iPads, its possible the second-generation iPad mini will be heavier and thicker. However, leaked photos of the casing suggest it will be thinner, meaning Apple may wait to add the high-definition display to later models. According to Apple site, 9to5Mac, the rumoured iPad 5 will also keep the 9.7-inch, high-resolution screen seen on older models. The camera is due an upgrade, too, and is thought Apple would move to an 8MP rear-facing lens, with the possibility of . even a 12MP camera being added.

Protest: Pay for teachers and other public sector employees are capped at one per cent . The average salary of a public  sector worker has fallen for the first time since records began, official  figures revealed yesterday. The Office for National Statistics said that average weekly earnings in the  public sector dropped by 0.5 per cent in August, the first monthly drop since 2001, when figures began being taken. The news represents a watershed moment for Britain, which saw the size of the State workforce and their average salaries balloon during 13 years of a Labour government. This is the first drop in public sector salaries since 2001, but the ONS has recorded eight drops in salaries for private sector workers over the same period, although they actually rose by 1.1 per cent in August. However, State workers, who account for nearly one in five workers in Britain, are still being better paid than their counterparts in the private sector. On average, a State worker earns £484 a week, while a private sector worker earns £473 per week. These figures include any bonuses paid on top of salaries, although many workers receive nothing. Since the coalition Government came to power in May 2010, it has cracked down on public sector wage rises and staffing levels. It began with a two-year pay freeze for  anyone earning a salary of £21,000 or more, followed by a two-year cap on pay rises at an average of one per cent a year. Since June 2010, the number of public  sector jobs has been cut by nearly 650,000. In contrast, between 1999 – when the ONS started keeping such records – and June 2010, the sector grew by just over 850,000 workers. Unions are dismissive of the idea of a public sector pay premium, pointing out that many public  sector workers are well-educated and highly qualified. The State sector also includes many highly skilled and specialised jobs which do not exist in the  private sector, such as judges, army generals, university lecturers and senior civil servants. The figures for the last few years do not entirely reflect the public sector pay freezes because of changes in staffing levels. For example, overall average pay may appear higher if the public sector is losing junior members of staff in the jobs cull, but holding on to senior, better-paid staff. The ONS figures are also complicated by other factors, such as some jobs being ‘reclassified’ from the private into the public sector. Cuts: Almost 650,000 public sector jobs have been cut since the Coalition government took power . For example, the banks rescued by the taxpayer in the financial crash, such as Royal Bank of Scotland, have been moved into the public sector, while sixth-form and further education colleges in England have been transferred into the private sector because they are run as corporations. However, whether workers are in the public or the private sector, the ONS’s figures continued to highlight what economists described yesterday as a ‘ferocious’ squeeze on salaries. The cost of living has been rising, with a long list of bills –  from the cost of heating to the weekly family shop – reaching record levels. The Bank of England’s inflation target, which is set by the Government, is two per cent, but inflation has been above this level for nearly four years. ‘The figures confirm that the ferocious squeeze on real pay levels continues,’ said Nigel Meager, director of the independent Institute for Employment Studies . ‘There is huge pent-up pressure for wage increases in the system. As the recovery proceeds, employers may find it harder to resist this pressure.’ The toxic combination of high inflation and low pay rises mean that millions of workers are actually earning less in ‘real’ terms than they were before the recession began in 2008. ‘Real’ means that the figures have been adjusted for inflation. Your salary might be higher but its spending power has been reduced because bills and other items have been rising much faster. Average weekly earnings for a worker in either the public or  private sector are £447 a week, excluding bonuses, according to the ONS’s figures. This is the lowest level in real terms since records began in 2001, according to the independent think tank, the Resolution Foundation, based on the higher RPI measure of inflation. James Plunkett, the foundation’s director of policy, said: ‘This has been a tough downturn for wages.‘The fall in real wages we’ve seen has been unprecedented. But perhaps most worrying today is that there’s still no sign of the wage squeeze ending. ‘Despite some better economic news, the gap between pay and prices is wider now than it was a year ago.’ Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: ‘This degree of real wage squeeze is not conducive to a strong and sustained recovery in the UK economy.’","Average public sector earnings fell 0.5 per cent in August to £473 per week .

Then you might want to snap up the first-ever complete dinosaur skeleton to go on sale in the UK. Hollywood stars are hoped to be among the bidders for the 17 metre Diplodocus next month, which looks like a prop straight from the Jurassic Park film set. Named 'Misty', its fossils were discovered by the children of celebrated dinosaur hunter Raimund Albersdoerfer near to the famous Dana quarry in Wyoming, USA. A huge dinosaur skeleton found in the United States in 2009 is being auctioned in Britain. Summers Place Auctions said the female Diplodocus longus skeleton, nicknamed Misty, measures 55 feet long and 19 feet tall . The female dinosaur was painstakingly prepared at a leading fossil laboratory in Holland before taking a day to be assembled at the auctioneers, 150 million years after walking the earth. Relatively complete Diplodocus skeletons are extremely rare and this specimen joins only a handful of other known examples. Even the famous Diplodocus ‘Dippy’ in the Natural History Museum, London, is a plaster copy taken from an original in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The skeleton was found mostly intact near a quarry in Wyoming by accident, and the skeleton was treated at a fossil laboratory in Holland before being assembled in Britain . The Diplodocus was a herbivore dinosaur that lived during the Late Jurassic period. It is the longest of all . dinosaurs with an unusual body structure that includes two rows of bones on the . underside of its tail to provide extra support and greater movement. Paleontologists believe that the ribs of the Diplodocus were not attached to the backbone, but instead were attached to the skin in the belly area. It used to be thought that the sauropods, like Diplodocus, had a second brain. Paleontologists now think that what they thought was a second brain was just an enlargement in the spinal cord in the hip area. Diplodocus longus is the longest of all dinosaurs with an unusual body structure that includes two rows of bones on the underside of its tail to provide extra support and greater movement. Natural history expert Errol Fuller, who is overseeing the sale said: ‘There are quite a lot of emerging museums in the Far East, particularly in China, who may be interested. ‘I think there might be some private buyers who may wish to put in a bid. A couple of Hollywood stars have bought dinosaurs in the past.’ ‘It would be a wonderful thing if you were a real rich person who could build a big outhouse for it,’ added Mr Fuller. ‘I think it's much better than a collector's car worth millions - and much cheaper. It's far better to show something this rare to your friends at dinner parties.’ The skeleton is now set to sell for an estimated price of £400,000 to £600,000 at Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, West Sussex, on November 27 . The auction, named ‘Evolution’, is due to take place on sale by Summers Place Auctions, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, on November 27. Alongside the Diplodocus longus, will be the sale of the only example of a highly important dodo pelvis bone in private hands. This specimen was found in the Mare aux Songes, Mauritius during the 1860s when excavations were carried out by a local schoolmaster named George Clarke. One highlight at the auction will be the only example of a highly important dodo pelvis bone in private hands . The auction also contains rare taxidermy specimens, including a Tarpan (an extinct variety of horse shown on the left) and a giant Aldabran tortoise (right) There is also an opportunity to buy some rare Chrysanthemum Stones, which are formed of celastite crystal discovered during the building of a dam in China. It is thought that no more of this stone can be uncovered. Another highlight is a giant blue semiprecious stone freeform from Afghanistan, which is 54 cm high and weighs 42 kg. The coloured stone is estimated to sell at £8,000-£10,000.

Researchers have discovered a new species of fish that breathes air and has evolved to grow extra strong scaly skin that can withstand piranha bites. The fish is a new species of arapaima, a giant freshwater fish native to the Amazon River in Brazil and has been named A. leptosome. In the mid-19th century, four species of arapaima were officially recognised but in 1868, Albert Günther, a scientist at the British Museum of Natural History, published an article that suggested that all sub-species should be classified as the same species: Arapaima gigas. The scientist's views eventually became the commonly accepted classification. Scroll down for video . Researchers have discovered the scales of the freshwater Arapaima gigas are made up of stacked spiral staircase-like layers covered in collagen, protected by an outer shell. This image shows the latest species of arapaima, called leptosome, that has only just been officially classified . The Arapaima gigas is a species of fish found in the Amazon River basin in Brazil. They are the largest freshwater fish in South America and can grow to around 6ft 7in, although many peak at around 6ft long. The fish has large black and green scales with red markings. It is known locally as 'paiche', which means 'red fish'. The new fish, dubbed Arapaima . leptosome, has several distinguishing features, including an elongated . sensory cavity on the head, a sheath that covers part of the dorsal fin . and distinctive markings on its skin. Although it was first discovered back in 2001, it has taken this long for the fish to be officially classified. The discovery and subsequent classification means there are now five known species of arapaima. The most recent species was found where the Brazilian Solimoes and Purus rivers join. However the latest findings called this view into question. The new fish, dubbed Arapaima leptosome, has several distinguishing features, including an elongated sensory cavity on the head, a sheath that covers part of the dorsal fin and distinctive markings on its skin. Although it was first discovered back in 2001, it has taken this long for the fish to be officially classified. The discovery and subsequent classification means there are now five known species of arapaima. The most recent species was found where the Brazilian Solimoes and Purus rivers join. 'Everybody for 160 years had been saying there’s only one kind of arapaima. But we know now there are various species, including some not previously recognised,' said Dr. Donald Stewart of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, who made the discovery. In separate research, experts have also studied the scales of the fish and discovered they consist of stacked spiral staircase-like layers made of collagen, protected by a hard outer shell. These spiral layers intertwine and curve inward and outward meaning they can repel the force of the piranha's tiny sharp teeth - and researchers believe the scales have evolved in this way. The team from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory wanted to know how the fish evolved to live in relative peace with the flesh-eating predators. They studied the scales to the highest resolution microscopic level ever used in experiments of this kind and discovered each individual scale is made up of a series of layers. A single scale has a hard outer shell, around 0.5mm thick, on top of a soft inner core that is double the thickness of its protective layer. The scales of the arapaima, pictured at microscopic levels, overlap each other by about 60 per cent. Each scale has a 0.5mm hard outer shell on top of a soft 1mm inner core. The core is made up of elastic collagen and researchers believe the fish evolved this way to protect itself . The core is made up of elastic collagen shaped by multiple staircase-like structures that curve in and around each other. The outer shell can protect the fish . from initial contact from the bite, but if the teeth shatter the brittle . casing, the softer core has evolved to repel the force of the bite. To test the scales, researchers simulated piranha bites along the row to see how the teeth penetrated them. They found the scales overlap each other by about 60 per cent and this adds an extra layer of protection because a piranha tooth is able to break one scale, but rarely two. Study co-author Bernd Gludovatz from the laboratory told Live Science: 'The beauty of the structure is when you apply a load in a certain direction, the spiral stairs have the ability to rotate, and can modify the loads you have applied to the entire sample to withstand the loads.' 'We want to understand how . nature develops these materials, and then try to copy them and make . something similar and, if possible, get the mechanical properties maybe . even better and more efficient.' The findings are published in journal Nature Communications. Piranhas, such as the one pictured, are omnivorous meaning they eat plants and meat. They are indigenous to the Amazon River basin and live alongside the arapaima fish. Researchers believe the fish's scales have evolved to repel the force of the piranha's tiny sharp teeth .","The large Arapaima lives in the Amazon River basin alongside piranhas .

Car headlights that make rain 'invisible' for drivers are under development and could save lives on the roads, engineers say. Developers hope their brainchild will reduce the number of accidents by improving visibility for motorists in treacherous conditions so they can effectively see through rain. The high-tech lights are programmed to detect water droplets and 'dis-illuminate' them as they fall. Scroll down for video . Developers say the smart headlights that can make rain almost invisible could save lives on the roads . The system uses a camera to track the . motion of raindrops and snowflakes and then applies a computer . algorithm to predict where those particles will fall a few milliseconds . later. The light . projection system then deactivates the light beams that would otherwise . illuminate the rain drops and cause a glare for the driver. At . low speeds, their system could eliminate 70 to 80 per cent of visible . rain during a heavy storm, while losing only 5 or 6 per cent of the . light from the headlamp. The system is less accurate the faster the car travels. It means the driver is less distracted and can focus on the road. The 'See Through Rain' technology works like a projector rather than a traditional single bulb headlight found in today's cars. Currently when a beam shines on a dark road during a downpour, it illuminates raindrops which can distract a driver. The new technology relies on a digital camera to establish a drop's location. Software then predicts where that drop will fall within the driver's field of view and light rays from the headlight that would usually illuminate it are turned off for an 'imperceptible fraction of a second'. Intel engineers say the system would eliminate up to 80 per cent of visible rain during a heavy storm . Components of the new system, which include a camera, projector and beamsplitter . This reduces the glare and leaves only the beams of light which travel uninterrupted between the falling rain, snow or hail. John Tomkins, an engineer at technology . firm Intel, said: 'Even though the light is slightly diminished from the . headlight (when some rays are switched off), it is being diminished . from the areas that would otherwise be distracting to the driver. 'When you eliminate the reflection from the rain, then you are able to see through the rain and see the road much more clearly. 'I would hope this could save lives on the roads though obviously the rain is still hitting your windscreen.' In the worst thunder storm, a motorist in a car travelling at around 20mph would notice a 70% improvement in visibility using the prototype developed by Intel and Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, USA. The system becomes less accurate at faster speeds but creators say it would still have a marked improvement on visibility. Developers hope the technology could be fitted in cars within a decade. The research has been developed by Intel and academics at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science.","Develops say the 'see through rain' technology will help make driving safer .
