"By . Julian Robinson . A man in China was left in agony for six hours after he trapped his arm in a filthy cesspit trying to retrieve his new mobile phone. Chen Ho was using the public lavatories in the city of Jianyang in Sichuan province and talking to a friend when the device slipped out of his hand and down the toilet. Connected to a deep cesspit, Chen rolled up his sleeves and fished around for the smartphone before his arm got stuck - sparking a six hour rescue operation. Wedged in: The man trapped his arm in a filthy cesspit after dropping his mobile phone while he was talking to a friend . He said: 'Unfortunately, my hand and arm became wedged in all this muck. 'The smell was appalling and by the time firemen arrived my arm was terribly swollen. I forgot I had a cut on my hand and I think it got infected. 'It was most embarrassing. 'When firemen arrived they used a towel to wrap my arm up as best they could and and then dug up the tiles around the toilet to broaden the space to try to lever it out. 'It went on forever but about six hours after I sat on the loo I was free.' Firemen were called in after Chen Ho discovered his arm was wedged in the toilet. They had to chip away at the tiles surrounding the toilet to set him free . By the time rescuers had arrived Chen Ho's arm was swollen and it took six hours for him to be freed . He said at first he had not wanted to call for help as he was embarrassed at his situation. His smartphone was new, he said, and added: 'I couldn't bear the thought of not having it. But getting it back did me no good - the thing was ruined.' A fire brigade spokesman said: 'You wouldn't believe the call outs we have in this district for possessions that have gone missing down the white bowl - phones, false teeth, even a Swiss army knife, although what that was doing in the toilet I have no idea. 'At least those people did the right thing by calling the professionals. We do not recommend DIY retrievals.'","Chen Ho was talking to a friend on mobile phone when device fell down toilet .

"By . Mail online Reporter . A Minnesota hunting club has offered to pay for the wedding and reception of a same-sex couple after first refusing to let the two men hold the ceremony there. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the settlement between the Little Falls hunting club and couple Cole Frey and Adam Block Friday. It is the first settlement of its kind since Minnesota legalized gay marriage in 2013. A Minnesota hunting club has offered to pay for the marriage and reception of Adam Block and Cole Frey after initially turning the couple away . According to The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the owners of LeBlanc's Rice Creek Hunting and Recreation Inc. will pay roughly $8,500 to cover the ceremony and reception and apologize to the couple. Frey, 20, and Block, 18, became engaged in November. Frey contacted LeBlanc's in February about holding the wedding there on his stepmother's suggestion. He was told the date he wanted was available. But when he went to sign the paperwork and give a security deposit, things went sour. 'That’s when they found out it would be between two males,' Frey told the Star-Tribune. 'They told us they don’t condone same-sex marriage, and they . wouldn’t be marrying us on their property.' Frey immediately called the state's Department of Human Rights and an inquiry was launched. An investigator from the department was also turned away when calling to ask about holding a same-sex wedding. The Little Falls hunting club said it would pay approximately $8,500 for the ceremony and reception to be held there . LeBlanc's attorney Paul Rogosheske claims his clients misunderstood state law. 'They made a mistake and we did everything in our power to correct it,' he said. 'This couple is going to have a great . wedding and I can assure you LeBlanc’s is going to be open to . everybody.' Rogosheske said it the initial refusal was because of the owner's religious beliefs. 'You’ve . got the archdiocese campaigning against the amendment, they were very . vocal,' he said. 'You could see how people involved in a private . hunting club, they were new to hosting weddings in the first place, you . could see how they made a mistake.' The owners declined interview requests. Minnesota criminalized discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1993. The couple said they no longer wish to have their wedding at the club because of its intolerance of same-sex marriage . Religious entities were exempted from having to take part in same-sex weddings when gay marriage was legalized there in 2013, but that exemption does not extend to businesses or individuals for their religious beliefs. The laws have enraged gay rights opponents . 'This . is a shameful example of government forcing citizens to accept the . government’s view of sexuality and marriage,' said Minnesota Family Council CEO John Helmberger. Even, without Helmberger's blessing, the happy couple's wedding will take place next Friday, at a private home. 'We . kind of came to the conclusion, anyway, that we didn’t want to have it . there because we didn’t want to be associated with them in that way,' Frey said.","Settlement is first of its kind since state legalized gay marriage in 2013 .

"By . Simon Walters . Speaking out: Boris Johnson threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union reforms to combat the threat of a General Strike . Boris Johnson threw down the gauntlet to David Cameron last night by publicly challenging him to impose a new wave of union reforms to combat the threat of a General Strike. The London Mayor called on Cameron to pull Britain out of the slump by clamping down on strikes, saying it was time to stop the ‘endless buggeration’ that disrupts public services. In his first major interview since this newspaper last week revealed his secret talks about making a quick Commons comeback, Johnson said reports that he was plotting Cameron’s downfall were ‘twaddle’. But he refused to rule out a Commons return before the next Election, due in 2015. Johnson says his anti-strike blueprint is designed to support  Cameron’s drive to boost the  economy, but it is bound to be seen as a riposte to critics who say he lacks the substance needed to be Conservative leader. And it could lead to a new clash with the Prime Minister, who believes the proposals ‘go too far’ and could increase the likelihood of a General Strike. The Mayor’s supporters say his proposals are the ‘21st Century equivalent’ of the union reforms  pioneered by Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the Eighties. The reforms would outlaw strikes unless a 50 per cent threshold of members take part in a vote; ban all-out strikes among key public-service workers such as paramedics, firefighters and transport staff; force key public services to maintain a basic service and stop pickets intimidating workers. Johnson’s proposals come  after he was forced to pay huge bonuses to London bus drivers and Tube drivers to stop them going on strike during the Olympics. He has clashed repeatedly with Bob Crow, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, one of the last old-style militant union barons. Burly Crow is accused of staging strike ballots involving a tiny  fraction of his members and RMT officials have been accused of heavy-handed picketing. Johnson praised London transport workers for their ‘brilliant’ performance during the Olympics, saying: ‘They served the city well and made everyone incredibly proud.’ But, frustrated by his inability to change the law, he wants Cameron to rein in Crow and Co. Dismissed: In his first major interview since his secret talks about making a quick Commons comeback were revealed, Johnson said reports that he was plotting Cameron's downfall were 'twaddle' Adopting a new statesmanlike  tone, Johnson condemned last week’s call by the Trades Union Congress for a General Strike over the Government’s public-sector pay freeze. He said: ‘We’re going through difficult economic times. People have got to be able to go about their business. It [a General Strike] would be damaging to the economy, it’s not in the interests of unions or their members and it is unlikely to carry much support. ‘What we don’t want to see as unions start to flex their muscles in the autumn is a return to the unfair and unnecessary strikes and ballots that put a terrific psychological  burden on people who don’t want to take strike action. ‘There are hard-working people on London’s transport system who are unnerved by what is going on. There are intimidating people who stop them getting to work, or a strike is called on the basis of a very small proportion of the relevant workforce. That is not fair on them or their families.’ It is time to adopt tough, US-style anti-strike laws, said Johnson, who was born in New York. ‘In New York, not just emergency workers but mass-transit workers [the New York underground] aren’t allowed to strike at all. In cities like Madrid, they have minimum service requirements that mean even if there is industrial action, a certain basic service has to be provided. All those ideas are worth looking at.’ Battles: Boris Johnson has clashed repeatedly with Bob Crow, pictured, the leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and one of the last old-style militant union barons . Johnson said a total ban on public-sector strikes is ‘not realistic,’ adding: ‘People have a human right to withdraw their labour. But we have to think very carefully about how it is done and the effect on people who aren’t in the ballot and suddenly find they’re co-opted into a strike they don’t support.’ Johnson wants his anti-strike package included in the Government’s economic growth Bill, which is due to be introduced in Parliament in the next few weeks. ‘It’s got to be seen in the context of a general agenda for growth and jobs – that is what people want, a solid drive. The job of the State is to free the private sector from excessive taxation and regulation by providing the essential framework of safety and infrastructure to allow business to flourish.’ But this latest intervention could cause a new Boris-Dave rift. The Mail on Sunday understands the Prime Minister believes there is  no need for tough nationwide anti-strike laws because it is a ‘London problem’ caused mainly by Crow. A No 10 insider said: ‘Most unions are a busted flush. ‘If we give Boris everything he wants, it could backfire.’ Cameron wants a ‘watered down’ version of the Mayor’s strike- vote threshold plan, although the Chancellor, George Osborne, is backing Johnson. The Mayor is determined to win his latest tussle with Cameron. ‘It makes a big difference what you go for. We’re asking for a 50 per cent threshold.’ He denies declaring war on the unions. ‘I’m very keen not to seem adversarial towards the unions or to be doing this in an aggressive spirit.’ He defends his proposals: ‘What it does is take away unions’ power to cause endless grief and stress by threatening strikes and causing endless disruption and buggeration.’ It comes a week after this newspaper revealed how Johnson met Richmond MP Zac Goldsmith and discussed the Mayor taking over Goldsmith’s seat in a by-election on an anti-Heathrow third runway ticket. This sparked frenzied speculation about a Johnson leadership challenge against Cameron. Johnson’s spokesman played down the report, saying it was ‘fanciful.’ In fact, according to a very reliable witness, the Mayor panicked when told that his talks with Goldsmith had been leaked. As he agonised over whether to confirm or deny the report, he exclaimed: ‘I can’t lie! I can’t lie!’ He was sacked by former Tory leader Michael Howard in 2004 for lying about his affair with writer Petronella Wyatt. It was a fib to this newspaper that sealed his fate. Wisely, this time, he did not lie, and told officials to confirm the Goldsmith talks, while doing his best to limit the embarrassment of being caught red-handed. Asked point-blank if he is undermining Cameron, Johnson the statesman resorts to his usual self-parody and bluster to get off the hook. He finally replies with characteristically colourful – and disarming – hyperbole: ‘It is self-evident twaddle. As everybody remembers, I was one of the first in the tiny taxiful of supporters to back Cameron in 2005. Changes: It is time to adopt tough, US-style anti-strike laws, said Johnson, who was born in New York, pictured . ‘He’s a winner. He’ll win an Election outright in 2015. I remain a big backer of his and I’ve got four years of hard work here in London.’ Yet even when he is swearing allegiance to the PM, Boris makes it sound insincere by referring to Cameron’s ‘tiny taxiful of supporters’. Put on the spot over whether he will rule out a Commons return before the next General Election, due in 2015 – crucially, before his term as Mayor ends in 2016 – Boris the clown throws up another cloud of chaff.  Will he or won’t he rule it out? A simple ‘No’ will do. He has done it in the past, but appears reluctant to do so now. It’s back to Boris the bogus bumbler, ducking and diving with the mock flattery and self-deprecation that has allowed him to rewrite the rulebook of political and personal conduct. ‘Simon, I’m going to regretfully and respectfully, with deep respect and continued admiration for you and your style and interrogatory methods from which I’ve learned so much over the past 20 years, I’m going to respectfully, I’m going to see if I can meet Mr Wang, who’s pounding my door to come and invest in London. OK matey?’ And with that, he was off to meet Wang Hongzhang, chairman of the China Construction Bank, the world’s 13th largest company.","The London Mayor called on Cameron to .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Britain’s phone users are being charged more for calls and text messages at home than they are in Europe, a report claimed today. Following the EU’s introduction of lower caps on the cost of roaming in the region, consumer experts say that domestic customers are unprotected by price rises imposed by networks within the UK. Sending a text to another UK number can cost up to three times more from within Britain as it does when roaming in Europe, according to analysis by MoneySavingExpert.com. Going on holiday: Sending a text to another UK number can cost up to three times more from within Britain as it does when roaming in Europe, according to analysis by MoneySavingExpert.com . For example, Vodafone pay-as-you-go customers pay 14p for each text to UK numbers when at home - compared to just 5p when roaming. The . latest mobile roaming regulations from the EU, which were imposed last . month, have been put in place to protect people from being ripped-off . when using their phone within Europe. But at the same time, the costs of calls and text messages from UK to UK numbers has increased, the report said. Making . calls to European numbers is also much more expensive from within the . UK - with the cost coming in at up to eight times as much as when . roaming in Europe. The . research found that a ten-minute call from the UK to an Italian number . will cost no more than £15 - but the same call made from the same UK . mobile number from Sweden will be £1.80. Daniel Hannan, Conservative MEP for South . East England, told MailOnline: ‘There was no need for price-fixing in . what was already a competitive market. Falling prices: A new EU cap on roaming costs came in on July 1, which put a limit of 19¢ plus VAT a minute on the cost of outgoing calls. This equates to a total of 18.24p a minute, including VAT, for British consumers . Active mobile subscribers: Figures from telecoms regulator Ofcom state that the average UK pay-as-you-go user sends 135 texts and makes 51 minutes of calls in a month . ‘As a result of this cap, non-travellers . are subsidising travellers. Teenagers on council estates are subsidising people like MEPs and Eurocrats. Brussels is taking . from the poor to give to the rich.’ 'There was no need for price-fixing in what was already a competitive market. As a result of this cap, non-travellers are subsidising travellers' Daniel Hannan,MEP for South East England . Bizarrely, it can in fact be cheaper to use a foreign European SIM card when in the UK rather than a British one. The average pay-as-you-go user spends £26.91 on calls and texts but using a SIM from another European country will reduce this to £17.79 - saving more than £100 in a year. This calculation is based on figures from telecoms regulator Ofcom that the average UK pay-as-you-go user sends 135 texts and makes 51 minutes of calls in a month. However, you would pay to receive calls if using a foreign SIM. But if you received a similar number of minutes of calls each month – this would only add £2.55 to the cost, making the total £20.34. Texting UK numbers: On every mobile network examined in the report, bar Three's pay-as-you-go service, it is cheaper to send a text to a number in the UK while holidaying in Europe than it is when in the UK . Differences: The research found all the mobile operators charge their customers more to text a foreign European number from within the UK than when abroad . Steve Nowottny, consumer expert at MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ‘It simply defies logic and common sense that calling and texting a UK mobile often costs more from within the UK than it does when travelling in Europe. 'Despite being introduced to help keep costs down, the EU cost cap has led to a financial paradox and mobile prices which are bizarrely skewed' Steve Nowottny, MoneySavingExpert.com . ‘Despite being introduced to help keep costs down, the EU cost cap has led to a financial paradox and mobile prices which are bizarrely skewed. ‘People are getting savvy about protecting themselves from big bills when they go on holiday, but now they need to wise-up to the tips and tricks that can keep their costs down when making calls and sending text messages on home soil. ‘Ultimately though, mobile phone networks need to take a long hard look at their pricing structures and explain why they're able to charge their customers less when they're using their phone abroad than they do when they're at home.’ Receiving a text in Europe has been free since 2009, but last month the Mail reported how one in six travellers suffers a mobile phone bill shock after using their handsets abroad. Calling UK numbers: Excluding Three and GiffGaff, on all networks pay-as-you-go users have to spend more to call UK numbers from home than when in Europe . Location, location, location: On every UK mobile network, it is cheaper to call an EU number - either mobile or landline - while roaming in Europe than it is when in Britain . Consumer champion Which? warned that mobile networks were cashing in on the fact many travellers are in the dark about the cost of using handsets on holiday. A new cap on roaming costs came in on July 1, which put a limit of 19¢ plus VAT a minute on the cost of outgoing calls. This equates to a total of 18.24p a minute, including VAT, for British consumers. The cost of sending a text is capped at 6¢ plus VAT, which equates to 5.76p for UK families. The figure is 20¢ plus VAT – or a total of 19.2p – for one MB download of data. MailOnline reported in April how lawmakers in Brussels had voted to back a proposal to scrap EU roaming charges, which will be phased out by December 2015. The landmark ruling means that British people travelling to one of the 28-member states will have the same charges for calls, texts and mobile data use as they would using their mobile phones at home.","EU officials have introduced lower caps on the cost of roaming in Europe .

"Lynwen started weaving loom bands to make colourful bracelets for herself and her daughter, but soon wanted a larger challenge . One mother has got her holiday swimwear sorted - after making a bikini out of loom bands. Lynwen Stonelake, 25, from Swansea, South Wales, spent months making the colourful two-piece from the little plastic rings. The mother-of-one started making little bracelets for herself and her daughter, Lexi, two, but soon decided to try something more challenging. She said: 'I have always been quite arty and enjoyed making things. 'I was doing it for a little bit, but wasn't really massively into it. 'I thought it would be fun to make a bikini out of them, but I didn't think it could be done. 'Then I saw that someone had made a dress out of them, and I decided to give it a go. 'I made it completely from scratch and it took weeks - and three separate attempts before I cracked it! 'A lot of people said I must have a lot of patience to do it, it was very fiddly.' Now Lynwen hopes she'll be able to sell the two-piece, and donate some of the money to charity. 'I would give some money to Cancer Research in memory of my grandfather, Alan Perrin.' She said she has since made a crop top for her daughter, but said she was too young yet to have a go at making the loom bands herself. The trend for clothing made out of out the simple children's toy began to grow after one women placed a dress made of the plastic bands on eBay for over a hundred thousand pounds. Scroll down for video . One of the bikinis made by Lynwen Stonelake made out of bands . Helen Smith, 42, couldn't believe her luck when a dress she made from 24,000 loom bands reached the high bid of £170,000 after she posted it on eBay. However unfortunately the dress did not sell for that amount as the buyer pulled out. But that hasn't stopped more wannabe weavers being eager to follow suit and try to make a quick buck from their rubber band creations, with the online auction site being inundated with clothing and accessories made from the bright bands. A quick search reveals endless listings with some items having a price tag of more than £5,000. Fashion fans have crafted everything from bikinis to belts and even high-heeled shoes from the rainbow-coloured elastic bands. Going loomy: Lots of loom band enthusiasts are listing their fashion creations on online auction site eBay . The first ever man's 'loomkini' also recently went up for sale on the site on sale at starting price of £30. The listing of a 'thong made from the popular bands' was originally taken down as the image broke eBay's nudity laws. Even flip-flops and high heels created from the colourful bands are beginning to appear on eBay . The shoes aren't created entirely out of the bands but instead heels are decorated using the weave . Jumping on the band wagon: Helen Smith, 42, put her dress, made entirely from loom bands by her friend Katherine, on eBay and it reached £170,000 - since then the auction site has been inundated with loom band creations . For some of the weavers their creations are more than just a hobby. One listing advertised a bodycon boob-tube style dress being sold to raise funds for a big day. The dress was designed by Dani Hubbard 26, from Porth in Rhonnda, who enlisted her family to help make the dress which took them a grand total of 39 hours to create. Too much skin: Innes's original advertisement showed more of his figure than eBay allows (right) but his item has since been relisted and the 22-year-old is currently fetching bids over £50 . Dani is hoping that her efforts will pay for her wedding to partner Jamie. According to The Mirror newspaper Dani was hoping to have enough to set aside a little extra to help buy her brother a car to thank him for helping with the dress. 'It was my brother's idea to make such a fashionable dress, and he helped me decide on the particular style we ended up with after we had discussed it. I haven't seen anything on the internet like it.' Dani Hubbard is hoping that her complicated design might fetch enough to cover the cost of her wedding...not to mention a car for her brother . Pick of the crop: This revealing crop top is one of the many inventive designs currently listed on the site . 'I just thought that if the other lady could do it, then so can I. There's a huge craze going on at the moment with these bands, so I gave it a go' continued the hopeful bride-to-be. However it appears that the increasing availability of loom band clothing is seeing the value of the garments decrease. 11-year-old Abigail Baker from Desborough, Northamptonshire, spent seven days crafting a loom band dress from 25,000 of the elastic bands. A family affair: Abigail will spend her £45 profit on a fish and chip dinner with her folks on their next holiday . Abigail used £90 worth of the bands and saw her dress go under the hammer for just £155. However the school girl seemed unscathed and thanked her family for the support. 'My family have . been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £90 to make this . dress and have supported me all the way.' Unlike Dani, Abigail has much more humble plans for her loom band profit. She said she wanted to raise at least . £50 cash so she could give her four-year-old brother Liam £10, keep £20 . for her to spend in the arcades and £20 for a fish and chip dinner . treat while on holiday in Weymouth, Dorset, next month.

"By . Nikki Murfitt . The language of love does not come easily to 22-year-old graduate Brent Zillwood, a freelance film-maker diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome six years ago. Inappropriate outbursts or swearing make it difficult for him to approach women, although in an ironic twist, being in love helps minimise the effects of his condition. ‘Being in love is like a form of medication for my Tourette’s,' he reveals. 'When I’m sleeping next to someone I have no Tourette’s, no insomnia, no nightmares, nothing.' Scroll down for video . Tourette's sufferer: Brent Zillwood has struggled to find love because of his outbursts, which are brought on by his syndrome . Brent is one of the unusual singletons battling to find love against the odds on Channel 4 series, The Undateables. His co-stars include men and women with dwarfism, a man with Asperger's and even a woman with Apert syndrome, a condition that causes the face to distort. But with 70 per cent of British people saying that they wouldn't even consider dating a person with disabilities in a recent sex survey, Brent and his co-stars are facing an uphill struggle. Brent's story began at the age of 15 when he woke up one morning and noticed he had a small twitch in his head and neck. Within three months he was dealing with physical and vocal outbursts and the effect on his life was devastating. Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological condition that affects the brain and nervous system. Named after French doctor, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the syndrome in the 19th century, it is characterised by involuntary noises and movements. Tics are usually vocal (grunting, coughing and shouting) or physical, with typical movements including jerking the head or jumping up and down. Most sufferers are first diagnosed during childhood and it is linked to ADHD and obsessive compulsive disorder. Source: NHS . ‘Initially my parents had no idea what was going on and assumed that as a teenager going through puberty, it was a phase. 'When I was diagnosed I was determined to try and get on with my life like any other 15-year-old but it was incredibly difficult especially as I was living in a small town at the time and I really stuck out which was very isolating,' admits Brent. Although he was still dating his childhood sweetheart at the time, the impact of his diagnosis put enormous strain on the relationship. When they split up five years later, Brent was devastated and the effects on his health were disastrous. ‘I was at university and, unfortunately, the Tourette’s feeds off low points in my life. I was so ill my weight dropped to seven stone. 'Doctors managed to help me with medication and I slowly recovered. I started going out and making friends but the anxiety of going on a first date can bring on the tics and I can start twitching or swearing. 'In the back of my mind, I am always . worrying that the Tourette’s is going to draw attention to me, and . therefore to my date, which will make her feel really awkward because . the whole room will be staring at her. Film maker: Brent in a still for a mini documentary he made to document his battle with Tourette's . Devastated: When Brett and his childhood sweetheart broke up, the effect on his health was disastrous . 'Going out with me is like going on a date with a live grenade and hoping that it doesn’t go off. I hate the awkward silences because that is when the Tourette’s really wants to come out. 'I can never tell how my Tourette’s is going to act. I wish I could keep it at home on the days I am going on dates,' says Brent. He now hopes that his appearance on The Undateables, his second, will help him overcome his dating hang-ups and find that special someone. But his foray into TV hasn't always proved the impetus he's looking for. In the last series, he met bar worker Lizzie, 19, and hit it off with her during a snowboarding trip. Constant anxiety: Going out with Brent is like 'going on a date with a live grenade' Sadly, it fizzled out soon after the cameras stopped rolling. 'We dated a few times and really got on well. 'I could relax in her company and that kept my tics at bay. But sadly the initial spark fizzled out but we have remained good friends and still keep in touch. 'Since I appeared on the show people . recognise me around town and have been friendly and understanding about . my Tourette’s which has given me a huge confidence boost. ‘I . have gone out with my mates and while I don’t go up to a girl and tell . her I have Tourette’s, if we get into conversation I’ve found that . talking about the condition can actually be an ice-breaker. Has Brent found love? He was instantly won over by Challis's confidence and playful personality . 'But,' he adds, 'I would still like to find love which is why the producers matched me with another date.' This time, he was matched with Challis, 26, an actress and model and Brent admits : ‘Even the Tourette’s voice in my head was shouting, ""Boom, Jackpot!""' Her confidence and fun instantly won Brent over and she wasn’t fazed by his tics. ‘I shouted out loud during one of our dates and it just passed over her head like it hadn’t happened.

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . For someone whose efforts were so crucial to the Allied victory in the Second World War, it’s surprising how little is known about him. But new research has revealed how unsung hero Colonel Thomas Kendrick was the top MI6 officer at the centre of Britain's intelligence work - and helped save tens of thousands of lives. Colonel Kendrick led an extraordinary operation of spying on German prisoners of war by listening in on their conversations with cellmates from 1942 at Latimer House near Chesham, Buckinghamshire. Unsung hero: Colonel Kendrick led an extraordinary operation of spying on German prisoners of war . Listening house: Latimer Estate in Buckinghamshire. Specially-constructed wartime buildings can be seen in the background. The whole site was used for clandestine work, including the house in the foreground . Latimer House was one of three secret . intelligence sites run by Colonel Kendrick, with 1,000 staff employed . and 10,000 prisoners conversations’ bugged across all of them. Some . of the important conversations first overheard in 1943 regarded Adolf . Hitler’s secret missiles, the V1, V2 and V3, which saw Winston Churchill . order their development sites to be bombed. Historian . Helen Fry - who has profiled Colonel Kendrick in her new book - said . that without this, the Allies could not have carried out the crucial . D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944. Dr . Fry told MailOnline: ‘The listeners first heard of the secret weapons. So, as a direct result, Churchill gave the order to bomb Peenemünde in . Germany. ‘Without that it’s . believed we wouldn’t have been able to do the D-Day landings. Hitler was . planning to fire 300 a day on London. We’re talking about highly . sophisticated stuff.’ Top secret: Listeners and some of the intelligence staff during World War Two outside Latimer House . Highest-ranking prisoners: Some of the 59 German generals held at Trent Park near Cockfosters, north London - one of the two other sites used by Kendrick's men. The third was Wilton Park, near Beaconsfield . She added: ‘Without bombing the development sites, we would have lost the war - there was no real defence, especially against the V2 and V3. 'If the V1 and V2 development hadn't been delayed in 1943, we couldn't have mounted the D-Day landings without a military disaster. In that sense, Kendrick's unit was pivotal for the downfall of Hitler.' The first V1 missles were eventually launched against London on June 13, 1944, a week after D-Day. They were pilotless, jet-propelled planes that flew by air-driven gyroscope and magnetic compass. Colonel Kendrick had previously been spying for Britain at the heart of Europe’s espionage hub in in Vienna, Austria, where he helped save up to 200 Jews a day between March and August 1938. But he was then denounced by a double agent to Hitler’s Secret Service and was arrested by the Gestapo. However, after four days of interrogations he was released and returned to England. Bugging conversations: Latimer House was one of three secret intelligence sites run by Colonel Kendrick . Before the Second World War: Colonel Kendrick, when he worked as a spymaster from Vienna in the 1930s . Dr Fry said: ‘He then completely disappears, but behind the scenes he’s working for M16 head office. Kendrick is tasked with getting ready a unit to bug prisoners of war as soon as war breaks out. ‘You have the prisoners who have all this knowledge in their head, but are not necessarily going to give it out in interrogation. Kendrick has three sites - he started in the Tower of London. ‘Then he moved out to Trent Park near Cockfosters. He then took over Latimer House, but the prisoners were only there for two or three days. The third place was Wilton Park, near Beaconsfield.’ She said that the prisoners would be bugged from ‘when they woke up in the morning to when they went to sleep’, adding: ‘The impact of this on the war is hugely significant and underrated.’ Churchill was a big fan of the work being done at Latimer House - he ‘loved the fact that we could understand the mind-set of the enemy’ and would regularly travel the 30 miles from London to visit. Telegram: A message from the British Ambassador in Berlin to 'C', the head of MI6, telling him of Colonel Kendrick's arrest in August 1938. Colonel Kendrick was interrogated for four days but then released . Crucial: A historian said that without this the discoveries by Colonel Kendrick's units of Hitler's secret weapons, the Allies could not have carried out the D-Day invasion (pictured) of Normandy on June 6, 1944 . Research: Historian Helen Fry (pictured at The National Archives) has profiled Colonel Kendrick for her book . Dr Fry said: ‘In the early days Kendrick had British-born male listeners – they didn’t want the women to listen to coarse language. 'You have the prisoners who have all this knowledge in their head, but are not necessarily going to give it out in interrogation' Dr Helen Fry, historian . ‘They were always fluent German speakers, but the problem they found by 1942 was the dialect was very difficult to understand. They then decided to draft in German-speaking refugees. ‘We bugged the conservations of 10,000 prisoners. There were close to half a million prisoners, but not all would have been significant enough to have the treatment.’ Dr Fry, who is originally from Devon but now lives in Golders Green, north-west London, is hosting a book launch for ‘Spymaster: The Secret Life of Kendrick’ on August 26 at 3pm at Latimer House.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A 'drunk' driver careered off a residential road, knocked down a lamppost and crashed into the front of a house - but still staggered away unhurt. Residents of the Victorian house - which has been converted into three flats - described the noise as being like 'gunfire' when the Ford Focus piled through the wooden porch and front wall. It came to a halt less than a metre from a downstairs bathroom at the property in Barnet, north London causing thousands of pounds worth of damage. Scroll down for video . A driver came off a road, knocked down a lamppost and then crashed his Ford Focus into a property in Barnet . The crash on Tuesday night left a gaping hole in the front wall and wooden porch of the converted house . The car came to a halt less than a metre from a downstairs bathroom at the property in Barnet, north London . Paul Rea, 56, was in his ground-floor bedroom when the black Ford crashed into the house at 11.31pm on Tuesday night. He told the London Evening Standard: 'We heard a huge noise and the whole house shook. There was dust everywhere and parts of the car all over. 'The car was stuck halfway out of the house. The driver and his passenger were still around and were looking for something in the car. 'Thankfully they missed my front room and my bathroom. If I had been in those rooms, the car would have missed me by less than a metre. 'God forbid anyone would have been walking down the stairs or coming back to the house, they would have had no chance.' A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, dangerous driving, possession of cannabis, committing grievous bodily harm and assaulting a police officer . Margaret Redmond, 52, who lives in the upstairs flat, said: 'I first thought the noise was thunder' Neighbour Samantha Dossett, 40, who saw the crash, said: 'I was watching TV in bed with my husband when all of a sudden we heard two small bangs,  quickly followed by a massive bang. 'It sounded like gunfire, like a bomb had gone off.I rushed outside in time to see the passenger and the driver crawl out of the car. They looked dazed and confused, but not injured. 'Police were here within seconds, and the driver got very aggressive. She added: 'A police officer who took my statement told me they suspected the driver had been drinking. 'I'm not surprised, it would have had to take some pretty spectacularly bad driving to come off the road and hit that house. I'm just glad everybody is okay.' Neighbours were trapped in the house until 6am the following morning as workers cleared the debris away . Neighbour Samantha Dossett, 40, who saw the crash, said: 'It sounded like gunfire, like a bomb had gone off' Margaret Redmond and her husband John, who live in an upstairs flat, came running down to find the hallway blocked by a pile of smashed bricks and rubble. Mrs Redmond, 52, said: 'I first thought the noise was thunder. I scrambled to get dressed and opened the front door and the stairs had gone.' The couple were trapped in their flat until until 6am on Wednesday as the car was removed and workers cleared the debris from the entrance hall. Surveyors for housing association Family Mosaic carried out an assessment and found that the structure of the building is safe. It is estimated that the cost to the building will be thousands of pounds.

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Louise Hitchen stole more than £96,000 and spent it on a boob job, a car and holidays to Ghana and Ireland, but will only pay £23,892 back . Scroll down for video . An office manager who stole nearly £100,000 from her clients to pay for a boob job and a sports car will only have to give around a quarter of the money back. Louise Hitchen, 27, swindled £96,620 while working at a PPI claims firm and was jailed for 12 months in May. The mother-of-one diverted the funds to her own bank account on 15 different occasions, and spent £3,000 on breast enhancement during a downward spiral into drink and drug abuse. Hitchen, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, also blew thousands of pounds of clients' cash on holidays to Holland and Ghana, an abortion, online shopping and a Vauxhall Astra convertible. A proceeds of crime hearing at Liverpool Crown Court heard that Hitchens, who worked for Hardwick Financial Solutions, in Wigan, had assets worth £23,849 and had paid this money back in an out-of-court settlement. At her sentencing in May, a jury heard how Hitchen's offending began when she secretly transferred £3,000 funds to her own bank account to pay for an abortion. Greed quickly took over and by the time her fraud came to light she had already left the firm having taken £93,000. The company had to halt plans for expansion and 10 members of staff were laid off as a result. Jailing her, Judge Robert Warnock said 'A significant driving force behind this fraud was greed and the wish to artificially boost her own self-esteem.' When she joined the company in March 2011 she was described as “keen and enthusiastic”, but by July the following year her performance had deteriorated and she was subject to disciplinary proceedings. Hitchen spent £3,000 of the stolen money on breast enlargement, and was jailed in May for 12 months . Hitchen's 'The Only Way is Essex' lifestyle drew the attention of her boss because she was spending fare more than she earned, but she told him her boyfriend was sending her money from overseas . Her line manager became suspicious when she started living a 'The Only Way is Essex' lifestyle, buying a car, having her breasts enlarged and buying clothes online, but Hitchen claimed her boyfriend worked overseas and was sending her cash. She left the company in October 2012, but in December that year a client complained that they had not been paid out and investigations revealed that the cash had gone into Hitchen’s payroll bank account. Hitchen claimed it had been 'a one-off', but inquires showed more payments totalling £28,574. She paid £20,000 back then, as well as handing over her car. In March 2013 another client complained that they had not been paid out and it was found that Hitchen had diverted other funds to herself but destroyed the audit trail. It was only then that the full extent of her fraud was revealed. The company, Hardwick Financial Solutions (offices pictured), had to lay off 10 staff because of the lost money . Speaking after the sentencing in May, Detective Constable Mark Edwards, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'In the space of about four months Louise Hitchen stole close to £100,000. 'With the exception of the cosmetic surgery and car - which has since been returned - Louise Hitchen frittered away much of the cash on shopping sprees and trips out. 'The cost to Hardwick Financial Solutions LTD has been significant and has included staff losing their jobs but the only person Louise thought about while she had her ""hand in the till"" was herself.'","Louise Hitchen swindled £96,620 while working at a PPI claims firm .

"By . Harriet Hernando . Plans are being drawn up for a new high-speed orbital railway connecting London's zone three suburbs in a bid to keep the capital's soaring population moving over the next few decades. London mayor Boris Johnson revealed the scheme in his London Infrastructure 2050 plan and predicted the capital would see a population shift to the east with Barking possibly becoming the next Piccadilly Circus within 100 years time. He said about £200bn of spending on transport infrastructure alone would be needed in the capital by 2050 to keep suburbs like Barking, Walthamstow, Bexley Heath, Hounslow, Neasden and Harrigay up to speed and connected with the heart of the city. Scroll down for video . The Mayor of London's plans for a £200bn orbital railway would connect London's suburbs in zone three and beyond and even transform Barking into the next Piccadilly Circus . Barking, in zone four of London, is linked by the tube and overground, but Boris Johnson's plans to bring the new orbital railway could bring prosperity to the area and even transform it into the next Piccadilly Circus . A number of businesses in Hounslow have closed down and been boarded up but the new orbital railway London mayor Boris Johnson is proposing could bring prosperity to the area . The idea . for an additional rail service has grown from the success of London . Overground which has helped regenerate areas and decongest tube lines. But . where London Overground largely connects zone two, the orbital railway . will link suburbs in zones three and four including Harringay and . Barking - and even Sutton in zone five. As London's population grows over the next few decades, demand for rail transport is expected to increase by 80 per cent. Mr Johnson was in the east London borough to launch his plan, which he described as ‘a real wake-up call to the stark needs that face London over the next half century’. He said: ‘Without a long-term plan for investment and the political will to implement it, this city will falter. Londoners need to know they will get the homes, water, energy, schools, transport, digital connectivity and better quality of life that they expect.’ The Overground mainly covers London areas in zone two but the new orbital railway would extend from zone three right through to the outskirts encompassing some zone five areas like Sutton . Boris Johnson's plans for a new metro-style train link in East London are based on the success of the Overground (pictured) which has brought prosperity to the suburbs . Barking was historically a fishing settlement on the River Roding in the county of Essex. But when the railway arrived in 1854 the 5,000 strong population was given access to other forms of work in the centre of London. And when the tube arrived in 1908, the population swelled to around 37,000, taking advantage of the suburb's transport links. Barking is nine miles from central London with a current population of 187,000, the majority of which are within the Becontree estate . The major has earmarked the area for further regeneration and the former industrial lands to the south are being redeveloped as Barking Riverside, with plans to build more than 10,000 homes. Office suites, shops and restaurants will also be built in a bid to bring more jobs to the area. But planning permission has been granted for only a fraction of that until the new rail links arrive. It is hoped the new orbital railway will bring prosperity to areas in the east that have been earmarked for new homes. Barking Riverside, a piece of former industrial land sandwiched between the A13 and the Thames, has been marked for almost 11,000 new homes but planning permission has been granted for only a fraction of that until new rail links arrive. Mr Johnson toured the new area after launching his new plans for the capital’s infrastructure. He said: ‘This will be Piccadilly Circus here in 100 years' time. ‘Transport infrastructure makes all the difference to the prospects of a community.’ And he reckons 50,000 new homes will need to be built in the capital to meet the needs of Londoners. He said: ‘Population growth is unstoppable. You've got to go with the grain of how people want to live their lives. 'If they want to live in the greatest city in the world, there's no point in trying to fight them off with a pitchfork.’ But he ruled out building on the green belt, explaining that green infrastructure is just as important as the city’s other utilities and called for an extra 9000 hectares to be provided.","London Mayor Boris Johnson announced project in Infrastructure 2050 Plan .

"By . Lucy Crossley . With the swollen Thames already flooding homes, and thousands more at risk this week might not have been the best time to launch plans for outdoor swimming pools along the river. Thousands of homes have either already flooded or are at risk of doing so, with the Thames bursting its banks in both Berkshire and Surrey. And yet developers have chosen this week to launch their scheme for public swimming areas along the river in London. Fancy a dip: This scheme to build swimming pools in the Thames was launched in the same week that hundreds of homes were flooded by the river . Location: This pool would be situated at Blackfriars Bridge, close to a proposed super sewer vent . Architects Studio Octopi, the designers behind the scheme say the 25metre pools, would offer users a place to exercise, but would also provide a 'habitat for fish, birds and a wide range of flora.' 'The improvements in water quality open the possibility for once again swimming in the tidal Thames,' said Chris Romer-Lee of Studio Octopi. 'These proposals look to re-establish this intimate and playful link between Londoners and the historic lifeblood of the city. Londoners have an opportunity to reclaim ownership of their largest outdoor public space.' The fixed pools would be split across two levels and sit on a concrete slab suspended on the steel frame, while the second adjoining floating structure would be free to rise and fall with the tide. Plans: The fixed pools would be split across two levels and sit on a concrete slab suspended on the steel frame, while the second adjoining floating structure would be free to rise and fall with the tide . Natural: The designers behind the scheme say the 25metre pools would offer users a place to exercise, but would also provide a 'habitat for fish, birds and a wide range of flora' As the supporting structure weathers, the designers hope it would be colonised by algae, ferns and saline plants such as sea beet and sea aster, while the pool itself would also be home to salt marsh species such as rushes and water plantains. Over the next 10 years Thames Water is planning major improvements to the London sewer system, including so-called new super sewers. The current system, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, opened in 1865 and 150 years later the sewers are running at full capacity. In 2012, 57 combined sewer overflows discharged 39 million tonnes of sewage into the River Thames. Weathered: As the supporting structure weathers, the designers hope it would be colonised by algae, ferns and saline plants such as sea beet and sea aster . The designers behind the scheme have earmarked the Thames Baths Project for the sites of the proposed Super Sewer vents: Shadwell in the east of the . city and Blackfriars Bridge in central London. 'Our scheme doesn’t rely on the Super Sewer it relies on the government . taking action and commissioning a clean-up programme for the Thames as . the (existing) Bazalgette sewers are near capacity,' said Mr Romer-Lee. He added: 'The Blackfriars site was chosen for both the Super Sewer . vent but also because of its proximity to both the City of London and . London’s cultural quarter (Southbank, Tate etc). I love places in cities . that are not defined by one profession/type; where City workers, . tourists, the arts, sport and leisure are all mixed up. Funding: The designers are considering using crowdfunding to finance the scheme, as with a similar project in New York, as well as looking for individual investors . 'We are . still meeting lots of people in connection to the proposals to . understand where we will go from here. We’ve had such a positive . response it has renewed momentum.' Asked about the project being launched in the same week that much of the Thames flooded Mr Romer-Lee said that the flooding highlighted the need for action to be taken on the current sewer system serving London. 'This is one of many major infrastructure projects that need to occur to look after our beloved city,' he said. The designers are considering using crowdfunding to finance the scheme, as with a similar project in New York, as well as looking for individual investors. The project is a collaboration between Studio Octopi, engineers Civic Engineers and Jonathan Cook Landscape Architects, who were chosen to conceive visions for the Thames as part of The Architecture Foundation’s programme ‘London As It Could Be Now’ project. The teams were encouraged to explore ideas that increased interaction with the waterway and raised awareness of this important artery running through the Capital.","Architects have submitted plans to build swimming pools in central London .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Ray Massey . A leading architect has compared Boris Johnson’s plans for a Thames Estuary  airport to the grandiose projects Adolf Hitler might have dreamed up. Sir Terry Farrell, who designed the MI6 spy building, said the London Mayor’s plan for a £65billion airport was ‘mad’. Sir Terry said: ‘When people say that you have got to have vision, well Hitler had vision. 'Vision can be a madness where you get so obsessed you throw everything you have got on the roulette table and hope you got it right.’ Hitler famously had his architect Albert Speer draw up plans on an epic scale for a radically re-designed Berlin – to be renamed ‘Germania’. Vision: Foster Island (pictured) on the Isle of Grain has today been backed by the Mayor of London above his own Boris Island plan because of its proximity to London . Argument: Announcing his three preferred options for aviation expansion Boris said today that building a new runway at Heathrow would be 'crackers' All change: Boris Johnson's plans for a new airport would demand that Heathrow is bought and replaced with a 250,000 new London borough . Sir Terry, who has designed some of . the world’s largest airports and train stations, including Charing . Cross, said the four-runway proposal was on an unprecedented scale for . the UK and made the HS2 high-speed rail project ‘look like chicken . feed’. Mr Johnson yesterday underlined his . commitment to an estuary airport by naming Sir Norman Foster’s Isle of . Grain plan as his first choice. The Mayor also wants to shut Heathrow at a cost of £15billion to create a new London borough for 250,000 residents. But Sir Terry, who is working on . Gatwick’s bid to build a second runway, said closing Heathrow and moving . the capital city’s main airport to the east would mean  ‘flipping . London’. Sir Terry was approached by the Mayor to work on his project but turned it down. Announcing his three preferred options to expand aviation capacity in the UK this morning, he ruled out a 'crackers' third runway at Heathrow and demanded a new airport east of London or the expansion of Stansted instead. Mr Johnson said: 'Ambitious cities all . over the world are already stealing a march on us and putting . themselves in a position to eat London's breakfast, lunch and dinner by . constructing mega airports that plug them directly into the global . supply chains that we need to be part of. 'Those cities have moved heaven and . earth to locate their airports away from their major centres of . population, in areas where they have been able to build airports with . four runways or more. 'For London and the wider . UK to remain competitive we have to build an airport capable of . emulating that scale of growth. Anyone who believes there would be the . space to do that at Heathrow, which already blights the lives of . hundreds of thousands of Londoners, is quite simply crackers.' He also admitted that Boris Island might be a 'bit far away' from London and said that Foster Island was his preferred option. Boris has backed the four-runway 'Foster Island' (pictured), which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the Isle of Grain in Kent . Elaborate plan: The Isle of Grain's  proposed international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes . Once shut down, any Heathrow buyout would be bank-rolled . by the Government and the Mayor's aviation adviser Daniel Moylan has . said its rail, road and Tube links would make it an ideal place for a . new development on the western edge of the capital. 'FOSTER ISLAND': The inner estuary site on Kent's Isle of Grain is close enough to London to provide smooth and fast access by public transport, yet ideally located so as to allow take-off and landing over water and so impact on as small a population as possible. It sits in an area with a strong industrial history, and is across the water from the new DP World London Gateway Port. A new hub airport there would lay the foundation for a future logistics heartland of the UK. 'BORIS ISLAND': An airport on an artificial island off the Kent coast would remove all problems of noise pollution and give the airport the freedom to operate in whatever way it needed in order to maximise the UK’s connectivity and economic benefits. STANSTED EXPANSION: Developing a major four-runway airport at Stansted would have the attraction of building on existing infrastructure and being sited in a relatively sparsely populated region, Stansted has none of the environmental or wildlife issues that would need to be overcome in the estuary. 'For an airport, that is not very good . connectivity. But most outer London boroughs would bite your hand off . for transport links like that,' he said. But . Heathrow bosses say shutting down their airport would cost almost . 80,000 jobs, the biggest cull since Britain's coal mine closures during . the 1980s. 'It seems extraordinary that any Mayor . of London would propose forcibly buying and then closing Heathrow. The . Mayor's proposals would leave 114,000 people facing redundancy, cost . taxpayers more and take longer to deliver than building on the strength . we already have at Heathrow,' a spokesman said. This morning Mr Johnson announced that . 'Foster Island', 'Boris Island' or the expansion of Stansted airport . would be the three best ways to . solve Britain's lack of aviation capacity. Mr Johnson's plans will be submitted later this week to the Government-appointed . Airport Commission headed by Sir Howard Davies, who will help the Government make the final decision. Mr . Johnson said that a new hub airport would be able to support more than . 375,000 new jobs by 2050 and add £742billion to the value of goods and . services produced in the UK. He . said it could be built by 2029, with a hybrid bill . being passed by parliament to secure approval for the airport, the . surface access and the acquisition of Heathrow. Two ideas: This graphic shows how planners have designed two new airports on the Thames, one on the edge of Isle of Grain nicknamed 'Foster Island' and the 'Boris Island' proposal in the middle of the estuary . Talking about the future of the . Heathrow area should a new airport be sited elsewhere, Mr Johnson said . that part of west London, with good transport links, had the space and . infrastructure to generate up to 100,000 new homes that London badly . needed. There was the potential to attract . tens of thousands of jobs in a number of different sectors and while . some workers at Heathrow would relocate to the new airport, many others . would find work in a newly-developed Heathrow area. Mr Johnson's chief adviser on . aviation, Daniel Moylan, said: 'Heathrow can never solve our problems . and our studies show that we're better off with a new site. 'The immense noise, pollution and . congestion that would result from expanding an airport located in the . heart of our suburbs would potentially devastate the greatest city in . the world.' The mayor's original preferred plan had been nicknamed Boris Island in his honour as he has championed the . idea to build it on an artificial island made of landfill. It would be two miles north of the . Isle of Sheppey and ferries would link the site to Kent and Essex while a . railway bridge could connect it to the mainland. If the Isle of Grain plan happens the scheme is expected to be designed by eminent architect . Lord Foster and an airport would have a minimum of four runways, with space to build two more. Vision: This is what Stansted Airport could look like if it was turned into a four-runway superhub (design above and plan below) Marches: Celebrities including chef Jamie Oliver have joined protest to prevent Stansted growing in any way . The entire project would cost about £65 billion, including a new train line taking passengers to Waterloo in 26 minutes. Planes would descend over the North Sea rather than densely populated . parts of London, as many do when coming in to Heathrow. Mr Johnson now says that the Isle of Grain plan has the 'greatest single potential for regeneration'. The . blueprint involves an opening scheduled for 2029, requiring . infrastructure improvements such as extending Crossrail and widening the . M25 an extra lane in each direction for 36 miles. Ongoing fight: A longstanding campaign has been fought to prevent a third Heathrow runway, but if airports move to the east of the London, tens of thousands will lose their jobs . On . top of those three suggestions, Heathrow will be revealing its own . plans to expand with a third and maybe even fourth runway. The . Mayor also argues that Stansted could be transformed into a . four-runway international super-airport as part of a 'compromise' package. A super high speed rail link - cutting the journey time to London to 25 minutes - would also be built to support its growth. But . it will still be highly controversial as proposals for a second runway . there have already led to years of protests from people living under its . flighpath. Stansted has . been targeted by many protests including one where more than 50 people . burst onto its runway and shut it down for more than five hours. Celebrities including Jamie Oliver have also joined other protests.","Mayor unveils his preferred options to expand UK's aviation capacity .

"By . Neil Ashton for the Daily Mail . Whenever things are going well at White Hart Lane, Tottenham's supporters rise as one to remind their great rivals they are back in the game. 'Stand up if you hate Arsenal' reverberated around this great arena after Tottenham scored their second and third goals in this Europa League play-off. That's what four wins on the spin can do to you. No manager in Tottenham's history - and they've had a few in recent years - has got off to a start like this. Long may it continue. VIDEO Scroll down for Pochettino: My philosophy is simple play football, work hard . Jumping for joy: Harry Kane celebrates giving Tottenham the lead aginst AEL . No mistake: Kane scores the opening goal for Spurs on the stroke of half time . Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris 6.5; Naughton 7, Kaboul 6.5, Chiriches 6.5 (Veljkovic 85), Davies 6; Townsend 6, Sandro 6.5 (Holtby 77), Paulinho 8, Dembele 7, Lennon 6.5; Kane 7.

Subs not used: Espana, Miguel Carlitos, Eleftheriou, Nadeau. Booked: Fegrouch, Bebe. Attendance: 29,976 . Referee: Miroslav Zelinka (Czech Republic) 7 . Ratings by NEIL ASHTON at White Hart Lane . This turned into an open training session against AEL Limassol, an exercise in possession and penetration as Mauricio Pochettino's team sailed into the group phase. The bigger picture is the Barclays Premier League and Sunday's fixture with Liverpool. Last year they lost 5-0 against a rampant Liverpool side at White Hart Lane and that cannot happen again. They owe Brendan Rodgers and his team. Here, against opposition with limited ability and even less ambition, they were in cruise control. Harry Kane, who missed a first half penalty, Paulinho and Andros Townsend scored their goals. In truth it could have been many more. 'Our philosophy is to play football, to work hard, to play on the grass and at the moment the players are happy,' admitted Pochettino. 'That is important. Now we need to prepare for Sunday's game against Liverpool because it will be very different. 'They invested a lot of money, but we have chosen a different route.' They certainly have, but for now they can reflect on another impressive performance in front of those demanding supporters at White Hart Lane. Kane's chance came early, taking responsibility for Tottenham's first penalty when Kyle Naughton was taken out by Limassol keeper Karim Fegrouch in the sixth minute. Down he goes: Karim Fegrouch concedes a penalty against Tottenham's Kyle Naughton . Early set back: AEL gave away an early penalty and lost goalkeeper Fegrouch to injury . Off you go: Fegrouch is taken off on a stretcher with an injury to his face . Spot of bother: Pulpo Romero saves Kane's spot kick early in the first half . It was a stupid, clumsy challenge that could easily have ended with a red card. In the event, he was forced off with an injury after seven minutes of treatment. Kane missed his chance, blasting the ball straight at Limassol's substitute keeper Pupo Romero when the penalty was finally taken in the 13th minute. 'It is possible to miss penalty, that's not important,' claimed Pochettino. 'It is better for him to play and score. He showed character and the personality to recover. He's a very good player.' At times he looks it. Despite the disappointment, he was undeterred and so were Spurs. Kane had a couple of chances before the break, failing to even hit the target when he cottoned on to Aaron Lennon's clever backheel. Making sure: Paulinho scores Spurs' second goal of the night to put them in the driving seat . Job done: Paulinho celebrates his second half goal that put Spurs 4-1 up on aggregate . He got there in the end, scoring in the 44th minute when Paulinho provided the incisive pass for Kane to streak into the box unmarked. His finish, neatly taken off the instep of his right boot, was warmly received by the supporters inside White Hart Lane. They see Kane as one of their own, a young man who has come through the youth ranks and sent on a tour of Championship teams to gain experience. He signed a new five year contract earlier this month, a sign that his new manager likes what he sees in his young brood. Spot on: Andros Townsend makes no mistake from the penalty spot as he makes it 3-0 on the night . Marching on: Paulinho and Townsend celebrate as the winger scored his penalty . Tottenham’s manager made nine changes from Sunday’s 4-0 demolition of QPR and their route into Friday's Europa League draw was never really in doubt. The insurance policy, the first team players who have helped Tottenham to win their opening two games in the Barclays Premier League were on the bench. Just in case. On the pitch they had three players - Paulinho, Moussa Dembele and Sandro - in the centre of midfield demanding the ball into their feet from Hugo Lloris. Paulinho scored their second, moving through the gears and finishing sweetly beyond Romero at the start of the second half. He deserved his goal for this assured performance. Going close: Sandro has an unsuccessful shot on goal during Spurs' win . Job done: Kane celebrates at the end of the game as Spurs won 3-0 . On to Aaron Lennon. The Tottenham winger deserved more from his majestic chip, beating the keeper from 18 yards only to see his effort deflected wide for a corner. Still, they had time for one more. Kane stepped aside when they were awarded another penalty and Townsend, recalled to the England squad yesterday, made no mistake. On Sunday, when Liverpool are back in town, they will discover just how far they have come.","Harry Kane gave Spurs the lead on the stroke of half time .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Doctors and nurses face being banned from eating junk food in hospital canteens to force them to set an example to patients. NHS England boss Simon Stevens said staff must 'get our own act together' before it can lecture the public on cutting down on calories. He said too many hospitals serve 'chips and burgers' to both patients and staff, and suggested more 'positive incentives' should be offered to encourage healthier meals. Too many hospital canteens serve junk food like burgers and chips to staff and patients, the head of the NHS has warned . Around 700,000 of the NHS's 1.3 million staff are either overweight or obese and Mr Stevens wants to introduce incentives for them to lose weight. More gyms are to be built and NHS sites will become increasingly cycle friendly, while prizes such as pedometers will be on offer for staff who shed the pounds. Mr Stevens said the rising obesity epidemic of recent years was bad both for people's health and for the health service itself, and tackling obesity would put less pressure on the nation's finances and would free up funding for new treatments. Recent figures show that almost three quarters of people aged 45 to 74 in England are either overweight or obese. Young adults are the only age group who have a normal average body mass index, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The NHS is facing a funding crisis and senior health figures have said it may need an extra £30 billion by 2020 to maintain the current level of service provision. NHS England boss Simon Stevens (right) said staff must 'get our own act together' before it can lecture the public on cutting down on calories . The clock could be turned back on staff meals, with nurses and doctors offered simpler, healthier meals . Promising to tackle the obesity problem, Mr Stevens told The Sun: 'It's hard for the NHS to talk about how important this is if we don't get our own act together. I think the NHS has got to take an example in helping our own staff and hopefully other employers will follow suit. 'A lot of the food in hospital canteens, not just for patients, but for staff, is chips and burgers. The NHS as an employer, for our own nurses and other staff, could we offer positive incentives? Yes, I think we could. And some hospitals have begun doing that.' Mr Stevens also called on parents to help keep their children healthy by swapping juices and fizzy drinks during meal times for water or milk. Looking to the future, he said that further progress in technology would keep patients out of hospital as people live longer, and he wants greater partnership between the NHS and social services. He said: 'What's great about the NHS can't excuse what needs to change about the NHS. That is the approach that we have got to take. We've got to support people doing great things, nurses, doctors, the frontline of healthcare. But we've also got to raise our game.' He also called for thousands more GPs to be trained, and wants to give them more power to make decisions about how NHS money is spent.","NHS boss Simon Stevens said staff must 'get our own act together'

"By . Chris Cutmore for MailOnline . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Tiger Woods has admitted he withdrew from Ryder Cup contention because he felt unable to win a single point for the United States due to ongoing back problems. The 14-time major winner looked a broken man during his slump at the US PGA Championship and it was no surprise last week when he said he would not be available as a wildcard pick for the Gleneagles showpiece. Woods’s season has lurched from one misery to another after undergoing surgery on a herniated disc in March. The 38-year-old endured a very public failure on his comeback, posting his worst 72-hole finish in a major at The Open and missing the cut at the US PGA as Rory McIlroy cleaned up both prizes. Pain game: Woods has been struggling with injury for a while and decided to withdraw from the Ryder Cup . ‘Physically, I couldn’t do it,’ Woods admitted to Sky Sports News about the Ryder Cup, which begins in Scotland on September 26. ‘I wouldn’t be ready and not being able to be there for my team-mates, the captain, assistant captain and everyone that’s involved in the event, I just wouldn’t be ready and I just couldn’t help the team. ‘When your name is called you have to be able to go out there and get a point and I just didn’t feel like I could be ready enough to get a point. Pain in the back: Woods holds his back as he tries to deal with his injury . ‘With that being said it was time to shut it down, get stronger, get more explosive again.’ Woods is now working solely on rebuilding his fitness in the gym and insisted he will not pick up a club for a month. The target for his next comeback is the World Challenge at Isleworth in Florida during the first week of December. ‘Now I need to keep (the back) calm, then strengthen it and then I’ll be back. That’s one of the reasons I’ve shut it down. I’ll come back in December and be ready for next year.’ No show: Woods will not play a part in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles next month .","Tiger Woods withdrew from the Ryder Cup last week .

Teenage sprint sensation Matthew Hudson-Smith will face his hero Kirani James for the first time at the Sainsbury’s Birmingham Grand Prix tomorrow — but says taking his driving test this week was much more daunting. Hudson-Smith, who announced his arrival on the international scene by clinching a 400 metres silver medal at the European Championships, earned green L-plates after passing his exam. He won’t be racing behind the wheel any time soon as he still doesn’t have his own car, but reaching top speed around a lap of the track at Birmingham’s Alexander Stadium is his sole focus in any case. Golden boy: Matthew Hudson-Smith (left) enjoys his European Championships 400m relay gold medal with team-mate Martyn Rooney . Hero: Hudson-Smith will face his idol Kirani James tomorrow . A personal best of 44.75sec won the 19-year-old the silver medal behind his friend and mentor Martyn Rooney at the European Championships in Zurich — an astonishing improvement of four seconds in 12 months — and he views today’s Diamond League event as another stepping stone to fulfilling what many believe is his world-class potential. Grenadian James, the reigning world, Olympic and Commonwealth champion, is the figure Hudson-Smith aspires towards and competing against such a calibre of athlete will provide valuable experience. He wants to pick up tips from James, just two years his senior, as well as get his autograph. But there will be no trepidation when it comes to racing on a track he has trained on since the age of nine — which is more than can be said for that driving test. ‘I’ve been learning for quite a while,’ he says. ‘A long time, let’s just say that.

"By . David Clough, Press Association . Alastair Cook must balance his priorities of overturning odds against India and managing the start of England's World Cup fact-finding mission when the Royal London Series gets under way in Bristol. The captain, one week on after completing the glorious transition of his Test summer from certain failure into resounding victory, has already confirmed he will have a new opening partner in Alex Hales - and previous incumbent Ian Bell will bat at number three, weather permitting on Monday. Yet in almost the same breath, Cook acknowledged the elevation of explosive short-format specialist Hales may yet be a mere watching brief - with the restoration of Bell, in time for the World Cup early next year, still a fallback option. Explosive: Alex Hales prepares to make his debut in the Royal London Series in Bristol . As for his own position, set in stone as England seek to avoid the untimely upheaval which has beset previous World Cup preparations, Cook insists the identity of his opening partner will entail no significant amendment to his methods. As he approaches a five-match, late-summer home series - yet with the modified demands of an impending global tournament in Australia and New Zealand very much in mind too - he argues his brief remains a constant, irrespective of opening with Hales or Bell and their contrasting strike rates of almost 100 or 76. 'I don't think it changes my role,' he said. Home and dry: Alastair Cook and James Anderson celebrate their 5th Test win against India at the Kia Oval . 'The job of the top four or five is to try and score a hundred, and win the game by setting up the game. 'You have to try and do it in your way. I have got to convert starts into scores. That's the job of an opener. 'When you win one-day matches, it's a common theme one of the top four or five has scored a hundred.' Cook has enhanced his own strike rate since his return to England's 50-over team after the 2011 World Cup, but it still pales in comparison to the one Hales has established in List A cricket. Anticipation: Hales' debut at the top of the batting order is drawing in Kevin Pietersen levels of excitement . He said: 'I still have to strike too - I can't let Alex do all the scoring. 'Since I have come back into the side, my strike rate hasn't been bad - it's at over 80.' Bell is the one who must adapt - although, as Cook admits, his repositioning may yet not be terminal. 'There is a different role for Ian to play,' he said. 'But Belly's a world, world-class player. So I have no doubts he can do that - and also, if we want to change it (back) up at the top of the order, mine and Belly's partnership has been a good one over the last couple of years. 'It's nice to know we've got different options, and we'll look at them over the next few months. So that when we come to the World Cup, we're very clear on what we think our best side will be.' Cook has no qualms about describing India as the likeliest winners over the next two weeks, despite their Test humbling and given their pedigree as World Cup and Champions Trophy holders - having beaten England in the Edgbaston final of the latter just last year. 'A change of format will obviously do them good. 'It's not quite the same groundhog day for them, probably. 'We've got to remember they're world champions at 50 overs, so they obviously know what they're doing and will probably go into this as favourites. 'But if we play well, we're hard to beat in our conditions.'","Alastair Cook and Alex Hales will opening the batting against India .

"By . Sam Peters . Andrew Flintoff dragged himself out of his fish and chip van and came agonisingly close to inspiring Lancashire to Twenty20 final glory as Warwickshire claimed their first-ever Twenty20 crown. The 36-year-old former England all-rounder got a last-minute call up for the final after Kabir Ali damaged his shoulder in the semi and looked set to deliver a virtuoso performance when he dismissed his old mate Ian Bell with the first ball of his spell. He returned, with hope apparently gone, to smash 20 not out off just eight balls, to give Lancashire a chance of the most unlikely victory only for current England all-rounder Chris Woakes to hold his nerve with a brilliant last over to leave Flintoff and his team-mates five runs short of victory.

Flintoff, who retired from cricket in 2009 with a chronic knee condition, struck with the first ball of his spell before Laurie Evans smashed 53 from 30 balls to set Lancashire a tough 182 winning target. The 2005 Ashes winning legend has spent the past three weeks filming a documentary on fish and chips for Sky One but he looked in good nick out on the field even if Lancashire captain Varun Chopra preferred England’s current pace ace Jimmy Anderson. ‘It happened so quickly,’ said Flintoff, who finished with two for 20 off two overs in his third game back after coming out of retirement earlier this season. ‘I was just told to get yourself ready to play. ‘I’d be lying to say I wasn’t nervous but I wasn’t too bad. I thought Belly had hit it better than he had. The celebration was out of surprise as much as anything. I also bowled the worst ball I’ve ever bowled in my career, a waist-high full-toss which went for six. ‘As soon as you start to get ahead yourself the game catches up with you.’ Warwickshire, who had never previously reached a T20 final, shrugged off the euphoria surrounding Flintoff’s appearance in the final to post a challenging total of 181-5 after Bell had chipped his first ball to Karl Evans to take a smart catch and spark delirious celebrations.

Acknowledgement: Laurie Evans holds his bat to the crowd as they applaud his half-century in the final . Evans was the star of the show for the home side, smashing 53 from just 30 balls including four huge sixes and two fours to seemingly take the game away from Lancashire under the lights in front of a packed Edgbaston crowd. He was ably supported by Chopra (30 off 17 balls) and William Porterfield (31 from 23) as Anderson in particular came in for some heavy punishment to finish with none for 52 from four overs. Tom Smith and Ashwell Prince added 41 for the first wicket but Lancashire were always behind the rate and when Jos Buttler was out the writing looked on the wall before Karl Brown gave them hope with some superb hitting. Brown smashed 55 off 28 before Chris Woakes bowled him, bringing Flintoff to the crease with 30 required off 13 balls. Surely not? Flintoff hit his first ball for one before smashing two towering sixes in successive balls off Oliver Hannon-Dolby’ to leave his side needing 14 off the last over from Chris Woakes’ last over and leave his many fans in the crowd dreaming of yet another fairytale chapter in his incredible career. A scampered single got Flintoff on strike and successive twos left his side needing nine off three balls. But Woakes kept his discipline and restricted Flintoff to a single and Stephen Parry was unable to hit six off the last ball. Agony for Lancashire, joy for Warwickshire.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for MailOnline . Rangers full-back Lee Wallace has admitted he has all but given up hope of playing for Scotland. The 27-year-old defender, who last played for his country in a 0-0 draw with the United States last November, is set to miss the trip to face World Champions Germany in next month's 2016 Euro qualifier when Scotland boss Gordon Strachan names his squad on Monday morning. Conceding he sacrificed his international ambitions to stay with Rangers and help them back up the leagues, Wallace revealed he has also received a phonecall from Strachan explaining his situation. Realistic: Lee Wallace knows his chances of playing for his country again are very slim . Focus: Lee Wallace has no regrets over sacrificing his international career to concentrate on his club career . And asked if he expects to feature against the Germans, he admitted: 'Probably not, no.

'I'll never hold much hope for it but I'm not going to get too downbeat about it, either, as I'm just going to concentrate on Rangers and always will do. 'When I stayed with Rangers after what happened, I knew that [playing in the lower leagues] would be a stumbling block [for international call-ups] and Craig Levein had said at the time it would be difficult to select someone in the bottom tier of Scottish football. 'I accepted that and understood it at that level. 'I was aware of that and it was a sacrifice I made. Rangers is the one for me and I want to play a part in their history over the next few years.' The emergence of Andrew Robertson at Dundee United led to the young left-back making a £2.5million move to Hull City this summer. And the 20-year-old, who has made an impressive start in the Barclays Premier League, now looks to be Strachan's first pick, with Wallace adding: 'I kind of got the message in some of the last few squads - although the manager did phone me one time to say he wanted to look at other people and they've gone on to bigger and better things, playing their football in one of the best leagues in the world.","The 27-year-old is not expected to be named in Gordon Strachan's latest squad for next month's 2016 Euro qualifier against Germany .

"By . Phil Blanche, Press Association Sport . Swansea's South Korean midfielder Ki Sung-yueng has signed a new four-year contract that will keep him at the Liberty Stadium until 2018. Ki had a year left on his old deal after arriving from Celtic for what was then a club record £5million in 2012. 'I'm very pleased,' Ki told the club's official website. VIDEO Scroll down for Swansea City midfielder Ki Sung-yueng signs new contract . Going nowhere: Ki Sung-yueng (second from left) has signed a new four-year contract with Swansea . Fresh start: The midfielder has committed his future to the Swans after spending last season at Sunderland . 'This is what I have wanted to do - my first option was always to renew with Swansea. 'I want to sacrifice myself for the team and, as always, do as much as I can to help this team improve. 'I will be giving 100 per cent, and I am looking forward to continuing my work with the club.' Ki's new deal represents a remarkable turnaround in his fortunes in South Wales. Despite making 38 appearances in his first season at Swansea - which included a Capital One Cup win at Wembley - Ki was loaned out to Sunderland for the 2013-14 campaign, helping the Black Cats to a League Cup final appearance as well as winning their battle against relegation. Perfect start: Ki scored the first goal of the new Premier League season as Swansea beat Manchester United . Sunderland and Aston Villa were both keen on securing Ki's services on a permanent basis but the 25-year-old has once more established himself under Liberty boss Garry Monk. Ki scored his first goal for the club in Swansea's opening-day victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford and has been impressive as Monk's men have won their first two Premier League games. 'This team has a great potential, and I am sure that we will be amazing as time goes by,' said Ki. 'The way we try to play makes it really enjoyable. Hopefully we can win more trophies. 'It was amazing to be at Wembley for two years in a row, and it would be massive if I could return again this year.'","Ki Sung-yueng has committed his future to Swansea .

"By . Pa Reporter . Rangers rounded off a good week's work with a comfortable 4-1 win over Dumbarton - taking their tally of goals to 12 in the process. First-half goals from Lee McCulloch and Darren McGregor set Rangers up for another home win on the back of Monday's 8-1 hammering of Clyde. And although it was a gutsy performance from Dumbarton, a second-half strike from Nicky Clark and an own goal from Chris Turner left Ian Murray's side on the wrong of another crushing defeat - with only a Bilel Mohsni own goal for consolation. Opener: Lee McCulloch celebrates scoring the opener against Dumbarton . Dumbarton made a confident start and provided an early threat on the home goal. After three minutes Stevie Simonsen, in his first league start, made the first save of the game getting down to smother an effort from Colin Nish. Rangers first chance to test the visitors' goalkeeper arrived after 10 minutes from a free-kick on the right of the penalty area. But with plenty of height in the box, Lewis MacLeod elected to play a low ball which was easily cleared by the Sons' defence. Four minutes later MacLeod made amends when his perfect delivery from a corner was met on the volley by McCulloch and from six yards the ball flew high past Danny Rogers to make it 1-0. In front: McCulloch (left) scores in the first half to put Rangers in the lead against Dumbarton at Ibrox . Rangers came within inches of doubling their lead two minutes later but MacLeod watched his 30-yard drive rebound from the foot of the post. After 20 minutes the other post was rattled. McGregor's long throw was nodded back by Kris Boyd, allowing Clark to swivel before slamming his shot off the upright with the goalkeeper well beaten. Nine minutes later, though, the Dumbarton goalkeeper was beaten again when McGregor raced into the box on the right before unleashing a powerful angled drive high into the net. Having been largely idle since the opening spell, seven minutes from the break Simonsen was forced into a fine save diving low to his left to push away an angled drive from Nish. A minute later the Rangers goalkeeper made another good stop, blocking Turner's downward header - although he was in an offside position. Good week: Ally McCoist's Rangers side won twice this week, scoring 12 goals in the process . The first-half ended with Rogers the busier goalkeeper, producing a couple of saves from Nicky Law and Lee Wallace. Three minutes after the break a brilliant piece of skill from Law set-up a half-volley towards to top corner but Rogers matched it with a superb one-handed save. The goalkeeper had no chance in the 53rd minute when Rangers made it 3-0. Boyd broke into the box and then unselfishly rolled the ball in front of Clark who had the simple task of sliding the ball home from 10 yards. MacLeod, having made a significant contribution, was then replaced along with David Templeton as Arnold Peralta and Dean Shiels came on. Goal: Nicky Clark scores for Rangers in their Championship match against Dumbarton . And within two minutes Shiels made his own contribution, whipping in a corner which was missed by the goalkeeper leaving the ball to rebound off Turner's face and into his own net. Injury was added to insult and while the Sons defender was off the pitch receiving treatment, Rangers had the ball in the net again but Boyd's header was ruled out for offside. Dumbarton finally got their consolation goal 10 minutes from time when Bilel Mohsni headed Gilhaney's curling cross beyond his own goalkeeper. Despite losing four goals, Rogers capped a fine afternoon with another impressive save to deny Clark a fifth for Rangers.","Lee McCulloch opened the scoring for Rangers .

"By . Ben Nagle For Mailonline . QPR boss Harry Redknapp has suggested his side's shock cup loss at Burton could hasten the departure of several players. Redknapp paid the price for making nine changes as League Two Albion claimed a 1-0 win in their Capital One Cup second-round tie at the Pirelli Stadium. The likes of Shaun Wright-Phillips, Nedum Onuoha, Karl Henry, Junior Hoilett and Adel Taarabt were among the players to come in and Redknapp was far from impressed by most of them. Redknapp did single out Taarabt - who was making his first appearance for the R's in 16 months - for praise but, with Monday's transfer deadline looming, many of the rest could be heading out. Asked if any business was possible, Redknapp said: 'Absolutely. I still think we need a bit of quality in one or two areas. 'There are one or two who played last night or are not going to get in my team who I think might be better moving on.' The future of former Manchester City, Chelsea and England winger Wright-Phillips at Loftus Road is again in question. The 32-year-old has faded from the limelight since joining Rangers three years ago in a move that was supposed to rejuvenate his career. On Wednesday he was completely overshadowed - almost literally - and outplayed by his marker, the towering 6ft 5in defender George Taft, and was withdrawn after 78 minutes. Goal: Burton celebrate Adam McGurk's 77th-minute winner to knock QPR out . Out? Shaun Wright-Phillips' QPR future is in doubt after struggling against Burton on Wednesday night . Hoilett hit the bar in one of Rangers' better moments, but the Canadian is also in danger of drifting to the periphery. Redknapp said: 'I wanted an awful lot more (from the wide areas). I thought Junior did all right first half but Shaun had a tough night.' Redknapp did say he would like Taarabt to stay but did not know the intentions of the Moroccan, who spent last season on loan at Fulham and AC Milan and has a buy-out clause. Struggle: Taarabt is another player who could be leaving Loftus Road, despite Redknapp's desire to keep him . As well as any transfer business, Redknapp is also anxious to get QPR's season up and running this weekend. The Londoners have lost all three of their games, with the Burton defeat compounding woes after last weekend's 4-0 defeat by Tottenham. Redknapp said: 'Saturday is important, it's massive for us. It won't be easy against Sunderland, that's for sure. 'They were a team in form at the end of last season and have started decent this year. We have got to pick ourselves up and get ready to go on Saturday.' Out: Redknapp watches on in disappointment as his QPR side crash out of the Capital One Cup to Burton . The mood was considerably different at Burton, the modest but well-run Staffordshire club who have made steady progress since promotion to the Football League in 2009. After missing out on promotion in the play-offs last season, the Brewers have made a solid start to the new campaign and are unbeaten in six games across all competitions. Striker Adam McGurk, who curled home the 77th-minute free-kick that settled the tie, said: 'Everyone is buzzing. It's a great win. We worked as hard as we could and we nicked the goal to get the win. 'We have had the likes of Wigan, Stoke and Derby here and given everyone a game. We just work away and stick to the game plan and it is paying off. 'When the goal went in and at full-time you could hear the roar. 'It is great for the fans to get memories like this. It's brilliant for them. 'But these are bonuses for us. Our main aim is obviously promotion. We can't get sidetracked from that. 'We have to get back down on Friday morning and make sure we keep our run going in the league.'","Harry Redknapp made nine changes to his Queens Park Rangers team .

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen can resonate exactly with what Liverpool are going through in terms of a rebuilding job this season after going through similar at White Hart Lane last term. The 23-year-old was one of a host of summer signings to arrive at Tottenham last summer in an attempt to fill the gap of star man Gareth Bale last summer. But things didn't quite pan as Spurs would have liked as they yet again finished outside of the Champions League places, despite spending £110million on a number of new additions. Similarities: Christian Eriksen believes Tottenham and Liverpool have gone through near identical transitions . Celebrations: After a superb start to the season Eriksen and co will be eyeing a top four spot at Spurs this year . Liverpool have splashed the cash this summer with a number of new additions in the hope of filling the void of star man Luis Suarez who joined Spanish giants Barcelona. But Eriksen says there is no guarantee of instant success when so many players are brought in such a short space of time telling The Evening Standard: 'It is true that we went through [what Liverpool are now facing] last year. It will depend on what team they have and what the new players are bringing in. Everything has to fit. 'Sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you are a bit unlucky. Last year we made some really good signings, I think. 'We were just a bit unlucky that nothing really ended up in a big thing. Of course, that can happen with Liverpool as well so sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you aren't.' Spurs will look to extend their 100% start to the season when they entertain Brendan Rodgers' side on Sunday, who in turn will be be looking to get back to winning ways after losing 3-1 against champions Manchester City on Monday night.","Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen sees similarities in the current situation at Liverpool and Spurs last season .

"By . Laurie Whitwell for MailOnline . Arsenal fans were calling Mesut Ozil’s name at the Emirates during their slender Champions League victory over Besiktas – but not in a good way. The club’s record signing was the lightning rod for grievances as the tension mounted and he gave possession away more than once with Alexis Sanchez in promising positions. When Mathieu Debuchy was sent off late on it was Ozil who Arsene Wenger decided would be sacrificed so Calum Chambers could be sent on to shore up defence. VIDEO Scroll down for Mesut Ozil's animal instinct takes over in eerie advert . Misery: Mesut Ozil with his head in hands during a night of frustration against Beskitas . Going nowhere fast: Ozil has yet to make a real impact at Arsenal since his move from Real Madrid last year . Had Ozil been keeping hold of the ball it is likely that, for all his defensive deficiencies, he would have stayed on. Possession is vital in closing out matches and at his best Ozil treats the ball like Gollum does his precious ring to rule them all; protective and unyielding. But Ozil has been struggling to reach his best in north London. He arrived last summer amid much fanfare and with a £42.5million price tag his form was explosive. Real Madrid players lined up to complain that their team’s creative spark had been sold – Cristiano Ronaldo was particularly critical – and the deal looked a steal when Ozil scored a sublime opener in early October’s Champions League victory over Napoli. He was the grandstand signing Arsenal fans had been crying out for during years of frugality from Wenger, keen to balance the books with a new stadium to pay for. Wenger threw off the shackles for Ozil and the German supplied assists in kind – as well as a decent goal return of five goals in 18 games before Christmas. But the lack of a winter break to which he had become accustomed in Germany appeared to deeply affect the 25-year-old of slight stature. There was fatigue in his game and a hamstring injury in March that kept him out for a month. He scored only two goals in his final 22 games. As he edged to fitness in April, Wenger revealed: ‘He had a period where he was tired because he was not used to playing a full season. Happier times: Ozil was a rising star in La Liga with Madrid before the £42.5million deal . 'He's a fantastic football player and I would put him on the list to be player of the season next season.’ A World Cup where he starred for Germany followed, even if at times he was criticised for failing to impact matches throughout. In the early rounds, he would flirt with providing a lasting contribution. More often, though, he sparkled brightly but briefly. His best performance came against Algeria in the last-16 when he scored. He was also excellent in the 7-1 humbling of Brazil although the headlines were elsewhere. It seemed he had his mojo back but his two appearances for Arsenal this season have been subdued. It might be that he still needs an extended break to recharge the batteries following a summer that provided him with little opportunity. Sanchez’s arrival takes some of the focus away and you imagine he will thrive with better players around him. At Madrid, he had the likes of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Gonzalo Higuain to feed. High five! Ozil celebrates with Cristiano Ronaldo (right) as Real beat Lyon back in 2011 . All three are hulking forwards who enjoy making runs in behind defences. Arsenal are short on that type of player and perhaps Ozil’s ability to slot passes through the eye of a needle for quick strikers to run onto cannot be harnessed in full in Wenger’s side. A statistic went round the internet in the wake of Angel Di Maria’s arrival at Manchester United. To justify his huge fee it was noted he had made 49 league assists in the league since 2010, the third-most of any player in Europe behind Lionel Messi on top with 57. Lodged in between them was Ozil, who has laid on 56 goals. It is that kind of world-class contribution that convinced Wenger to splash the cash and it is what he now needs to bring out of his player once more.","Arsenal are yet to see the best of midfielder Mesut Ozil .

"By . Neil Ashton for the Daily Mail . Inside the draw hall in Monaco on Thursday afternoon, it will be the turn of the greatest names in the Champions League to enter the competition for real. Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thiago Motta are among the star turns who will be hunched around television sets at training grounds all over Europe. At London Colney, the man who engineered Arsenal’s squeaky qualifying win at the Emirates over Besiktas, will be itching for the chance to compete with the best midfielders in Europe. VIDEO Scroll down for Jack Wilshere trains with Arsenal ahead of Besiktas clash . Time to shine: Jack Wilshere dazzled at times against Besiktas, but must do more this season . This, as Arsene Wenger accurately described at the start of the season, is the biggest of Jack Wilshere’s career. It feels like now or never. It was only a year or so ago that former England captain Steven Gerrard guaranteed increased scrutiny on the midfielder by elevating him into the world class category. At lunchtime today he will be named, alongside young Calum Chambers and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, in Roy Hodgson’s first England squad since they exited the World Cup with only a point. Without Gerrard and Frank Lampard, who confirmed his international retirement on Tuesday, Wilshere will have the chance to make hay in the centre of England’ s midfield. At 22 there is time to blossom, but club and country need him. In and out: The Arsenal midfielder has been criticised for his early season form . So much was, rightly, made of the poolside party pictures from Las Vegas just days after England’s embarrassing exit from the World Cup with a single point. On Wednesday night, without the presence and influence of the suspended Aaron Ramsey in the centre, there was something of a swagger about Wilshere’s game. It wasn’t vintage, far from it, but he was instrumental in the goal that took Arsenal into the group stage after their annual dice with death in the qualifiers. At times he came alive, switching player with a swivel of his hips or a dip of his shoulder. There was the extravagant turn in the second half, spinning off Veli Kavlak and Ramon Motta before driving forward at the start of another attack that lifted Arsenal’s fans. Deadlock: Alexis Sanchez (centre) celebrates putting Arsenal into a 1-0 lead against Besiktas . Off the mark: Sanchez found the net in the 45th minute to open his account as an Arsenal player . ‘The burst is back when he get away from players,’ admitted Wenger and it would be hard to disagree. When he does that, he can compete with anyone. His quick-witted one-two with Mesut Ozil for Arsenal’s goal, the one that guarantees a 17th successive year of Champions League football, drew gasps of admiration form the Emirates crowd. Mostly they were for Alexis Sanchez after he scored his first goal in an Arsenal shirt, but Wilshere played a significant role in it. There are times, especially when Aaron Ramsey is missing from the team through suspension, that the stage is set for Wilshere to dazzle. God-willing, Wilshere will go on to fulfil his potential. No-one doubts that he has the touches to be one of the main thrusts in this Arsenal team when they have the ball. Setback: Last season's injuries halted Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's (centre) development . When they are without it, his game suffers. He knows that he brought down Besiktas winger Ramon Motta inside the area before Arsenal’s opening goal. It should have been a penalty, fairly straightforward for referee Pedro Proenca really, but somehow he ignored the claims from Besiktas’ players. ‘I probably touched him, but it was a slip,’ admitted Wilshere. On Wednesday night, the Arsenal midfielder landed on his feet. Honesty: Arsene Wenger himself has claimed that it is now or never for Wilshere .

"By . Charlie Eccleshare for MailOnline . Mario Balotelli has his work cut out to impress new Italy manager Antonio Conte - a strict disciplinarian with little respect for reputations. The new Liverpool signing had a disappointing World Cup for Italy this summer, and Conte has insisted that he will be picking players based on current form. The former Juventus coach told Gazzetta dello Sport that, 'whoever joins the national team must then deserve to stay there.' Point to prove: Mario Balotelli scored against England at the World Cup but had a disappointing tournament . New boss: Former Juventus manager Antonio Conte has taken charge of the Italian national side . Picked on merit: Conte has said Balotelli must prove himself again if he wants to make the Italy squad . Unsure: Conte said he wasn't sure Balotelli's decision to move back to England was a positive one . 'The man is more important than the footballer... talent is secondary. First you've got to sacrifice yourself for the squad.' Conte added that he wasn't sure Balotelli's decision to move back to England was a positive one. Balotelli was heavily criticised in Italy after the Azzuri were  eliminated at the group stage of the World Cup, which prompted Conte's predecessor Cesare Prandelli to resign. The Liverpool striker has a decent scoring record for Italy though, with 13 goals in 33 games, and will expect to keep his place in the Italy squad.

"By . Neil Ashton for the Daily Mail . Roy Hodgson refers to the void between England’s 2-1 defeat against Uruguay on June 19 and Thursday's squad announcement as ‘post-World Cup depression’. The rest of the country, those poor souls who watched as England were knocked out before 12 teams had even played their second group game, were diagnosed at the same time. Thursday was billed as ‘The Rooney Press Conference’ at which the head coach explained why the Manchester United striker has succeeded Steven Gerrard as captain. Upbeat: England manager Roy Hodgson ready for Euro 2016 qualification bid . Good for Wayne Rooney, who has never made any secret of his desire to lead from the front, but there are more pressing matters to address. First things first. Hodgson declared: ‘Don’t try to make me out to be some complete fool who, after getting knocked out in the first round of the World Cup, says we are as good as the team who won it.’ If only he had been this spiky when the writing was on the wall at the World Cup after Mario Balotelli’s 50th-minute header sealed a 2-1 victory for Italy in Manaus. Boost: Striker Wayne Rooney has been handed the captain's armband . Hodgson must raise his game. He claims to have an identity in mind, a plan to play just like Germany — or better — as he starts out on the lengthy qualification campaign towards Euro 2016. He has reconstructed the squad, rightly bringing in Calum Chambers after the defender’s outstanding start to his career with Arsenal. ‘I spoke to Arsene Wenger to ask him if it was too early and he said “no, take him”,’ said Hodgson. Danny Rose, Jack Colback and Fabian Delph are the other newbies in the group ahead of next Wednesday’s friendly with Norway at Wembley and the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on September 8. ‘Germany have very good players and they started with these young players,’ said Hodgson. ‘Bastian Schweinsteiger at 18 wasn’t the player he is today and Philipp Lahm wasn’t. If we work hard and develop our players there is nothing to stop us producing these type of players and playing the same sort of football.’ Lift: Newcastle's Jack Colback has been called up to England squad by Hodgson . So, now that Germany are champions of the world, we are going to play like them. It was inevitable, but we had to hear it from Hodgson to be certain. When England lost 1-0 to Germany in their own back yard last November, Toni Kroos had no fewer than 125 touches of the ball in midfield. Over to you, Colback. With Euro 2016 qualifiers against Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, San Marino and Lithuania over the next 18 months, Hodgson has time to convince a sceptical audience. ‘The qualifying group looks relatively easy so we can only hope that the chance to play in those qualifiers, plus getting games in club football, will in two years make them better players,’ said Hodgson. ‘I am not blaming any of the clubs for sometimes not using these players. The 19 or 20-year-old with great potential is having to fight competition from a 27-year-old Brazilian or Argentinian international with 75 caps. That’s the situation. ‘They may even develop some leadership qualities. You don’t develop them without playing. Blueprint for success: England want to copy world champions Germany . ‘If working with a younger team with potential costs us leaders, I can’t wave the magic wand and bring back a leader in defence, with one or two in midfield and up front. ‘I believe in the squad and I think they are going to be good enough. In 2016 we will see a good England team and I am entitled to believe that.’ Let’s hold Hodgson to this because no-one can sit through another lame England performance at a major tournament. He retains the full support of the FA and maintains that he never came close to resigning after England finished bottom of Group D at the World Cup with a single point. He said: ‘When you have the backing of your employers and you have a contract and you have the backing of the people you are working with I don’t see any reason not to carry on.’ To Hodgson’s credit, he takes full responsibility for the failings of the national team in Brazil. ‘I accept all of those things,’ he added. Next week, in front of around 50,000 England fans, Hodgson must lift the mood of the nation with a bracing performance against Norway. ‘I can’t expect people to shrug it off, but I’m hoping it won’t be too evident that the apathy exists,’ he added. ‘I am hoping the public gets behind the team because the team needs them. ‘We have to get on the field, put this shirt on and play well. I want them to think “this team is worth following”.’ As Hodgson knows, it has been a long time since anybody has been able to say that.","Roy Hodgson has plan to play like the world champions .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Neither Ukraine nor Israel will be allowed to play next month's Davis Cup ties on home soil because of security issues, the International Tennis Federation has ruled. At a meeting held on Tuesday, the ITF board of directors upheld an appeal from Ukraine's opponents Belgium that their World Group play-off should not be held in Kiev because of continued unrest in the country. A statement on the Davis Cup website read: 'The Board noted that the original decision by the Davis Cup Committee had not been unanimous; and that, while the recent political unrest had occurred in eastern Ukraine, a disturbance in Kiev's Independence Square as recently as last Thursday indicated that the security situation there was fluid.'

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta has backed his fellow Argentine Angel di Maria to be a big success at rivals Manchester United following his British record £59.7m move from Real Madrid. The 26-year-old has swapped a La Liga title push for an altogether different challenge at Old Trafford, as they look to recover from a disastrous start to the season and push for a top four place. The latest setback, a 4-0 thumping at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup, leaves United in a early season crisis already, with new manager Louis van Gaal weighing up whether to throw both Di Maria and other new signing Marcos Rojo into his squad for the game at newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria's first interview as a Manchester United player . Faith: Pablo Zabeleta believes both Angel Di Maria and Marcos Rojo will be successes at Manchester United . Historic: Di Maria will look to follow in the footsteps of previous No 7's Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo . Zabaleta has no doubt in his mind that the former Real Madrid winger will be a star at United, with his top-level experience set to aid United significantly this season. He told the Daily Star: 'All the Argentinians are coming and taking over Manchester now! 'Di Maria and Rojo are on the other side, though. I am very pleased for both of them because I know them very well. 'With Di Maria, United have signed one of those players that every single club in the world would like to sign. 'He has been at Real Madrid and has won a lot of trophies - he's won the Champions League and has great experience there. He's a great player, he's fast, he's direct, sets up goals and can score them.' All smiles: Louis van Gaal will be hoping for Angel di Maria to make an instant impact at Manchester United . Welcoming: Van Gaal sits alongside Di Maria as the latter is unveiled at a press conference on Thursday . All smiles: Marcos Rojo signed for Manchester United for £16million from Sporting Lisbon . Zabaleta's last came up against Di Maria when Real and City were drawn in the same Champions League group in 2012 - with the Galaticos picking up four points from the two games. So the 29-year-old is chomping at the bit to square up with him again at the Etihad Stadium when the two Manchester rivals face each other on November 2. He added: 'That will be interesting (the derby game). We'll see where Van Gaal is going to play him, where he fits into that system. I've seen him play in different positions - not just as a winger - so we'll see. 'I'll look forward to going up against him. We are friends, we'll always be friends off the field but not in that game.'","Zabeleta has backed Di Maria to be a big hit at Manchester United .

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Alan Pardew is banking on forgotten man Papiss Cisse rescuing goal-shy Newcastle United. The Magpies have failed to score in more matches than any other League club in 2014 and are one of only two yet to find the back of the net in the top flight this season. Even Tuesday’s 1-0 win at League One Gillingham in the Capital One Cup arrived courtesy of an own goal from former Sunderland player John Egan. VIDEO Scroll down for Alan Pardew: Win against Palace would be a good start to season . Better times: Papiss Cisse celebrates scoring against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in May 2012 . Papiss Cisse and Nikica Jelavic were both winter-window signings in 2012. Before the end of the season Cisse had scored 13 times for Newcastle, while Jelavic had netted 12 for Everton following his £5m transfer from Rangers. In two years since both have struggled for league goals. Cisse has 10 and Jelavic only netted his 12th for Hull at the weekend. Pardew insists that goals do reside in his team and says he was not tempted to enter the race for Shane Long who cost £12million, Ross McCormack, who cost £11m, and Jordan Rhodes, whose proposed £12m move from Blackburn to Hull collapsed yesterday. Instead, Pardew will wait for Cisse. The Senegal forward has been sidelined since April with a broken kneecap but will return to training next week. The 29-year-old, however, had seemingly been written off by the management team at St James’ Park after starting just 15 league games last term, returning two goals. Cisse, of course, was one of Europe’s hottest properties two years ago having smashed 13 goals in three months following a £9m January switch from Freiburg, a first-time volley from an impossible angle at Chelsea the pick of that haul. He has, though, netted just 10 times since. Out of favour: The Senegalese striker failed to impress at St. James' Park last season, starting just 15 league games and finding the net only twice . Help: Pardew's (left) £6m summer signing, Emmanuel Riviere (right), is yet to find the net for the Magpies . But with £6m summer signing Emmanuel Riviere yet to get off the mark in three attempts, Pardew is hoping Cisse can rediscover the free-scoring form of 2012 as the United boss risks a £35m close-season investment being undone by a lack of firepower. ‘I do remember not so long ago us all talking very highly about Papiss and whether we could keep him,’ said Pardew, whose side drew 0-0 at Aston Villa on Saturday despite dominating in the second half. ‘I think with Papiss that there’s a possibility that he could score a lot of goals in this team so I wouldn’t write him off by any stretch of the imagination. ‘If we’re going to bring in a player they have to be better and above Riviere and Papiss, otherwise there is no point. ‘When you look at the transfers, Jordan Rhodes, McCormack to Fulham and Shane Long to Southampton, and you look at their prices, I don’t think we would have done those three transfers.’ Team Games Failed to score % . Newcastle 21 14 66.67 . Hartlepool 27 14 51.85 . Blackpool 27 13 48.15 . Norwich 23 11 47.83 . Cardiff 23 11 47.83 . Pardew’s side have failed to score in 14 of 21 Premier League matches this calendar year, and – at 66 per cent - that is a higher ratio than any of the 92 League clubs. Cisse appeared in half of those scoreless outings, but Pardew said: ‘The chances he was given last year didn’t really help his cause and there were a lot of games where he trawled through for us because we never created enough for him. ‘He had like two or three chances a game and he fluffed his lines a little bit but he probably needs more than that. Top strikers do need more than that and I’d never put off the fact that he can come again - and come again here.’ VIDEO Forward players tried too hard - Pardew .","Newcastle have failed to score in their first two league games of the season .

"By . Simon Jones for MailOnline . Stephane Mbia is poised to make a return to the Premier League. The 28-year-old Cameroon international is a free agent after his contract ran out at Queens Park Rangers in July. The powerful midfielder enjoyed a successful loan spell at Sevilla last season which culminated in the Spanish side winning the Europa League final against Benfica and finishing fifth in La Liga. On the up: Mbia has just recently been made Cameroon captain and is set for a return to the Premier League . Mbia, who converted his penalty in the shoot-out win over Benfica, was named in the Europa League ‘Team of the Year’ alongside teammate Ivan Rakitic. He was appointed the new captain of Cameroon this week, taking over from Everton’s new signing Samuel Eto’o, and is ready to play in England again. ‘I have trust in my agent Willie McKay and his business partner Pierre Frelot to find me the right club,’ Mbia told Sportsmail. ‘They are looking for the best opportunity for me to play and I am absolutely ready for a new challenge. Mbia, who has been linked with Arsenal this summer, added: ‘People didn’t see the true, 100 per cent me while I was at QPR and I want to show what I can do. ‘I had a very good season in Seville and I feel a lot more positive and happy about where I am. 'It is not just about the individual but the team and the organisation of the club that helps a player and I rediscovered my confidence in Spain.’ Mbia is willing to take a one year contract for now to ensure a move to the Premier League as clubs search frantically for last minute bargains, although his free agent status allows him to move after the window closes at 11pm on Monday.","The Cameroon international is out of contract after leaving QPR .

"By . Becky Evans . Shipping containers could be used as temporary accommodation for homeless people to help solve a city's housing crisis. A housing trust in Brighton wants to use the 36 adapted containers as a stop-gap for people without a permanent home. It is the latest plan aimed at tackling Brighton and Hove's 'desperate' housing crisis. Scroll down for video . Innovation: Shipping containers have been used as homes in the UK before such as this Container City in London . The containers have been transformed into self-contained studio flats, and feature bathrooms, kitchens and plasterboarded walls. The structures were designed for a social . housing project in Amsterdam two years ago but the scheme had to be . abandoned after hitting funding difficulties. It is hoped they will instead be used as temporary homes in Brighton and Hove from late spring next year until a permanent roof can be found. The Brighton Housing Trust and developer QED are to submit a planning application to the local city council for a central site featuring the modified containers with allotments on the roofs. Andy Winter, chief executive of Brighton Housing Trust, said 'imaginative solutions' were needed to deal with the 'desperate' housing situation in the city. Concern: Brighton and Hove authorities recognise homelessness is a serious problem in the city. Some 43 rough sleepers were counted there this month (file picture) Shipping-container homes have been . used elsewhere, including in London, and are seen as a significantly . cheaper housing option than bricks and mortar. The . plans in Brighton follow a warning from leading housing bodies this . month that homelessness and overcrowding are getting worse amid . Britain’s housing shortage. High property prices averaging around . £302,000, steep private rents and low average wages in the seaside city . have contributed to high levels of homelessness . The . problems come against a background of rising private sector rents and . as more people are claiming housing benefit nationwide, a report by . Shelter, the National Housing Federation and the Chartered Institute of . Housing said. Mr Winter said: 'I have to admit that when it was first suggested to me that shipping containers be used for housing I was a bit sceptical. 'However, having seen what can be achieved, I was quickly won over. The WC and shower unit is exactly the same as my daughter had in her student accommodation and she much preferred it to having to share bathrooms and toilets with other students. Who wouldn’t? 'What really excites me about this opportunity is that land that might otherwise lie idle for five years will be brought back into life and used to provide much-needed temporary accommodation for 36 men and women in Brighton and Hove.' Unusual: 36 shipping containers, similar to these pictured, have already been converted into studio flats complete with bathrooms and kitchens . Excited: Andy Winter, chief executive of Brighton Housing Association, said 'imaginative' solutions are needed to solve housing crisis . When the site comes to be redeveloped, the containers can be transferred to other locations. Mr Winter added: 'This appears to me to be very attractive from a sustainability perspective.' Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb said the Government 'simply isn’t delivering the new homes we need'. And David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said there had been'“words and policy' but 'we’ve not had delivery'. In Brighton and Hove, the authorities recognise homelessness as a significant problem, with 43 people found sleeping rough during an annual headcount this month, up six from the previous year. Mr Winter highlighted the case of one man who was living in his car and holding down a job. He said he would not want to see the shipping containers used as a long-term housing option here, but there are examples in mainland Europe. 'The most notable project is in Keetwonen, Amsterdam, a development by TempoHousing, of 1,000 containers using exactly the same internal design layout as the ones we are proposing to use. It was completed in 2006 and is still in use today,' he said. QED director Chris Gilbert told local newspaper The Argus: 'We’re not intending to dress them up and pretend they’re not containers. 'I think it could be an exciting way of addressing, quickly, what’s a massive problem.'","Local housing trust wants to use converted containers to help people while they search for permanent home .

"By . John Mcgarry . Ally McCoist has sought clarity over the role of a chief football operations officer at Ibrox – amid concerns his plea for a new chief scout is falling on deaf ears. Sportsmail revealed last month that Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace had met former Ibrox midfielder Christian Nerlinger about the possibility of returning to the club in the CFOO position created in his 120-day review. McCoist has stated he would have no issue with the move – provided he was guaranteed final say over player recruitment. But he remains in the dark as to whether someone like Nerlinger would effectively be the club’s eyes and ears on potential transfers at home and abroad. In the dark: Rangers boss Ally McCoist has been told nothing of the potential appointment of Christian Nerlinger . Were that not to be the case, McCoist believes the lack of a chief scout will seriously hinder the club’s prospects of building for the future. ‘I spoke with Graham half an hour ago and nothing has been said about Nerlinger or any director of football so I don’t know anything about it,’ he said. ‘I would expect to know something but it’s gone quiet. ‘My priority is to win the league but in terms of the infrastructure, we desperately need a chief scout. ‘Finance plays a big part in why we can’t plan longer term. ‘You lose 20 players valued at £40million and you replace them with free transfers. It is not rocket science and not a criticism of the boys you are bringing in. It is a fact of life. Familiar territory: Former Germany international Nerlinger played for Rangers between 2001 and 2004 . ‘We have to replace quality and get quality back in to get back to that level we want to be at. You are not going to do that in a year. It is proven. ‘We had a team to win the Third Division and a team last year and we have a team this year. We just have to keep strengthening. ‘The one thing you do have with a chief scout and a scouting department is you have the potential to do a Sporting Lisbon (with Ryan Gauld). ‘Go and get a boy at 18, 19 and say: “Right, it looks like we are not going to play you for 18 months, but we are going to develop you.” That is the ideal world. Striking Gauld: Dundee United cashed in on the sale of teenager Ryan Gauld to Sporting Lisbon . ‘We are light years away from that yet. We need to get back to having a base where we have people at games, going to Europe to watch under-18 and under-21 tournaments. ‘Whether that is the chief football officer’s gig or the chief scout’s gig is up for debate. But if we want to get back to a top standard in Scotland and hopefully get back into European football, we have to have people assessing players.’ Summer signings Darren McGregor, Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd have provided ammunition for critics who believe McCoist’s line of vision is too narrow. Experienced: McCoist has moved to bring in veteran strikers Kenny Miller (centre) and Kris Boyd (right) While content with those acquisitions, he feels the lack of a proper scouting network means recruiting potential hidden gems from untapped markets is currently impossible. ‘Durranty, Kenny (McDowall) and myself watch French and Dutch football, absolutely everything. But we can’t go and watch players unless they are in Scotland because of the situation the club is in. ‘That is the beauty of having a scouting department. At this moment in time you are actually just watching games off videos. You are getting players sent to you from agents, which is great and we follow it up, but it is not ideal.’","Sportsmail understands Rangers have spoken to Christian Nerlinger about taking on the newly created chief football operations officer role .

Antenucci has done the rounds in Italian football, playing for the likes of Giulianova, Catania, Ascoli, Torino and Ternana, for whom he scored 19 goals last season. His best return came in the 2009-10 campaign when he scored 24 times for Ascoli to win the Serie B golden boot. He arrives at the Leeds the day after their 2-0 home defeat to Brighton - their second loss from three Championship games under new coach David Hockaday. Antenucci's signing is Leeds' 11th of the summer and he becomes the fourth Italian purchased by owner Massimo Cellino. The former Cagliari president said last week that he still hopes to sign a further five or six players and is understood to be pursuing a move for Adryan, the Brazilian playmaker on loan at his old club from Flamengo.

Mauricio Pochettino is well known for encouraging a possession-based style of play, but not many Tottenham fans would've predicted his side would score after a 48-pass move during his first Premier League game at White Hart Lane. Unfortunately for former Spurs boss and current QPR manager Harry Redknapp, that's exactly what happened when midfielder Nacer Chadli finished off a fine passage of play with a powerful header past Rob Green. The move began with defender Jan Vertonghen picking up the ball inside his own half and finding Chadli out on the right by the halfway line. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Pochettino: We're trying to build a philosophy at Tottenham . Heads up: Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli finishes off his side's 48-pass move to make it 3-0 . Not enough: QPR keeper Rob Green can't stop the Belgian's header finding the back of the net . Possession football: Spurs played a total of 48 passes before Chadli finished with a well-taken header . The Belgium international chose to go back to Younes Kaboul and, after a long period of keep ball in front of keeper Hugo Lloris, Tottenham eventually worked it down their left side. Etienne Capoue, Nabil Bentaleb, Danny Rose, Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen were all involved in the move before the ball found Erik Lamela in the centre of the pitch. The Argentine skipped past the challenges of Richard Dunne and Maurcio Isla before playing an inch-perfect cross into the area for the unmarked Chadli to finish. It was the 25-year-old's second goal of the game and helped Pochettino's side record a convincing 4-0 win over new-boys QPR, with Eric Dier and Emmanuel Adebayor also on target. Every member of the Spurs XI completed a pass in the build-up to Nacer Chadli's second strike. Here's the top passers from one of the goals of the Premier League season so far: .

"West Ham forward Ravel Morrison has denied threatening to have his former girlfriend murdered for £10,000, a Manchester Crown Court has heard. Morrison has also been charged with harassing his former partner Reah Mansoor over a four-and-a-half-year period and assaulting her mother, Parveen Mansoor at a preliminary hearing on Thursday. Morrison is also accused of threatening to throw acid in the face of Miss Mansoor. He has denied the charges. In the dock: Ravel Morrison, wearing jeans and a leather jacket, arriving at Manchester Crown Court . Bailed: A provisional trial date has been set for January. Morrison must not enter Greater Manchester except for court appearances and when playing for West Ham . A provisional trial date has now been set for January 26, and Morrison, who appeared in the dock in a black leather jacket, white shirt and blue jeans, has been bailed on the condition he does not make direct or indirect contact with the two alleged victims. He must also not enter the Greater Manchester area except for court appearances or when on 'an official West Ham United football match'. The former Manchester United youngster was initially arrested and charged with two counts of common assault after allegedly punching and slapping Miss Mansoor, 19, and her mother in the early hours of July 27 in Salford. Morrison made his first appearance of the season in West Ham's Capital One Cup exit to Sheffield United . Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. Hammers manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham and QPR. He made his first appearance of the season in West Ham’s Capital One Cup clash against Sheffield United earlier this week, which they lost on penalties.

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . West Ham’s summer of discontent is long forgotten and Sam Allardyce is turning the club around, according to captain Mark Noble. The central midfielder has backed his manager to the hilt and believes the Hammers are heading in the right direction after testing times. Allardyce’s job had looked under threat towards the back end of last season, but there have been encouraging signs at the beginning of this campaign - not least during a demolition of Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, which saw new signing Mauro Zarate star in the 3-1 win. Looking forward: West Ham skipper Mark Noble has backed Sam Allardyce to succeed at Upton Park . Grim viewing: Allardyce's job appeared under threat throughout last season and the summer . All smiles: Noble was talking at the adidas #PredatorInstinct live event on Wednesday . And any talk surrounding the 59-year-old’s potential departure is premature, says Noble, who applauded the club’s decision to remain stable, particularly given the club have only been back in the Premier League for two seasons. ‘He’s a top man and has taken all the stick on the chin, going about his business the way he always does,’ Noble told Sportsmail. ‘It’s slowly turning back on his side now – especially after the way we played against Spurs and Palace – and hopefully we can carry that on. ‘We’re used to the manager and the way he works. Obviously a lot was said about his job in the summer but he’s fought through that and has come out the other side. ‘He’s too experienced and been in the game for too long to allow that sort of stuff affect him.’ Noble freely admits that last season’s finish of 13th wasn’t good enough, but rejects the notion that West Ham weren’t a decent side to watch – a chief complaint from a section of the support. All smiles: Noble celebrates with Stewart Downing (right) during the 3-1 win against Crystal Palace . ‘There were many times last year when we played really well, didn’t score and then got beat by the odd goal. That comes around to bite you,’ he added. ‘No-one says how well you played – they just see the result.’ The summer addition of Mauro Zarate, who scored at Palace last weekend, looks to have arrested the problems in front of goal – so severe that Kevin Nolan’s seven had him above everyone else in May. Teddy Sheringham has come in as a strikers' coach – visibly delighted when Zarate, Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole scored at Palace – with rewards reaped already. ‘It’s been proven that Mauro’s a top player,’ Noble said. ‘He’s scored a lot of goals in different countries and hopefully the decision to bring him here pays off. He scored a brilliant goal on Saturday and we’re going to need him. Hopefully we’ll have a much better season. ‘He’s a lovely fella. He’s had a bit of bad publicity in the past for being quite temperamental but since he’s been here he’s been brilliant.’ Mark Noble was speaking at the adidas #PredatorInstinct Live event- the world’s first real world event that combines gaming and football.

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Mauricio Pochettino has been impressed by Harry Kane's attitude and aptitude since arriving at Tottenham - no more so than when he overcame an early penalty miss against AEL Limassol to set his side on course for the Europa League group stage. Spurs continued their 100 per cent start to life under the former Argentina international by comfortably overcoming the Cypriots 3-0 in the second leg of their play-off on Thursday evening. Already boasting a 2-1 lead from the first leg in Cyprus, the north Londoners never looked like falling to a shock exit and secured their place in Friday's draw as Paulinho and Andros Townsend added to Kane's first-half opener. VIDEO Scroll down for Pochettino: My philosophy is simple play football, work hard . On target: Harry Kane impressed in Tottenham's 3-0 defeat of AEL Limassol in the Europa League . All smiles: Mauricio Pochettino, pictured with Limassol boss Ivaylo Petev, was pleased with the performance . The 21-year-old scored the winner last week and opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time in the return leg at White Hart Lane, coolly slotting home after Paulinho capitalised on an AEL mistake. It was no less than Kane deserved after another fine display and was a particularly impressive response to seeing his penalty saved after just 14 minutes. 'I have always believed in Harry since the first day,' Pochettino said. 'That is football. I think it is possible to miss penalties, but it is not important. 'He found a way to score, to play and did not let it affect his performance. It was good. 'He showed character and personality. He has a very strong mind and Harry is a very good player, too.' Brave: The Tottenham youngster stepped up to take an early penalty but missed from the spot . Kane may well have been impacted by the lengthy wait he had before his penalty after AEL goalkeeper Karim Fegrouch sustained a nasty-looking blow to the head in taking down Kyle Naughton. The Moroccan was taken to hospital with what Limassol manager Ivaylo Petev described as a 'bad situation' and Pochettino was quick to send his best to the goalkeeper. 'Maybe it affected Harry,' he said. 'I hope the keeper is okay and makes a good, quick recovery.' Back-up goalkeeper Pulpo Romero kept out Kane's spot-kick and had to be at his best to stop Spurs racking up an even bigger scoreline. Pochettino was delighted with his side's display, especially given he made nine changes from Sunday's 4-0 win against QPR. Perseverance: Harry Kane was rewarded with a beautifully composed opening goal . Asked about Andros Townsend - called up by England despite being omitted from the squad to face the Hoops - Pochettino said: 'It is good for him and other players that got 90 minutes and for the confidence. 'We have a lot of players, a very good squad and my job is just to choose the players for each squad. 'I am very happy, very pleased with the team. It was a very good performance today. 'There are no easy games because the Europa League is difficult to play, but we played very, very, very well against Limassol. We are very happy.' Selected: Tottenham winger Andros Townsend has been called up to the England squad . Pochettino said on the eve of the match that he had no intention in letting Townsend or Roberto Soldado leave before the end of the transfer window. Sandro, Vlad Chiriches and Lewis Holtby are amongst the other players to have been linked with a move away and Pochettino suggested there may well be movement before Monday's deadline. 'We have a lot of players with unbelievable quality,' he said. 'We need balance and it is possible we add some players, but not too much movement before the end of the transfer window.'","Mauricio Pochettino impressed with Tottenham performance against AEL Limassol as Spurs progressed to Europa League group stage .

"Click here to read Matt Lawton's special investigation as Malky Mackay and Iain Moody are investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Rio Ferdinand became the latest star to cast judgement on the League Managers Association's statement which was released on behalf of Malky Mackay on Thursday. The Queens Park Rangers defender took to Twitter to question the statement, which described Mackay's sexist, racist and homophobic messages as 'friendly text message banter' Ferdinand tweeted: 'Who wrote the #LMA statement???'. Confused: QPR defender Rio Ferdinand took to Twitter to question the LMA's statement . Unacceptable: Stan Collymore believes the LMA statement was 'f****** disgraceful' Institutional acceptance: Former Liverpool and England striker Collymore was unhappy with the LMA statement . In the statement Mackay apologised for sending messages he admits were 'disrespectful of other cultures', but he said he would fully co-operate with any official investigation after Cardiff sent a dossier to the Football Association detailing a number of issues during his stay in south Wales. Mackay and Iain Moody were sacked by the club last season and the Welsh club have sent a dossier to the Football Association alleging misconduct. The statement said that Mackay had been under pressure at the time of the messages and that he was 'letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.' Reported: Malky Mackay (right) and Iain Moody have been accused of being racist, sexist and homophobicin a series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff City . Exclusive: Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton's story in Thursday's Daily Mail . Click here to read Jason Roberts' verdict on the controversial statement from the LMA . Elsewhere, former England striker Stan Collymore has described the LMA's statement as being 'f****** disgraceful'. He said on Twitter: 'LMA statement. F****** disgraceful. Institutional acceptance of the ""banter"" of casual racism.' He does feel Mackay deserves a second chance, though, adding: 'Always kind to me, hope he says sorry (if true), and moves on.' Another former player who has worked closely on eliminating discrimination, Jason Roberts, tweeted excerpts from the LMA's statement and then said: 'That's it..I'm done for the evening..The LMA said it better than I ever could.. They are actually being serious! Somebody drafted that..WOW!' Shock: Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts couldn't believe the LMA's statement was serious . Opinion: Former Wigan and Reading striker Roberts shares his views via Twitter . Former Football League player and manager Leroy Rosenior has also had his say, revealing he's disappointed with the LMA's use of the term 'banter'. He told the BBC: 'If the LMA are going back into the dark ages to support people then I might have to withdraw my support. 'If Malky did use a couple of texts, as he admits to in the statement, then I'm disappointed and I think it needs to be dealt with not as something swept over or as a bit of banter. 'I know they (LMA) are trying to protect their member but in doing so I feel they are almost abusing another member, like myself.' The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.","Rio Ferdinand tweets 'Who wrote the LMA statement???'

"By . Ryan Gorman . Google's efforts to make it harder for governments to spy on ordinary citizens may be in vain. By using encryption, Google believes it can limit the amount of spying done by governments on innocent people and force agencies to narrow their efforts to criminals, terrorists and suspected offenders, internet security experts told the Washington Post. Despite this push for added security, an expert who spoke to MailOnline believes it will do no more than delay spying efforts at best. Google’s encryption efforts were initially approved last June, but recent reports detailing the previously PRISM program have caused it to prioritize the project, according to the Post. Spy headquarters: The NSA has been spying on ordinary Americans for years, according to recent disclosures . By encrypting information, firms are usually able to make it unintelligible to most anyone who comes across it – unless the encryption is broken. Depending on the level of encryption, it forces more of an effort to crack open the data, but with ProPublica reporting this week that the US and UK governments have been working to crack most forms of internet encryption since at least 2000, it would appear they have the upper hand. That disclosure, along with Edward Snowden leak reports from the Guardian and the Washington Post suggesting companies are basically turning on spigots that allow information to flow to the government nearly freely, has firms like Google scrambling to protect client privacy. The reasoning behind bolstering encryption schemes is that governments and others who want to pry open the data of ordinary citizens will be forced to limit the scope of their hacking, technology firms argue. Feverishly working: Google has ramped up efforts to encrypt data after recent disclosures of the NSA PRISM spying program . ‘It’s an arms race,’ Eric Grosse, vice president for security engineering at Google, told the Post. ‘We see these government agencies as among the most skilled players in this game.’ The US and Britain aren’t alone in their employment of cyber armies. Reports have shown that China, Iran, Israel, Russia and even Syria have legions of hackers awaiting their next marching orders. The National Security Agency (NSA) has spent the last decade-plus using super computers to break codes, obtaining encryption keys and even influencing encryption standards ‘to make them more vulnerable to outside attack,’ according to ProPublica, making them nearly useless in the process. Despite Google using some of the brightest minds in the world to encrypt the data coursing through its networks and servers, that still can’t completely stop spooks from kicking down the door. ‘If the NSA wants to get into your system, they are going to get in,’ a computer security expert told the Post, adding that ‘this is all about making dragnet surveillance impossible.’ Almost finished: The new encryption project is expected to be finished soon, months ahead of schedule . The agency declined to comment to the Post and was not immediately able to be reached by MailOnline for comment. For a company the size of Google, cost limits its ability to use a level of encryption that would cause anything more than a hiccup for government spies, according to Michael Hawkins, an IT specialist with a background in information security who spoke to MailOnline. Explaining that Google is likely working to encrypt data 'at rest' in servers, which makes it harder to crack, the Mountain View, CA-based search giant is also increasing the amount of resources it needs to do the encryption and decryption, Hawkins said. Google already encrypts Gmail and its bread and butter search for most users, but the data flowing between data centers is what is most vulnerable, according to the Post. PRISM: NSA's spying program, dubbed PRISM, has been the subject of several recent media reports detailing the scope of US government spying . Copies of emails, search histories and even browsing histories for users race between data centers through much-less secure connections than the ones Google has between it and users, the Post said, basically providing what amounts to a back door for hackers. The firm’s engineers are plowing forward to not only close that back door, but also fence it in. By encrypting each server and the information blasting through the fiber-optic lines between them using ‘very strong’ technology, experts told the Post, Google will have ‘end to end’ protection. The project should be finished months ahead of schedule, according to the Post. But if encryption is cracked for one user, hackers can use that exploit to root around the data of many users, Hawkins said, unless Google tied individual encryption keys to user passwords. This would make them much harder to crack, but still not impossible, he added. Resistance is futile: No matter how hard Google's engineers work to outfox the government, the NSA will ultimately crack whatever encryption it sets its sights on . No matter which route Google is going, the NSA will eventually crack it, Hawkins argues. Google was not immediately available for comment. 'All the NSA has to do to break even the toughest encryption is train a few thousand supercomputers - which you can rent by the hour on it and it would take a few days to a few weeks... it's expensive, but it would eventually get through,' said Hawkins. 'For every security mechanism put in place, there will eventually be technology to defeat it and, with the near limitless resources of the 'black' agencies of the US government, it is comparatively easy for them to do it,' Hawkins furthered. The level of encryption needed to be used by Google, 2048 bit, is prohibitively expensive at the scale Google would need, according to Hawkins, who suggested that Google is perhaps scrambling to look less evil in the wake of the fallout from the Snowden disclosures. 'They can probably delay the NSA for a while, but I'm of the viewpoint that the NSA will just work harder to crack it,' Hawkins said, adding that 'Google is probably using it more for marketing than actual security.'","The effort began in earnest over one year ago, but has picked up steam in the wake of PRISM revelations .

"By . Rebecca Brett for MailOnline . and Camilla Canocchi For Mailonline . The world-renowned explorer who was first to reach both poles has praised a young British adventurer for becoming the first person to walk 1,500 miles solo across Mongolia. Sir Ranulph Fiennes, dubbed by the Guinness Book of Records the ‘world’s greatest living explorer’, said Ash Dykes was one of the last 'adventuring firsts'. Dykes, 23, strolled into the record books after spending 78 days alone crossing the unforgiving land of the high Altai Mountains, scorching Gobi Desert and the seemingly-endless Mongolian Steppe. An incredible accomplishment:  Ash Dykes travelled 1,500 miles, over 78 days, in temperatures reaching 40C . He battled . raging sandstorms, heat exhaustion and the unrelenting loneliness of . crossing the world's most sparsely populated country at walking pace. Word even spread among the local Mongols about the strange foreigner walking across the country - and the young Welshman was soon nicknamed the 'lonely snow leopard'. Sir Ranulph, who was the first to cross the Antarctic and Artic Ocean, and the first to circumnavigate the world along its polar axis, said it was ‘an example of great determination’. He said: ‘I applaud every endeavour to achieve an adventuring ""first"" - a feat which is becoming harder all the time.' 'The world's greatest living explorer': Sir Ranulph Fiennes was the first to reach both poles . He added: ‘This young man’s completion of a ""first"" solo trek across Mongolia, from the Altai to the Steppe, will have proved both physically and mentally challenging and is an example of great determination.’ Ash, from Colwyn Bay, North Wales, became the first known person to walk from Mongolia's western border with Russia to it's easterly border with China. After completing his record-breaking trek on August 6, he said: 'It is an absolutely unreal feeling. It still hasn't really sunk in, it feels surreal. Ready, steady, go: Ash started his journey in a small settlement of Olggi in the west of Mongolia, near Russia . 'It is an absolutely unreal feeling': Ash reached Choybalsan in the east of Mongolia at the end of his trek . 'I haven't had the time to fully reflect. I have done what a lot of people said would be impossible.' Ash dragged an 18-stone, homemade trailer behind him all the way from the small settlement of Olggi in the west to the town of Choybalsan in the east. It carried the dehydrated food ration packs, large water butt and camping equipment he needed on his trek through the brutal terrain. Ash covers up during a sandstorm: 'The storms, as frightening as they were when you were in the centre of them, were unbelievable to witness' Ash had to fight the loneliness of walking alone to keep focused on the goal of reaching his destination . The one-man campsite: 'It was sometimes difficult leaving a really nice family in a small settlement or isolated yurt to face the extreme conditions alone all over again' His longest day of walking saw him on his feet for 14 hours as he covered 34 miles. And he reached a peak altitude of 8850ft along the way. Mongolia is the second-largest landlocked country on earth at 603,930 square miles and the most sparsely populated with only 3,133,318 people - averaging just 5.19 people to every one square mile.

He said: 'There have been so many unforgettable experiences on this trek it is impossible to list them all.

"By . Claire Elliot For The Daily Mail . Wikileaks founder Julian Assange gave a rambling press conference yesterday claiming he would leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London ‘soon’ after two years inside. He complained about the difficulty of living in a small room in the imposing six-storey townhouse and claimed his human rights had been violated. The 43-year-old  Australian added: ‘I can confirm I will be leaving the embassy soon.’ Assange is fighting extradition to Sweden where he is accused of rape, which he denies. He will be arrested if he leaves the building in Knightsbridge where police have been stationed outside round the clock since he arrived in June 2012. The constant watch is thought to have cost taxpayers at least £7million so far. There were at least 20 officers outside the embassy yesterday. Scroll down for video . Press conference: Julian Assange spoke at the Ecuadorian embassy today where he said he would leave 'soon' after two years there . Message: In a monologue Assange said he was 'imprisoned' in the embassy but denied problems with his health is the reason for wanting to leave . During the . press conference Assange thanked the Government for making changes to . extradition laws that allow those who have not been charged to remain at . liberty. He . suggested Parliament had changed the law because of the ‘abuses of my . rights’. But the Home Office said the changes would not apply . retrospectively. A . spokesman said his case would be dealt with under the law as it stood . when Sweden issued the European Arrest Warrant in 2010, when there was . no requirement for prosecutors to have taken a charging decision before . completing the paperwork. Julian Assange's failing health looks likely to end his two year stay in the Ecuadorian embassy. Assange . is, according to a WikiLeaks source, suffering from the potentially . life-threatening heart condition arrhythmia and has a chronic lung . complaint and dangerously high blood pressure. A . severe shortage of Vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin, is impacting on his . general health – in the long term, it can trigger asthma and diabetes, . weaken bones and increase the risk of dementia. The . Ecuadorians have asked permission to take him to hospital – using a . diplomatic car as an ambulance if the need arises – but it’s a request . the Foreign Office has declined to answer. In . the meantime, he works out with a former SAS veteran who acts as his . personal trainer and plays football alone in the embassy corridor in an . effort to keep flexible. He . is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes . during his incarceration, when he emerged on the balcony to address his . supporters in August 2012. He has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft. Near a Victorian fireplace he has a . treadmill donated by the Left-wing film-maker Ken Loach and in his first . year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine. There has been speculation that Assange was planning to leave the embassy to seek hospital treatment. He . has been reported to be suffering from vitamin D deficiency due to a . lack of sunlight, a chronic lung complaint because of life without fresh . air, and arrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of the . heartbeat. Assange said living inside a small room in a building that . had no outside area would affect any ‘healthy person’. ‘The United Nations minimum standard for prisoners is one hour a day of outside exercise,’ he said. Even when I was in Wandsworth prison in solitary confinement, that was respected.’ All change: The fugitive Australian WikiLeaks founder will give a news conference from his London hideout at 9am and may announce his intention to leave . Is he leaving? After two years inside the Ecuadorian embassy (pictured) Julian Assange may be about to leave after developing heart problems cause by a lack of sunlight . But . he said he was emerging for other reasons, although he did not say what . these were. However, as the day wore on it became clear that the press . conference had been a publicity stunt, with his representatives saying . he would not be leaving while the extradition order remained. His . spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said Assange had no intention of handing . himself over to the police and could only leave if the British . Government ‘calls off the siege outside’. Assange . claims that if he is extradited to Sweden he will be sent on to the US . where he could be tried for the largest information leak in the . country’s history. WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of confidential . US documents on the internet in 2010. He walked into the Ecuadorean embassy on June 19, 2012, and was granted political asylum two months later. He . said he had been detained for four years, having spent time in prison . and under house arrest before retreating to the embassy. Last week he . lost a legal bid to have the arrest warrant against him cancelled. Ecuador’s . foreign minister Ricardo Patino said yesterday: ‘It is time to free . Julian Assange. It is time for his human rights to be finally . respected.’ He added: ‘Ecuador is obligated to protect Julian Assange in our embassy until he can fully enjoy his right to asylum.’ The Ecuador government said it wanted a meeting with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to discuss freeing Assange. The . Foreign Office said he would be extradited if he left the embassy. ‘As . ever we look to Ecuador to help bring this difficult, and costly, . situation to an end,’ a spokesman said.

However, although the draw of sun, sea and sightseeing Down Under may be strong, 90 per cent of people also revealed they will never make it to their perfect destination. Just one in ten Brits believes they will make it to Australia for a holiday, with the rest calling it just a pipe dream, according to a survey.

But it's not just Australia that Brits would like to visit. They have also set their hearts on New Zealand (47 per cent), Canada (42 per cent) and The Maldives (31 per cent) as other top destinations. Myles Stephenson, CEO of my Travel Cash, which commissioned the survey, said: 'We wanted to get a real insight into where people dream of travelling to.

'Pound sterling is currently experiencing a five-year high against currencies including the US dollar, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, meaning holiday money can stretch a lot further than people might think.' Holiday envy was also revealed as a common trend, as one in two Brits admitted to feeling jealous of friends and family visiting their dream destination instead of them. One third admitted to coming close to booking their dream getaway, while over a quarter revealed that this had happened a number of times.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian newsreader who declined a challenge to tip a bucket of ice over his head for charity has been met with criticism from people offended by his message. Sunshine Coast WIN sports presenter Lincoln Humphries delivered the on-air message to 'everyone, everywhere' encouraging them to stop 'pouring fresh water' over their head and 'wasting ice.' Responding to a viewer's request that he participate in the ALS Project, Humphries said it was a 'worthy cause' but wasting water wasn't necessary in aiding charity considering the shortage of it in other countries. Scroll down for video . Queensland newsreader Lincoln Humphries turned down an ice buck challenge on live television . He criticised people who poured ice and water over their head because it was a waste of the resource other countries are short on . He suggested a number of other charities as alternatives to the ALS challenge . He encouraged people to show their support for The Red Cross and Cancer Council, instead.

Reacting to unpopular feedback about his take on the charity challenge, Humphries reportedly apologised on Facebook where he said he shouldn't have used his position 'as a soap box.' He also called it a 'gross error of judgement', according to 9news. But Humphries wouldn't comment about the supposed apology when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. He did however defend the good work that ALS is doing. He also said he was 'pushing for a national, annual MND day'  to ensure the cause lasts. 'The fundraising has been nothing short of astounding,' he said. Shane Warne jumped on board electing to get doused in ice-cold water by his 14-year-old son Jackson .

Exxon Mobil fell $3.57, or 3.5 percent, to $99.70 after the energy company said that oil and gas production slipped six percent, disappointing analysts. Oil and gas production fell to 3.84 million barrels of oil and gas per day from 4.15 million barrels last year. The decline was driven by the expiration of rights to a field in Abu Dhabi and natural field declines. Whole Foods Market fell 96 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.15 after reporting quarterly sales that fell shy of Wall Street expectations. The upscale grocer also lowered its sales forecast for the year.

"By . Neil Ashton for the Daily Mail . When Rio Ferdinand talks about the England job, he speaks with authority. He wants a successful national team. To think that he could soon be taking the sessions as England’s head coach is a tantalising, exciting prospect. He is the first from the Golden Generation — the term given to England’s players by the FA a decade ago — to say he wants the biggest job of the lot. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rio Ferdinand take on the Ice Bucket Challenge . England dream: Rio Ferdinand wants the biggest job of the lot . In a couple of years, when Roy Hodgson’s contract is up, Ferdinand will be 37 and perhaps, with a senior figure alongside him as a sounding board or working in an advisory capacity, this really could work. We have tried everything else and everything else has failed. Ferdinand has already started his coaching badges. When he gets his ProLicence, he could be further down the route of landing the biggest job in English football. In many ways international football could be a young man’s game, with Ferdinand commanding the respect of the dressing room after a glittering playing career. England’s players will be aware of his achievements in the game, fully aware that Ferdinand was one of the finest central defenders of his generation. He has worked with some big names in club football — Harry Redknapp, David O’Leary, Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes — and learned from all of them. Fitting right in: Ferdinand with David Beckham and Sir Trevor Brooking on the bench in South Africa . At international level he was inspired by Terry Venables and Glenn Hoddle, people he respects and admires. He has made mistakes, but he will be right to question those in power if he doesn’t get an opportunity to manage when his playing career ends. It feels right that Ferdinand should be part of the future of English football and he should be encouraged by the FA to fulfil his dream. If it becomes a reality, England really could be on to something.","Ferdinand has set his sights on England job after completing his coaching badges .

"By . Freya Noble . A Gold Coast man who filmed himself doing a handstand on top of a moving car earlier this year has been found guilty of dangerous driving. Ryuichi Hozaki and his lawyers challenged the dangerous driving charge at Southport Magistrates Court on Monday, where he is currently on trial over the incident. But Gold Coast Bulletin report that Magistrate Paul Johnstone said 'the manner of driving cannot be described as anything else but dangerous.' Scroll down for video . Ryuichi Hozaki filmed himself handstanding on the roof of his car in February of this year . Footage from February showed the 30-year-old exit the window of his small Toyota as it coasted down a deserted street at 15 kilometres per hour. He the lifted himself into a handstand and held the upright position for a few seconds before re-entering his vehicle. The video revealed he repeated this movement a number of times. The Southport man was travelling down a secluded road in an industrial park in Burleigh Heads, at twilight when he shot the film. However Hozaki, an agile acrobat and stuntman told the court he believed the activity was safe, and said 'It depends on what you think dangerous means'. In a deserted industrial area, Hozaki lifted himself out the drivers window and on top of his Toyota . The Southport man told the court he was an experienced stuntman and the manoeuvre was not dangerous . It is understood he recorded the footage to post to Facebook page 'Handstand February', a group which encourages amateur and professional acrobats and atheletes alike to work on their handstands every day for the month. The aim of the page is for the community to coach each other on techniques, and members are encouraged to document their progress through a daily picture posted online. In February, officers were alerted to the stunt when onlookers contacted police who then seized Hozaki's smartphone and found the footage. The man repeated the movement a few times while on a quiet street in an industrial area . The Japanese man is part of a Facebook group called Handstand February which encourages amateurs and professionals alike to practice their technique . The Japanese national was then charged with dangerous driving, which can carry a penalty of up to three years in jail. However Hozaki's solicitor Colin Greatorix challenged this charge, and said it should instead be replaced with a count of driving without due care and attention. The 30-year-old said he had chosen to execute the stunt at night in a secluded area to risk the chance of any accident occurring. He has been found guilty and sentenced to one year probation and community service.

"By . Leon Watson . Women in Missouri will have to wait three days after first seeing a doctor before having an abortion under a new bill passed by the state's Republican-controlled Legislature. Democratic Governor Jay Nixon has not said whether he will sign into law or veto it. The measure would triple Missouri's current 24-hour waiting period and put the state in line with Utah and South Dakota as the only states to mandate a 72-hour time frame. Missouri's Democratic Governor Jay Nixon has not said whether he will sign into law or veto a state legislature bill that would require women to wait three days after first seeing a doctor before having an abortion . Missouri currently has only one clinic performing elective abortions. The House voted 111 to 39 in favor of the measure on Wednesday, sending it to Nixon, who has previously allowed other abortion restrictions to become law without his signature. That included a measure last year that requires doctors to be in the room for the initial dose of a drug used in medical abortions. Nixon said on Tuesday that he would review the extended waiting period and act in a manner consistent with his other actions on abortion legislation. Senators passed the waiting period measure earlier this week after Democrats agreed to stop filibustering the bill in exchange for Republicans dropping other measures the Democrats opposed, related to union fees and photo identification requirements for elections. Under both current law and the new legislation, Missouri's abortion waiting period doesn't apply in instances deemed by a doctor to be a medical emergency. But women do have to wait in cases of rape and incest. Abortion rights advocates parade around the State Capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri . Supporters argue that women need more time to digest information received by a doctor. In addition to the waiting period, Missouri's current abortion law requires doctors to provide women with a variety of written information about the procedure, and they must be given the opportunity to hear the fetus' heartbeat on an ultrasound. 'Life is precious. I want to make sure the unborn child has a chance to survive,' Senator David Sater, a Republican pharmacist from rural southwest Missouri, said during debate on the legislation he sponsored. Opponents said the longer waiting period would push woman further into pregnancy before an abortion, which can increase risk. They argued it would also make women pay for expensive hotel visits or drive multiple times to a clinic. A Planned Parenthood in St Louis is the only facility in Missouri that currently performs elective abortions. Anti-abortion and pro-choice activists stand next to each other in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington . 'The idea that a woman would not have taken this time already is insulting,' said Republican Genise Montecillo, a St Louis Democrat. About 25 abortion-rights advocates gathered at the state Capitol on Monday and stayed throughout the night into Wednesday as part of what they described as a 72-hour 'citizen filibuster' against the bill. Speakers took turns talking about the negative impacts of the 72-hour waiting period from a lectern on the Capitol steps. They plan to continue until Thursday afternoon. 'I think the 72 hours is way too long,' St. Louis resident Madi Mauck said while taking a break from speaking at the lectern. 'Making them wait longer is an emotional and financial burden.' Republican supporters of the measure said the longer waiting period could help reduce abortions and that lawmakers had a moral obligation to pass the bill. 'The objectors stood and focused on the rights of the mother,' Rep Kevin Elmer, a southwest Missouri Republican, said before Wednesday's final House vote. 'I stand here for the rights of the unborn.' Democrats argued the longer waiting period would just force women to go to abortion facilities in neighboring states, citing a clinic in Overland Park, Kansas, and a location in Belleville, Illinois. State figures show there were about 9,000 abortions performed on Missouri residents in 2012 and that the number of abortions for Missourians has declined each year since 2008. While Missouri's bill is similar to those Utah and South Dakota law, there are some key differences. Under South Dakota's law, weekends and holidays don't count toward the 72-hour period. Utah's waiting period does not apply when a woman becomes pregnant because of rape or incest, or when she is younger than 14. A clause in Missouri's bill if a court finds the three-day time frame unconstitutional would seek to immediately revert to the 24-hour period.

"By . Adam Duggan . Buddhist monks arriving at an event to the sound of chanting and bells isn't outside the realm of possibilities for most people. But a crowd at New York's Union Square got the shock of their lives when four 'monks' broke from their solemn, statuette poses and started breakdancing to the Beastie Boys hit song Ch-Check It Out. The performance was produced to raise awareness for 'MCA Day', an annual event which honours the life of deceased Beastie Boy Adam 'MCA' Yauch. Breaking Out: Two of the 'Buddhist monks' are seen breakdancing to the Beastie Boys hit song Ch-Check It Out . The four dancers – identified as Franklin Chen, Jason Ng, Erich Reyes and Stephen Pyo – start their performance by solemnly entering Union Square dressed in robes, with their hands in a prayer-like motion. To the sound of bells and chanting, the men each make their way to a corner of the makeshift dancefloor – a black and white mat, featuring a logo promoting ‘MCA Day’ in the square's centre. Once in place, the group bow their heads, while the chanting and bells continue playing. Suddenly, the Beastie Boys hit song ‘Ch-Check It Out’ starts to play and the ‘monks’ break from their solemn stances and start busting their moves. Arriving in style: The four 'Buddhist monks' arrive at New York's Union Square . Why so serious? One of the 'monks' is seen looking very solemn, ahead of the performance . Like a prayer: Three of the 'Buddhist monks' are seen bowing their heads and gesturing that they were praying with their hands . Buddhist monks may seem like a strange way to advertise an annual memorial day for Yauch, who died in 2012 following a long battle with cancer. However, the former Beastie Boy was a practicing Buddhist and supporter of Tibetan Independence, after converting in 1994. Frank Anselmo, the man behind the video and creative director of New York-based advertising firm KNARF, claims he and his crew spent six months planning the stunt. On the question of whether or not the monks really are men of the robe, Mr Anselmo told the New York Daily News: ‘Of course they're not real monks.’ Spinning around: One of the 'monks' can be seen performing a spin on his head . Gettin' down: One of the 'monks' attempts to perform the splits . A 'monk' without any hang ups: One of the 'monks' performs a handstand, while being cheered on by his fellow performers . After auditioning several breakdancers, the team eventually narrowed it down to four that would be willing to shave their heads. Identical robes to the ones worn by the Dalai Lama were also ordered from Nepal. Having grown up in New York, Mr Anselmo idolised the Beastie Boys – who were also born and raised in the city. The third annual MCA Day took place in Brooklyn on Saturday.

"By . Rob Shepherd . Follow @@robshepherd5 . Neymar might not be better than Pele but in many ways he is already bigger. In the modern world of sports marketing 22-year-old Neymar’s image is omnipresent in Brazil. 'Neymar-keting' sees the player endorse a wide range of products from soft drinks to mobile phones and he has even appeared on the front cover of Time magazine. On Monday he will aim to endear himself further to a besotted Brazil by leading the World Cup hosts to victory against Cameroon. Fancy footwork: Neymar is the poster boy for the World Cup and his image is all over Brazil . Hopes of a nation: Brazil fans will be praying Neymar can lead them to World Cup glory . All this from a player who four years ago could have moved to, er, West Ham. In 2010 agent Barry Silkman alerted the club to a new Brazilian wonder player at Santos - the club where Pele played. The Hammers swiftly made a £12million bid for a player then 'unknown' in Europe. But Santos, and one suspects the Neymar family, turned the offer down. An approach from Chelsea soon after was rejected, too. Neymar moved on to Barcelona last summer. Mexico skipper Rafael Marquez, who will lead his country out against Croatia on Monday, has set a new record this summer. He is the first player in World Cup history to have worn the captain’s armband at FOUR consecutive finals. One to Watch: . Chile’s Alexis Sanchez is often left in the shadows at Barcelona despite being the club's second top scorer behind Lionel Messi. Danger man: Alexis Sanchez (left) has impressed for Chile and has attracted interest from Livepool . But he showed his talent in Chile’s wins over Australia and Spain and will pose a big threat to Holland. Liverpool fans will be particularly interested in the 25-year-old on Monday, as Sanchez could be offered by Barcelona in part exchange for Luis Suarez. Holland only need to avoid defeat against Chile to finish top of group B and stay on course for what could be a classic Total Football v Samba soccer final. Kicking up a storm: Robin van Persie and Holland will top group B if they beat Chile tonight . If the Dutch do top their group they would avoid Brazil in the first knockout stage and most likely face Mexico - creating a path for a possible Holland v Brazil final . If Brazil, who kick off their final group game four hours after the Dutch, much to the chagrin of boss Louis van Gaal, top their group they would face Chile, who have the capability of bursting the balloons of both countries. I-Say: . It is not often I agree with what Sven Goran Eriksson has to say. After all, here is a manager who, after a brief period of bringing some stability to the England set up, wasted a 'golden generation' who should have got much closer to winning the World Cup or European Championships when he was in charge. He was allowed to stay in the job far too long. Time to go: Roy Hodgson has taken charge of England for two tournaments with little success so far . Underperformed: Eriksson's England were expected to do better than two quarter finals at World Cups . But he is spot on to say the FA are wrong to back Roy Hodgson who, ahead of Tuesday’s game against Costa Rica, says he won’t quit. The fact is Hodgson has been in charge for two tournaments and England have underperformed badly. The whole set up needs a fresh approach. The problem is many contenders don’t really want the job. It is interesting to see that sources close to Hull boss Steve Bruce have indicated he would be willing to take on the challenge - or poisoned chalice depending on your view. I say he would be a good choice. Bruce would be an ideal figure to nurture the young players emerging and would be tactically more flexible than Hodgson. He would also help former Manchester Unite team-mate Gary Neville mature into the role down the line. World Cup Bet : .

"By . Graham Poll . Follow @@MAIL_GPoll . They say the referee has had a good game if he has not been noticed and many times this season, that was true. However, inevitably there were decisions which put the referee in the spotlight, usually for the wrong reasons. These were the season's five most contentious incidents... Andre Marriner sent off Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at Chelsea in March 2014 after the winger handled the ball to stop what he thought would have been a goal for the hosts. Mix up: Andre Marriner sends off Kieran Gibbs (third left) for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's handball . Anthony Taylor allowed Chelsea’s goal against Cardiff City when Samuel Eto’o kicked the ball away from Cardiff keeper David Marshall when he was in the process of clearing it upfield. The ball is considered within the control of the goalkeeper even when he throws it from his hand to drop kick it. Jon Moss awarded Manchester United a penalty against Crystal Palace for a Kagisho Dikgacoi challenge on Ashley Young which was clearly outside the area. Not spot on: Jon Moss awarded a penalty for this foul by Kagisho Dikgacoi on Ashley Young despite the fact it was outside the area . Mike . Jones disallowed Cheick Tiote's perfectly good goal against Manchester . City for offside by ruling that Yoan Gouffran had got a slight touch on . the ball when he had not. A player must touch the ball to be considered . to be interfering with play. Jones was then affected for the rest of . the game and badly misjudged Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa’s shocking challenge on Samir Nasri . which should have been a red card – perhaps the worst of the season. Assistant referee Scott Ledger made two wrong calls in Tottenham’s defeat by Manchester City. Firstly he indicated a foul and a penalty when Danny Rose clearly played the ball when challenging Edin Dzeko and was wrongly dismissed. He then flagged for offside and had a perfectly good goal Michael Dawson goal disallowed - both helped City to victory. Disallowed: But this Michael Dawson goal for Spurs against Manchester City should have stood . Mike Riley publicly criticising Andre Marriner and apologising on his behalf to West Brom manager Steve Clarke after Marriner awarded Chelsea a penalty after Ramires dived. Whilst Marriner was clearly wrong and was ‘conned’ by the Brazilians dive it can’t be good for an individual referee to be highlighted by his boss – team managers would not do it. 1. Mark Clattenburg - who is the best natural referee who can get the most out of a game with his approach and attitude towards advantage. Once again controversy followed him with 'Lallanagate' this season after the race allegations from 'Mikelgate' from last season. He survives because he is so good on the field but needs to take care that he doesn’t push the friendly approach too far. Official No 1: Mark Clattenburg has been the best referee in the country this season . 2. Michael Oliver - who matures with every performance. Refereeing the Manchester derby, Liverpool’s 5-1 demolition of Arsenal and the north London derby without problems shows great development. He will be No 1 it’s just a case of when. 3. Mike Dean - continues to perform consistently well in the big games despite coming off the FIFA list at the end of 2013 due to age restrictions. Arsenal v Chelsea and Manchester City v Chelsea went well. Even Jose Mourinho congratulated Dean after losing to Sunderland! Refs can never please everybody. 4. Martin Atkinson - returned to good form and was rewarded with a lot of key appointments – refereeing the Liverpool vs Chelsea game with huge common sense was his highlight for me as this game perhaps affected the title more than others and went without a single issue. Reward: Martin Atkinson (left) has been given key matches, while Howard Webb will go to the World Cup . 5. Howard Webb - had a really interesting season – fantastic in Europe but indecisive in Premier League games. He has the World Cup finals to officiate at and then a summer of reflection and perhaps retirement. Whatever you think of him he would be sorely missed for his presence on a list short of quality in depth. 6. Anthony Taylor – recovered after a poor start and is a solid and safe referee for most PL games. 7. Chris Foy – steady referee whose experience gets him through most games. 8. Phil Dowd – started the season in great form helped by his huge weight loss last summer. As the weight has gone back on the performances have dipped – refereeing is about fitness and positioning. Not fit enough: Phil Dowd, here sending off Paul Dummett, has seen his form dip as his weight increased . 9. Andre Marriner – A real mixed bag from Marriner who gaffed with the Gibbs/Oxlade-Chamberlain dismissal and the Ramires penalty against West Brom. Still a good referee but not his best season. 10. Kevin Friend – Had the pleasure of sending Alan Pardew off for that butt but appears to have lost the support of the PGMO to handle any big games.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Andy Cole thinks the best players in the world will not want to sign for Manchester United while they are out of the Champions League. Thanks to their seventh-place finish under David Moyes, United did not qualify for Europe last year for the first time in almost a quarter of a century. United have been well behind their rivals in the transfer market this summer too despite the appointment of manager Louis van Gaal. Having his say: Former Manchester United striker Andy Cole (left) spoke out about his old club at the launch of Manchester United and Apollo Tyre's Go The Distance Pitch . Poacher:  Cole in his pomp, scoring against Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final in 1996 . New boys Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo all have potential, but they are currently not in the same league as the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Toni Kroos and Diego Costa, who have all gone to United's rivals in the transfer window. More signings are expected before the window shuts, but former Red Devils striker Cole thinks United will struggle to sign the very best players. 'I know a lot of people have been complaining about the club not bringing enough players in, but it gets tougher when you don't have European football because if you want to try and bring in the best, you have to entice them with European football,' said Cole, who was speaking at the launch of Manchester United and Apollo Tyre's Go The Distance Pitch at Old Trafford. Solution? Louis van Gaal has signed left-backs Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw, but reinforcements are needed . 'Like it or not, every top player wants to play in Europe, and this year we aren't playing in it.' Cole's former team-mate Paul Scholes said he thinks the club needs to sign five new players to stop them slipping into the 'wilderness'. United have been linked with a number of other players, including Angel di Maria, Kevin Strootman and Daley Blind. New boys: Ander Herrera has been bought from Athletic Bilbao to bolster United's midfield . And Cole believes reinforcements are required quickly. 'I think we need to buy more players,' said the former United hitman, who scored 121 times in 275 appearances for the club. 'We need to improve competition for places. If you are going to get stronger you need to buy players. 'And if you want to finish in a higher position you have got to bring in better players. 'You have to make sure your football club does that. I think it has been tough for them.' United bound? The Red Devils are reportedly interested in signing Angel di Maria from Real Madrid . Despite last weekend's defeat to Swansea, the former England frontman believes Van Gaal will enjoy a successful debut season at Old Trafford. Cole even thinks the title is not beyond United's reach this term. 'Nothing is above Manchester United,' he said. 'Many years ago Alan Hansen said you'll never win anything with kids and we won the Premier League that year. Anything is possible.'","Andy Cole: the world's best  do not want to sign for Manchester United .

"By . Associated Press . Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, have donated $1 million to a Washington state campaign seeking to expand background checks on gun sales, bringing the total amount the campaign has brought in up to nearly $6 million. The donation to the Initiative 594 campaign was given on Friday but it was not made public until Monday, when it posted on the state's Public Disclosure Commission website. I-594 would require background checks for all gun sales and transfers in Washington state, including at gun shows and for private sales. Under the measure, exemptions would exist, including gifts within a family and antiques. Bill and Melinda Gates, pictured in July, have donated $1million to a Washington state campaign seeking to expand background checks on gun sales . In a joint written statement issued on Monday, the couple said that they believe I-594 'will be an effective and balanced approach to improving gun safety in our state by closing existing loopholes for background checks.' The large donation comes on the heels of fellow Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's $500,000 donation earlier this month. Also last week, venture capitalist Nick Hanauer donated an additional $1 million, bring his total donation to the campaign to nearly $1.4 million. Other prominent figures who have made large donations to the campaign include former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife, Connie, who have given $580,000. A rival campaign, Initiative 591, would prevent the state from adopting background-check laws that go beyond the national standard, which requires the checks for sales by licensed dealers but not for purchases from private sellers.

"By . Martin Robinson . Tracey Connelly, the cruel mother who allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death, has been seen on a trip to the supermarket as she enjoys her new life out of prison. The 32-year-old, who ballooned to more than 22st while in a Durham jail, was spotted strolling to the shops from her bail hostel with a cheerful friend. Clutching a 'bag for life' Connelly walked into Aldi to pick up some food before grabbing a bargain in Poundland. An onlooker said she was also seen looking at posters advertising Christmas food offer, presumably planning for the festive period, but others shoppers clearly had no idea who she was. Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is out of prison and allowed to lead a relatively normal life despite being jailed in 2009 . over the brutal death of her son Peter, right . Let out: Connelly has left Low Newton jail (pictured) in Brasside, County Durham and was released after five years there for allowing her son's death . 'She had a shopping bag on her shoulder and looked like she was really enjoying herself,' a witness told The Sun. 'No one clocked her in the supermarket — they barely gave a second look. They had no idea they were exchanging glances with one of Britain's most notorious criminals.' Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing . nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend . Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Peter was . just 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at . his mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 . separate injuries, including a broken back.

The case provoked a . national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and . doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the . child’s life. As she was granted parole, Connelly . had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection, . but ministers refused. These orders are rare and only four are currently in force.

"By . Anna Edwards . Modern Scouts can earn badges in cookery, circus skills and orienteering. But the skills demanded of a Scout back in 1914 were distinctly different; as members were expected to master the arts in horseshoe fitting, know the dangers of diphtheria and slaughterhouse rules. The Scout Association has republished a century-old guide that shows just how much the organisation has changed over the last 100 years. Lord Robert Baden-Powell with some of his Boy Scouts. The 1914 guide advised members on the finer points o blacksmith work and fireman skills . For the Fireman badge, Scouts had to throw themselves from a height of 10ft into a net or sheet. But they not only had to save their own skins, they also had to carry a boy of their own size down and up 12 steps. The Blacksmith badge demanded Scouts learn how to make a horseshoe, while the Poultry Farmer badge required Scouts to kill and pluck birds for their dinner, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The members,  were also taught how to spot the warning signs of ditheria. Perhaps it comes as no surprise, given that during World War II over 50,000 Scouts were trained to undertake National War Service jobs, including acting as police messengers, firemen and stretcher bearers. The no-nonsense badges are a far cry from the more varied pursuits of the Association today, which offers members the opportunity to learn about public relations and meteorology. Some of the new badges launched by the Scouts Association are a far cry from the vocational ones 100 years ago . But whereas the emphasis was on vocational badges in 1914, the Scouts now vary practical badges such as mechanical or nautical skills with more lighthearted hobbies such as crafts. And while the badges may have changed, so has the historic oath, so that the membership promise can include atheists. The Scout movement is to preserve the historic promise by its members that they will do their duty to God, its leaders announced in November. Baden-Powell's Scouting for Boys has sold 150 million copies since 1908, making it the fourth bestselling book of all time after The Bible, The Koran and Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book. There are only five countries in the world that do not have Scouting – China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Andorra. In the past one hundred years, over half a billion men and women have taken the Scout Promise. Sea Scouts helped evacuate Dunkirk during World War II. Polar explorer Ernest Shackleton took two Scouts with him on his final expedition to the Antarctic on the RSS Discovery. Source: Scouts Association . They bowed to pressure from secular lobbyists and offered boys and girls from atheist families the chance to make a special non-religious pledge when they sign up as Scouts. But new recruits will continue to make the religious promise unless they ask for the atheist version. Scout officials said that following a 10-month consultation 'the core Scout Promise remains in place and scouting remains fully committed as a movement that explores faith and religion as a core element of its programme'. Although the Guides remain an all-female group, Scouts have accepted girls as members since the 1970s and now have more than 77,000 girls among 537,000 members. The Scout Promise, which dates from the foundation of the movement in 1907, requires that new members declare: ‘On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’ Different versions for the use of Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists have been available since 1960, although all have included a religious reference. There are also versions for foreign members which allow them to pledge duty ‘to the country in which I am now living’ rather than to the Queen. The new wording for atheists says: ‘On my honour I promise that I will do my best to uphold our Scout values, to do my duty to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’","The Blacksmith badge taught Scouts how to make a horseshoe, while the Poultry Farmer badge required Scouts to kill birds .

All walks of life: Police said 108 people were arrested in Canada, 76 in the U.S and 164 in countries from Spain to South Africa and Australia, among them teachers, doctors and priests . Canadian police described the Project Spade operation as one of the largest child porn busts they've ever seen. ‘It . is alleged that officers seized hundreds of thousands of videos . detailing horrific sexual acts against very young children, some of the . worst that they have ever viewed,’ Toronto Inspector Joanna . Beaven-Desjardins said. Police said 108 people were arrested in Canada, 76 in the U.S and 164 in countries from Spain to South Africa and Australia. Forty . school teachers, nine doctors and nurses, and more than 30 people who . volunteered with kids were among those taken into custody. The list of suspects also includes nine clergymen, six police officers and three foster parents. Police said the children were ‘rescued from child exploitation’ but did not give more details.

Police . allege Brian Way, 42, instructed people around the world to create the . videos of children ranging from 5 to 12 years of age, then distributed . the videos via his company, Azov Films, to international customers. The videos included naked boys from Germany, Romania and Ukraine, which it marketed as naturist movies and claimed were legal in Canada and the United States. The head of the Toronto police sex . crimes unit told the Toronto Star that the X-rated images displayed . 'horrific acts of sexual abuse — some of the worst (officers) have . seen.' Police said they executed a search warrant at Way's company and home, seizing about 1,000 pieces of evidence: computers, servers, DVD burners, a video editing suite and hundreds of movies. Way was charged with 24 offences, including child pornography. Police also designated Azov Films as a criminal organization, charging Way with giving directions on behalf of a gang. The Azovfilms.com website has been shut down. Beaven-Desjardins said this is the first time in Canada that anyone as been charged with being a part of a criminal organization in regards to child pornography. Police said they began their investigation in 2010 and worked with Interpol in more than 50 countries including Australia, Spain, Mexico, Norway and Greece. More than 350,000 images and over 9,000 videos  - about 45 terabytes - of child sexual abuse were found during the probe, and arrests are continuing, Beaven-Desjardins said. Online filth: Police allege Brian Way, 42, instructed people around the world to create the videos of children ranging from 5 to 12 years of age, then distributed the videos via his company, Azov Films . ‘This operation shows that international police cooperation works. Despite large amounts of material and that this is time-consuming work, this shows that the Internet is not a safe haven for crimes against children,’ Norwegian police spokesman Bjoern-Erik Ludvigsen said in a statement. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service said it began its investigation by accessing the company website and making undercover purchases. People making the images included a youth baseball coach in Washington state who made more than 500 films and a school employee in Georgia who put a camera in a student washroom to videotape images of students' genitals, U.S. Postal Inspection Service inspector Gerald O'Farrell said. Beaven-Desjardins said the investigation is ongoing and believes more arrests will be made.","Three-year Project Spade operation spearheaded by Canadian authorities .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Running the country is like being stuck in an ‘asteroid shower’, David Cameron has complained. The Prime Minister revealed his struggle to cope with the bombardment of questions on foreign affairs. And while trying to deal with global problems he also has to contend with his gaffe-prone ministers going off message. Pressure: David Cameron told students of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta about the challenges of being Prime Minister . Mr Cameron has already used his trip to India to air his grievances with life at the top, grumbling about having to make compromises with the Lib Dems and not getting a Tory majority. But speaking to students in Calcutta he revealed how the blizzard of issues which are thrown at him can leave him struggling to cope. He said: ‘It’s like sometimes being in a sort of asteroid shower, things flying at you every day. ‘You know, “Should you go to Sri Lanka?”, “What are you going to do about the famine in the Philippines?”, “Why has this minister done that?’ All these things are coming at you”.’ Mr Cameron said he coped by having a firm idea of what he is trying to achieve while in government or he will lose his way. ‘You’ve got to have a plan,’ he said. Earlier the Prime Minister admitted that the coalition government has made decisions that are not in the national interest. He said the Liberal Democrats have forced him into adopting policies that could damage Britain 'in the long term'. Shower: Cameron said he had to deal with a flurry of questions about international crises and gaffe-prone ministers . But Deputy PM Nick Clegg hit back, insisting blocking some Tory policies was the 'right' thing to do. With 18 months to go until the general election, both parties have begun striking out to provide greater ‘differentiation’ from their coalition partners. The Conservatives have placed greater emphasis on crime, immigration and Europe while the Lib Dems have focussed on the environment and blocking visa curbs. Speaking in Delhi, Mr Cameron told an audience of politicians and businessmen: 'I would prefer not to have a Coalition. 'We’ve shown it can work. And actually the good parts of Coalition are because you have these arguments within government and you have to proceed on a rational basis – that’s good. 'I think what’s bad about it is that sometimes you have to make compromises that are not necessarily in the long-term interests of the country.' Tour: Mr Cameron also tried some Indian snacks from a street food stall during his visit .

"The 'Ice Bucket Challenge' has gone political with Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young tipping the bucket on herself today in Canberra. The mercury was sitting at barely four degrees which she joined the In doing so, she also uttered words which would resonate with many Australia voters, saying 'I think every good politician needs a good shower'. The Ice Bucket Challenge was established to raise awareness of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) and has spread globally. Scroll down for video . Here we go. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young tells of her plan (left) to accept the Ice Bucket Challenge and then douses herself on a chilly Canberra morning .

Sarah Hanson-Young issued the icy challenge to her Greens leader Christine Milne, who opted to make a donation instead to Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research instead. Now it's up to Clive Palmer and Scott Morrison . Spreading the word and issuing the challenge, Sarah Hanson-Young has her sights set on some of Australia's biggest political names. Christine Milne is out, opting to make a donation, now it's over to Clive Palmer and Scott Morrison . Australia's sporting and entertainment stars have been caught up with the craze for a cause but it remains to be seen who's next in line in the political world. Senator Hanson-Young, who was singled out by Education Minister Christopher Pyne, has challenged her own party leader Christine Milne, Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer and Immigration Minister Scott Morrison. The Greens leader, however, chose to make a donation to MND research instead, telling reporters she would 'spare everyone the sight' of her being drenched. Will Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who's not averse to water sports, be down for a dunking or will Opposition Leader Bill Shorten get in first? The Senator went on Twitter to announce her support for MND research and to call out fellow politicians . The rules for the challenge vary but in principle, the idea is to fill a bucker with cold water and ice, then tip it over your head or have it tipped on you and then issue a challenge for up to three other people to do the same withn 48 hours. If they can't, then they must make a donation to charity. Most of those who take the tip, end up donating as well.

"It's long been thought our moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago - but the time of formation has been fiercely debated. Some scientists believe it occurred approximately 30 million years after the formation of the solar system, while others claim it happened up to 100 million years later. Using measurements from the interior of Earth coupled with computer simulations, an international team of planetary scientists claim it was the latter - and have discovered what it is calling a ‘geological clock.’ Using measurements from the interior of Earth, coupled with  computer simulations, an international team of planetary scientists earlier this year claimed the moon, pictured, formed 95 million years after the formation of the solar system, 4.6 billion years ago - plus or minus 32 to 39 million years . Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 Gya. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. The researchers from France, Germany and the U.S carried out 259 computer simulations of the growth of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. During this analysis, the scientists discovered a link between when the Earth was hit, and the amount of material added to Earth after the impact. This relationship works much like a clock to date the moon-forming event and is said to be the first ‘geologic clock’ in early solar system history that does not rely on measurements and interpretations of the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei to determine age. ‘We were excited to find a 'clock' for the formation time of the Moon that didn't rely on radiometric dating methods,’ said lead author Seth Jacobson of the Observatory de la Cote d'Azur in Nice, France. ‘This correlation just jumped out of the simulations and held in each set of old simulations we looked at.’ The amount of mass that was released by Earth after the moon was formed was taken from previous studies. The solar system is thought to have formed 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of part of a molecular cloud. The majority of the collapsing mass formed in in the centre, which became the Sun, while the rest flattened into a disk, artist's impression pictured, out of which the planets and moons formed .

These reports previously demonstrated that the abundance in the Earth's mantle of highly siderophile elements - atomic elements that are chemically associated with iron - is directly proportional to the mass released after Earth’s impact. From these geochemical measurements, the newly established clock dates the moon to approximately 95 million years after the beginning of the solar system - with an uncertainty of between 32 and 39 million years. The solar system is believed to have formed around 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of part of a molecular cloud. The majority of the collapsing mass formed in the centre, which became the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk, out of which the planets and moons formed. ‘This result is exciting because in the same simulations that can successfully form Mars in only 2 to 5 million years, we can also form the moon at 100 million years,’ added author Dr. Kevin Walsh from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) Space Science and Engineering Division. ‘These vastly different timescales have been very hard to capture in simulations.’ The findings are reported in the journal Nature.","After the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago, Earth was said to have been hit by a Mars-sized planet .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A 'heartbroken and humiliated' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie apologized Thursday for his staff's 'callous' conduct leading to the 'Bridgegate' controversy that will either dampen his hopes at a run for the White House or strengthen his image as a no-nonsense executive who places a premium on accountability. Christie revealed at a two-hour press conference that he has fired Bridget Kelly, the deputy chief of staff who conspired to block vehicle lanes to the George Washington Bridge, snarling traffic and delivering a political blow to a New Jersey mayor who refused to back the governor's re-election bid. 'I terminated her employment because she lied to me,' he said. 'I am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE DOCUMENTS . Garden State circus: Chris Christie fended off questions about his management on Thursday, taking responsibility for the bridgegate episode but blaming specific staffers who have now been fired . Christie, a possible Republican White House contender, took responsibility for the bridge scandal on Thursday, while announcing that he had fired a top aide . Grim: Christie's staff listen sullenly to his press conference hours after he fired a trusted co-worker . Christie also dismissed Bill Stepien, . his former campaign manager who just days ago seemed destined lead the . state's Republican Party, saying that exercising leadership sometimes . requires politicians to fire their friends. Stepien has also lost a . lucrative consulting deal with the Republican Governors Association, . which Christie leads. Christie, . who appeared confident and traded barbs with reporters, could see his presidential hopes disappear if it is proved he knew . about the affair. He insisted that he first learned Wednesday about a raft . of emails that exposed his staff's conspiracy. 'I was blindsided,' Christie said. He also said that . he never considered resigning over the issue. 'Oh my god. I didn't do . anything wrong. That's a crazy question,' a bullish – but not bullying – Christie told reporters. Just . as Christie finished his lengthy performance, an official implicated in . the scandal asserted his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer . questions during a state assembly committee – as a prosecutor mulled . criminal charges over the affair. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie fired his deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly (right) as the controversy grew . Happy birthday: The pair are seen together celebrating Kelly's birthday with a cake . Betrayed: Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie said, lied when she was asked whether there was any truth in rumors the bridge closures were arranged . The . assembly's transportation committee then voted to hold him in contempt, . over objections from his lawyer, since the witness defied their . subpoena for his testimony. Christie explained on Thursday that he 'was done with my workout yesterday morning at 8.45 a.m. and got a call from my . communications director ... informing me of this story that had just . broken. That was the first time I knew . about this, the first time I had seen any of the documents that were . revealed yesterday.' 'I had no knowledge or involvement in this issue, in its planning or its execution,' he said later, 'and I am stunned by the abject stupidity that was shown here, regardless of what the facts ultimately uncover.' Contempt: David Wilstein faces the cameras before taking the Fifth at a state assembly hearing into the scandal . What me? Christie emerges from a personal meeting with the Fort Lee mayor where he apologized to him . Christie . said that an hour before he publicly denied any involvement in statements to the press . in December, he gave his inner circle an opportunity to come clean. 'They all reported that there was no information other than what we already knew,' he said. Kelly's . failure to own up to her involvement, he said Thursday, 'shows a lack . of respect for the appropriate role of government.' Christie said he felt 'betrayed' by her. He said he was 'heartbroken,' 'blindsided,' and 'embarrassed and humiliated' as the story broke on Wednesday. He . added that he was 'ultimately responsible' for what had happened, but . said the true measure of leadership is fixing something when it has gone . wrong and that is what he intended to do. Nothing on me: Christie departs his press conference after insisting he knew nothing and telling a reporter who asked him if he had considered resigning: 'That's a crazy question' 'Sad': Christie said he was disappointed in his staff's actions, but claimed it was a measure of leadership to act ruthlessly when you discover something had gone wrong . GOP leaders at the national level . watched the drama unfold with an eye toward the 2016 race, with the . governor's supporters keenly aware that his performance throughout the scandal will determine whether he is considered presidential material. New . Jersey lawmakers believe Christie's political appointees may face . criminal charges in connection with a political revenge stunt that . snarled traffic on one of the nation's busiest bridges in September. And Fort Lee, N.J. Mayor Mark Sokolich, whose municipality was targeted after he refused to endorse Christie's re-election effort, slammed Wildstein, directly for joking about his Croatian ethnicity in instant messages while he helped plot the traffic mess with Kelly. 'David Wildstein deserves an ass-kicking,' he said on MSNBC. 'Sorry, there, I said it.' On CNN, he called the actions of Christie's team a 'venomous form of political retaliation.' The comments came as State Senator Ray Lesniak told the Newark Star-Ledger that 'there’s gotta be dozens of state and federal criminal law violations' connected with the scandal. Lesniak has called on U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman to convene a federal grand jury. 'This is the use of governmental authority for political retribution in a manner that jeopardized lives,' the Democratic lawmaker said. The New York Times reported Thursday that Fishman had opened an 'inquiry.' Fort Lee, New Jersey, Mayor Mark Sokolich said former Christie aide David Wildstein 'needs and ass-kicking' The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election . The liberal blog Talking Points Memo asked New Jersey State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg if she thought criminal charges were possible. She replied, 'Yes.' 'I am not a lawyer,' she said. 'I am not a prosecutor, but from where I come from, you can't use public facilities to politically punish people.' In the face of a possible criminal probe, Wildstein refused to answer questions during . a state assembly committee. 'On the advice of counsel, I . respectfully assert my right to remain silent under the United States . and New Jersey constitutions,' said David Wildstein as cameras flashed . and nearly two dozen TV cameras jockeyed for position. The committee later voted to hold him in contempt. On Wednesday a New Jersey Assembly committee released 22 pages of an estimated 3,000 it has received in connection with subpoenas related to the growing scandal. Emails and instant messages in those pages depict Christie staffers giddy at their cleverness in punishing Sokolich. Traffic lanes in Fort Lee feed into the bridge; several were blocked in September, delaying school buses on the first day of school and stranding commuters for hours. 'We had families looking for emergency services, to respond to 911 calls,' Sokolich told MSNBC on Wednesday. 'Calls that take 3 minutes were taking 11 and 12 minutes ... and on top of that we had thousands of kids late for the first day of school.' Worse yet, a 91-year-old Fort Lee woman died as the lane closures delayed emergency medical help. Bridget Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to Port Authority official David Wildstein on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . Wildstein, the former Port Authority aide who is directly implicated in the fast-developing scandal, is scheduled to testify in a noon hearing before the state assembly's transportation committee. His lawyers argued Thursday morning that he should not have to appear, claiming that a subpoena demanding his testimony wasn't properly signed. In the emails and instant messages, Wildstein, Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly and another Port Authority appointee reveled in the calculated effort to retaliate against . Sokolich . 'Time . for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the . event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive . political payback. 'Got . it,' responded Wildstein, who later resigned. Wildstein also responded 'Is it wrong that I am smiling', when he saw a message that read: 'I feel sorry for the kids'. The Christie . administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge . into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study . supervised by Wildstein. Christie is set to be inaugurated for a second term as governor on January 21. New Jersey Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg (R) said criminal charges could be coming in the Christie 'bridgegate' scandal . Texts between two Christie aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused, including a swipe at children of voters who supported Christie's gubernatorial candidate, Barbara Buono .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jason Lee, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, was initially arrested a month ago after the woman accused him of attacking her at a home he had rented in East Hampton with his wife . A Goldman Sachs banker accused of raping a 20-year-old woman during a naked pool party in the Hamptons was reportedly found by police cowering in his Range Rover. Jason Lee, who is managing director of the firm's equity capital markets group but has been placed on leave since his arrest, was charged on Wednesday with first-degree rape. On Sunday, it emerged Lee's own friend, Rene Duncan, called the police, believing one of the alleged victim's friends had stolen a car from Lee's rental home. But when police arrived, the young woman's brother drew a female officer aside and led her into the house where his sobbing sister reported she had been raped, according to The East Hampton Star. A source told the newspaper Lee then went to the driveway of the $33,000-a-month summer home he was renting, got into his late model Range Rover, which was dark with tinted windows, and hid. But officers soon found him cowering inside, the source said. The Star reported Lee and Duncan met the alleged victim, a foreign student, and her friends at Georgica restaurant and lounge in Wainscott on Monday night, where the two men were celebrating Lee's 37th birthday. They asked the group back to Lee's rental home, where the banker is accused of going into the house with the young woman, holding her down by the forearms and raping her. One of the other foreign students . borrowed Duncan's car to drive home another friend and did not return, . prompting Duncan to call the cops. However, the car was found the next . day.

The grand jury indictment was . fast-tracked because the woman, a student who was working on the East . End for the summer, had been due to return to her home country. She . hasn't been identified and her native country hasn't been released. Lee, an Ivy Leaguer who had started at the Manhattan investment bank in 1998, has pleaded not guilty. On . Saturday, his attorney, Edward Burke Jr. of Sag Harbor, said: 'There's . not a scratch, there's not a mark, there is not a bruise on my client. There is not a blemish on his background, on his record.' If convicted, Lee will serve between five and 25 years in state prison.

"By . Joe Bernstein . Italy’s World Cup preparations suffered a major embarrassment on Wednesday when police were forced to disperse supporters after racial abuse was aimed at the team’s star striker Mario Balotelli. Balotelli was shocked to hear at least one fan shout out ‘F***ing N****’ as he took part in a sprinting exercise with his team-mates at the Coverciano complex near Florence. The 23-year-old Balotelli, who was less than 50 metres away when the insults were hurled, immediately complained to nearby team-mates, and police were called to break up a group of around 20 fans including schoolchildren who had gathered in a street overlooking Coverciano to watch training. Disgusting: Mario Balotelli suffered racial abuse from his own supporters during Italy's World Cup training camp . Afterwards, team-mate Ciro Immobile said: ‘In 2014, we shouldn’t need to be talking about racism again. ‘We didn’t speak to Mario about it afterwards because I think he agrees with me, we do not want to give any importance to these people. ‘At the moment, there is a problem with chants about black people. Fortunately, Mario was very calm. We had a meeting when we met up about behaviour and not reacting, and he acted the right way. ‘We know it is a very bad thing but we don’t want to give publicity for the people who do it.’Yesterday, Balotelli limited himself to telling team-mate Claudio Marchisio ‘I only ever get this in Rome or Florence.’ Italy has a long-standing problem with racism and Balotelli was abused by Roma fans during a game for AC Milan in 2013. He made a ‘shh’ gesture with his lips after he and team-mate Kevin Prince-Boateng were greeted by monkey noises and Balotelli said afterwards he would walk off the pitch if he encountered it again. Immobile, who could partner Balotelli up front when they play England in their first match of the World Cup in Manaus on June 14, added: ‘I’m not ashamed to be Italian because of this but I am sad when these things happen. We should try to use our role to improve behaviour, so people don’t do it.’ Not happy: Balotelli told team-mates he only receives this kind of abuse when in Florence or Rome . The incident took place less than an hour into the second day of manager Cesare Prandelli’s World Cup bootcamp, at around 10.45am local time. The manager himself was not close to Balotelli at the time and said he did not hear any racial slur, though he said he did hear other messages of encouragement for his striker. It’s been a bumpy start all round for the Italians preparations. On Tuesday, goalkeeper and captain Gianluigi Buffon – one of four survivors from their 2006 World Cup squad – announced he was separating from his wife Alena, forcing Prandelli to say the split would not affect his preparations for Brazil. Balotelli is also in the middle of a legal battle to see more of his 18-month-old daughter Pia. The striker is well-known to English fans having won the Premier League and FA Cup with Manchester City. Looking ahead: The former Manchester City striker is likely to hold the key for the Italians this summer . He returned to sign for Milan at the beginning of last year and though his form last season was patchy, he is a certainty to make Prandelli’s final cut of 23 because of his performances at Euro 2012. But the Italian manager has other decisions to make whittling down his provisional squad of 23.He currently has seven strikers in his party and when asked if he would go to the World Cup, Immobile – Serie A’s top scorer last season with 22 goals for Torino – quipped: ‘The only certainties are life and death.’ Prandelli will snub the chance to watch England play Peru at Wembley on Friday, May 30. He will be in London for Italy’s game the following night against the Republic of Ireland, but will spend the evening with his players at Craven Cottage, the venue for that match.","Ex-Manchester City striker was abused when training with Italy .

Flow: Father Penn Holderness raps the lyrics, while wife Kim Dean Holderness, along with their children Penn Charles and Lola, dance along . The song is set to the music from Sir Mix-a-Lot's song, which served as an ode to women with large rear ends. The song was recently sampled by Nicki Minaj for her new single 'Anaconda.' At the family's website, theholdernessfamily.com, Penn wrote in a post 'If there was one of those facebook relationship status options for my children, at this point in August, I would choose “needs to see other people.” On both sides — we literally need to see other people. 'It’s been an amazing summer but for our children and ourselves — we are ready for the routine the school year brings.' The father's post later maintained the feeling is mutual. 'Our kids had a full summer of camps, play dates, fun babysitters, and a few work trips with mom and dad,' he wrote. 'We’ve spent A LOT of time with them — and we’ve treasured every (almost every) minute. 'Just as much as WE are ready to walk them to the classroom door -THEY are ready to go.'

"By . Sophie Borland . Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, is being investigated over claims its operating theatres are not safe . One of the country's top hospitals is putting thousands of children at risk by forcing inexperienced nurses to work out of their depth. A damning internal review into Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust has warned that the operating theatres at the hospital are unsafe. Junior nurses and technical staff are being made to carry out complex tasks beyond their capabilities and failing to report mistakes or near-misses, according to the review at the Liverpool hospital. Alder Hey, which treats 270,000 . children a year, is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission . after whistleblowers warned that theatres were unsafe. But . a separate report carried out by the hospital's own director of nursing . – and seen by Channel 4 News – warns that staff are frequently being . asked to carry out tasks which put patients at risk. Last . year the Daily Mail revealed the concerns of a surgeon who formerly . worked at the hospital who warned that two babies had died needlessly . due to mistakes by overworked staff. Edwin . Jesudason, one of the country's leading paediatric surgeons, said . bullying and swearing were rife in the operating theatres with staff so . stressed they fainted. And in the 1990s the hospital was at the centre . of an organ scandal after it emerged that staff had removed the body . parts of 850 dead children without their parents' consent. The . internal report written by Gill Gore, Alder Hey's director of nursing, . warns that surgeons, nurses and other staff are taking shortcuts to get . through operations as quickly as possible which are putting patients at . risk. Staff are also failing to report errors or near-misses which means . they are not learning from mistakes – and they may happen again. The document adds: 'Staff have adopted some high risk practices in order to avoid cancellations; whilst safe outcomes have been maintained, the level of risk is such that urgent action needs to be implemented to avoid an adverse outcome or serious incident.' Under the heading 'safety concerns', the report states that 'the high pressure, time constrained environment sustained and increasing, over a significant period of time, has resulted in work-rounds to speed up activity and avoid cancellations'. Second arrest: A woman was also arrested on suspicion of murder . It adds this has led to 'shortcuts being made to safety processes that have created high risk activity' and 'limited reporting of incidents'. The report also states that there is 'belief that the senior management and the board are aware of the working conditions and condone it'. It adds that 'the working environment is hostile and there are numerous examples of staff feeling pressurised to undertake activities that they do not believe are safe. 'The perception of mistrust of management and the board is such that there is a widespread feeling of hopelessness that change will ever be achieved.' Last March Mr Jesudason warned that at least two young children had died at Alder Hey due to unsafe practices by staff. In an interview with the Mail he revealed how one baby had died in 2007 after undergoing surgery that other staff had warned was too risky. Another baby died suffering an injury at the hands of a 'stressed' surgeon, while other children were victim to accidents which were never reported. Mr Jesudason, 46, says he was later forced to leave the hospital after raising concerns. The associate professor, who now carries out research in Melbourne, says he has since been unable to find a job in the NHS as he is deemed a troublemaker. He said: 'To me, it was simply a question of doing what was right: children were at risk in a department that wasn't analysing errors while surgeons were suffering from burnout. It took a great deal for me to become a whistleblower. The whole experience has been utterly traumatising.' Mr Jesudason joined Alder Hey in 1998 but left in 2010 in what was meant to be a year's sabbatical. Three years later he has still not gone back to work at the trust. The CQC carried out an unannounced inspection of the hospital in December after being contacted by whistleblowers who work in the operating theatres. It is compiling a   report of its findings which will be published over the next few weeks. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We acknowledge that there have been difficulties within the theatre team at Alder Hey for some time. 'Over the past year we have undertaken a range of measures to address these and make changes within the department. We recognise that changes to the culture of the department may take time and therefore we have made a long-term commitment to supporting the team.'","Damning review tears into Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A mother is demanding answers after her son was rushed to hospital for drinking a Dairy Queen vanilla milkshake that had been contaminated with a chemical cleaning product. Lisa Chase and her son Riley both suffered a burning sensation in their mouths after drinking the shake, which they bought from a drive-thru at a Dairy Queen in Thornton, Colorado on Thursday. After taking a sip, seven-year-old Riley told his mother it didn't taste right. 'Something was bubbling on my tongue,' he told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Fears: Lisa Chase and her son Riley both sipped the Dairy Queen milkshake that had been contaminated by a chemical cleaning product and experienced a burning sensation. Riley was treated at hospital . When Chase tasted the boy's drink herself, she immediately felt it too. 'It was just like you were drinking a very strong cleanser,' she said. 'You could feel it go all the way into your stomach - it just burned all the way down.' She immediately headed back to the store to complain, where employees were not helpful, she told 9 News. But after returning home, she called the store and a manager admitted there had been a mix-up. Concerns: Mrs Chase became emotional as she said the restaurant had to be held accountable . On the mend: Riley said he felt like something was bubbling on his tongue after sipping the vanilla milkshake . The store's owner told 9 News that the vanilla syrup bottle had been left in a sink by a staff member who had poured a chemical cleaner inside. Another employee picked up the bottle thinking it was clean and refilled it with vanilla syrup. The container showed traces of a floor cleaner and de-greaser concentrate. This contains sodium hydroxide that can cause burns, vomiting and shock when ingested, MyFox8 reported. Both of the workers have been written up and the store owner has contacted poison control and  the health department. A regional manager also contacted Chase on Friday to update her. The franchise owner is now urging other customers to come forward if they believe they consumed a contaminated vanilla milkshake. Scene: It emerged that an employee at the Colorado DQ had put cleaning product in the container and left it in the sink - before another worker, who thought it was clean, picked it up and put more vanilla flavor inside . At least two other customers ordered vanilla milkshakes and had to be treated at hospital, ABC News reported. Chase said Riley was feeling better after his hospital visit - but worries that it could have been much worse. 'They need to be held accountable for what they’re doing,' she said through tears. 'It could have cost people their lives.' The incident comes just two weeks after a grandmother was rushed to hospital in critical condition when she consumed lye that had accidentally been put in her ice tea at a BBQ restaurant. Victim: The incident came two weeks after Jan Harding, pictured with her husband Jim, suffered burns after drinking sweet tea that had accidentally been mixed with lye at a BBQ restaurant in Utah . On August 10, 67-year-old Jan Harding drank a single sip of the tea at Dickey's Barbecue in South Jordan, Utah and immediately said she thought she'd drunk acid. Authorities have said a restaurant employee unintentionally put the heavy-duty cleaner lye in a sugar bag, and another worker mistakenly mixed it into the iced tea dispenser. Lye, which looks like sugar, is an odorless chemical used for degreasing deep fryers. Harding's attorney initially said she had suffered deep burns to her mouth and esophagus. She was released from the hospital on Saturday after making a 'miraculous' recovery, the lawyer said.

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . Australian free-to-air television viewers could soon be subject to an extra seven minutes of advertising every hour under proposals from some of the biggest television networks. Networks can only show a maximum of 13 minutes of 'non-program matter' between 6pm and midnight, according to the code of practice set out by Free TV Australia. These rules are relaxed under certain conditions such as during elections, with promotions for the program itself also not falling under the category of 'non-program matter'. Leading national free-to-air television networks Seven and Nine are arguing for advertisement regulations to be relaxed to allow a maximum of 20 minutes of adds within each hour of programming . However Network Seven along with the Nine Network are now calling for the limit to be increased to 20 minutes of advertisements within every hour. 'The proposal being discussed at FreeTV is to make advertising time limits for the main channel consistent with what is already the case on multi-channels. These don't seem to have caused any major problems or viewer complaints for the past four years, a spokesperson for Seven told Daily Mail Australia. 'This is really just about allowing more flexibility in scheduling advertising and not running two sets of traffic systems across the various channels.  We would not envisage any significant uplift in overall advertising minutes out of the changes.' Free TV Australia recently appeared to agree on the lack of flexibility free networks faced in terms of advertising in a recent submission to the Contemporary Community Safeguards inquiry. Network ten is the only major network that has opposed the advertisement increase, however recent data released by Ebiquity found that all three stations are already exploiting their advertisement limits . 'While broadcasters recognise that there are community expectations that an appropriate balance between program matter and advertising is maintained, the existing requirements are overly complicated,' the submission stated. The submission also clarified that advertising was essential for free-to-air television, to ensure the service remains a free and competitive service. Network Ten is the only major network that has opposed the advertisement increase, with a spokesperson telling Daily Mail Australia: 'Such a move would disenfranchise the audience and damage the viewing experience'. However data released by Ebiquity to Mumbrella earlier this year, found that all three stations are already exploiting their advertisement regulations by running up to 29 minutes of ads during their prime time airing. The biggest culprits were revealed to be programs such as The Voice, House Rules and Masterchef. Chanel Seven currently receives more than 40 per cent of all advertising revenue nationally, while the Nine Network receives just over 38 per cent. Channel 10's ratings have fallen below the two leading stations, with its advertising revenue making up the final 20 per cent. Daily Mail Australia have approached the Seven, Nine and Ten networks for a comment.","The code of practice only allows for 13 minutes of 'non-program matter' each hour .

When relatives did not hear from the couple over the weekend, they asked the Sheriff's Office to perform a welfare check and the three bodies were discovered inside the house on Sunday. It appears that Miller - who was described by relatives as a religious man - shot his wife and their 21-month-old son Paxton in the heads with a handgun before turning the weapon on himself.

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian camera crew have captured endearing footage of the devastating effect of the Ebola virus in one of the hardest hit areas of Sierra Leone. The team of journalists, who were the last camera crew in the area before a government lock down forced them to leave, were recording the stories of a number of Australian volunteers working alongside the infected and their families at an emergency centre near the borders of Liberia and Guinea. Since the most recent outbreak in March of this year, the Ebola virus has killed more than 1427 people in West Africa, according to the World Health Organisation. This figure continues to grow and appears to be close to dwarfing the total number of deaths recorded in outbreaks between 1976 and 2012; 1590. The Australian group of journalists documented conditions at a crisis coordination centre for Ebola in Kailahun, Sierra Leone . The disease is highly contagious, has no cure and with a fatality rate of 90 per cent, leads to an incredibly painful death. Malcolm Hugo, an Australian Psychologist, is one of the many health professionals working at a crisis coordination centre in a town called Kailahun alongside the International Red Cross, Medecins Sans Frontier and the World Health Organisation. The centre is complete with an isolation ward where patients battle to survive through the 21 day cycle of the illness, but where 6 out of 10 people die. Dr Hugo, who provides counselling services to people with Ebola, their families and even medical workers, is responsible for finding foster homes for children who have lost both their parents to the virus. He said one of his hardest roles was separating children from mothers who could be carrying Ebola. Malcolm Hugo, an Australian Psychologist providing counselling to people with Ebola, their families and  medical workers, said his most 'heartbreaking' role is separating children from mothers who could be carrying Ebola . ‘It’s always a heartbreaking moment to actually tell the parent that it’s in the best interest of the child to separate from the mother and in two cases they were actually breastfeeding, so it is very difficult to persuade them to give up their children, and then the problem arises who is going to look after the child in a safe environment,' Dr Hugo said. 'People are scared, and anybody who has been here faces a huge problem with stigma and marginalisation when they go home. 'Giving really correct timely information to the community, is really important, I guess given the kind of suddenness of the epidemic, and the catastrophic impact it’s had on small communities where whole families have been wiped out.' Dr Richard Broome, a NSW Public Health physician who was sent to the coordination centre to assess the effectiveness of the strategy, explained how local customs and emergency workers were colliding in their response to the outbreak. Ebola survivors: Since the outbreak in March, the Ebola virus has killed more than 1427 people in West Africa . 'The environments in which people are living is absolutely a critical part of the effectiveness of the spread of this outbreak,' Dr Broome said. 'There’s a lot of beliefs in black magic and those traditional beliefs, so people often explain things through witchcraft and curses. All those things come together I suppose with the disease like Ebola to result in the explosive outbreaks.’ But amongst the tragedy there are stories of remarkable survival, including a little two-and-a-half-year old girl who lost 17 members of her family to Ebola but endured and conquered the illness herself. The full story, 'EBOLA – Into the Hot Zone', will air on ABC's Foreign Correspondent on Tuesday at 8pm.","A team of journalists and a camera crew documented conditions at a crisis coordination centre in Kailahun, Sierra Leone .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . A mother-of-four who was killed in a car crash alongside two of her children, predicted her own death would occur on the very road that she lost her life. Keisha Ann Jackson, from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, had been driving along Glenview Road with her four children on Friday night when her car slid off the wet road and slammed into a tree. The 30-year-old died at the scene alongside her son Ryan Jackson-Cooke, 10, and her daughter Joan Jackson, 7, according to Queensland Police. Krystal Percival (left), the best friend of mother-of-four Keisha Ann Jackson (right) who died after her slammed into a tree on Friday, said that her friend had predicted her own death . Ryan and another child, four-year-old Matilda Jackson-Cooke, were found in the grass nearby and appeared to have been thrown from the vehicle upon impact. While Ryan did not survive his sister is currently still in a critical condition at the Royal Brisbane Hospital according to police. In the wake of the tragic incident, Ms Jackson's best friend, Krystal Percival, told the Sunday Mail that Ms Jackson had expressed grave concern about driving along the very road she died on. 'She told me ""One of these days I’m going to die on this corner"",' Ms Percival, 27, said. Since news of the accident spread, family and friends have expressed their shock over the incident. Two of Ms Jackson's children died at the scene. Her oldest son Ethan, 11, managed to escape with only minor injuries while her youngest child, Matilda, 4,died in hospital . 'I wished this has never happened to you I hope I will see you in the next life in the spirit world and your kids as well. You will always be in my heart for ever,' Amanda Lando wrote on Facebook. Ms Jackson's eldest child, 11-year-old Ethan Jackson miraculously managed to survive the crash. He only sustained minor injuries according to police, and was discharged from hospital on Saturday. The 11-year-old managed to escape the wreck after the accident and flag down a car that was passing by, Verena Hart, an aged care nurse who had been passing by at the time, told the Northern Star. Ethan was covered in blood, grass and mud when he flagged down some cars for help, according to witnesses, before he led them back to the scene were his mother (pictured) and siblings had been killed . 'He was covered in blood and grass and mud, he was all dazed and confused,' she said.Ms Hart, Ethan and a policeman that he’d managed to flag down, then went to find the wreckage together in the dark. It was then that they found seven-year-old Joan, caught in her seat belt and barely breathing at the scene that Ms Hart described as appearing 'like a bomb had gone off'. She was unable to be saved by paramedics and died at the scene. Forensic investigators are still looking into the incident, and are considering the issues of speed and seatbelts.","Keisha Ann Jackson died after her car slid off the road and slammed into a tree in Queensland .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . William Thoms was born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left . William Thoms is just like every other little boy. His mother says he 'loves to make noise'. But only two years ago, the three-year-old could barely hear a thing after being born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left. Despite the long battle ahead of him, in which he has to attend weekly speech therapy classes and audiologist appointments, his mother Penelope from Caste Hill in New South Wales, told Daily Mail Australia that her son was lucky. 'We look at his hearing impairment as fortunate because he was born with it and we can help him at a young age,' Mrs Thoms said. William is one of an estimated 3.5 million Australians who have some degree of hearing loss, according to Australian Hearing. Mrs Thoms first found out about her son's problem within the first week of Williams birth when the hospital performed a number of Statewide Infant Screening - Hearing (SWISH) tests that brought back poor results. The three-year-old was fitted with a hearing aid and a cochlear implant before his first birthday . He's now starting to sing along to his favourite songs and is communicating with others perfectly for his age . 'It was a bit of a shock,' Mrs Thoms said, due to having no family history of similar problem. 'We kept wondering ""what kind of life is he going to have?""' But before he turned one, William was fitted with a hearing aid on his left ear, and by the time he was nine-months-old he underwent surgery to receive a cochlear implant. 'With the implant and hearing aid, he can hear like a normal child. The second we had it switched on – 10 days after the operation - we could tell there was a great improvement,' Mrs Thoms said. 'He could hear all these different sounds, like planes overhead, so it was quite a fascinating process to watch,' His mother, Penelope Thoms, said of her son after he had his cochlear implant (pictured) Mrs Thoms (pictured) said the devices allow him to hear like a regular person and that her son has to have weekly speech therapy where he 'learnt how to speak from scratch' Source: NIDCD and Connect Hearing . 'Because he could already hear from his left ear through the hearing aid, we thought there would be not much of a reaction and it was a subtle reaction at first where he just had a curious look about him, but then after a week or two at home you really started to notice the difference. 'He could hear all these different sounds, like just our movements across the floorboards and planes overhead, so it was quite a fascinating process to watch him become aware of all these sounds.' But it all can get a little bit too much for a little fellow, Mrs Thoms revealed, as she described a time that William refused to wear both his hearing aid and implant attachments. 'He would break down and throw a tantrum because he didn't want to have anything on his head and that was very hard because he changed completely. He was very snappy and negative and would get upset often because he couldn't hear. 'And then we just persevered one day and kept putting it on until he got used to it. William is one of an estimated 3.5 million Australians who have some degree of hearing loss, according to Australian Hearing . 'We checked with his audiologist and it might have been something emotional he was going through because he didn’t have any ear aches and there was no sign of infection.' Now, little William is more than happy to have his full hearing and only takes off his aids when he’s tired or feeling unwell, but according to his mother, that won't last. 'It's going to come; the day when I'm getting him in trouble for something and he just turns them off and says ""But mummy,  I didn't hear!"".' The organisation is promoting Hearing Awareness Week, August 24-30, in which they hope to inspire the thousands of people with untreated hearing loss to seek help. Through Hearing Awareness Week, Australian’s can get free hearing checks with Australian Hearing .","Three-year-old William was born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Fiery temperament: Baby sitter Martha Dreher, 57, has been charged with felony first-degree arson in connection to the August 9 inferno . A 57-year-old Texas baby sitter has been accused of intentionally setting a man's Austin house on fire in retaliation for the children’s bad behavior. Fire department investigators charged Martha Carolyn Dreher with felony first-degree arson Thursday in connection to the August 9 inferno. According to investigators, Dreher typically took care of Glenn Williams' preteen daughters, but they were on vacation with their dad during the incident. On the night of the fire, officials said Ms Dreher was watching the man’s 5-year-old twin boys in their mother's house but told them she needed to stop by Williams' residence in the 7900 block of RM 2222 to 'grab popcorn.' The fire was set at around 9pm on one of the girl's beds in the 30 minutes Dreher was inside, according to investigators. A surveillance video captured Dreher driving away from the house as flames began ravaging the structure, according to court documents obtained by Austin American Statesman. Mr Williams' twins were in their nanny's car at the time and were unharmed. The homeowner’s older son, who was out having dinner when the blaze ignited, returned after midnight and discovered his sisters' rooms in shambles and the house smelling like smoke and lighter fluid. Inferno: The blaze broke out inside the bedrooms occupied by Glenn Williams' pre-teen daughters on this block of RM 2222 in Austin, Texas . Responding officers later discovered broken eggs on the floor and bed of one of the targeted rooms. ‘It was definitely a vendetta against the two girls,’ Glenn Williams told ABC News. When interviewed by police, Ms Dreher said she had informed Glenn Williams that she would no longer look after his daughters after they returned from vacation because the girls were 'out of control, lacking respect' and 'having discipline issues.' Ruse: Dreher was watching the man's twin 5-year-old boys in a different house when she put them in her car and drove to the residence on RM 2222 to 'get popcorn' The woman also told fire investigators that when she stopped off at the house for popcorn, she never saw flames, but she did notice light in one of the bedrooms. The 57-year-old Martha Dreher could face 99 years in prison if convicted of first-degree arson. She was released on bond Thursday after pleading not guilty. The family will now be forced to gut their heavily damaged 90-year-old home.","Martha Dreher, 57, charged with first-degree felony arson in connection to August 9 fire in Austin, Texas .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . and Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . Little Alliyah Broadby has spent her whole life in hospitals, but that's all about to change for the 14-month-old when she finally gets to move home next month. Her mum Kathryn Gordon, 39, and dad Mark Broadby, 43, received the news on Sunday that their daughter will be able to leave the Brisbane hospital and move to the Gold Coast Hospital nearer to their home on September 8. The move - green lighted by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman after she appealed to him for help - will allow Alliyah, who who has suffered a range of breathing, lung and heart complications since birth, to go home during the day and spend more time with her siblings - but she will have to go back to hospital each night. The ordeal will be made easier for her parents who live just a few kilometres away from the hospital. The bubbly tot has only spent one night away from a hospital and at her family's Gold Coast home on her birthday . Mrs Gordon told Daily Mail Australia that it has been a challenging 14 months of sweat and tears for her family but she wasn't going to back down until changes were made for her daughter. 'I'm not easy and one to take no for an answer so we needed to push the boundaries because when it's your own daughter - we're her only advocate,' she said. 'Sometimes you have to step on a few people's toes for whats best for Alliyah and our four kids back at our Gold Coast home.' Mrs Gordan and her husband have four children together - Kaitlyn and Kailen, who are twins age 11, Ashlynn, 13 and Darienne 15. Mr Broadby also has a daughter name Dimity, 22, who lives in Tasmania. 'We have fought hard for the transition because we have a big family and it was not possible for us to just pick up our bags and move to Brisbane. 'My husband and I have had sleepless nights and we've tried to rotate our weeks so I would stay with Alliyah one week and Mark would do the other and so on. Mrs Gordon said Christmas is looking promising but will have their fingers and toes crossed that she will be at home permanently by the end of September . The bubbly tot has only spent one night away from a hospital and at her family's Gold Coast home on her birthday, when a nurse had to stay with her overnight. But next month, Alliyah will be able to have her treatments at the Gold Coast University Hospital. 'Alliyah will get to come home during the day and spend more quality time with her brothers and sisters but we will have to take her back to the hospital every night. 'It's still not ideal but at this stage, it is a lot better to finally have her in our home but we are hoping for the hopsital to find a night time carer so she gets to be home permanently. 'Christmas is looking promising but we have our fingers and toes crossed that she will be at home permanently by the end of September. 'We still don't have a clear reason as to why she has the condition but I like to call it the 'cute syndrome' - because she's too cute to be sick. She is a smart little cookie and the support we've had from everyone has been exceptional.' Next month: Alliyah will get to go home during the day and spend more quality time with her brothers and sisters but will be taken back to hospital every night . Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said since Alliyah was born at Tweed Heads in July last year, her complex needs have taken her to intensive care units at the Royal Women’s, Royal Children’s and Mater Children’s Hospitals. 'She has had strong support every day from her family, but for her mum, dad and brothers and sisters, it has been a tough time.' Mr Springborg said Alliyah’s health and continued development was the number one priority for all involved in the case and he thanked her medical team and carers for their determined and professional support. Alliyah Broadby, who has spent her entire life sleeping in a hospital bed, will finally be allowed to go home each day . 'Now we have agreement on the next phase of Alliyah’s care, which will begin with a move to the Gold Coast University Hospital about the middle of next month,' he said. 'Alliyah was born with a respiratory condition that is capably managed by clinicians here at the Mater. It’s a specialised area of care not previously available on the Gold Coast, which will be provided under the plan.' Her parents couldn't be happier with the news and on their tribute page to their little girl tittled  Alliyah's Journey, her parents wrote on Thursday: 'FINALLY!!! GREAT NEWS!!! We are getting out of the Mater and back to the Gold Coast. 'We hope that our stay at the Gold Coast Hospital will be short lived and we get home permanently sooner rather than later. Good news is, we will get to take Alliyah home EVERYDAY!!' Mrs Gordon describes her daughter's condition - the cute syndrome because she's too cute to be sick . Mrs Broadby told AAP: 'When people look at her, they just see her as being a little girl apart from the trach in her neck'. Alliyah has had a tracheostomy, a surgical hole made in her neck, so she can be attached to a respirator when she sleeps because her breathing stops. The Broadbys have had to take shifts staying with Alliyah at the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane, while the other looks after the couple's other four children on the Gold Coast. The 14-month-old has suffered from a range of breathing, lung and heart complications since birth . Alliyah is being transferred to the Gold Coast University Hospital which much closer to her home than the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane where she has been receiving her treatment . 'We're her lifeline,' Mrs Broadby told reporters. 'No nurse can put the time and effort that we have into her.' Mrs Broadby said her daughter's cheeky personality, which is coupled with a disarming smile, often belies the full extent of her medical troubles. 'Sometimes people go ""it doesn't look like there's much wrong with her"". But she is a complex-needs child and she does require constant supervision.' Alliyah has had a tracheostomy, a surgical hole made in her neck, so she can be attached to a respirator when she sleeps because her breathing stops . Mrs Broadby wrote to Premier Campbell Newman earlier this year about her daughter's condition, which prompted a transfer plan to the Gold Coast University Hospital. Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said the transfer would come about in stages but would likely be underway in September. 'The important thing about returning Alliyah home is that she will be able to be monitored at the Gold Coast University Hospital,' he said. 'I am proud of the work our Gold Coast and Mater medical teams have done to help Alliyah and her family,' he said. 'Alliyah will move to the Gold Coast Children’s Critical Care Unit as part of a staged care plan, which is only possible because of new services now in place at Gold Coast University Hospital. 'The transfer requires training and thorough careful planning, but we are all confident that Alliyah will move in September. Alliyah will move to the Gold Coast Children's Critical Care Unit as part of a staged care plan . Gold Coast Health Board Chair Ian Langdon said that making sure the health needs of his own community were being met was a priority for his Board. 'The Children’s Critical Care service is just one of many new services including neonatal intensive care, cardiac surgery, and radiation therapy now available on the Gold Coast,' he said.'There are not only new facilities at the Gold Coast but also the clinical expertise and experience required to provide clinical care for children with complex cases.'This has only been possible through strong partnerships with fellow providers such as the Mater Children’s Hospital.'Mr Langdon said future plans for Alliyah would be determined by the clinicians who cared for her, working in partnership with the family to achieve the best outcomes for Alliyah.","Alliyah Broadby has suffered from a range of breathing, lung and heart complications since birth .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Fire starter: Sadie Renee Johnson, 23, pleaded guilty last May to starting the fire . A woman who pleaded guilty to tossing a lit firework out of a car and starting a massive wildfire –to help her firefighter mates out who were ‘bored’ has been fined $7million. Sadie Renee Johnson, 23, pleaded guilty last year for the crime of setting brush and timber on fire on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in north central Oregon. The wildfire that she started blackened over 51,000 acres and forced widespread evacuations. According to the Bureau . of Indian Affairs, the approximate cost to fight and contain the wildfire was $7,901,973 -- which she has been ordered to pay back in full. During . questioning, Ms Johnson told police that she started the fire because her . firefighter friends were bored and needed work but she didn’t mean for . it to be 30,000 acres. But two days after the fire began, Ms Johnson took to social media site Facebook and posted an entry stating: ‘like my fire?’ She told authorities she thought it would be a two-day fire and be put out. The . U.S. Department of Justice said it released details about the case to . deter others from attempting similar types of reckless behaviour. According to police, Ms Johnson started the fire at 9.20am on July 20th last year. Reckless: Two days after the fire began, Ms Johnson took to social media site Facebook and posted an entry stating: 'like my fire?' Fire: The wildfire that she started eventually blackened over 51,000 acres and forced widespread evacuations . Ablaze: The Sunnyside Turnoff Fire -- grew quickly, ultimately burning about 51,480 acres of brush on the reservation, officials said . She was riding as a passenger in a car on Route 3 near Sunnyside Drive, in Oregon, when she used a lighter to light a small firework. She then tossed it out of the passenger window into the brush along the side of the road. The firework lit a brush beside the road on fire, which quickly spread northwest. The fire was reported about 15 minutes later. The first responders to the scene identified the point of origin at milepost 5 on the north side of the road, within a 1- to 1.5-acre area. Within minutes, the fire -- later named the Sunnyside Turnoff Fire -- had grown quickly, ultimately burning about 51,480 acres of brush on the reservation, officials said. Warning: The fire sparked mass evacuations of dozens of homes . Luckily, the fire, less than five miles north of Warm Springs, destroyed no structures,  but it did spark mass evacuations of dozens of homes nearby. Ms Johnson is currently being held at the Columbia County Jail. She is due for sentencing on September 3. In addition to having to pay back millions of dollars for the fire, she also faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 and three years of supervised release. Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Gabriel told NewsChannel 21 yesterday that the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Indian Affairs gave the case ‘top priority.’ The crime was investigated by both the BIA Special Wildland Arson Investigation Team and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Police Department. Meanwhile, Aassistant U.S. Attorney Pamala Holsinger is handling prosecution of the case.","Sadie Renee Johnson, 23, pleaded guilty .

"By . James Nye . and Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Deepest sympathy: Iraqi President Fuad Masum sent a letter of condolences to the Foley family in reaction to the beheading of their son James . Iraqi President Fuad Masum today sent a letter to the family of American journalist James Foley beheaded by ISIS fanatics, expressing his condolences. Masum has become the first Iraqi official to contact the Foleys since the gruesome video of the desert execution was released by the Islamist militants earlier this week. Masum, who assumed office a month ago, called Foley's slaying a 'bloodthirsty act' in his three-paragraph note written in Arabic. The newly elected Iraqi leader railed against the ISIS rebels, calling them 'terrorists' who do not care about the ‘dignity of humanity.’ Mr Masum added that horrific crime committed by ISIS against Foley highlighted the need to boost 'the freedom of journalists, guarding their rights to work, and securing the delivery of their news to the audience.' Iraq's president concluded his heartfelt letter to the Foley family by saying that he is feeling the ‘deep pain’ experienced by James’ relatives, colleagues, friends, and 'all those of appreciate life.' President Masum's letter, first reported on and translated by NBC News, came a day after James Foley's brother, Michael, gave an emotional interview expressing his anger that US government did not do more to help free his older sibling. Speaking from Dover, New Hampshire, with his sister, Katie, seated by his side, the 38-year-old Mr Foley said he believes the United States let his murdered brother down and said that negotiating with terrorists should be considered, despite the White House refusing to. Scroll down for video . Unthinkable: The parents of beheaded American journalist James Foley have revealed that they watched the revolting video depicting their son's execution . Savages: A masked ISIS militant holding a knife speaks next to U.S. journalist James Foley at an unknown location in this still image from an undated video posted on a social media website . Initially hesitant to discuss the controversial issues, Michael Foley said he felt the US did not do everything in its power to save his brother and said watching his fellow hostages return home after European countries paid their ransoms was hard to bear. Michael Foley also appeared ambivalent about the Obama administrations much trumpeted 'flawless' July 4 rescue mission for the captive reporter, which failed when it raided the wrong base, and of which the Foleys were not informed. Michael called on the United States to work with Europe to establish a coherent strategy for dealing with terrorists, because as it stands, terrorists know they will get no ransom for their American prisoners. 'I really really hope that in some way Jim's death pushes us to take another look at our approach, our policy to terrorist and hostage negotiations and rethink that,' said Michael. 'Because if the United States is doing it one way and Europe is doing it another way then by definition it won’t work.' The anger aimed at the White House was compounded by the desperate revelation that the Foley family have watched their son's execution video. Asked outside their home in Rochester, New Hampshire, dad John Foley said, 'We just needed to know.' Family reacts: Katie and Michael Foley spoke exclusively to Katie Couric Friday, expressing frustration that the US did not do more to save their brother . Unable to speak any more about the horrifying clip, incredibly the Foleys claimed that they will one day forgive their sons killers. ‘Not today'.....but said John, 'As a Christian, we have to.' In an interview earlier Friday morning on the Today show, James Foley's parents said that they were not going to remain silent on the issue of negotiation and said that the process was 'very uneven'. James Foley, 40, was kidnapped on Thanksgiving 2012 and on Tuesday, ISIS released a shockingly barbaric video of his beheading, which sent ripples of disgust across the world. Foley's executioner appeared to have a British accent and the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, has said he is sure the butcher is a British citizen. At the end of the revolting execution video, another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, is paraded in front of the camera and threatened with death unless the United States ceases bombing ISIS positions in northern Iraq. During their appearance on the Today show Friday morning, James Foley's father revealed that he underestimated the brutality of ISIS after receiving an email last week that gave the family hope they could negotiate with the captors for their son's life. Devastated: Diane and John Foley talk to reporters after speaking with U.S. President Barack Obama Wednesday outside their home in Rochester, N.H. Michael and Katie Foley said they hope the release of Sotloff can be secured and revealed the horrifying email sent to them on August 12 by their brother's kidnappers. 'It was chilling. It was full of so much hate,' said Katie Foley. 'I don't understand where that much hate can come from in a person. Michael also confirmed that he was sent an email by his brother's captors demanding $132million dollars, a sum he called 'ridiculous'. Besides Iraq’s newly elected president, the Foley clan were also contacted by Pope Francis, who called them Friday to express his condolences and offer his prayers. Michael said that the pontiff labeled James a martyr whose sacrifice would not be forgotten. Marveling at the leader of the Catholic Church phoning their home, Katie said that the experience was full of grace. 'It was pretty powerful, it felt like the Lord and Jim were watching down on us at the same time and kind of giving us the strength to move forward,' said Katie.","President Fuad Masum sent the letter written in Arabic to James Foley's family Saturday .

"By . Associated Press . Money and memorabilia from Johnny Cash's family and friends have helped historians restore a significant part of the Historic Dyess Colony, a government collective built to pull Depression-era families out of poverty. The country music icon's boyhood home, along with the colony's former headquarters, will open Saturday to reflect everyday life in a northeast Arkansas community built on once-sunken land. 'Restoring the Dyess Colony Administration Building, and even saving at least one of the typical colony houses, would have been a worthwhile project, even without the Johnny Cash connection,' said Ruth Hawkins, the executive director of the Heritage Sites program at Arkansas State University. Childhood home: Here, Dyess, Arkansas Mayor Larry Sims stands in front of the restored Depression era Administration Building of the Resettlement Administration's Dyess Colony, childhood home of Johnny Cash . Experiment in socialism: Money and memorabilia from Johnny Cash's family and friends have helped historians restore a significant part of the Historic Dyess Colony, a government collective built to pull Depression-era families out of poverty . 'But the project would not have gotten anywhere near the public support that it has, and it would not be a major tourism draw,' she said. Before he was the Man in Black, he was J.R. Cash, a son of Kingsland, Arkansas, farmers who successfully applied to take part in a 1930s Works Progress Administration experiment. The federal government brought in 487 families and gave them land and a mule. Making good: Johnny Cash went on to achieve massive fame as a country music bad boy. He died in 2003 at the age of 71 . 'This was a practice in socialism,' said Roscoe Phillips, who was born at Dyess 77 years ago. 'They took people who had nothing and gave us something. It wouldn't happen today.' Under selection criteria — the application ran on for eight pages — families were rewarded for their rugged independence but on arrival had to share their excess with the community. Their contributions qualified them for 'doodlum,' a paper currency not unlike scrip offered in company towns. Members of the Cash family were 'representative colonists,' Hawkins said, so it was appropriate to incorporate their former home into the preservation effort. It also helps that countless Cash fans will plunk down $10 for a tour of both buildings. 'I doubt that even our grant funders primarily interested in the New Deal aspects would have invested at the level they have without being able to focus on the Cash family,' Hawkins said. A restored five-room house northwest . of town holds items that belonged to the singer's parents — a shaving . mug in the bathroom and an upright piano atop red linoleum in the living . room.  J.R. shared a bedroom at the front of the house with three . siblings. Although there was a toilet and bathtub, the home never had . running water. Electrical service arrived in 1945. At . the museum back in town, Cash's 1950 Dyess High School yearbook, given . to his daughter Rosanne in 2000, rests in a special wing dedicated to . the singer and his family. 'It's been one of my most prized . possessions. It's yours. Merry Christmas,' Cash wrote to Rosanne on . personal stationery with Johnny Cash scratched out and Dad written in. Without . Cash's fame, it'd be a lot tougher to save places like the Dyess . Colony, one of nearly 100 proposed resettlement sites nationwide. Arkansas State used the same principle in 1999 when it restored Ernest . Hemingway's writing studio in Piggott, 50 miles north. He worked there . while married to Pauline Pfeiffer, the daughter of a prominent family. Cashing in on Cash: Johnny Cash's memorabilia is displayed in the restored Dyess Colony Administration Building . House and a mule: Ruth Hawkins, executive director of Arkansas State University's Heritage Sites Program explains a map of the Depression era Resettlement Administration's Dyess Colony . 'We would lose a place like Dyess, and we have lost many other such places of historic significance because of a lack of funds, disinterest or ignorance,' Rosanne Cash wrote in an email to The Associated Press. 'I am so happy ASU stepped in when they did. There were only around 35 cottages left and my dad's, though dilapidated, was one of those. 'My family was saved by the WPA,' she wrote. The Dyess Colony, named for a state government administrator, covered 16,000 acres reclaimed from a swamp and carved into 20- or 40-acre homesteads. The government cleared 2 acres to put up a . house, a barn, a chicken coop and outhouse, then it was up to residents . to clear the rest of the land, grow a crop and begin paying on a . mortgage. Cash's father Ray signed his contract in February 1938 — for . $2,183.60. Restored: Daylight filters through lace curtains onto an oil lamp behind a family photograph in singer Johnny Cash's childhood home . Elementary school books sit on a chest in a bedroom of a home where singer Johnny Cash spent much of his childhood . Stories about hard times here landed in some of Cash's songs and also Rosanne Cash's ""The Sunken Lands."" 'I particularly had my grandmother Carrie Cash in mind all through the restoration process, and while writing 'The Sunken Lands,' about her and this very area,' Rosanne Cash wrote. 'I wanted my children to know their lineage and that their great-grandparents worked harder to make a good life for their children and all their descendants than anyone could possibly imagine.' At its peak, the town had more than 2,500 residents. Now, its population is less than 500, said Larry Sims, the town's mayor. 'There was no reason to come back when you could go to Jonesboro and have all the convenience you needed,' he said. Former Dyess residents, after visiting for town reunions or attending informal tours during restoration, helped Arkansas State furnish the museum and Cash home. 'My dad's mother saved everything. I had the original paperwork from when they were accepted to come to Dyess,' said Russell Clifton, who now lives north of Detroit. Phillips, now in Germantown, Tennessee, shared photographs from his youth after visiting the site last month. 'Without J.R., no one would have ever known that there was such a thing as a relocation town,' he said. A legend's bathroom?

"By . Tom Gardner . Shake-up: Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson said some illegal immigrants had earned the right to U.S. citizenship . Illegal immigrants must be able to become citizens in order to keep America safe, the man charged with protecting the country has declared. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that around 11 million people who are in the country illegally have 'earned the right to be citizens'. Mr Johnson said: 'An earned path to citizenship for those currently present in this country is a matter of, in my view, homeland security to encourage people to come out from the shadows. 'It is also, frankly, in my judgment, a . matter of who we are as Americans. He used his speech to more than 270 mayors at the United States Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. to call for 'comprehensive, common sense, immigration reform'. Mr Johnson added: 'To offer the opportunity . to those who want to be citizens, who’ve earned the right to be . citizens, who are present in this country - many of whom came here as . children - to have the opportunity that we all have to try to become . American citizens.' 'Comprehensive immigration reform would also promote a more effective and efficient system for enforcing our immigration laws, and should include an earned path to citizenship for the approximately 11-and-a-half-million undocumented immigrants present in this country, something like 86% of whom have been here almost 10 years.' Mr Johnson's intervention came as House Republican's prepared to reveal their plans for a shake-up of the immigration system. Reform: New Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said border control was vital to protect America - but called for reform of immigration (Stock picture) Welcome: Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson called for a 'pathway' for 11 million illegal immigrants to gain citizenship . Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders will also call for illegal immigrants to be given the oportunity to gain legal status - but stop short of calling for them to be able to become citizens. The 2012 Presidential election results showed more than ever the changing face of the American voting demographics. Mitt Romney won the biggest share of the white vote that any Republican White House contender ever has — and he still lost. In an election battle that was defined as much as anything by race, Mitt Romney won the support of 59 per cent of whites, but just 27 per cent of Latinos, 26 per cent of Asian-Americans and 6 per cent of African-Americans. Thirty years ago, being unpopular with ethnic minorities would hardly have stopped a white establishment candidate like Romney from trouncing Barack Obama. But back then, whites accounted for almost 90 per cent of voters. Now they make up just 72 per cent of the electorate, and that figure is shrinking by the year.Tuesday’s election showed a large turnout by Hispanics, who constituted some 10 per cent of voters — more than ever before. With 71 per cent of them voting for Mr Obama — notably in a handful of crucial swing states such as Florida, Colorado and Nevada, where they turned out at the polls in unusually high numbers — Hispanic voters gave the President his winning margin. They are expected to demand tougher border security during their annual retreat in Cambridge, Maryland later this week. This apparent softening of the Republican stance would see the party attempting to reach a consensus with the Obama administration. In June, last year, the Senate passed a measure reforming immigration which included a 13-year path to citizenship. Mr Johnson, who took up the role of Department of Homeland Security chief in December, also reiterated the need for effective border policing, adding: 'Border security is inseparable from homeland security.' 'The five core missions of the . Department of Homeland Security are guarding against terrorism, securing . our borders, enforcing our nation’s immigration laws, safeguarding . cyberspace and critical infrastructure in partnership with the private . sector, and supporting emergency preparedness and response efforts at . every level,' Johnson said. 'Common . sense immigration reform is supported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, . businesses, and if the polls (are) to be believed, the majority of the . American people,' Johnson said. 'And . border security must and should be part of comprehensive immigration . reform – protecting our borders, securing our ports, promoting the . lawful flow of trade and travel through our ports to cities and other . communities,' he said. Johnson . touted the alleged improvement in border security over the last four . years and said comprehensive immigration reform also would increase that . security.","Jeh Johnson called for 'comprehensive immigration reform'

"By . Associated Press . In a first, working-age people now make up the majority in U.S. households that rely on food stamps - a switch from a few years ago, when children and the elderly were the main recipients.Some of the change is due to demographics, such as the trend toward having fewer children. But a slow economic recovery with high unemployment, stagnant wages and an increasing gulf between low-wage and high-skill jobs also plays a big role. It suggests that government spending on the $80 billion-a-year food stamp program - twice what it cost five years ago - may not subside significantly anytime soon. Working poor: Working-age people now need state food benefits more than any other group . Food stamp participation since 1980 has . grown the fastest among workers with some college training, a sign that . the safety net has stretched further to cover America's former middle . class, according to an analysis of government data for The Associated . Press by economists at the University of Kentucky. Formally called . Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, or SNAP, the program now covers one in seven . Americans. The findings coincide with the latest economic data showing workers' wages and salaries growing at the lowest rate relative to corporate profits in U.S. history. President Barack Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night is expected to focus in part on reducing income inequality, such as by raising the federal minimum wage. Safety net: Low wage workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet . Congress, meanwhile, is debating cuts to food stamps, with Republicans including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., wanting a $4 billion-a-year reduction to an anti-poverty program that they say promotes dependency and abuse. Economists say having a job may no longer be enough for self-sufficiency in today's economy. 'A low-wage job supplemented with food stamps is becoming more common for the working poor,' said Timothy Smeeding, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specializes in income inequality. 'Many of the U.S. jobs now being created are low- or minimum-wage - part-time or in areas such as retail or fast food - which means food stamp use will stay high for some time, even after unemployment improves.' The newer food stamp recipients include Maggie Barcellano, 25, of Austin, Texas. A high school graduate, she enrolled in college but didn't complete her nursing degree after she could no longer afford the tuition. Hoping to boost her credentials, she went through emergency medical technician training with the Army National Guard last year but was unable to find work as a paramedic because of the additional certification and fees required. Enrolled: Maggie Barcellano poses for a photograph with her three-year-old daughter, Zoe, at Lakeway City Park in Lakeway, Texas on Saturday . Barcellano, now the mother of a three-year-old daughter, finally took a job as a home health aide, working six days a week at $10 an hour. Struggling with the low income, she recently applied for food stamps with the help of the nonprofit Any Baby Can, to help save up for paramedic training. 'It's devastating,' Barcellano said. 'When I left for the Army I was so motivated, thinking I was creating a situation where I could give my daughter what I know she deserves. But when I came back and basically found myself in the same situation, it was like it was all for naught.' Since 2009, more than 50 per cent of U.S. households receiving food stamps have been adults ages 18 to 59, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. The food stamp program defines non-elderly adults as anyone younger than 60. As recently as 1998, the working-age . share of food stamp households was at a low of 44 per cent, before the . dot-com bust and subsequent recessions in 2001 and 2007 pushed new . enrollees into the program, according to the analysis by James Ziliak, . director of the Center for Poverty Research at the University of . Kentucky. By education, . about 28 per cent of food stamp households are headed by a person with . at least some college training, up from eight per cent in 1980. Among . those with four-year college degrees, the share rose from three percent . to seven per cent. Goals: Maggie Barcellano prepares dinner at her father's house in Austin, Texas. She enrolled in the food stamps program to help save up for paramedic training while she works as a home health aide and raises her three-year-old daughter . High-school graduates head the bulk of food stamp households at 37 per cent, up from 28 per cent. In contrast, food stamp households headed by a high-school dropout have dropped by more than half, to 28 per cent. The shifts in food stamp participation come amid broader changes to the economy such as automation, globalization and outsourcing, which have polarized the job market. Many well-paying jobs in areas such as manufacturing have disappeared, shrinking the American middle class and bumping people with higher levels of education into lower-wage work. An analysis Ziliak conducted for the AP finds that stagnant wages and income inequality play an increasing role in the growth of food stamp rolls. Taking into account changing family structure, higher unemployment and policy expansions to the food stamp program, the analysis shows that stagnant wages and income inequality explained just 3.5 per cent of the change in food stamp enrollment from 1980 to 2011. But from 2000 to 2011, wages and inequality accounted for 13 per cent of the increase. Providing for the future: Maggie Barcellano wants to find better-paid work so that she can give her daughter 'what she deserves' Several economists say food stamp rolls are likely to remain elevated for some time. Historically, there has been a lag before an improving unemployment rate leads to a substantial decline in food stamp rolls; the Congressional Budget Office has projected it could take 10 years. 'We do not expect income inequality stabilizing or declining in the absence of real wage growth or a significant reduction in unemployment and underemployment problems,' said Ishwar Khatiwada, an economist for the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University who reviewed the Labor and Commerce departments' wage data. Full- and part-time workers employed year-round saw the fastest growth in food stamp participation since 1980, making up 17 per cent and seven per cent of households, respectively. In contrast, the share of food stamp households headed by an unemployed person has remained largely unchanged, at 53 per cent. Part-year workers declined in food stamp share.","Working-age people now make up the majority of U.S. households that rely on food stamps .

"By . David Martosko . By Tuesday afternoon the White House had leaked much of President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, but one detail was as closely guarded as the nation's nuclear launch codes: Who's the designated survivor? The answer: Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, an MIT nuclear physicist, will stay behind to run the government in case the worst happens and the entire Capitol disintegrates in a hail of radioactive cannon-fire. The idea is a relic from the Cold War: If the Soviet Union were to launch a missile attack on Washington during the annual address – when the president, vice president, cabinet members, Supreme Court justices and every member of Congress gather in one chamber – someone had to live on to lead the country and mount a response. 'Designated survivor': Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz was chosen to watch Obama's speech from an undisclosed location this year, to guarantee the continuity of government if the rest of America's leading officials were attacked and killed when they gathered in a single place . When President Barack Obama delivers his annual State of the Union address, one of his cabinet members will be somewhere else, tucked away for the sake of the U.S. Constitution . U.S. officials in charge of all three branches of government will gather Tuesday night in the House of Representatives to hear Obama speak. What would happen if the unthinkable should occur while every American political target was in the same place? Line of succession: Vice President Joseph Biden would become president if Barack Obama should die in office, putting him literally 'a heartbeat away' from the Oval Office . Speaker of the House John Boehner would take over the presidency if both Obama and Biden were dead or unable to perform their duties, providing an unprecedented party switch since Boehner is a Republican . He . or she – the White House chief of staff typically chooses from among . members of the president's cabinet – is whisked away well in advance of . the speech to one of Washington's famed 'undisclosed locations,' just in . case. And the public only learns who drew the short straw a few minutes before the president arrives at the Capitol. The practice is believed to date back to the late 1950s, but the public wasn't made aware of it until the Reagan administration. Some . have gone out of town. Others escaped to D.C.'s suburbs for dinner. One . , HHS Secretary Donna Shalala, hung out in the Roosevelt Room of the . White House in 1996, at the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue from the U.S. Capitol. After the 9/11 terror attacks, however, the routine became more serious and the locations more clandestine. The U.S. Senate Historical Office keeps records of which presidential cabinet member has set out on State of the Union night. Any of them could have become president in an instant if a terrorist attack or a nuclear missile had killed the rest of the federal government's leaders.2014: Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz2013: Energy Secretary Steven Chu2012: Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack2011: Interior Secretary Ken Salazar2010: HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan2009: * Attorney General Eric Holder2008: Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne2007: Attorney General Alberto Gonzales2006: VA Secretary Jim Nicholson2005: Commerce Secretary Donald Evans2004: Commerce Secretary Donald Evans2003: Attorney General John Ashcroft and Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta2002: Interior Secretary Gale Norton2001: * VA Secretary Anthony Principi2000: Energy Secretary Bill Richardson1999: HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo1998: Commerce Secretary Bill Daley1997: Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman1996: HHS Secretary Donna Shalala1995: Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 1994: Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy1993: * Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt1992: Agriculture Secretary Ed Madigan 1991: Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan1990: VA Secretary Edward Derwinski 1989: * Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos 1988: Interior Secretary Donald Hodel     1987: Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng 1986: Agriculture Secretary John Block    1985: Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige1984: HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce . * Speeches given in the first year of a presidency are not called State of the Union addresses, but Presidential Addresses before Joint Sessions of Congress . The . practice of setting aside a designated survivor isn't confined to State . of the Union speeches. Several presidential inaugurations have featured . a designated odd-man-out to respect the Constitution in case the . federal government's leaders simultaneously go kablooey as the result of . what homeland security analysts call a 'decapitation attack' on the . U.S. Since 2003 a handful of . members of Congress have also been asked to stay away from the Capitol . during the annual presidential address, in order to keep the legislative . branch of the government alive in case of a terrorist attack. The U.S. Constitution provides for a . line of succession in case the president should die while in office. The . sitting vice president takes over immediately, as Lyndon Johnson did . after John F. Kennedy's assassination. But . if the veep should die too, the Speaker of the House becomes acting . president, and then the president pro tempore of the Senate. If . they're all dead, the Oval Office goes, in order, to the secretaries of . state, treasury and defense, and then to the attorney general, and so . on – a list 18 names long. Everyone . on the list is currently eligible to serve as president with one . exception: Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewel is a naturailzed U.S. citizen who was born in the United Kingdom, so she can't assume the . office. The Secret Service officially controls the movements of the designated 'survivor' each year. Ken Salazar, the former interior secretary who sat out the speech in 2011, told ABC News that 'there are serious preparations and serious consideration of different scenarios' when the time comes. The designated survivor is sworn to secrecy and briefed on the procedures involved with ensuring the continuity of government. 'They walked you through the White House and showed you the Situation Room and talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor,' Shalala told ABC. So someone from President Obama's leadership team – although it won't be clear who until just before 9:00 p.m. EST – will be absent when he uncorks his annual stemwinder. Or maybe two. In 2010, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan was the designated 'survivor' for President Obama's speech. But then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also out of town, attending a London conference on battling radical Islamist sects in Yemen. Because the public knew where to find Her, Clinton couldn't be the official 'survivor.' But if calamity had struck, she would have become America's first female president, since the State Department comes well before the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the order of presidential succession. But had her husband Bill and his entire administration, plus the Congress, all bitten the dust in 1996, Shalala would have beaten her to it. The odds of a president dying in office are slim enough, but the chance the his entire cabinet and the leaders in both houses of Congress kicking off at the same time are astronomical. The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics estimates, based on American history, that a U.S. president has a 1-in-27 chance of dying in office each year. Compound that across the 18 people in the line of succession, and calculate their odds of all dying on the same day, and it comes to 1 in 357 quattuordecillion. That's 357 with 47 zeros after it. Whoever is sitting the speech out Tuesday night had better not quit his or her day job: The Oval Office curtains aren't due for a change until January 2017. After Boehner, the presidency would fall to Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who serves as president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate . Grey Poupon in the White House mess: Secretary of State John Kerry is the first cabinet member in line to take over the top job if the others above him in line are all dead or incapacitated . Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew could be president, provided Barack Obama, Joe Biden, John Boehner, Patrick Leahy and John Kerry were all dead -- and Lew himself had managed to survive . If a sitting U.S. president dies while in office, the Constitution provides for an order of succession to ensure the continuity of the executive branch of government. Here are the lucky officials, in the order in which the job of president would fall to them. * Jewell is a naturalized U.S. citizen born outside the U.S., so she cannot be sworn in as president .","'Official survivors' have been tapped by White Houses since at least the late 1950s .

"By . James  Nye . For some Republican politicians the real star of Tuesday evenings State of the Union address was not the president but Willie Robertson - star of the hit A&E reality series Duck Dynasty. A whole stream of star-struck GOP house members, including one-time vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan, seemed to go out of their way to get Robertson, 41, and his wife Korie to pose for smiling selfies. Sporting his trademark Stars and Stripes bandana and untucked white shirt, Robertson was in high demand the minute he arrived in the Capitol building - despite cutting an unusual figure on such a prestigious occasion.

Even veteran Republican Senator John McCain waved up at him from the floor. Asked how it felt to be one of the big attractions of the evening, Robertson told The Daily Caller: 'It was awesome.' 'I don’t know,” he went on. “I think it’s the beard.' But it wasn't all Republicans who wanted a piece of Robertson. Democratic . Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Rep. Steve Israel approached . Robertson after the speech, telling him he 'just wanted to say hello.' The son of controversial star Phil Robertson was invited to the State of the Union by Rep. Vance McAllister from Louisiana, who won election with the reality TV family’s support. Among those who posted pictures of themselves with the star were the junior United States Senator from Louisiana David Vitter, who admitted that 'My kids are impressed I get to see one person tonight, and it's not President Obama or Speaker Boehner,' - in reference to Willie Robertson. Indiana Rep. Jackie Walorski also posted a picture of herself and Willie while North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer uploaded a picture of his wife Kris beaming alongside the Duck Dynasty star.

Willie 'Boss Hog' Robertson invitation was announced by Vance McAllister on Twitter before the State of the Union. Indeed, Representative McAllister pointedly said in a statement that he looks forward to 'bringing some diversity to our nation's Capitol', with the invitation of the younger Robertson, despite the huge controversy his father created last year. 'I'm happy to announce that my friend, constituent & small business owner @williebosshog will be attending tonight's #SOTU as my guest,' McAllister tweeted - including the younger Robertson's Twitter handle and the ""#SOTU"" hashtag, or search term, for the State of the Union address. Robertson's wife Korie, who also appears on the show, was given a guest ticket to the speech by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who tweeted a photo of himself with the couple. Graham, a Republican, is up for re-election this year. Robertson, 41, is a son of 'Duck Dynasty' patriarch Phil Robertson, who was temporarily suspended from the hit show by cable television network A&E last month for making anti-gay remarks in a magazine interview. Other quotes in the interview were criticized as racist. U.S. Representative for Alabama, Martha Roby was seemingly ecstatic to meet Willie Robertson and his wife Korie . Famous: Indiana Rep. Jackie Walorski made sure to post this picture to Twitter of herself and the Duck Dynasty star . Happy: North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer uploaded a picture of his wife Kris beaming alongside the Duck Dynasty star . Phil Robertson's suspension sparked a national debate over tolerance and religion, with several Republican politicians and conservative figures coming to his defense. The patriarch, who never apologized for his remarks, was reinstated after fans protested and big-name corporate sponsors stuck by the show. Willie Robertson is the chief executive officer of Duck Commander, a family-run business that specializes in duck-hunting gear and whose family's life is the subject of ""Duck Dynasty,"" which averages about 8 million viewers per episode. The show is in its fifth season.

A detective told the court that Dorsey had accelerated in his white pick-up truck when he saw the young woman walking across the parking lot. Dorsey had hit three cars on the interstate before driving into the parking lot, according to KATV. Surveillance showed that he entered the parking lot at the same speed he was driving on the interstate. Sgt Todd Crowson told the station: 'It's a horrific video, and you just hate to see what this young lady went through.' A Target employee called 911 on seeing the horrific hit-and-run, before following the truck to  apartments nearby. Dorsey was arrested soon afterwards.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A doctor who was struck off eight years ago for 'stalking' Abi Titmuss has blamed the episode on his drinking problem as he tries to rekindle his medical career. Shibley Rahman is trying to convince a medical panel that he is fit to be a doctor again, insisting he is no longer an alcoholic and feels 'horrible' about how he traumatised the former glamour model. Rahman's medical career was left in tatters after a disciplinary panel found his behaviour towards the TV personality amounted to 'serious psychological violence'. Struck off: Shibley Rahman's medical career ended abruptly in a 2006 hearing of the General Medical Council (left), which was told how he had 'stalked' the TV personality and glamour model Abi Titmuss (right) Ms Titmuss, a former nurse, was left 'terrified' when the drunken doctor sneaked into a communal bathroom at her hospital staff accommodation while she showered in July 2004. Rahman was struck off by the General Medical Council in 2006 and handed a restraining order the next year after admitting a public order offence at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. But on Thursday he told a fitness to practise panel of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service, held in Manchester, that he was ready to be a doctor again. All doctors who have been struck off are allowed to ask permission to be restart their careers five years later. Plea: Rahman, pictured outside the 2006 hearing, said he felt 'horrible' for the star and wished her well . Rahman told the panel he wanted to overcome the shame of being struck off, restore his reputation and make a valuable contribution to the profession. The former senior house officer at Hammersmith Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital and Royal Brompton Hospital, all in London, added he had now dealt with his alcoholism. 'I think it is horrible,' he said. 'It would never happen again. It was disgusting... My behaviour towards her was unacceptable. 'If I ever saw her again I would just walk in the opposite direction. I would not look at her. I would just run off. I would certainly not trouble her again in any way.' The former medic added: 'I really don't care about her or what she does, apart from the fact I really do feel horrible about the emotional impact on her, and I wish her well in the future.' The panel heard how Rahman began to contact Ms Titmuss after seeing her in media reports in 2004. She had left her job as a nurse after becoming a household name when she stood by then-boyfriend John Leslie, who was falsely accused of rape. But she was still living in nurses' accommodation at London's University College Hospital, where she worked from 1998 to December 2003. Rahman, who was not previously known to Ms Titmuss, sent her a letter asking to meet before bombarding her agent with up to 20 text messages a day, the panel heard. The junior doctor then began to turn up at her residence before introducing himself. In a statement, the actress and former model said: 'He came straight up to me then shook my hand. It was very difficult to get away from him. 'He acted as though I knew him and was waiting all day for me to return. I had to ask reception not to tell Dr Rahman I was in.' On one occasion in July 2004 Ms Titmuss arrived home to find Rahman, who smelt strongly of alcohol, waiting for her with a bunch of flowers. On July 17 Rahman gained access to the nurses' rooms and Ms Titmuss returned from the bathroom to find him waiting outside her door. She went into her room and Rahman started banging on the door and shouting abuse, the panel heard. When he had stopped shouting Ms Titmuss went into a shower cubicle - but Rahman followed her into the communal bathroom and shouted at her again. The 'terrified' celebrity returned to her room where Rahman continued to bang on her door until police arrived and warned him not to contact her again. In a statement, the actress and former model (pictured) said: 'He came straight up to me then shook my hand. It was very difficult to get away from him... He acted as though I knew him and was waiting all day for me' He told police he thought the media had been unfair to her and he thought he could help her because he was a doctor. The medic continued to pester Titmuss and her agent until he received a written harassment warning on July 27, 2004, the tribunal heard. Announcing the decision to strike him off in July 2006, Dr Brian Alderman told Rahman: 'The panel takes the view that your actions in relation to Ms B [Ms Titmuss], who was a stranger to you and who you put in terror, is conduct not becoming of a doctor and is likely to bring the medical profession into disrepute.' Rahman admitted 'harassing' Ms Titmuss and said he thought he could help with her charity work, but hoped it could lead to a romantic relationship. He was arrested after another incident with Ms Titmuss in April 2007 when he approached her and shouted: 'You and your media team have ruined my life.' Claims: The ex-doctor later accused Ms Titmus of wishing to 'capitalise on misery to further her own career' The hearing was also told that while pursuing his legal career three years later, he wrote to the Solicitors Regulation Authority to say: '[Ms Titmuss] wished to capitalise on misery to further her own flagging career'. All doctors have the right to apply for re-registration five years after being erased from the register, but it is rare for applications to be granted. The General Medical Council also opposes all restoration bids on principle. The hearing continues.","Shibley Rahman was struck off in 2006 for 'serious psychological violence'

"By . Luke Garratt . Even the Star of David could be banned, if used in the context of the atrocities committed in WWII . Israel has passed the first step on the road to more severe banning of the use of Nazi symbols and offensive ideology. The ban would stop the use of all Nazi symbols and expressing remorse for the fall of the Nazi regime, and would make calling someone a Nazi illegal, with a punishment of up to six months in prison and a fine of 100,000 shekels (around £20,000). In addition, the law would ban the use of the Jewish Star of David symbol when used in the context of the internment camps or in reference to the holocaust. The bill has passed its first reading, but still has two more readings before it can become a law. The first reading of the bill, submitted by MK Shimon Ohayon passed largely unopposed, receiving 44 votes for and 17 MKs voting against. The bill was approved on Sunday by the Ministerial Committee for Legislation, meaning that it stands a better chance of becoming a law because it has the backing of the coalition government. An effort to pass a similar bill happened a few years before, but was voted down because many believed the existing laws were tough enough, and worried that newer, tougher laws might affect free speech. General Attorney Yehuda Weinstien, who had reservations about the possible ban . The bill says the word 'Nazi' would be banned for anything other than 'for the purpose of learning, documentation, scientific study or historical accounts.' Also, using words that sound like 'Nazi' to indirectly refer to someone as an insult would also incur punishment. The bill reads: 'Insulting someone by expressing the wish, hope, or anticipation for the fulfillment of the Nazis’ aims, or expressing sorrow or protest that they were not accomplished is forbidden.' 'Unfortunately, the phenomenon of using Nazi symbols and epithets has grown in recent years. The intolerable ease with which the day-to-day usage of these concepts as part of public and political discourse, and with blatant disregard for the feelings of Holocaust survivors and their descendants, is reprehensible.' It received objections from Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein, saying that it might raise constitutional problems. He said: 'Not all behavior that offends the public . deserves to be made a crime. 'Is . it proper in a democratic country to ban an entire world of images from . the public discourse to protect people’s feelings?' 'Given the centrality and importance of the . constitutional right to freedom of expression, any restriction on it . must be examined meticulously and with exceptional caution.'","Calling someone a a Nazi could lead to jail sentence and £20,000 fine .

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . The University of Alabama football fan who poisoned rival team Auburn University's landmark oak trees will not be making an appearance at an upcoming charity event after organizers received death threats on social media. It appears the roots of Auburn fans' hatred of Harvey Updyke, 65, are deep and they aren't willing to let bygones be bygones, even in for a good cause. The September 29 event, planned by former Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron, his wife, former Miss Alabama Katherine Webb, and his mother Dee Dee Bonner, is to raise awareness and funds for children's cancer. Tree change: Following his release from prison for poisoning Auburn University oak trees, Harvey Updyke moved to Louisiana. His upcoming appearance in Mobile, Alabama for a charity event has been cancelled after organizers received death threats . Game changer: After they received death threats on social media, organizers former Miss Alabama Katherine Webb and her husband, former Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron decided to cancel Updyke's appearance . Updyke poisoned the beloved oak trees at Toomer's Corner on the Auburn campus after they beat Alabama in 2010. Updyke was arrested after a man calling himself 'Al from Dadeville' - Updyke's middle name is Almorn - phoned Paul Finebaum's radio show claiming he poured herbicide around the 130-year-old oaks after Auburn's win over rival Alabama during the 2010 national championship season. The caller signed off by saying, 'Roll Damn Tide.' He served six months in jail for the crime and was released last spring. Deep roots: The 130-year-old oaks poisoned by Updyke were mourned by Auburn fans . Attendees at the charity event would have had the opportunity to dunk Updyke in a tank of water or throw a pie in the face in exchange for a donation to Roses for Linda, a charity that helps families with transportation costs to visit dying loved ones. However, it became apparent that Auburn fans wanted to hit Updyke with more than just pies. Bonner told ESPN that she had received 'death threats and other ugly messages on social media.' 'It seems to be taking away from the primary purpose, which is raising awareness for children's cancer,' she said. A Twitter account called All_Auburn tweeted, 'Ol' Harvey getting death threats? What the hell did they expect. How many bricks can you put in a pie?' Updyke now lives in Louisiana and is banned from attending any college sporting event for life. He had to pay almost $800,000 to Auburn University.","Harvey Updyke, 65, poisoned 130-year-old oak trees at Auburn University after they defeated Alabama in 2010 .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . KFC has opened its kitchens to the public to reveal a behind-the-scenes look at how the company cooks its finger lickin' food. More than 160 Australian stores offered a sneak peak on Saturday, and the details of what goes in to your three-piece meal, zinger meal or plain chicken legs are likely to shock you - for the better. The fast food giant still wouldn't reveal the ingredients of its 11 secret herbs and spices but did show off how its poultry was cooked from scratch. Scroll down for video . Fresh out of the cool room?: The tour participants sample the fresh 'Coles and Woolworths' style chicken pieces . Restaurant manager Ben Sondermeyer shows the group all the breasts, legs, thighs and wings of the fresh chicken from the temperature controled cool room . Phoenix Mendy, Sven Wolpert, John Mitchell and Darren Zomar inspect the fresh produce at Mascot KFC . Inside the cool room where the fresh produce is kept . Inspecting the trays of fresh chicken which is stored in colour coded bags that separate the marinated from original recipe pieces . The comprehensive tours were an opportunity for the 2000 Australian participants to 'discover for themselves how a genuine working kitchen operates' Chief Marketing and Development Officer at KFC Australia Nikki Lawson said. Inside the Mascot store in Sydney's south, the topic on everyone's tongues was, of course, the chicken. The group of three Canadian nationals and one Australian all had the same preconceived idea that KFC chicken is 'naturally frozen.' 'Naturally, you just expect it to be frozen,' tour participant Darren Zomar said. But behind freezer door one was a temperature controlled storage unit stocked with fresh produce 'the same, exact product you would buy at any Coles or Woolworths,' store manager Ben Sondermeyer said. All chicken is dated and bagged in colour coded plastic to distinguish between the different cuts, and to also ensure that their is no cross contamination between 'marinated and original' pieces. Delivered fresh from the storage unit, each original piece of chicken is prepared in flour and seasoned before being cooked for exactly 12 minutes and 40 seconds . Marinated zinger fillets are left to sit overnight in a designated cool room before they're cooked in a similar fashion. If any piece of chicken is not eaten in 90 minutes after being cooked, it's thrown out. '90 minutes is the longest time it will sit before it is discarded,' Mr Sondermeyer said. The team inspect the preparation of the chicken and the rigorous processes involved before it is cooked . The chicken is floured in a particular fashion, before it is seasoned and put into the cooker for 12 minutes 40 seconds . The chicken is kneaded by hand in flour before it is put in the cooker . The preparation of the burgers is part of the delicate food handling processes . The participants on the tour said they expected all the chicken to be frozen, and not fresh . Mrs Lawson said the KFC Open Kitchens Day was a chance to provide 'transparency' into the operations of the business. 'We could have produced a beautiful TV ad,' she said. 'But it feels like a this is something consumers wanted and something we are prepared to give to them.' She said KFC has one of the most rigorous health and safety procedures in the world when it comes to cooking chicken, and felt people were misguided by the belief all its food was 'frozen.' 'To be perfectly honest as an industry we are genuinely proud and I think we have some unique things in KFC,' she said. Canadian national Darren Zomar felt let down he couldn't find the answer to the age-old recipe known to produce that famous KFC taste. 'Are we going to find out the 11 herbs and spices are?' he said. But Mr Sondermeyer assured him that there were only two people alive today who know what is in the tightly sealed recipe packs which are manufactured in the US and shipped offshore. Mrs Lawson added: 'They're two people in the US who work in product development.' At the completion of the each of the members were treated to their very own freshly cooked meal .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The National Zoo in Washington threw a party Saturday in honor of the first birthday of panda cub Bao Bao. To celebrate, the cub got a cake made from frozen fruit juice and other treats like pears and apples. Bao Bao is only the second panda born at the zoo to survive to her first birthday. The cub's only sibling, brother Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and returned to China in 2010. Panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle says Bao Bao has been a different baby from her brother, including a little more stand-offish with keepers. In the past year she has grown from a wriggling pink newborn a little bigger than a stick of butter to a 44-pound black-and-white bundle whose favorite activity is sleeping in a tree. Cause for celebration: Panda cub Bao Bao licks her birthday cake at the National Zoo in Washington, Saturday, Aug. 23, 2014 .

Picture perfect: The birthday party was a big event at the National Zoo in Washington on Saturday, with all visitors getting involved . A hemlock tree in the front of her yard is one favorite, and she also likes wrestling with a blue cylinder-shaped buoy filled with sand, MacCorkle said. The cub, whose name means 'precious' or 'treasure', has also started eating solid food like sweet potato and bamboo and recently got her first taste of honey. She's also learned behaviors that help keepers monitor her health including getting on a scale and standing up when asked. Lately, she's 'getting really good' and responding when her name is called, MacCorkle said, and is exploring her yard a little more. 'She's really becoming an independent bear,' MacCorkle said. The next year will bring even more changes. Bao Bao will stop drinking her mother's milk and, like wild pandas of the same age, at between a year and a half and two years old she'll start living independently in her own enclosure. Eventually keepers will also teach her to present her paw to get blood drawn and lie down in order to get an ultrasound.

"By . Danielle Gusmaroli for Daily Mail Australia . Dressed in a stripy uniform, Alice band and purple sneakers, Skyler Burns skips merrily through the  school gates eager to start her morning. Her nails are painted pink, her hair is a golden mane of shoulder-length locks, and her cheeky smile is as infectious as her effervescent nature. Yet, the cherubic six-year-old was in fact born a boy called Seth who has now begun school life as a girl, happily telling her new friends on Queensland's Gold Coast: ‘Mummy said the doctors told her I was a boy - but they got it wrong ... I've always been a girl.' Scroll down for video . Happy in her skin: Transgender girl Skyler Burns began prep school on the Gold Coast, Queensland, in February having transitioned from a boy to a girl . Cherubic: The bubby six-year-old was born a boy called Seth (L) who has started school as a girl . Skyler, who lives near Surfers' Paradise, began prep school in February and her parents Summer, 45, and Brett, 30, are understandably anxious, only too aware of the challenges that lay ahead. They have chosen to share their story with Daily Mail Australia to educate people about what transgender means - so that their daughter does not have to study in a hostile environment. With the advice of medical experts, Skyler spent most of last year transitioning at kindy, introducing pretty tops and colourful shoes to her wardrobe. From the age of two she would break down in tears and tantrums whenever she was forced to dress as a boy. New life: Skyler has started the same school as her brother Archer, seven, who is in the year above, and her parents Summer, 45, and Brett, 30, are aware of the challenges they face . The road ahead: Skyler, pictured with her older brother Archer, would break down in tears whenever her parents dressed her as a boy . All smiles: She showed 'marked gender variant behaviours' from the age of two associated with 'escalating distress and disruptive behavioural problems,' doctors found . Doctors at the Royal Childrens’ Hospital Brisbane confirm she is in essence a girl, although still genetically a boy, and this year wrote a letter to the school supporting her parents' decision to allow her to live as female. Director of the hospital’s child and youth mental health service, doctor Stephen Strathis, notes that Skyler showed ‘marked gender variant behaviours’ from the age of two and 'disruptive behavioural problems' whenever her parents forced her to dress as a male. In a letter penned to the school this year, he said: ‘I believe it would be in her best interest to live as a female at school.' Well adjusted: Skyler currently uses the girls' school toilets but changes separately from her classmates after swimming lessons to avoid unnecessary questions . In a letter to the school this year, doctor Stephen Strathis wrote: 'I believe it would be in her best interest to live as a female at school' 'How many sleep times 'til school?' Skyler loves her new life, thanks to the unwavering support of the staff . Living on the Gold Coast: The children's mother says the community has been accepting and open-minded, allowing Sklyer to be herself . The school principal and deputy have shown unwavering support to Skyler and have agreed to use her preferred name. Although unofficially unable to comment, they are keen for her to excel without facing discrimination. Summer maintains school chiefs are considering lobbying the education board to add the option of ‘preferred gender’ to its enrolment forms so that Skyler's chosen name can appear on future report cards. Support: Summer maintains school chiefs are considering lobbying the education board to add the option of 'preferred gender' to its enrolment forms . She currently uses the girls’ school toilets but changes separately from her classmates in an adjacent classroom after swimming lessons to avoid unnecessary questions. Her mother Summer, a beauty therapist, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We love her so much, she is so precious to us, we want her to be proud of who she is. ‘As a mother you blame yourself, I thought perhaps because I had her late in life I could be the cause of this.' Pretty in pink: The six-year-old never had any interest in toys his boisterous older brothers loved . She added: 'I still miss Seth and I occasionally check in with Skyler and ask he if she does, too, and she tells me each time “mummy, let's leave Sethy in the cage where she belongs.” It breaks my heart every time.’ She added: ‘This has not been an easy decision but Seth’s gender just didn’t fit. She is exactly who she intended to be. We are lucky to live on the Gold Coast in a community that is accepting and open-minded.’ Unique: Her favourite colour is (pink), her kindergarten friends were 'girls because boys play hard' and she loves dolls' houses . The insistence that Skyler was a boy began age two and became more pronounced as the years went on. As Seth he never had any interest in toys his boisterous brothers Archer and stepbrothers Chayse, 17, Dayne, 21, and Jye, 22, loved. Instead he would ask sister Nykisha, 19, to take him to the girls' section of stores, ignoring Thomas the Tank Engine and Lego sets, to play with the Barbie dolls, tiaras and dresses. Birthday girl: She celebrated her sixth birthday earlier this month with a Pocho Hontas theme party . Dad Brett Burns, a roofer, would tell the family not to encourage the ‘girlish behaviour’ as doctors initially dismissed it as a 'phase'. But their child's continuing angst was heart-breaking. Doctor Stathis asked their son a series of questions including what his favourite colour was (pink), who his kindergarten friends were ('girls because boys play hard'), what his best toys are (dolls house and a pink hippo), and if he prefers being a boy or girl ('I am a girl'). Belle of the ball: The cherubic youngster shone at her birthday party attended by her new school friends earlier this month . He diagnosed Skyler as having gender dysphoria,- when you are born into the wrong body and did not advise the family other than to say ‘let him be.’ Despite the young age, the concerned parents have made the decision to let Seth live her life as a female and she chose the name Skyler 'because she loved it.' Once they made the decision, it was like night and day. ‘The crying had stopped and now she wears dresses she's such a happy child,’ Summer said. If Skyler's desire to be a girl persists, her parents will give her the option to start on hormone treatment when she is 12-14, which will stall male puberty; her voice won't deepen, and she not develop wide hips or masculine features such as an Adam's apple. In the past: Doctors at the Royal Childrens' Hospital Brisbane say Seth, pictured age three, shows signs of being a girl . Pretty: Her cheeky smile is as infectious as her bubbly character . Tablets containing a synthetic version of the female sex-hormone oestrogen are given – a process known as cross-hormone therapy. This encourages breast tissue growth and females characteristics such as larger hips. Brett said: ‘The new school has been fantastic but for a lot of people, it's hard to swallow. ‘If these children are not allowed to be what they really are, the outcome is something I don't want to think about. ’Right now I have a little boy who needs to be a little girl and we're only just catching up with her.’ Daddy's girl: Her father Brett said: 'Right now I have a little boy who needs to be a little girl and we're only just catching up with her'","Skyler Burns, 6, was born Seth but feels more comfortable as a girl .

Peter Capaldi makes his debut in Doctor Who tonight with a trip to Victorian London but if he was ever tempted to take the Tardis back to 1913 Glasgow, he could find himself in the middle of a real-life drama involving his own grandparents. Researchers at the British Newspaper Archive have unearthed a report about the actor's grandfather Giovanni, who left his Italian village at the turn of the century and ended up in Scotland selling ice-cream. The story, headlined 'Love Tragedy at Glasgow', tells how Giovanni's heart had been 'set aflame' by his landlady's daughter Agnes Dougan and he shot himself in the chest after she rejected him.

He was taken to hospital with a bullet 'lodged underneath the heart' but survived and went on to marry Agnes weeks later. The couple had five children, including Peter's father Gerard. Amy Sell, a researcher from the British Newspaper Archive, said: 'Local newspaper archives can reveal fascinating information about where we come from. It's shocking to think that if Peter Capaldi's grandfather had not survived, we would be welcoming a different Doctor on to our screens tonight.' Capaldi's grandfather Giovanni was born in 1885 and had initially emigrated to the United States, but  instead went to England, before settling in Glasgow. Capaldi said in an earlier interview: 'I always thought it was funny that my grandparents had bought a ticket to New York and ended up in Glasgow.' His grandparents married on February 20, 1913 - only a month after the shooting. Giovanni opened an icecream business in Glasgow, using his mother Nicolina's recipe. Later his father Gerry sold ice cream from a van around the city.

"By . Paul Thompson . Professor Don A. Samuelson arrested for secretly videotaping students (mugshot pictured) A University professor has been arrested for allegedly filming up female students' skirts using a camera pen in his class. Don Samuelson, 65, also used the pen to allegedly film the cleavage of two girls at the University of Florida. When arrested on Friday, he claimed he had made the films to prove the girls were not wearing any underwear because he thought it was inappropriate. But an examination of the hard drive on the pen revealed other pornographic images. Samuleson is a tenured professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Florida in Gainesville. According to police he used the camera pen on two occasions to secretly view and record under a student's shirt. Samuelson is alleged to have pointed the pen towards the gap between the female student's chest and the v-neck of her shirt. In June, Samuelson allegedly targeted another student, aiming the camera pen down her cleavage. Then in August, he allegedly targeted the same victim when he pointed the pen up her skirt. The victim noticed he was videotaping, according to the police report and told campus police. The camera pen containing multiple pornographic images was allegedly found in Samuelson's office on September 9th by university police. He admitted to owning the recording device. Samuleson, 65, is a tenured professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Florida in Gainesville (pictured) The pen had an integrated USB thumb drive where the videos were stored, according to police. Also on various thumb drives recovered by police were videos of several other females working in Samuelson's lab or meeting with him in his office. College chiefs placed the professor on administrative leave after the 'up skirt filming' allegations were made. 'He was placed on administrative leave as soon as the university learned of the allegations against him and he is prohibited from campus,' said Janine Sikes Assistant Vice President of Media Relations at UF. Sikes said the professor is facing being sacked. 'In situations of a serious nature such as the allegations in this case, the appropriate course of action is termination,' said Sikes. Samuelson was bonded out of Alachaua County Jail Saturday night. He faces two counts of video voyeurism of a 19-year-old or older, a third degree felony.","Don Samuelson, 65, also allegedly filmed the cleavage of two girls in class .

Arrested: 22-year-old mother Kelsey James was arrested after she drunkenly passed out in a bar and left her 2-year-old child alone in a parked car . Police in Connecticut say a toddler spent the night in a car outside a bar after her mother went drinking and ended up in the hospital. According to Bristol police, the two-year-old girl was found asleep Saturday morning inside the locked vehicle in Bristol after her mother, Kelsey James, 22, was taken to hospital for treatment after passing out at a bar. James awoke almost six hours later and began asking hospital staff for her daughter. Officers arrived at the City Sports Grille at 177 Farmington Avenue at about 11:56pm Friday after staff reported a woman who was 'intoxicated and incapacitated,' reports NBC Connecticut. 'Apparently talking to her, she was very incoherent. She tried to break into a car that wasn't hers. At that point we called police in fear for her safety,' Ron Philbrick, general manager at City Sports Bar, told WFSB. Staff said she'd arrived around 11pm and was refused alcohol. She was given a glass of water and then ran out into the parking lot. 'The fact that she drove here. I don't even know how she drove here. It amazed me because her eyes were barely open,' bartender Courtney Lausier told WFSB. Emergency responders took James to a hospital for treatment and evaluation. At about 5:30am, hospital staff called police to say James was awake and asking where her daughter was. Intoxicated: Bar staff say Kelsey James drove to the City Sports Grille but was refused alcohol and was then taken to hospital around midnight before waking up almost six hours later and asking for her daughter . Police then located James' car with the little girl asleep inside. James is charged with risking injury to a minor and leaving an unsupervised child in a vehicle. Connecticut's child welfare agency is investigating and will care for the girl until further notice. James was released after posting $50,000 bail and will appear in Bristol Superior Court on September 2. Neighbors told WFSB they were shocked and that James is a good mother.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An ad in which TNT Post compared itself to Royal Mail has been banned for implying that it offered the same service and similar prices as its competitor. The leaflet showed a photo of a man in a TNT uniform and said: 'What does my postie look like? Like this - in a smart uniform which our posties wear at all times on duty. 'Like Royal Mail, all are CRB-checked and fully trained in how to keep mail safe and secure.' Delivery firm TNT Post has had one of its ads banned after implying that it offered the same service and similar prices as the Royal Mail . It added: 'We operate under exactly the same rules and regs as Royal Mail - authorised by the Government to carry mail and watched over by Ofcom.' A regional press ad said every item was delivered 'at a competitive price - not just within Manchester, but all over the UK'. Royal Mail complained that the ad was misleading because TNT was not required to deliver to every address in the UK on a next-day basis in the way Royal Mail was. Royal Mail also complained that the ad suggested TNT delivered mail all over the UK itself and also that it implied the service provided by TNT was better than the service provided by Royal Mail. TNT said the ad was intended to reassure consumers about the security of mail rather than frequency of delivery and where it did not have its own network, it subcontracted Royal Mail to deliver, enabling it to provide a service across the UK. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ad suggested that TNT was subject to the same service levels as Royal Mail in all aspects of its service, including the obligation to deliver to every UK address every day, which was not the case. Royal Mail complained that the ad suggested TNT delivered mail all over the UK itself . It also said the reference to mail being 'delivered ... all over the UK' was misleading in the absence of qualifying information that explained that delivery to most areas in the UK could not be carried out by TNT. And it found that information in the ad did not allow readers to identify for themselves how TNT was superior to Royal Mail in respect of how its prices compared to those offered by Royal Mail. It ruled that the ads must not appear again in their current form, adding: 'We told TNT Post UK to ensure future ads did not suggest that they were subject to the same service levels as Royal Mail, that they delivered mail themselves to all parts of the UK or that their prices were competitive in relation to those offered by Royal Mail unless they could substantiate that that was the case.' A TNT Post spokeswoman said: 'Whilst we disagree with the findings, we will comply with the request for greater clarity in the future.'","Royal Mail complained that the TNT Post ad was misleading .

Romeo Clarke, from Rugby, Warwickshire, who has three older sisters, has amassed a collection of 100 dresses and eight pairs of high-heeled children's shoes. The youngster likes to wear heels and something in his favourite colour, pink - such as socks or a hair clip, every single day. Romeo also likes having his hair straightened, his nails painted and playing with Barbie dolls. Scroll down for video . Little Romeo Clarke, five, from Rugby, pictured sitting among some of the 100 dresses he owns . He says he is unfazed by what people think. But the organisers of Romeo's after-school club, run by his his local church, believe his princess dresses were 'confusing' the other children and have asked him not to return.

His furious mother Georgina Clarke, 36, has lodged a complaint with the church, claiming they are discriminating against her son. The stay-at-home single mother said: 'I was so cross when I was told he couldn’t wear dresses I was speechless - all I could ask was, why? 'Wearing the dress is his choice and if wearing it makes him happy, it's fine with me.

Romeo keeps asking when he is going back and I don't know what to say. 'He is going to be so upset as he loves going to play there.' Georgina says Romeo has had an eye for 'glitzy things', since he was two years old. 'He has always been surrounded by girls I suppose, with his three older sisters. If he asks for it, they straighten his hair and paint his nails when they are doing theirs. 'Romeo has . about 100 dresses and high heels, too. He has to wear . something pink everyday, even something like a hair clip. 'He pretty much comes home from school, throws off his uniform, puts on a dress and starts singing. 'His favourite film is Frozen and loves acting out the role of the princesses with his sisters. 'He wears his dress to the supermarket and sings down the aisles, he isn't bothered what people think. I don't think he should be, I’m proud he is so free and comfortable with himself. 'He took a Barbie to school the other week, I did warn him the other children might say something but he didn't care. 'He is friends with boys and girls, but mostly girls. I think he is quite theatrical so he might end up on the stage, I guess. He loves performing. 'I try to encourage his boy side too and he goes rock climbing once a week and swimming but I think he wants to do ballet too. Romeo pictured with his mother Georgina Clarke at their home in Rugby . Romeo insists on wearing something pink every day, even if it's just a hair clip . 'The whole family is very supportive. He won't be going back to that club, he will just have to go somewhere else.' Romeo's . father Winston Morris, 42, a builder, who has separated from the . family, added: 'I don't care if he wears the dress. He can be whatever . he wants to be. 'I am not happy with the way the whole thing has been dealt with. 'We think he has been singled out and he definitely won't be going back.' At the request of his school, Romeo wears a boy's uniform . Mrs Venables, the Minister in Training at the Rugby Christian Fellowship yesterday defended the decision. She said: . 'Georgina's son is still allowed to attend Buzz Children's Club but has . been asked to wear clothing of the gender stated on his registration . form, which states male. 'This request is no different from what is asked by his school, where he wears a boys' uniform. 'Buzz . Children's Club seeks to follow our usual safeguarding guidelines and . we did so in this case in order to avoid any confusion or possible . conflict or teasing from other children.' Zoë Ashmore, Consultant Forensic Psychologist who works with families and co-editor of the forthcoming book Forensic Practice in the Community said: . 'We know from social learning theory that children will imitate what they observe in their environment. It sounds as if Romeo likes to dress up like his older sisters and follow their example. 'Engagement in positive activities such as after school clubs is important for children. It is where they learn to socialise with others. 'I very much hope that the club involved and the family can work together to resolve this issue.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Chef Simon Rogan's restaurant L'Enclume has been ranked the best in Britain for the second year running by an influential guide. The Cumbrian eatery won a perfect 10 cooking score alongside two other restaurants, Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, the first time in 15 years that the Good Food Guide to Britain's top restaurants awarded three full marks simultaneously. In 1999, that honour was shared by Marco Pierre White's Oak Room, Nico Ladenis at Chez Nico and female chef Gunn Eriksen at the Altnaharrie Inn at Loch Broom, Ullapool, in Scotland. Simon Rogan's restaurant L'Enclume was voted the best in the country for the second year running, now the 45-year-old chef has taken over the running of the prestigious restaurant in Claridges, in London . Simon Rogan wowed judges from the Good Food Guide with his inventive cooking such as these carrots . L'Encume, pictured, won restaurant of the year for the second time in a row with a score of 10/10 . In another first, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay chef proprietor Clare Smyth became the first female chef in 15 years to be awarded a perfect 10 score by the guide, now in its 64th year. The Fat Duck, ranked second, has now scored a perfect 10 for seven years in a row - longer than any other restaurant since the guide adopted its current scoring system. Restaurant Gordon Ramsay achieved third place, up two places from last year. The guide's consultant editor Elizabeth Carter said: 'After a break of a decade, Gordon Ramsay's Chelsea flagship has once again been awarded a perfect 10. Claire Smyth of Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, pictured, is the first woman to be granted a perfect 10 score . Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire also was commended by judges . 'Now the domain of Clare Smyth, with support from what is without doubt one of the best front-of-house teams in the UK, this most impressive of London's premier restaurants is back in that elite club. 'Further congratulations, too, for Smyth is the first female chef to achieve our top score in 15 years. With her brilliantly artistic, elegant, modern French cooking she perfectly complements the witty, cerebral Fat Duck and the sensual farm-to-table delights of L'Enclume at the pinnacle of our top 50 list.' Rogan said he felt 'so privileged to be at the number one spot for a second year'. He said: 'The full 10 rating really is a reflection of all the continued focus and improvements we have been undertaking at L'Enclume every single month. 'The team just keeps on getting stronger and stronger, and we now also have a hugely skilled front-of-house staff who more than match our culinary standards.' Cornwall's Restaurant Nathan Outlaw took fourth spot followed by Claude Bosi's Mayfair restaurant Hibiscus. The Fat Duck, pictured was among three restaurants to receive a perfect score of 10 for their cooking . The guide, published by Waitrose, ranked Jason Atherton's flagship restaurant Pollen Street Social sixth, followed by Nottingham's Restaurant Sat Bains at seven and Phil Howard's The Square at eight.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . We all dread the moment when a relaxing holiday comes to an end. For Samantha Disney, however, it was not returning to work she was afraid of but getting on a plane. In fact, she was so scared of flying that she and her fiance ended up stranded for a month in Tunisia – and had to fork out an estimated £5,000 to get home . Scroll down for video . Traumatic: Samantha Disney and her partner Chris Young were forced to pay £5,000 to get home from a romantic week-long break in Tunisia after a panic attack meant she could not get on the plane home . The 32-year-old was whisked away on the week-long package holiday by her partner, who proposed during the trip. Right from the beginning, the romantic getaway did not go smoothly. Miss . Disney, who has always been a nervous flyer, was prescribed medication . to get her on the plane from Gatwick airport –  only to suffer a panic . attack in mid-air. They made it to the all-inclusive Scheherazade Hotel in Sousse. Ordeal: Miss Disney, 32, had taken medication to withstand to flight out but had a two-and-a-half-hour attack . Idyllic: The couple had been looking forward to their all-inclusive trip to Sousse, Tunisia, for months . But as they prepared to fly home, Miss Disney was gripped by fear and refused to leave for the airport. In . 2012, 11-year-old Joey Thompson was so petrified of getting on a plane . home from the Gulf that his parents looked for jobs in the area rather . than back home in Somerset. And . the Dutch footballer Dennis Bergkamp disappointed Arsenal fans hoping . he would take a coaching role at the club as he revealed in his . autobiography he will never fly again. His fear has forced him to take great lengths to reach matches abroad, such as long car journeys and awkward ferry stops. After . flying her mother out to calm her down, she eventually agreed to get on . a ferry to France before taking the Eurostar to England. She and fiance Chris Young arrived at their home in Ramsgate, Kent, more than a month after flying to Tunisia. Miss Disney said: ‘It ruined what should have been an incredible holiday. Chris proposed and we were really celebrating. ‘This . was just a blight on the whole thing. We missed out on work for a month . and we were draining our bank balances. It was absolutely awful.’ The dog groomer said she had never suffered a panic attack before taking the outbound flight on July 16. It escalated, leaving her hyperventilating and being sick throughout . the two-and-a-half hour journey. After making it to the hotel, she was . given tablets by a Tunisian doctor but lost her nerve again on July 23 . as they prepared to leave. She said: ‘I completely freaked out. 'I wasn’t breathing very well and I kept passing out. 'When . we told the holiday reps, they read us a disclaimer saying if we didn’t . get on the coach to the airport then we were no longer their . responsibility.’ The . couple returned to the hotel but had to pay £104 a night for their room – . far more than during their package break, which cost a total of £1,600. They searched for . another way home and  found a ferry crossing a week later from Tunis to . France. But moments before boarding, Miss Disney had another panic . attack and refused the £160 trip. Her . mother Deborah Savannah, 56, who also suffers from panic attacks, was . flown out to calm her down. On August 15, Miss Disney was finally coaxed . on to the ferry. It took them to Marseille, where they boarded a £250 train to Paris before taking the Eurostar to Ashford, Kent. Miss Disney said: ‘In total we must have spent an extra £5,000. The only saving grace was the hotel staff. They were fantastic.’","Samantha Disney, 32, had 2.5-hour panic attack on flight out with partner .

Internationally acclaimed architect David Adjaye will speak about his work at an event in memory of Stephen Lawrence. Stephen had dreamed of becoming an architect before he was stabbed to death aged 18 in an unprovoked racist attack in 1993. In a fitting tribute to the teenager, Mr Adjaye will deliver the annual Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture on September 16 at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It was a shocking and controversial scene that prompted more than 200 complaints – and one nomination that has given Joanne Froggatt plenty to smile about. The Downton Abbey actress who plays housemaid Anna Bates has been nominated for an Emmy as outstanding supporting actress in the wake of her character's rape scene. The episode was originally shown in the UK last year and aired in the US earlier this year. In the scene Anna is pushed against a wall by Lord Gillingham's valet Green (played by Nigel Harman) and he tries to kiss her. His advances spurned, he beats and then rapes her. Scroll down for video . Joanne Froggatt looks radiant in red as she arrives with the rest of the Downton Abbey cast at the BAFTA Pre-Emmy Tea Party at the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills . Although the attack was implied through sounds behind a door, ITV faced a backlash from fans and domestic violence charities who accused programme-makers of using rape to liven up the drama's script when it was shown in October last year. It prompted more than 200 complaints to ITV and regulator Ofcom. However US judges for the prestigious annual Emmy awards felt her performance deserved to be praised. Speaking at the Audi Pre-Emmy party last week, where the period drama has been given 12 nominations including best actress for Michelle Dockery who plays Lady Mary Crawley, Froggatt, 34, said: 'We are so so thrilled to be here and have 12 nominations, because the competition is so stiff this year - as it is every year. 'There is such great shows this year. We never expected anything. We were saying it was going to be hard, we would be lucky to get a couple of nominations. Joanne Froggatt plays housemaid Anna Bates and has been nominated for an Emmy as outstanding supporting actress in the wake of her character's rape scene . 'To get 12 is just incredible and we are over the moon and can't believe it and we are so excited just being in the mix.' The new series of Downton Abbey will air in the UK next month and Froggatt said British fans will see the aftermath of her character's rape and the impact it has on her on-screen marriage to valet John Bates. She said: 'We will see them trying to move forward and heal themselves from what has happened to Anna.. But as you would expect there is a huge cloud hanging over them and it is not something they are going to process easily or if ever. Rightly so that storyline carries through. Also there is the issue of Mr Green's death.That is hanging over them and there are questions about that. 'There are moments of hope, love and joy for Anna and Bates. It is not all doom and gloom, It would be remise to leave these characters in that situation we have to follow that through and see where that goes.'

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . Former Virginia Gov Bob McDonnell took the witness stand this week in his official corruption trial. Pictured above arriving at the courthouse on Friday, August 22 . After former Gov Bob McDonnell took the witness stand in his public corruption trial, a narrative worthy of a nighttime soap opera got even juicier. McDonnell currently faces charges he performed 'official acts' to benefit Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams, a man who appears to have had an emotional affair with McDonnell's wife Maureen. More details of the high-profile couple's relationship were revealed in court on Friday, when  the defense introduced McDonnell's melancholic letter to his ‘soulmate,’ professing his love for her and gratitude for their life together, apologizing for his shortcomings, calling her out for hers, and begging her to work with him to save the marriage. ‘I am lonely sometimes,’ McDonnell wrote on Labor Day 2011. ‘I want to be in love, not just watch movies about it.’ He was not specific about his faults, but clear about hers: ‘I am so spiritually and mentally exhausted from being yelled at. I don't think you realize how you are affecting me and sometimes others with your tongue.’ Jurors and everyone following the story that has dominated front pages across Virginia for four weeks had already heard how his wife, Maureen, had turned the stately and seemingly serene Executive Mansion into a house of workplace horrors with her incessant yelling at employees. They also heard how she sought the attentions of a slick vitamin entrepreneur while her husband was away or preoccupied with his job. Then the man once widely considered a possible running mate for Republican presidential aspirant Mitt Romney told his story, laying bare the most intimate details of his personal life. And there were other revelations from his testimony: He got in the habit of working late to avoid going home and dealing with his wife's rage. He moved out of the family home and into the rectory of a Catholic church for the duration of the trial for much the same reason. He had no idea how tight his wife and the vitamin guy, Jonnie Williams, had become and was ‘hurt’ to learn they had exchanged 950 phone calls and text messages. But neither McDonnell nor any of the other witnesses believed the relationship was sexual — and Williams had testified that it was not. Scroll down for full letter . Juicy: At trial this week, a private letter sent from Gov McDonnell to his wife Maureen (in red) was revealed, in which he reaches out to her to repair their broken relationship. Mrs McDonnell pictured leaving the federal courthouse on Friday . Affair: McDonnell stands accused of performing 'official acts' to benefit Jonnie Williams (left). But his defense team is arguing that he did not conspire with his wife Maureen (right) because they weren't communicating. So far, it appears Maureen was having an emotional affair with Williams . The marital discord is a key element of the defense as the McDonnells fight charges that they performed ‘official acts’ to benefit Williams, the former Star Scientific Inc. CEO who showered them with more than $165,000 in gifts, trips and loans. The theory is that the McDonnells could not have conspired because they were barely communicating. To illustrate the point, McDonnell said his wife didn't even respond to his letter pleading for reconciliation. Defense attorneys had prepped the jury for McDonnell's woebegone testimony by calling a parade of former Maureen McDonnell associates who portrayed her as petulant, suspicious, secretive, manipulative, accusatory and prone to angry outbursts. From: Bob McDonnell . Sent: Mon 9/05/2011 12:54 PM (GMT -4) To: Maureen Mcdonnell . Subject: (No Subject) I love you. Yesterday was one on the lowest points in my life. We have had very hard year emotionally, despite a wonderful anniversary celebration. You are my soulmate. I love being married to you and having a family. We have shared much good life together. I have made plenty of mistakes in my life which I wish I could fix. I am so sorry for all the times I have not been there for you and have done things to hurt you. I know I am a sinner and keep trying to do better. But I am completely at a loss as to how to handle the fiery anger and hate from you that has become more and more frequent. You told me again yesterday that you would wreck my things and how bad I am. It hurt me to my core. I have asked and prayed to God so many times to take this anger away from you and heal whatever hurt is causing it....some going back years and years. He has not yet answered those prayers. I often lie awake at night thinking what I can do to try to make things better. I admit that I do keep away from you sometimes and don't talk to you about important things or problems to avoid confrontation. My whole life is spent trying to help my family and other people. Overall I am incredibly blessed to lead the life we have lead, and you are too. More great children, good jobs, material comforts and friends than most people ever have. I fight to continue to be humble and thankful for All God has done. l was very excited about this weekend to spend 3 days with you to do what we wanted. We started tough friday night but we agreed to a reset. I wanted yesterday to show we could work together. I planned to open gifts, walk to the river with you, talk to you(like you did when you bared your sweet soul a little about your childhood on the Aspen trip this summer) read, watch a movie and catch up on personal business. Somehow the best plans with us never work out. It makes me very sad. I am lonely sometimes. I want to be in love, not just watch movies about it. You are doing a really great job as First Lady...better than any I've seen and better than you probably expected as you were nervous taking the FLOVA job. l'm so proud of your public actions. Our private life though has great heartache. You tell me all the time how bad your life has been with me and how unhappy you are. l do not understand this. I am so spiritually and mentally exhausted from being yelled at. I don't think you realize how you are affecting me and sometimes others with your tongue. As you told me many times and bought the book, ""don't sweat the samll stuff'. And everything is small stuff(Gary Smalley). I beg of you to think about conflict resolution in a peaceful manner. Ironically that was the focus of the readings at Church and Fr Jims homily yesterday. There is no problem we can't work out if we are calm and talk nicely and respect each others position. I am NOT preaching! l love you and want to help make you happy and our family endure. I will do anything possible to try to fix our marriage if you will work with me. Today I will spend on the many tasks I need to do:working on Dads estate(sad), paying bills, 2010 taxes,student loans, getting our files in order, letters to kids, sandbridge properties, etc. And taking at least a little time to read something for my soul! l know you work hard too to run a good office. Let me know if you want to talk softly. Bob . Sent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry . It's a character portrait that could bolster the notion that Maureen schemed behind her husband's back to solicit most of the gifts and loans, and engender sympathy for the former governor. But it also could backfire, said College of William & Mary law professor Adam Gershowitz, who specializes in criminal procedure and evidence. ‘It's a strategy that's fraught with danger,’ he said. ‘Normally doing something unchivalrous like throwing your wife under the bus doesn't play very well with regular people, which is what you have with a jury.’ Nevertheless, the former governor could beat at least some of the charges in the 14-count indictment if he is convincing enough, Gershowitz said. Brad Long isn't on the jury and hasn't been in court, but the 34-year-old Richmond resident said he has been following the case closely and believes Bob McDonnell is guilty of nothing more than using poor judgment. Supporter: McDonnell pictured leaving court with his daughter Cailin Young on Friday . ‘It seems like his wife has expensive taste and is a little greedy,’ Long said Friday as he stopped by a suburban coffee shop. ‘I think it's more on her shoulders than his.’ Long said he feels some sympathy for the former governor, and he believes the jury might too. Pete Borman, 59, of Richmond also has kept up with the daily news reports. He said that while McDonnell could get some sympathy from jurors, the former governor is getting none from him. ‘They absolutely should be convicted,’ Borman said. ‘It doesn't absolve them of guilt because their marriage was falling apart.’ Before the former governor took the stand, prosecutors had tried to discredit the marital discord theory by pointing out frequent hand-holding and other public displays of affection by the McDonnells. They will get a chance to tackle the issue head on when they cross-examine McDonnell, perhaps as soon as Monday.","Former Virginia Gov Bob McDonnell is currently facing charge he performed 'official acts' to benefit Star Scientific CEO Jonnie Williams .

"By . Katy Winter . A woman who was bullied as a teenager and branded an ‘ugly lesbian’ because of her short hair has had the last laugh - by getting through to the finals of a national beauty pageant. Kirsty Baxter, 23, suffered severe bouts of depression and even attempted suicide after years of torment. She was targeted by cruel playground bullies where she grew up in Leicester who teased her because of her edgy looks and interest in rock music. Kirsty (left, age 5, right, age 12) was horribily bullied as a child for her short her and alternative appearance . Kirsty beat 20 other women to come second in the regional rounds of the Miss Dream Street competition . Kirsty started self-harming as a teenager and was caught minutes after taking an overdose when she was 14. But she has now overcome her confidence issues after finding success in a beauty pageant and has been contacted by a number of modelling and acting agencies. Kirsty beat 20 other women to come second in the regional rounds of the Miss Dream Street competition. She was just one point behind the winner and has been entered into the national finals in Birmingham on Saturday. Yesterday, Kirsty said: 'When I applied to the beauty pageant I never thought I would be first runner up in the regional rounds like alone go through to the finals. 'I’ve never considered myself to be attractive, beautiful or anything like the kind of beauty that’s associated with beauty pageants. Kirsty, pictured age 18, was tormented by her peers, branded an 'ugly lesbian' because of her short hair . Kirsty, pictured backstage at a beauty pageant, entered the competition on a whim when she saw it on Facebook . 'I was bullied from about the age of 10 right up to 18 because of my looks. 'It started with typical high school bullying and as I got older it progressed to centred around my appearance. 'I don’t think I was fat but I was bullied because I was larger and I had short hair and everyone else was doing the teeny bop thing in the 90s. 'But I dyed my hair pink and listened to rock music. I always felt different to everybody else. 'I found two people who I thought were friends but then I found out they were spreading rumours behind my back. Kristy says that pageants have done more for her confidence than any other form of therapy she has tried . 'It was things like because I had short hair I was a lesbian, so no girls would ever come near me. 'I was always ostracised, it became a voice in my head wherever I went that said ‘you’re completely unattractive’. 'Because of this I became depressed and started self-harming and I attempted an overdose when I was 14. 'That was when my mum became aware of the bullying because she walked in on me. 'She was able to help me out and talk about it.' Kirsty has recently completed a degree in Drama and Performance as well as a postgraduate degree in Theatre for Young Audiences at the University of Worcester. She is now auditioning for film and TV roles and plans to enter other beauty pageants thanks to her new-found confidence. Kirsty, who now lives in Worcester with her boyfriend Mark Games, 34, added: 'When I was younger there was no-one that I could look up to who looked different. Kirsty has recently completed a degree in drama and now is an aspiring actress . 'So I hope my story will make people realise they don’t have to be a size zero or look like Claudia Schiffer, you can be beautiful just being you. 'I’ve been through various forms of therapy to help with my self confidence. 'I entered the beauty pageant one a whim when I saw it on Facebook and it said it was open to all ages and all sizes. 'Modelling is always something I’ve been interested in doing but I’ve never had the confidence to do it. 'But since taking part in the Miss Dream Street competition I’ve entered other beauty pageants because it has given me a real boost. 'My family and friends are really proud of me for conquering my fears. 'I know I can now achieve whatever I want to.'","Kristy was horribly bullied throughout her childhood for her looks .

"By . Clare Goldwin . Until now, exfoliating has required taking countless products into the shower. From foot to body to face, each part needs a different formulation of scrub depending on how rough or delicate the skin. Exfoliating is important to remove dead cells from the skin’s surface, as they can leave skin looking dull and dry. The older we get, the more our ability to shed old skin and produce new cells slows, so more debris accumulates and exfoliating becomes even more crucial. Smooth operator: Clare tries out Le Edge . Most commonly, exfoliators are abrasive creams, known as scrubs — these contain small particles that remove cells mechanically or chemicals such as fruit acids that dissolve the dead skin cells.Harsher products that can be used on the body — for example, the thighs and bottom — can’t be used on delicate areas of the face. However, . an Australian invention called Le Edge, presumably because of the dull . metal blades that form an ‘edge’ that you draw along your skin, is . available in Britain and is the first you can use all over. Le . Edge looks like a small car  de-icing tool. It’s inspired by an Ancient . Roman curved metal bathing tool known as a strigil, which was used, . before the existence of soap, to scrape oil, dirt and dead skin cells . off the surface of the skin. The . idea is that stroking the skin with the metal edges — in whichever . direction works best for you — scrapes away dead cells and residue left . behind by creams and soaps, speeding up your skin’s natural renewal . process and leaving behind nothing but a glowing complexion. The . makers claim it’s better than any other exfoliator because it can be . deployed on every part of your body — including the face and neck — and . as it’s used with just hot water there’s no need for expensive gels or . creams. What’s . more, it costs as little as £5 from Amazon and lasts up to a year. In . fact, Le Edge sounds almost too good to be true — so I decided to put it . to the test for a week. As a woman, the prospect of ‘shaving’ my face is bizarre — and as I drag Le Edge over my skin, the friction leaves it tingling. When my husband walks in on me using it he gives me a very odd look. Unconvinced: Clare didn't notice much difference when she used Le Edge on her face . Over the years I’ve used plenty of grainy scrubs on my face, but sometimes find they’re too harsh. Hopefully, this will be more gentle. To judge it fairly, I use Le Edge only on one side of my face and neck, putting it into action after I’ve used a cleanser and exfoliated with a scrub as usual on the left-hand side. I experiment by gently dragging the tool downwards one day and upwards the next, but direction makes little difference. The sensation isn’t unpleasant, but I don’t apply much pressure for fear of damaging my skin. While the makers of Le Edge claim it ‘helps to reduce the size of pores naturally’, they don’t explain how and it doesn’t have much impact on mine, especially those around my nose, which is impossible to get to with the scraper as the angles are too tight. One morning I forgo my cleanser as the aim of Le Edge is that you don’t need products but just warm water to soften and loosen dead skin cells. At the end of the day my face doesn’t feel any greasier than usual. If I’m honest, I haven’t noticed much difference. Certainly, it hasn’t evened up my skin tone. It doesn’t leave my skin looking red afterwards, though, which is a small saving grace, and perhaps it will work better when I try it elsewhere on the body. EXFOLIATING POWER: 3/5 . Like so many 40-something women, I am cursed with dry, scaly skin on my shins and calves. With temperatures soaring I’d like to be able to get my legs out. Body scrubs have no lasting impact: perhaps Le Edge can make a difference? Holding the tool at the recommended 45 degree angle, I pull it up my lower right leg. Again I’m using it only on one side so I can compare results with a typical scrub on the other. I use only water initially, which causes an odd dragging sensation. It’s more pleasant with a soapy lather, which I resort to after a couple of days, and makes the tool glide better. After using it around my lower leg I look at the base of the metal strips to see if a gratifying amount of dead skin and debris has collected, as other users claim. Disappointingly, there’s very little to see, but perhaps it’s been washed away. Good results: Clare was impressed with the effect of using Le Edge on her calves, thighs and buttocks . According to the instructions, using Le Edge ‘enhances the penetration and effectiveness of your other skin treatments’. I rub body butter into both legs after showering and I’m surprised to find my right limb does feel and look smoother than the left. Later in the week I shave my legs and again notice the results are smoother on the leg that has been ‘Edged’. Used before shaving, Le Edge easily lifts ingrown hairs away from the skin. Now for thighs and buttocks. My upper legs suffer from tiny rough spots that leave this area looking less than peachy. After a week of experimenting with Le Edge, these areas feel remarkably softer and look less patchy, too. I read a review by a blogger who claims it’s useful for correcting fake tan mistakes. She’s right. One morning I find there’s a large splodge of fake tan on the back of my left calf that I hadn’t massaged in properly. Sure enough, a minute or two of scraping at the area with Le Edge and it’s gone. I would also say that when I applied fake tan to both legs, the limb that I was Le Edging had a more even result. EXFOLIATING POWER: 4/5 . Full marks: Clare was delighted by the results of using Le Edge on her arms . For as long as I remember I have suffered from keratosis pilaris; dry pimply spots on my upper arms caused by an accumulation of dead skin that forms a plug blocking follicles or pores. They make me loath to wear sleeveless dresses. While exfoliation is one of the recommended treatments for this problem, there’s a danger that with conventional scrubs you rub too hard and damage the skin. No creams I’ve tried before have worked, so I’ve given up. It’s quick and easy to use the tool on this area and the dragging sensation is fine; perhaps because it’s fleshier than my lower legs. I try different approaches — pulling Le Edge slowly over my skin some days and faster on others, and decide a slow action with medium pressure works best. After two days the bumps are less prominent and by the end of the week the skin here is definitely softer, with no redness at all. I am thrilled and resolve to use this every day until I am bump-free. EXFOLIATING POWER: 5/5 . Thanks to having narrow feet, I have horrible hard patches on the tops of some of my toes and calluses on the balls of my feet from ill-fitting shoes rubbing. I’d love to have soft, supple feet, but fear I’ll never experience such heights without a beautician visiting daily. We lose 30,000 to 40,000 skin cells a minute, or 1.8 to 2.5 million per hour . I struggle to use the tool on the soles of my feet as it’s unbearably ticklish. I just want the experience to end as quickly as possible. The soles of my feet do feel slightly less rough, though it’s when I use Le Edge on the tops of my feet that I notice the most dead skin collecting. At the end of the week, my feet feel refreshed and look marginally improved. EXFOLIATING POWER: 2/5 . Many women — and men — swear by Le Edge for regular and effective exfoliation. There are reams of reviewers who say it’s replaced all their other exfoliating products. It worked best on my arms and legs and it would be a great tool on holiday, when bodies are slathered in creams, and legs and armpits regularly shaved, as it would take the place of at least three bottles in your washbag.","Australian invention 'Le Edge' can be used to exfoliate the entire body .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . and Josh Gardner for MailOnline . Her Sports Illustrated cover may tell fans to 'Remember her name' - but Mo'ne Davis might be hoping they'll forget her performance in the Little League World Series semifinal game last night. Just hours after it emerged that the Little League phenom had scored a coveted Sports Illustrated cover, the 13-year-old was pulled from the game during her team's 8-1 loss. The Philadelphia teen gave up three runs and six hits against Las Vegas and one walk in 2 and 1/3 innings. 'Mo'ne didn't have her A game today,' Philly manager Alex Rice said after the loss. 'At this point, we're playing to get to Saturday.' Disappointed: Mo'ne Davis  stands on the mound during the third inning of the game against Las Vegas on Wednesday night. Las Vegas won 8-1, with Mo'ne giving up three runs in 2 and 1/3 innings . Not too happy: Davis steps up to bat on Wednesday. She left the game after 55 pitches, meaning she cannot play in tonight's battle against Las Vegas but will play if they reach the championships on Saturday . The loss comes after she captivated the sports world when she pitched a no-hitter last Friday - a first for a girl at the Little League World Series. She is the 18th girl to appear in the tournament. She has also become the first Little League player of either gender to score a Sports Illustrated cover - and Wednesday's performance puts her in good company. Other sports stars, including New England Patriot Tom Brady, have also put in a bad performance following their appearances on the front of the magazine, ABC News pointed out. But even though it wasn't her strongest performance, she still drew record audiences: the game earned the highest ever preliminary rating for the event on ESPN, the network said. The game received a 3.4 overnight rating, up 143 per cent from the corresponding game last year. It also drew a 16.3 rating in Las Vegas and a 14.9 in Philadelphia. Ratings represent the percentage of homes with televisions tuned to a program, and overnights measure the country's largest markets. Mo'ne, whose pitch has been clocked at 70mph, only threw 55 pitches on Wednesday night so she will be eligible to pitch on Saturday if her team advances to the U.S. championship game. Honor: The disappointing performance came after it was announced that she will become the first Little Leaguer - of either gender - to ever grace the cover of Sports Illustrated. It is due out August 25 . Philly will take Chicago on again on Thursday, but she won't be pitching due to pitch-count rules. Despite the disappointing result on Wednesday, Davis still put in a solid performance, the Associated Press reported. She dazzled her opponents more than once on the mound with off-speed deliveries and tantalizing pitches just off the plate. 'She's very crafty,' said opponent Austin Kryszczuk, who scored against her. 'She's a great pitcher. That triple in the first was huge and then she settled down. Great job by us to get this victory.' The game came after she had eight strikeouts, didn't walk a batter and needed only 70 pitches to complete the game in the team's 4-0 victory over Nashville. She then led Philadelphia to a 8-0 victory over Delaware in the Mid-Atlantic Regional championship game. Mo'ne appears on the SI cover, with the headline 'Remember her name,' on the August 25 issue - not that fans, who have lined the grassy hills beyond the playing field at the Little World Series to see Davis play, really need to be told. Impressed: Although Philadelphia took a bad loss, Las Vegas' Austin Kryszczuk (pictured on Wednesday) called her a 'great pitcher' and said his team did well to win. Kryszczuk hit a triple in the game . Bad night: From left, Jahli Hendricks, Carter Davis, Mo'ne Davis, and Zion Spearman wait on the dugout steps to the take the field for the sixth inning of the semi-final baseball game against Las Vegas on Wednesday . The concession stands have sold out of the powder-blue T-shirts of her Mid-Atlantic team. And yet, in spite of her 70 mph fastball, baseball isn't Davis' best game; her basketball coach said she is even better on the hardwood. 'Coaching boys and girls in this age group for two decades, Mo'ne is just a special talent,' said Debra Brady, Davis's basketball coach at Springside Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia. 'She's a phenomenal pitcher, but I think her best sport is basketball. In a year or so, she will be doing the same unbelievable things in basketball. The first couple of games I coached her, she was head and shoulders above any kid I've ever coached at that age level.' Davis has not shied from using her riveting success in a positive way. She sacrificed time with teammates to do a national television interview late Sunday night, and of course there's the Sports Illustrated cover.","The Philadelphia teen captivated the sports world when she pitched a no-hitter Friday - a first for a girl at the Little League World Series .

"By . Sam Webb . An auction house is hoping to appeal to wannabe politicians by selling 10 Downing Street - for just £40,000. But any prospective buyer won't be making Prime Minister David Cameron homeless, they'll be buying this end-of-terrace property in Nottingham. The three-storey home has two double bedrooms, lounge, kitchen/breakfast room, gas central heating, double glazing and a white door. It is going under the hammer on September 4 at Graham Penny Auctions' Nottingham Racecourse sale. Power property: An auction house is selling 10 Downing Street for just £40,000. However, the property is not the Prime Minister's home (right) but an end-of-terrace in Nottingham (left) The home, which requires 'general cosmetic improvement and upgrading', is being offered subject to tenancy with a guide price of just £40,000. Built in the early 20th Century, it has around 670sq/ft of space and a small courtyard garden at the rear. It is currently being let out for approximately £395 per month. At 3,800 sq/ft, the Prime Minister's property is more than five times the size of the home in Nottingham and is tucked away on a private road in a historic part of London. The home, which requires 'general cosmetic improvement and upgrading', is being offered subject to tenancy with a guide price of just £40,000 . No nuclear bunker then? The three-storey home has two double bedrooms, lounge, kitchen/breakfast room, gas central heating and double glazing . While London's Downing Street is worth an estimated £50million, the PM probably can't have a friendly natter over his garden fence with his neighbour George Osborne, like he would in Nottingham . Pastor Real Estate, in London, believe that if the PM's home ever came onto the market it would sell for more than £50million or achieve a rental of £45,000 a week. But the Nottingham Property has the advantage of being an end-of-terrace, rather than the PM's mid-terrace home. Vejay Pal, senior valuer at Graham Penny Auctions Nottingham, said: 'It is not every day you see 10 Downing Street for sale. 'This clearly isn't the head of government's home, however we've already received a reasonable amount of interest in the property a month before the auction - no doubt in part because of its better-known double. 'The lot itself is an ideal investment property benefiting from gas central heating and double glazing. 'It does require some cosmetic improvement and upgrading but with a little effort it could produce a healthy return or yield for a property investor or landlord.'

"By . Gemma Champ . Scroll down for video . With its chandeliers, rails of glossy clothing and attentive assistants, it’s no wonder this new clothing shop has drawn in hordes of fashion-forward women. Inside the spacious store, they stroke elegant illusion dresses, bright tropical shifts and chic knee-length frocks. But this isn’t an expensive designer shop, rather it’s the latest opening from the High Street’s most surprising renaissance: Bonmarché, in Uxbridge on the outskirts of London. Flattering: Stylish and well-priced dresses are now available at Bonmarché . It couldn’t be further from the image most will have of the brand. Bonmarché was once one of the High Street’s most forgotten — and forgettable — shops thanks to its flammable fabrics, boring clothing and cramped, messy stores filled with a mish-mash of youth styles and dowdy dresses. Today, there are no crop tops, sequins or sack-like frocks, just well-cut clothes at outrageously low prices that have proved catnip for older women. It has clearly worked. Bonmarché this year announced profits were up 66 per cent on 2012-13, with online sales increased by an astonishing 84 per cent. Already, the fashion crowd has taken to referring to Bonmarché as Topshop for the over-50s. So how on earth has one of the High Street’s most underwhelming shops turned around its fortunes in such an astonishing manner? Perhaps, it’s because the man credited with the brand’s latest incarnation understands what this customer wants to feel when she steps into a new dress. David Emanuel — the couturier famed as the co-designer of Princess Diana’s wedding dress and beloved for his classic glamour, worn by the likes of Joan Collins and Jane Seymour — was first approached by Bonmarché in 2007 to create a branded line for the otherwise uninspiring store. Yet it is only in the last season or so that he has felt truly happy with the quality on offer at Bonmarché. ‘Now, the collection is ageless,’ says Emanuel. ‘Better yet, we’ve brought in a brand new customer — the woman who wants comfort and a bargain, but knows that looking good is the primary consideration.’ Emanuel believes the High Street had all but betrayed these customers: ‘These women were starved of colour,’ he says. ‘These ladies were wandering round the country in beige — beige sweaters, beige macs, beige shoes, beige handbags, because that’s all that retailers offered to them. ‘My collection is filled with prints and colours that flatter older women and I’ve really thought about their body shapes and what they want.’ High point: The shop has introduced contemporary clothes that have proven more popular than the old classics . This summer’s collections mark a high point in the company’s chequered fortunes. Originally part of the collapsed Peacock Group, it was rescued from administration in January 2012 when it was bought by the private company Sun European Partners, which owns high-end designer brands such as Jacques Vert. The new regime closed 160 stores, leaving 230 in place, and started a programme of revamping interiors with prettier lighting, better styling and staff employed for their charm and cheeriness. It also completely revamped its collections, chasing quality while maintaining prices (the dresses pictured each cost less than £30) and gradually introducing more contemporary — but, crucially, not younger — clothes, which have proved more popular than the old classics. Say goodbye to beige: David Emmanuel filled his collection with colours and prints . A new team, with a new CEO — 48-year-old fashion powerhouse Beth Butterwick, former head of buying at Marks & Spencer — at its helm, set about revamping the firm. This week, at the store in Uxbridge, I watched busy women gleefully pick up item after item, with none of the trepidation that normally comes with fearing the waist will be tiny or the hem too high for a post-50 body. From well-to-do, expensively highlighted blonde ladies looking for smart partywear to silver-haired friends with clipped Home Counties vowels ‘oohing and aahing’ over embellished tops (two for £18), and women shopping with their husbands, it’s clear that Bonmarché caters for women with money who are tired of being alienated by the High Street. Here, frocks come with sleeves, hems are knee-length or lower, dresses feature forgiving ruching or wrapping, and necklines are flattering rather than revealing. The clothes are tailored to suit a post-menopausal body, rather than the waif-like teens favoured by the likes of Zara and New Look. Lindsay Sharp, 62, from Kings Hill in Kent epitomises this new customer. Retired, with two grandchildren, she’s swapped M&S for Bonmarché. ‘Marks & Spencer was my original fallback, but they sell very boring everyday things or clothes for work or going out,’ she says. ‘The High Street has given up on me.’ Beth Butterwick says she immediately made it her mission to woo the older shopper.‘At Bonmarché our mantra is to make women over 50 feel fabulous at fantastic prices,’ she says. ‘Our typical customer is in her early to mid-60s, so we focus on fit and style that’s relevant to those ladies rather than the younger women.’ And while the store’s online success is unequivocal, their retail campaign has been ingenious. As customers desert the High Street in their hordes, Bonmarché has opened branches in upmarket garden centres around the country — the first ones were in Bicester, Oxon, Lechlade, Glocs, and Andover, Hants — next to the likes of Laura Ashley, Cotton Traders and Lakeland. ‘Garden centres are very much a whole day out — they often have free parking, restaurants and other retailers, too,’ says Ms Butterwick. ‘We’re attracting a customer that perhaps didn’t know about us. I feel as if we’re almost a best-kept High Street secret.’ But judging by the scenes in my local store, it seems the secret’s well and truly out.","Bonmarché was once one of the High Street’s most forgettable shops .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Outspoken comic Frankie Boyle has called on the BBC to sack 'cultural tumour' Jeremy Clarkson. Speaking at the Edinburgh festival, the Scottish comedian launched a stinging attack on the controversial Top Gear presenter. Boyle - who has himself been cast out by some TV producers - said Clarkson only keeps his job because of his closeness to those in power. Scroll down for video . Comedian Frankie Boyle has launched a stinging attack on  Jeremy Clarkson at the Edinburgh Festival, calling the Top Gear presenter a 'cultural tumour' Boyle said Clarkson (pictured) only keeps his job at the BBC because he is close to those in power . In comments reported in the Observer, Boyle said: 'He's a friend David Cameron... he's in there like a f****** growth and he should be removed because he's horrible. Sack him because he's a cultural tumour.' Clarkson, 54, escaped dismissal in May despite being forced to issue a grovelling apology for apparently using the word 'n*****' during a Top Gear outtake. Unused footage from car show emerged showing the £1million a year host swinging his finger between two cars while reciting a notoriously racist children's nursery rhyme. Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was 'mortified' by the upset he had caused, and 'begged forgiveness' from his fans. It came after he sparked outrage by making an apparently racist joke during another episode of the hit motoring show, screened in March. While filming in Burma, he joked a bridge with an Asian man walking across it had a 'slope on it'. Clarkson was forced to issue an apology for apparently using the word 'n*****' during a Top Gear outtake . Boyle, 42,  has himself attracted controversy in the past for making controversial jokes about Katie Price's disabled son and the appearance of Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington. But he insisted he did not regret his comments, saying: 'Think of all the other things that we could get offended about rather than a joke that was told five years ago.' Boyle has attracted criticism from some TV bosses, with Channel 4's Head of Comedy Phil Clarke claiming the Glaswegian would not be returning to the channel in an interview earlier this year. Boyle hit back at producers in his on-stage rant in Edinburgh, claiming: 'There's a layer of people whose job it is to kind of reject things that are interesting. And the trouble is, that layer is at the top.' He added that current TV guides look like 'the entertainment programme on a f****** cruise ship'. In a further outburst, he claimed the BBC 'is biased against' Scottish independence because it is worried about a drop in licence fee revenue. Asked about the aftermath of a No vote, he said: 'I think half the country will have had their dreams and hopes destroyed, so it will be pretty much business as usual for everybody.'

"By . Julian Robinson . They have just witnessed a military coup in their nation’s capital, but people in Thailand are being urged to embrace ‘happiness’ – starting with free haircuts. Army bosses, who just weeks ago seized power in Bangkok, say perking up the mood in the country is a top priority and want to reinstate Thailand as the ‘Land of Smiles’. Now the military junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has ordered a series of events including road clean-ups, army-band concerts and free haircuts for civilians. The Thai junta wants to reinstate 'happiness' among the people of Thailand after weeks of unrest. A child is pictured with a soldier in Bangkok just days after the bloodless coup . The scheme was outlined by army chief General Prayith Chan-ocha in a national address, according to the Samui Times website. Outlining his vision for the country, which includes up to three months of ‘national reconciliation and constitutional reforms, he is reported as saying: ‘Thai people, like me, have probably not been happy for nine years, but since May 22, there is happiness.’ Soldiers from the Saraburi province have already been ordered to carry out a ‘Big Cleaning Day’ around the Victory Monument in the centre of Bangkok – recently the site of anti-coup protests. Soldiers from the Thai junta watch on as a woman runs past them near the Victory Monument in Bangkok following their military coup in May. The army has now set about launching a charm offensive by offering free haircuts and musical events . According to the website, the army said this was done in an effort to bring ‘beauty and cleanliness back to the people. Soldiers also temporarily swapped their weapons for guitars, keyboards and drums during free concerts. Residents were also offered free desserts and haircuts during the musical events. The NCPO is also expected to air weekly television shows aimed at keeping residents up to date with their moves to make people happy. But it has not been plain sailing for the army since seizing power. A soldier is pictured taking cover behind a speaker during heated demonstrations in Bangkok just days ago . An army spokesman told the website: ‘It will be an explanation of the NCPO’s works, and will answer people’s questions.’ General Prayuth Chan-ocha seized power on May 22 and has since led a determined crackdown that has stifled dissent and silenced the ‘red shirt’ supporters of former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, billionaire former premier Thaksin Shinawatra. The military has detained many politicians and activists and demanded as a condition of release that they sign documents stating they would avoid politics and halt anti-coup activities. A protester, foreground, launches a rubbish bin at a line of Thai soldiers during an anti-coup demonstration at the Victory Monument in Bangkok. The junta says it is now attempting to bring happiness back to the nation . The junta has also banned political meetings of more than five people and at the weekend flooded Bangkok with thousands of troops and policemen to stifle dissent. Opposition to the coup has been limited to small flash mob protests, and they have for the most part been peaceful. Some Bangkok protesters have sat in groups of less than five reading books about civil disobedience or that critique authoritarian government, such as George Orwell's ‘1984’.","Civilians offered free desserts and haircuts in junta's plan for 'happiness'

"By . Associated Press . It cost a Bend teenager about $800 in revenue from chores, yard work and birthday gifts to buy a miniature aircraft and a camera he sent aloft to capture video of a forest fire this summer that was threatening the western edge of the city. The images were a YouTube hit, but they were also a source of worry for fire bosses concerned about the possibility that drones could interfere with firefighting and possibly bring down a big aircraft. Morgan Tien, 14, told The Bulletin newspaper of Bend that he had read federal guidelines on when and where he could fly his DJI Phantom, a small quadcopter he fitted with a GoPro camera. Scroll down for video . Morgan Tien, 14, holds his quadcopter that he flew to film and photograph the Two Bulls Fire from his backyard near Awbrey Glen Golf Club in Bend Ore. Tien's not in trouble for the flight, which went up from his patio on June 7, followed by a second flight the next day. They didn't get into restricted air space. But federal authorities cited the flights, along with others this summer in Washington state and California. They called them an 'emerging hazard.' Drones may be a problem for firefighters if the drones fly into restricted airspace over and near a wildfire, where air tankers and helicopters could be in the air, said Mike Ferris, a spokesman in Portland for the U.S. Forest Service. If firefighters spot a drone close to a fire, they may suspend the aerial delivery of retardant and water from air tankers and helicopters, Ferris said. The number of drones flying around wildfires is expected to increase, he said. 'We just want people to be aware and know the rules and know that it could become a hazard,' Ferris said. There have been no collisions reported between airplanes or helicopters and drones in central Oregon or the rest of the country, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Forest Service itself is interested in using drones to collect information about wildfires, such as determining their perimeters and checking for small fires. Tien said no federal agencies have contacted him about his flights near the Two Bulls Fire. He said he'd fly again near another wildfire, after making sure he was following rules, and he expects to see more people flying drones near wildfires. 'We are just entering this realm of drones,' Tien said. Video by Morgan Tien .","Authorities worry drones could interfere with firefighting and potentially bring down bid aircraft .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A toddler died when a fireplace that her father had bought on eBay and glued to a wall in their house fell on top of her. Trinity Liliana Coward suffered serious head injuries when the stone and marble mantelpiece came crashing down on her in July. The two-year-old was taken to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital where she died of her injuries. Two-year-old Trinity Liliana died after the stone and marble mantelpiece fell on top of her at her home . Today a coroner warned parents of the dangers of DIY which kills 'one child a year'. The inquest heard how the girl's father, Shaun Coward, had glued the fireplace, which was not sold with fitting instructions, to the wall after buying it online. He fixed it onto a wall using No More Nails-type glue from B&Q with his father-in-law at the home in Lakenham, Norwich. He watched as his beloved daughter swung from the top of the mantelpiece before it came crashing down on her. The distraught parent previously said he wished he had died rather than his daughter. 'Trinity was happy, being cheeky and running around. 'She reached up to the fireplace and started swinging from it. 'All of a sudden it came away from the wall. 'I rushed over and expected her to respond the way she normally did when she had a fall but she was lifeless. 'She was my rock, She was a real daddy’s girl. I wish I could have died so that she could have lived,' he said. Recording an accidental death, coroner Jacqueline Lake said the child's death shed light on the dangers of unregulated DIY. 'This does highlight a lack of regulation in respect of the sale of secondhand fireplaces on a private basis and where they are fitted by an individual. 'Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. 'Trinity’s death highlights the dangers of carrying out do-it-yourself work in the home where a job like this requires professional installation. 'I make no criticism of Mr Coward - he was trying to make his home look nice and was unaware of the dangers he was facing.' The 'happy' toddler was swinging from the mantelpiece at the family's home when it fell and crushed her, the inquest heard . The inquest heard how Mr Coward put up the fireplace at the family home (pictured) in Lakenham, Norwich, after buying it on eBay . One child dies every year in similar accidents, a Norfolk County Council trading standards officer claimed. 'The incidents all involve surrounds made from stone which are fixed to a wall with an adhesive. 'It is not a suitable DIY project and should be approached by somebody with some knowledge of safe installation,' said Dean King. Norfolk County Council has published advice to parents on how to avoid such accidents since Trinity's death. Sheila Merrill, public health adviser at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: 'The most normal everyday items can be a risk to young children. 'Thankfully accidents of this nature are not a regular occurrence, however RoSPA's advice when buying modular, stone or artificial stone fireplaces is to seek professional advice before making the purchase and to get the fireplace surround fitted by a professional. 'Individual components of these fireplaces can weigh more than 50kg and, unless fitted in a secure manner, can in time come adrift from the fixing.'","Trinity Liliana Coward died after being crushed by stone fireplace .

"By . Valerie Elliott . Mosquito traps have been set up at motorway service stations because motorists returning from the Continent could be carrying home a deadly species. The Asian tiger mosquito, which can bite 50 times in 15 minutes and carries the life-threatening dengue fever, yellow and Chikungunya fevers, hides in caravans, camping trailers and motorhomes. It has been spreading north from southern Europe and experts believe it could soon establish in the UK. Deadly species: The Asian tiger mosquito (pictured), which can bite 50 times in 15 minutes and carries the life-threatening dengue fever, yellow and Chikungunya fevers, hides in caravans, trailers and motorhomes . The traps have been installed on the main routes from the Channel ferry ports and the Eurotunnel terminal. They resemble black plant pots and contain water to attract the insects. A few . leaves are inserted and a small polystyrene square placed on top of the . water. The dark, wet spaces are ideal shelters for mosquitoes to lay . their eggs. The sticky larvae then attaches to the polystyrene. Scientists . check the traps every two weeks. If larvae are seen, the polystyrene is . removed and bagged, and a replacement inserted. Samples are then tested . in the laboratory to identify the insect species. Traps: Mosquito traps that attract the insects have now been set up at motorway service stations (file picture) Jolyon Medlock, head of medical entomology at Public Health England, said: 'Asian tiger mosquitoes have now spread along motorways from Greece, . Spain and Italy through the south of France as far as Lyon. 'But with . many holidaymakers driving to the south of France, Italy and Spain the . potential is there for the mosquito to enter the country. 'If a mosquito . flies into a car you’ll swat them, but people are unlikely to know if a . mosquito is sheltering inside a caravan or trailer. 'So we’ve decided to . set up traps away from the  coast where mosquitoes may escape from . vehicles into the environment.' Shipments to Britain of used tyres where the mosquito likes to nest are also routinely inspected. Asian tiger mosquitoes, named after their distinctive striped markings, thrive in temperate climate and can carry more than 20 exotic diseases. Dr Medlock said the intensive mosquito surveillance was necessary so health chiefs could plan for possible disease outbreaks and warn people about the potential threat. Surveillance is also being extended in a triangle from Basildon in Essex to Canterbury and Dartford in Kent to monitor the spread of another dangerous mosquito, known as Culex modestus, which can transmit West Nile Virus which can be fatal to humans. Until four years, ago this mosquito was thought to be extinct in the UK, but it was found in a trap in marshes at Cliffe north, Kent, and has extended to Faversham. Mosquitoes trapped and tested have so far been free of the virus. July is the peak time for mosquitoes in Britain, but householders can reduce numbers in their garden by emptying paddling pools, covering water butts and turning buckets, plant pots or other containers upside down to prevent collecting water which attracts the insects.","Asian tiger mosquitoes can bite 50 times in 15 minutes and carry diseases .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A sailor was rescued five miles off the coast of Dorset last night - after attempting to sail 3,000 miles to America in a 14ft dinghy. The 30-year-old Bulgarian national purchased the £300 boat from Christchurch harbour yesterday before setting off on his voyage. He was spotted looking seasick in choppy seas at around 5pm by a passing yachtsman, who called the coastguard. An RNLI lifeboat crew from Mudeford attempted to help the man, who had a U.S. visa on board, but he refused their assistance for 45 minutes. Lucky to survive: A 30 year old Bulgarian man had to be rescued by an RNLI lifeboat crew after getting into difficulty five miles out of Christchurch in Dorset. He was trying to sail to America in a £300 14ft dinghy with no lights, no life jacket and rudimentary supplies. File picture . He was eventually dragged onto the RNLI lifeboat and taken to shore, where police and an ambulance crew were waiting. The man was not wearing a life jacket, his boat did not have any lights and the only navigational aid in his possession was a street map of Southampton. Pete Dadds, 41, a lifeboat crewman who attended the incident, said the man would have died if he had not been rescued. 'When we reached the gentleman he didn't want us there, he wanted to carry on his way,' the commercial fisherman said. 'We were not happy leaving him out there. He kept saying 'I am going west'. 'His boat was not properly rigged so he was just getting battered, he was at the mercy of the elements. 'We said ""if we leave you you will die"". He didn't have a life-jacket, just a buoyancy aid and the vessel didn't have any lights.' He was spotted looking seasick in choppy seas at around 5pm by a passing yachtsman, who called the coastguard. He  made it five miles from Christchurch harbour - 3,000 shy of America . He added: 'All he had on was a bag of personal belongings which were a few odds and ends, a bag of biscuits, beans and hot dogs and a bag with his passport in. 'He was obviously suffering from the first signs of hypothermia. He was only wearing a pack-a-mac jacket and leggings. 'He was absolutely sodden.' The man boarded the RNLI lifeboat, where he was violently sea sick and 'very, very cold', Mr Dadds added. The sailor was rescued five miles off the coast of Dorset after buying a dinghy from Christchurch . 'I ended up cuddling him at the back of the boat to keep him warm,' he said. 'He would have died, he was severely sea sick, he had the first signs of hypothermia and his boat was filling up with water. 'There's no chance it would have kept going for much longer.' Mr Dadds said the sailor was 'incredibly lucky' the yacht had been passing him and had contacted the coastguard. The RNLI crew arrived back at Mudeford at around 6.30pm and the man was immediately taken to hospital by the waiting ambulance. His boat was then towed back to shore by the crew.","The 30-year-old was spotted looking seasick in rough seas in £300 boat .

"By . Mail online Reporter . The FDA has blocked the donation of a teen suicide victim's eyes because he was gay, it has emerged. Alexander 'A.J.', Betts Jr., 16, of Pleasant Hills, Iowa, committed suicide in July 2013 after enduring more than 18 months of ridicule when he was outed as gay. Before his death he had registered as an organ donor. After his passing, a 14-year-old boy was able to receive his heart, but his eyes have been rejected from donation because of the FDA rule saying men who've had sex with men in the last five years should be 'ineligible' for donating certain tissues because of the 'risk factor' of their behavior. Scroll down for video . Teen Alexander Betts took his own life last year following months of harassment after being outed as gay . Betts wanted to be an organ donor but FDA regulations on tissue and blood donation from gay men have prevented anyone from receiving his eyes . 'My . initial feeling was just very angry because I couldn’t understand why . my 16-year-old son’s eyes couldn’t be donated just because he was gay,' mother Sheryl . Moore told KCCI. The FDA's policy is a leftover from when the AIDS crisis was at its peak, and is part of an overall ban on blood from homosexual men. As The Washington Post reports, blood donation is held to even stricter standards, saying men who 'at any time since 1977 . (the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States) are currently . deferred as blood donors.' This is because 'a history of male-to-male sex is . associated with an increased risk for exposure to and transmission of . certain infectious diseases, including HIV.' The FDA insists such a hardline stance is required, as there is a 'documented increased risk' of infections like HIV been transmitted and that are heightened when 'associated . with male-to-male sex and is not based on any judgment concerning the . donor’s sexual orientation.' Betts's mother Sheryl Moore has called the policy preventing her son's eye donation 'archaic' But critics call the policy archaic. 'We think it’s time for the FDA to take a serious look at . this policy, because it’s out of step with peer countries, . it’s out of step with modern medicine, it’s out of step with public . opinion, and we feel it may be legally problematic,'; Glenn Cohen, a bioethics law professor for Harvard Law School told CBS. Cohen argued the ban was contradictory as it only banned men who had sex with HIV-positive women or prostitutes for a single year. And last summer, the American Medical Association voted to end the ban. But the regulations on tissue donation are more nebulous than the blood bans. A homosexual man's vital organs - such as the heart, liver, and lungs - can be donated as long as the recipient knows their origins and signs a waiver. However, the FDA classifies eyes as human tissue, which is banned from use if the donor was a sexually active gay man. Betts's liver, lungs, kidneys, and heart have all been successfully donated because in those cases as long as the recipient gave consent with knowledge of the risks and counseling, organs are allowed to be donated . However Betts's eyes were rejected because Moore could not confirm whether he was sexually in the years before his death. Betts's friends said he had struggled with bullying for years before he was outed as gay, having been teased over a cleft lip and for being half African American. 'He's different,' best friend Noah Lahmann told reporters after Betts's death. 'He doesn't add up to what they're used to.' Moore says she's appalled by the regulations. 'It is just silly that people . wouldn’t get the life-saving assistance they need because of regulations . that are 30 years old,' Moore said.","Alexander 'A.J.'

"By . Damian Spellman . Edin Dzeko has insisted Manchester City will take nothing for granted as they attempt to defend their Barclays Premier League title. The reigning champions launched their defence with a hard-fought 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Sunday with an efficient, rather than dazzling, display. Title rivals Liverpool and Arsenal both enjoyed even narrower successes in their opening fixtures, and Dzeko knows there is no room for complacency during a campaign he expects to be as competitive as ever. Hard work: Manchester City will hope to retain their title this season but Dzeko knows that will be a tough task . Champions: The Bosnian striker has won the Premier League twice with Manchester City in 2012 and 2014 . The 28-year-old frontman told CityTV: 'It's just the beginning of the season and it will be, definitely, a long season with the five teams fighting for the title. This is just the beginning. 'It's good to start with a win, but we are not there. There are so many games to come and we have to prepare for the next one, for the big game against Liverpool to try to win at home. 'We have brought in some great new players. Some of them still need time because it was the World Cup and a lot of us came later to the pre-season. 'I think we can still improve a lot. Each game, we can be better and better and just try to continue where we finished [at Newcastle].' Dzeko was a key figure in the win at St James' Park despite not finding his own way on to the scoresheet. It was his clever back-heel after he had drawn central defenders Fabricio Coloccini and Mile Williamson to the ball which allowed David Silva to fire City into the lead against the Magpies, just as he had done 12 months earlier. Opening win: David Silva scored City's first goal of the new Premier League season at Newcastle . Winner: Sergio Aguero, who has signed a new contract, scored the second of City's goals in the 2-0 win . VIDEO Important to start with a win - Pellegrini . But if Silva's 38th-minute intervention gave the visitors the advantage, it was one they were unable to push home until substitute Sergio Aguero beat Tim Krul at the second attempt in stoppage time at the end of the game. Dzeko said: 'We played very well. From the first minute, we were there like the manager wanted us to be, from the first minute to try to press them high, to try to score a goal. 'We didn't score an early goal, but it was the perfect time, five minutes before half-time, and I think we controlled the game during the 90 minutes, were definitely the better side and deserved this win.' New recruit:  Fernando, signed from Porto for £12million, was impressive for Manchester City at Newcastle . Dzeko's impressive individual display came amid reports that he is close to signing a new contract at the Etihad Stadium, but it was collective, rather than individual plaudits which were of greater interest to the Bosnia-Herzegovina international. He said: 'I am very happy because of my performance and the performance of the team because I think we were brilliant. 'It's always good to start the season with a win, especially away at Newcastle where it is always tough to go.' Dzeko's mood was in sharp contrast to that of Newcastle debutant Jack Colback as he and his team-mates emerged from a tight encounter with nothing to show for their efforts. Manager Alan Pardew was quick to take positives from a spirited display in the immediate aftermath, and urged his players to take them into Saturday's trip to Aston Villa. Dream: Despite the result, Jack Colback fulfilled his dream by making his debut for boyhood club Newcastle . Colback told nufcTV: 'We are disappointed with the result. You get nothing for good performances, but defeats. 'We are not going to come up against the quality that City have every week and we are going to get more chances against the teams who aren't the so-called better teams, so we have got to take the positives out of Sunday and look to go there and get some points.' Tyneside-born Colback fulfilled a dream when he made his league debut for the club he supported as a boy after spending the whole of his career until the end of last season with arch-rivals Sunderland. The 24-year-old said: 'It was bittersweet, really, coming off with a defeat. It would have been fantastic to have come away with at least a point. 'But it was great to finally have that moment and get it under the belt.'","City opened their title defence with a 2-0 victory away at Newcastle .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Health experts have slammed a hospital canteen for selling an 800-calorie 'fry-up pie' to patients. The meal - dubbed 'a heart attack on a plate' - includes a slice of bacon, a sausage, a black pudding and beans with an egg on top. It is being sold at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, just around the corner from the cardiac rehabilitation ward where doctors are fighting to save heart attack victims. Scroll down for video . Defence: Bosses at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee backed the selling of the snack alongside other alternatives . The NHS trust in charge of the hospital has been blasted by healthy-eating campaigners for continuing to sell the £1.50 pie - which contains a third of a man's daily calorie intake - despite expert advice. Former government adviser Professor Mike Lean, chair of Human Nutrition at Glasgow University, said the pie was proof that stricter guidelines are needed on what food should be sold to patients. He said: 'It should never be anywhere near a hospital. It is laden with fat, salt and without a vegetable in sight.' One of those being cared for at the hospital added: 'There are so many huge and obese staff and patients here, it's the last place that should be selling something like this. It comes after a patient in Southmead Hospital in Bristol shamed hospital bosses by keeping a photo diary of the meagre meals he was served during his stay. Chef Steven Williams photographed the tiny portions he was given, which included a roast dinner with just one floret of broccoli and a half-plate portion of chilli con carne with rice. Alternative: It comes after a patient at another hospital posted photos of the small meals he was given . After experts criticised those meals for having insufficient nutritional value, others have expressed dismay at the calorie-overload of the fry-up pie. National Obesity Forum spokesman Tam Fry said: 'What we have here is a heart attack on a plate. 'It should be absolutely obligatory for the NHS to have wholesome food whether it is from a take-away shop within hospitals or on menus. 'The NHS is creaking under the weight of the nation's obesity problem.' Labour health spokesman Neil Findlay added: 'NHS hospitals should be leading the way in encouraging people to eat a healthy, nutritious and balanced diet.' A spokesman for NHS Tayside admitted the pies are on sale at one of their takeaway outlets - but insisted that healthy food is also available. He said: 'There are a wide range of meals, snacks and drinks available for the public and staff to choose from including healthy breakfast options such as cereals, fresh orange juice, low fat yogurts and fresh fruit. 'These are provided by NHS Tayside dining rooms as well as third-party providers on the concourse of the hospital.' Steven Williams was given this tiny roast dinner with just one floret of broccoli, two potatoes, two pieces of cauliflower and fatty beef at Southmead Hospital in Bristol .

"By . Associated Press . The overjoyed father of the American journalist freed by Islamic militants said Monday that his son and others who venture into dangerous lands like Syria deserve praise for wanting to 'bear witness ... tell the truth about what's going on.' Michael Padnos, who lives on a boat outside Paris, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the interminable search and wait for his son had been like 'hunting for bats in a dark, black cave.' Theo Padnos spoke to his mother in Boston Sunday night 'for less than a minute' but said he was 'happy to be back in the civilized world and see some girls,' according to the father's account. Scroll down for video . Overjoyed: Michael Padnos, the father of Peter Theo Curtis, the American journalist freed by Islamic militants, is happy is son is free . Safe: Michael Padnos said the most important thing is that his son is safe and that he patiently awaits his arrival . Captive no longer: Theo Padnos was returned back to the Unites States after being captured in 2012 shortly after crossing Syria . An unidentified American with the journalist initially spoke with Padnos' mother, Nancy Curtis, but told her that 'he is too upset to talk ... right now.' He called her in the evening, according to the father. It wasn't clear when Padnos would return home to Boston. He was apparently in Tel Aviv, where he was driven after being released Sunday in the Golan Heights, a week after the beheading of another American journalist, James Foley, an act that was videotaped and posted on the Internet. His family said they believe their son was captured in October 2012, shortly after crossing into Syria. He was held by Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front, according to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The al-Qaida-linked group is fighting the regime of Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Michael Padnos brushed aside delays in his son's return. 'They say they're going to bring him back when he's ready to travel,' Padnos said. Now free: American journalist, Theo padnos, who was kidnapped entering Syria nearly two years ago  was handed over to UN representatives on Sunday . Murdered: Theo Padnos was freed just days after journalist James Foley was brutally beheaded by ISIS . 'The main thing is he's safe ... That's the only thing that counts for me,' he said, calling his son Theophilus, his birth name. Theo Padnos changed his name to Peter Theo Curtis before leaving for Syria some two years ago for safety reasons, his father said, noting he had written a book 'Undercover Muslim' after investigating the secretive Islamist world in Yemen, pretending to be a deeply religious Muslim. The journalist's father said the risky life of his son, whom he described as an 'itinerant journalist,' made him fearful. But 'you can only respect those people (journalists) for doing it.' 'Your heart's in your mouth while you bite your tongue ... but it's noble and worthy' to do as his son did, he said. Beyond the relief and the joy, questions remain, notably how Padnos was freed, and whether ransom in any form was involved. It is a U.S. policy not to pay ransom. Michael Padnos said Qatar's involvement was crucial. Relieved: Padnos spoke to his mother briefly on Monday and told her he is happy to be back in civilized society and is 'happy to see some girls' 'The government that has been the intermediary in this has been Qatar, and Qatar has said that they had him released on a humanitarian basis without the payment of any ransom,' Padnos said. 'I don't know any more than that.' Betsy Sullivan, a cousin of Curtis, said earlier other intermediaries involved in negotiations threatened the family and made ransom demands of varying amounts. The family said that Qatari representatives assured them that no money was paid out. Foley's Islamic State captors had demanded $132.5 million (100 million euros) from his parents and political concessions from Washington. Neither obliged, authorities say. The journalist's father praised the U.S. government and other nations who helped procure freedom for his son. He wished the same outcome for dozens of others held captive in Syria and elsewhere. 'It's just a very chaotic situation over there. There's no clear lines of authority. There are no clear people in charge. It's unclear what's going on. That's what is so awful about the last two years,' he said.","Father of freed journalist Theo Padnos, Michael Padnos, said his son deserves praise for risking his life to tell a story .

The Australian housing market is  between 20 to 30 percent overvalued, leaving Australia open to an international economic shock, warns a leading senior Australian economic expert. The overvaluation of the property market is fuelled by policies that make getting large home loans too easy, leading Australian economist Jeremy Lawson said. Mr Lawson is the global chief economist of British fund manager Standard Life and a former senior economist at the Reserve Bank of Australia and the OECD and adviser to former prime minister, Kevin Rudd. 'Overall financial conditions have probably been too loose and that has undermined longer-run financial stability,' he said in an interview with the Australian Financial Review. He stated that the boom in the property market is the result of increased money supply through easy monetary policy and a reluctance of institutions to implement macro-prudential tools, which aim to mitigate risk for the financial system as a whole, which was broadly considered necessary in the wake of the global financial crisis. Daily Mail Australia reported on Friday that there are now 417 suburbs in Australia with an average price of more than $1 million, a rise of 33 per cent in just one year. Mr Lawson also said there had been too much of a focus on credit growth, as the RBA has repeatedly stated increases of over six percent per year is not a matter of concern. Instead he said the RBA should focus on the ratio of household debt-to-income, which has increased to over 150 percent, which is just slightly lower than just before the 2007 financial crisis.

The house still clearly maintains elements of its former purpose with its bright engine red garage door and the interior original-style exposed brick walls . The 370 sq metre plot also has a huge well-lit, private courtyard for entertaining . 'A high debt-to-income ratio leaves households much more vulnerable to income and interest rate shocks,' he said. Mr Lawson warned that the Australian economy was too closely connected to Chinese trade and if China were to experience a sharp downturn, the Australian economy would suffer substantially. 'The painful choices governments will need to make at that time will make the ruckus over the May budget look like a minor skirmish,' he said. He also warned that while Australian debt metrics were good, Australia's structural fiscal position has deteriorated significantly over the last ten years and meaning Australia is 'very vulnerable to the next big global shock,' which he said could come about due to the breakdown of the relationship between the West and Russia.

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . How very typical of Mario Balotelli. Rather than taking a moment to settle into his new surrounds and provide a few anodyne words, Liverpool’s latest signing had to make a statement. First came Balotelli’s tweet ‘YNWA! COME ON LIVERPOOL!’ that he published at 4.58pm, two minutes before his new employers had planned to formally announce his acquisition, but then, more significantly, came his message to Liverpool’s official website. Balotelli would not be described as someone who regularly courts the media. He barely gave an interview during his first spell in the Barclays Premier League with Manchester City, and was hardly a frequent orator when he returned to Milan. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mario Balotelli: I see expectation from Liverpool fans . Done deal: Liverpool completed the £16million signing of frontman Mario Balotelli from AC Milan on Monday . 1 - Balotelli has made only one assist in the Premier League - but what an assist! The frontman set up Sergio Aguero’s goal that won City the title in 2012. But here was a glimpse of his ambitions. Having been given a hero’s welcome when he arrived at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground - he was besieged again on Monday, as he was on Friday night and Saturday afternoon - the 24-year-old revealed his desire to win the ultimate prize. ‘I always start a competition wanting to win it,’ said Balotelli. ‘I want to win another Champions League for sure, because the Champions League (he won with Inter Milan in 2010) wasn’t all mine, I was in a team. I want to take this team to the Champions League. ‘I’m happy to be back because I left England and it was a mistake. I wanted to go to Italy but I realised it was a mistake. English football is generally better. English football is beautiful. Liverpool are one of the best teams here. The football is very good. It’s a great team with young players, and that’s why I came here. I’m very happy. We’ve been talking about coming here and I’m happy to be here.’ Signed, sealed, delivered: The Italy international looks serious as he puts pen to paper on his Liverpool deal . Ready for business: Balotelli will be expected to fill the void left in Liverpool's attack by Luis Suarez's exit . Put through his paces: The former Manchester City attacker trained at Melwood for the first time on Monday . If Balotelli is going to be remembered for his achievements at a premier football club, rather than as maverick with a knack of attracting unnecessary headlines, this is his last opportunity to make his mark. His agent, Mino Raiola, said as much on Saturday when Balotelli was completing his medical and his new manager Brendan Rodgers made that clear to him when they met, as well as to Sky’s cameras before Monday night’s game at the Etihad. Perhaps, though, that quote about wanting to win the Champions League is a sign that beneath the stories of fireworks in bathrooms and the urban tales of coming out of casinos to hand money to tramps, there is a footballer who is ambitious and hungry. Balotelli has a C.V. that would be the envy of most - as well as a Champions League, he has won titles in Italy and England, plus an FA Cup - and it could be that he has finally found the right place to realise his ambitions. As he travelled to Manchester in a club people-carrier on Monday night, with five of his new team-mates including Adam Lallana and Jon Flanagan, it would not have taken him long to realise he has joined a hard-working group committed to sustained improvement. Settling in: Balotelli posted a picture of him travelling to The Etihad with Jon Flanagan and Adam Lallana . Familiar territory: Balotelli watches Liverpool's 3-1 defeat to Manchester City alongside Adam Lallana . Successful: As well as the Premier League title, Balotelli has also won the Champions League and Serie A . ‘When I first played three or four games with Inter Milan, when I was young, I had No 45 because the numbers for young players were from Nos 36 to 50. I took No 45 because I was joking that four plus five is nine - and I scored in all four games. It brings me luck and that’s why I’ve always kept No 45.’ He watched the game from the directors’ box after being introduced to those players who had been selected for the crucial fixture and then travelled back with them on the team coach, to begin preparing for what could be his debut at Spurs on Sunday. Whether he will be unveiled to the media before then has yet to be decided, but Balotelli has the charisma and personality to be a Liverpool player. The question remains as to whether he has the application to fit into the group Rodgers has built. ‘I didn’t expect (to get such a warm reception) because I’ve always been playing against Liverpool,’ said Balotelli, referring to the scenes outside Melwood. ‘Whenever I played against Liverpool, the fans weren’t nice with me but that’s normal - it’s football! ‘Now that I play for Liverpool, I can see the expectation in people. They’re very happy and that makes me very happy. When I meet the team, start training and start my first game, I will realise (that I have signed for Liverpool).’ And when he walks around Melwood and sees the fifth European Cup Liverpool won in Istanbul nine years ago, he will appreciate he has a platform to realise his lofty ambitions.","Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers jokes Mario Balotelli will bring 'trouble' to the Merseyside club .

But Wenger insisted: ‘You’re never too good for Arsenal and Steven Gerrard knows that but I can understand completely that he asked him to stay because he wanted him [Suarez] to play with him and have a chance to win the Premier League.

Manchester United are also interested in signing Vermaelen, who is attracting other European clubs, but Sportsmail understands Arsenal prefer to sell their captain abroad. Vermaelen knows his playing time will be limited next season with Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker established as Wenger’s first- choice central defensive pairing and the manager said: ‘If he goes we have to replace him because he’s an important player in our squad. I expect him to stay but he, of course, did not play enough games last year. For me he’s a very important player but I couldn’t guarantee him the games he wanted last year.’ Wenger, who says he also wants to kept Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell despite interest from AC Milan, has backed Alexis Sanchez to emerge from Lionel Messi’s shadow to become Arsenal’s main man.

And then at Barcelona it was a bit more difficult,’ said Wenger. ‘But it’s like you could see with Neymar at Barcelona, because there you have Messi. You see Neymar with Brazil and Neymar with Barcelona and it’s not the same. ‘I like the fact he can play left, right, up front and that’s why I went for him. But I took him because he is a player who has the qualities of Walcott, he goes behind the defenders off the ball. ‘And with the quality of his runs he can be very important for us. Will he give us an extra dimension? Yes, I think so, and I hope I’m right.’ Dream move: Suarez sealed a move to Barcelona earlier this month after Liverpool decided to cash in . David Ospina will miss the Emirates Cup this weekend with a thigh injury but Calum Chambers is set to make his debut. He is one of seven high-profile exits from Southampton this summerand Wenger reckons the Saints would be a major European force had they not sold their top talent. ‘I respect first of all the quality of work they have done because you look at Southampton and you think the team they had last year, plus Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain, plus Gareth Bale who came out from there. They could have won the European Cup had they managed to keep everybody together. ‘But unfortunately the modern game has changed and the smaller clubs with less potential are not in a position any more to keep their players.’","Steven Gerrard said he told Luis Suarez he was too good for Arsenal .

When Ranieri was given his marching orders by Roman Abramovich in 2004, he still had three years on a deal at Stamford Bridge which should have earned £2m-a-year in salary payments. He stood accused of over-rotating his squad, and picked up the nickname of the ‘Tinkerman’, but his period in charge saw Chelsea finish second in the Premier League and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League. It was not enough for Abramovich, who was ready to pay handsomely to get rid of Ranieri for what he considered failure. But Chelsea’s scheduled compensation bill was drastically cut to around £1m when their former boss walked into a new job replacing Liverpool-bound Rafa Benitez at Valencia. Within eight months of taking charge of the Spanish champions, he was on the look out for a new job yet again and about to bank another hefty bonus for winning nothing. The decision to axe Ranieri, taken at a panicked board meeting following the club's shock elimination from the UEFA Cup by Steaua Bucharest, was a costly one. He walked away with a cheque believed to be worth more than £4m, which allowed the luxury of two years off before taking his next job.

Decent showing in Brazil: Greece celebrate after beating the Ivory Coast in group stage match . His self-imposed period in the wilderness ended with his return to management at Parma, who, against the odds, he led to Serie A safety at the end of the 2006-07 season. After being at the club less than five months, though, he resigned to take over one of the biggest jobs in world football at Juventus. His first season in charge was relatively successful, guiding them to third place a year after they had been rocked by the Italian match-fixing scandal. But his second campaign was dire, leading to his dismissal after an emergency board meeting despite having a year to run on his original three-year contract. Handshake: Ranieri (left) replaced Rafael Benitez at Valencia following his sacking from Chelsea . Axed: Ranieri was sacked by Valencia after being eliminated from the UEFA Cup, receiving £4m compensation . Ranieri was due to receive his final year’s salary in one lump sum because a clause in the contract covered such an eventuality. When his legal team threatened court action in a bid to force Juve to stump up the cash, the two parties agreed a cut-price compromise deal which saw him grab around £1m. By the start of the following season, Ranieri had switched allegiances - and paymasters - to Roma. A familiar pattern emerged; a bright start and a disappointing finish. His resignation by mutual consent followed after a string of miserable results in February 2011. Remarkably, despite his average record as far as silverware is concerned, Ranieri is never short of offers from the biggest clubs when out of work. Internazionale were next to gamble on the man who invariably delivers so little yet costs so much. Short-lived: Ranieri (right) chats with Alessandro Del Piero (left) during his reign as Juventus manager . The parting of the ways was inevitable, but few could believe he was shown the door after just six months in charge. He had been under intense pressure after a run of just one win in 10 matches left the club languishing in eighth place in the league table and struggling for European qualification. Ranieri’s ill-feted reign came to an end in the aftermath of a painful 2-0 defeat against his former club Juventus, Inter’s ninth reverse of that season. Never down for long, Ranieri fancied a change of scenery and left his homeland in May 2012 to work among the yachts and millionaires of Monaco. He can argue a good case for success on the French riviera, leading the club to second in Ligue 1 and securing a Champions League spot after clinching promotion in his first season. But after failing to beat Paris St Germain to the championship, the decision was made to call him the proverbial taxi in May this year. The bill is believed to be around £3m.

Blackburn issued a statement on Saturday confirming that they had rejected two offers from Hull and that Rhodes was not for sale but Bowyer needs funds to strengthen his squad and may yet be forced to sacrifice the prolific striker.

Blackburn's director of communications Alan Myers said: 'We have recently received two official bids for the services of Jordan Rhodes from Hull City FC, both have been respectfully and categorically rejected. 'The owners of Blackburn Rovers wish to reassure fans that their intention is not to sell Jordan Rhodes as they, along with the manager and board of directors, feel that he is integral to our bid to gain promotion back to the Premier League.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Andy Murray is happy to have a rare early start to his US Open campaign. The 2012 champion plays his first-round match against Dutchman Robin Haase second on Louis Armstrong court on Monday. More often than not Murray has had to wait until Tuesday or Wednesday, and 12 months ago he did not begin the defence of his title until the third night session. Murray said: 'I have been here long enough to be used to the conditions and stuff now. Focused: Andy Murray is hoping to progress from the first round of the US Open on Monday . Competitor: Murray will take on Dutchman Robin Haase at the Louis Armstrong court on Monday . 'I think for some guys that are coming in late, playing on the Wednesday may help, but I have had enough time on the courts now to practice and prepare. So to get under way on Monday is good.' The 27-year-old has struggled all through 2014 to regain peak form and fitness following back surgery almost a year ago and is seeded only eighth at the year's final grand slam. Form remains a concern to his fans if not seemingly to the man himself, but fitness-wise Murray could scarcely be happier. The back pain that lingered through the first part of the season is in the past and the Scot had time after Wimbledon to put some serious work in at a training camp in Miami. Fully fit: Murray is happy with how his preparations at a training camp in Miami have gone . There have been encouraging signs over the last couple of weeks, with Murray reaching quarter-finals in both Toronto and Cincinnati. But he would have wanted to go further in both and had chances to do so, failing to capitalise on leads against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Roger Federer. That surely betrayed the lack of big match wins Murray has under his belt in 2014 - he has not beaten a top-10 player or reached a final since Wimbledon last year. He said: 'I have been playing well the last few weeks. I lost to guys who won the events, and had quite big opportunities in both those matches. I feel like I'm playing well. This week has been very good preparation. I'm happy.'

"By . Associated Press . The bound bodies of two people were found in a Philadelphia river on Wednesday, and a third man who said he managed to free himself was taken to a hospital for stab wounds, police said. The bodies were found in the Schuylkill River in Fairmount Park just before 4am today, Chief Inspector Scott Small said. Both of the dead bodies had duct tape wrapped around their face. They also both appeared to be bound, their wrists and ankles, according to the officer. Scroll down for video . Philadelphia police and other law enforcement officials view a body pulled from the Schuylkill River in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia today. The bound bodies of two people were found in the river on Wednesday, and a third man who said he managed to free himself is being treated at a hospital for stab wounds . Philadelphia police load a body pulled from the Schuylkill River in Fairmount Park into a vehicle. At the moment the only motive they have for the deaths is robbery . They also appeared to be tied or tethered to some piece of debris, some sort of weight used as an anchor to take them under water. Inspector Small said police were alerted to the presence of the bodies after finding a partially dressed 20-year-old man walking along the road with his wrists bound and duct tape around his face and ankles. 'He was wet, and he told us he managed to get out of the river,' Small said. He was taken to a hospital in stable condition with about nine stab wounds to his torso and both legs. Small said the surviving victim reported that he was thrown into the back of a van in another part of Philadelphia by four or five people, and the other two victims were already in the van. Small said it was unclear whether the other two were alive or dead at the time. The man said he was robbed and stabbed before all three were tossed into the river, but he was able to free himself and climb out of the river. Officers patrol the river which has been cordoned off by police after two bodies, tied down with weights were pulled out in the early hours of Wednesday . 'At this point, the only motive we have for the abduction and stabbing of our 20-year-old victim who's alive is robbery,' Small said. 'He claims when he was thrown in the back of the van and tied up and stabbed he was robbed of an undisclosed amount of money. He further states that the two other victims were already in the back of the van — he was not with the two other victims — so we don't know if the two other victims were related to the robbery.' Small said the other two victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and both remained unidentified. 'We're not even certain if they're males,' he said, adding that police did not begin recovering the bodies until after daylight to allow investigation of the scene. Small said he would not disclose the place where the surviving victim was abducted but police hoped to use surveillance video from that location to identify the van. Dive teams prepare to search the river. Police are trying to work out if the victims, who were bound and gagged with duct tape were dead before they were thrown into the river .","The bodies were found in the Schuylkill River in Fairmount Park at 4am .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Victim: Mary E. Whitaker, 61, was found killed at her home in rural New York last week after a robbery . A violinist who was found murdered in her garage last week was the victim of a random robbery by two homeless men who wanted to money 'to live like rock stars', police have said. Mary E. Whitaker, 61, was found with gunshot wounds to her chest and leg and a stab wound to the neck at her home in Westfield, New York last Wednesday. Authorities have now said they believe homeless drifters Jonathan Conklin, 43, and Charles Sanford, 30, randomly targeted Whitaker's rural home near Lake Erie. The pair met met in a homeless shelter in Erie, Pennsylvania several months ago and last week, Sanford told Conklin he was looking for a place to stay - and Conklin said he had a plan, according to the National Post. A friend drove them to Sherman, where they robbed an apartment of someone Conklin claimed owed him money. They stole shotguns and a .22-caliber rifle, the affidavit states. They then took off on foot and arrived at Whitaker's home. Authorities told Buffalo News they believed the violinist had been targeted at her isolated home where she lived alone. Her closest neighbors were a quarter of a mile away. Their intention was to rob the home because Conklin told Sanford he wanted to 'live like a rock star', authorities said. Sanford rang the buzzer around 7am and when the call went unanswered, he pounded on the door. When Whitaker opened the door, he asked to use the phone, saying he had run out of gas, and she handed hers over to him, police said. Scroll down for video . Suspects: Charles Sanford, 30, left, and Jonathan Conklin, 43, right, have been charged in the crime. The two homeless men are accused of robbing her home at random so they could 'live like rock stars' Conklin then jumped out and yelled, 'This is a robbery', police said. Whitaker screamed and Conklin fired, hitting her in the chest, Sanford told cops. She went to grab the gun and he shot again, hitting her in the leg. Sanford told police he then took her to the garage and Sanford ordered him to use a knife on her neck to kill her - but he said he couldn't get the blade to go deep enough. The men left her on the floor, took her credit cards and check book and fled, leaving her on the floor of the garage, authorities said. Her dead body was later found by two friends who had become concerned when they could not contact her. Crime scene: Police investigate at the home of Ms Whitaker in Westfield, New York. A friend found her dead in the garage with gunshot wounds to the chest and leg and stab wounds to her neck . Targeted: Investigators believe she was targeted because she lived alone in a rural home . The two men then fled in her car and drove to Erie, where a woman they knew pretended to be Whitaker so they could buy a flat-screen TV. But the men were arrested on Friday after they were seen using the credit cards at a convenience store. They are being held without bail in the Chautauqua County Jail in Mayville. Conklin and Sanford are facing in life in prison if convicted of murder along with additional charges of car-jacking and use of a firearm. Ms Whitaker, who also had a home in Manhattan, belonged to the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra for four decades where she was a second violinist. She would travel upstate to play with the renowned orchestra which draws musicians from around the country to play in its summer season. Loved: Ms Whitaker, pictured left with friends, was an accomplished violinist who lived in New York City but spent several months upstate during the summer at her isolated home . Marty Merkley, director of programming at Chautauqua Institution, told the Buffalo News that the violinist's death was a 'tragic situation' and that the orchestral community was 'devastated'. According to a friend on Slippedisc.com, Ms Whitaker graduated from Indiana University with a performance degree in violin and moved to New York City to begin her career. For 30 years, she has been a freelance musician who worked with orchestras including the New York City Opera Touring Company. She worked on Broadway show The Lion King and she also toured with Barbra Streisand during her 2006-07 North America and International Tour. Ms Whitaker is survived by her sister Martha, who lives in St Louis.","Mary Whitaker, 61, was found killed with a gunshot wound in the chest and stab wounds in her neck in the garage of her home in Westfield, New York .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Reverend Al Sharpton, who once tipped the scales at 305 pounds, regularly fat-shames friends and followers, calling them 'jumbo' and expressing his disgust at their eating habits, it has been claimed. The civil rights leader, who hosts MSNBC's 'Politics Nation', regularly derides people in sermons and conversations at his Harlem-based organization, the National Action Network, The Smoking Gun reported. The website cited examples between March and July. 'Since I lost weight, I talk about . fat folk real bad,' Sharpton, who has lost 167 pounds, reportedly said at a meeting for a fashion show . organized by his daughter, Ashley, in April. 'I like keeping fat folk . around me so I can just talk about them.' Half the man: Rev Al Sharpton, pictured left earlier this month and right in 1988, once weighed more than 300 pounds. He has now turned on other obese people to deride them for their weight, according to reports . He also mimicked some 'jumbo' women who were not asked to model in the show because of their sizes, saying: '""Why Ashley didn't have me model?"" 'Cause you too fat!' In another incident, 59-year-old Sharpton described his horror at seeing a woman eat half a fried chicken, two sides and a dessert at a soul-food restaurant in Harlem. She then 'had the nerve' to ask for Sweet'N Low in her drink. 'I couldn't take it anymore,' Sharpton said, TSG reported, 'and said ""Miss, lemme ask you something. All of that you took, what do you need . Sweet'N Low? I mean, you just make yourself feel better? You might as . well pour the whole bag of sugar in the cup"".' Heavier days: Sharpton is pictured in July 1992 - ten years before he shed nearly 170 pounds . Slimmer: Sharpton, pictured in 2004, lost 30 pounds during a hunger strike in 2001 and then became vegan . Sharpton, who TSG notes has easy access to multiple healthy options beneath his Manhattan building, also often tells followers that they should be skipping meals. 'A lot of y'all ain't doing nothing but . going to lunch,' he reportedly told protesters at a rally against Boko Haram outside the United Nations in May. 'And most of y'all don't need no lunch. Y'all need to . walk over to the UN and lose some weight anyhow.' And after seeing a once-slim high school friend who had piled on the pounds in March, he quipped: 'Every fine girl is two big Whoppers away from being obese', according to TSG. Svelte: Sharpton now weighs just 138 pounds and reportedly now ridicules 'jumbo' people . Scene: He reportedly tells his followers at the NAN headquarters in Harlem that they should be skipping lunch . The National Action Network and Rev. Sharpton have not yet responded to a request for comment. Sharpton, who once squeezed himself . into plus-sized tracksuits, lost 30 pounds during a prison hunger strike . in 2001 when he was locked up for protesting against the government . using Vieques Island in Puerto Rico for bombing exercises. But when he left, he said he wasn't able to keep that weight off so realized he needed more exercise and a better diet to slim down. He became vegan apart from eating fish twice a week and refused to eat after 6pm. He eventually dropped to 138 pounds, meaning he shed 167 pounds in total.","Al Sharpton once tipped the scales at 305 pounds but now weighs 138 pounds thanks to a mostly vegan diet and exercise .

"By . Associated Press . A soldier who barricaded herself in a building at a Virginia base and then fatally shot herself in the head has been named as a 33-year-old human resources specialist from New York, the Army said today. Fort Lee officials identified her as Sgt. 1st Class Paula M. Walker of Yonkers, New York, who served a tour in Afghanistan in 2008 and had been awarded commendation and good conduct medals. Walker was pronounced dead after being taken to Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center on Monday. Fort Lee officials identified the soldier who shot herself in the head as Sgt. 1st Class Paula M. Walker of Yonkers, New York . She had barricaded herself in an office on the third floor of the four-story building that houses the Army's Combined Arms Support Command and was throwing things around. About 1,100 people were inside, but no one else was hurt. Her gun was not a service weapon, officials said. Walker had been in the Army for nearly 14 years and at Fort Lee since December 2011. Maj. Gen. Stephen R. Lyons, who took over as commanding general of the support command last week, has said he did not know whether she was being treated for any mental health issues and could not speculate whether drugs or alcohol might have been a factor. Prior to coming to Fort Lee, the Army said Walker served at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, starting in 2010 and was at Fort Eustis, Virginia, beginning in 2006. Her career included a 15-month combat tour in Iraq from 2007 to 2008. Lyons has described Walker as upset and enraged but said he couldn't say whether that was consistent with her personality. The Army says her awards and decorations include three Army Commendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, one Joint Meritorious Unit Award and four Army Good Conduct Medals. Army Major General Stephen Lyons, pictured on Monday, said that he did not know if Sgt Walker was being treated for any mental health issues and could not speculate whether drugs or alcohol might have been a factor . Fort Lee police responded within two minutes of being alerted to the shooting. An alarm was sounded across the post and those in the building either took shelter inside or evacuated as directed, officials said. Army officials initially labeled Monday's incident an 'active shooter' situation. The Department of Homeland Security uses the term to describe someone actively trying to kill people, usually in populated areas, with no pattern of choosing victims. The heavily trafficked Fort Lee reopened and normal operations resumed within an hour of the morning shooting. The daily population at Fort Lee - 25 miles south of Richmond and 130 miles from Washington - is about 34,000, with members from all branches, their families, civilians and contractors. The shooting is the fourth violent act at a Virginia military installation this year. In March, a civilian truck driver shot and killed a sailor aboard a Navy destroyer at Naval Station Norfolk before he was shot and killed by Navy security. In June, authorities said, a sailor repeatedly stabbed another near Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. The same installation was placed on lockdown in April when a sailor shot and killed himself inside a barracks there.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association Sport . CLICK HERE to read the full story of Lewis Hamilton's clash with Nico Rosberg as Daniel Ricciardo wins in Belgium . Nico Rosberg has admitted for the first time to 'regret' over his Spa shame with Lewis Hamilton, but is still refusing to apologise. It is now all-out war at Mercedes between Hamilton and Rosberg in the wake of Sunday's highly-controversial Belgian Grand Prix. Hamilton's race was wrecked by a lap-two puncture sustained after the front right-wing endplate of Rosberg's car hit his left-rear tyre, resulting in a puncture.

Winging it: A piece of Hamilton's wing soars over German Rosberg's Mercedes after the high-speed collision . From the get go: Hamilton got off to the perfect start, overtaking pole position holder Rosberg at the beginning . Hamilton, visibly upset after the incident with Rosberg claimed the German admitted he did it 'to prove a point'. ‘I was gobsmacked. He (Rosberg) basically said he did it on purpose. He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault. 'And you don't have to just rely on me. Go and ask Toto, Paddy and all those guys who are not happy with him as well.' The Briton was eventually forced to retire late on in the race due to the damage sustained to his car from a long return to the pits, whilst Rosberg went on to claim second place behind Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Hamilton later claimed the German said his actions were intentional in a heated post-race meeting between himself, Rosberg, motorsport boss Toto Wolff, executive technical director Paddy Lowe and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda. Rosberg has not said as such publicly, and via his Facebook page continued to suggest what unfolded was 'a racing incident'. 'That was a tough race,' said Rosberg. 'We had the pace to win, but the incident cost us a top result, so I'm really disappointed because for the team it was a bad day.

'As drivers we are here to entertain and show the fans a good time, so our duels are always on the limit. 'I regret that Lewis and myself touched, but I see it as a racing incident - just as the stewards did. 'I was quicker down the straight and went to the outside as the inside line was blocked. 'I gave it a go, and after we touched I realised my front wing was damaged and thought that was it. 'In the next second I saw Lewis also had a problem, which was very unfortunate for him and for the team. 'We sat down quickly after the race, but there will be some more meetings to be held in order to avoid races like this.' The reaction at the circuit resulted in Rosberg being booed on the podium on four separate occasions, whilst the reaction on Facebook to his own comments were mixed. Whilst many fans naturally expressed support, there was an equal number - many simply F1 followers and not those who support Hamilton - who called him 'a cheat'. Ripped: Hamilton limps into the pits with a torn-up rear-left tyre after the incident on Sunday in Belgium . Change: Rosberg didn't escape damage and had to have his right front-wing endplate replaced in the pits . Rosberg's lack of an apology comes after Hamilton, visibly emotional after speaking to his German counterpart about the incident, claimed: ‘I was gobsmacked. He (Nico) basically said he did it on purpose. He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault. 'And you don't have to just rely on me. Go and ask Toto, Paddy and all those guys who are not happy with him as well.' Hamilton earlier admitted the incident would seriously damage his title chances. 'I don't know why he hit me but I'm sure he'll leave here happy,' Hamilton added. 'It's really gutting. I was trying so hard in the car to do what I could with it but it was so damaged, I must have lost 50-60 points of downforce. I'm gutted for the team, we've had such a difficult time this year. We had a good start, it was looking positive. 'I took the corner as I usually do, it was my line and... I don't know why he hit me but I'm sure he'll leave here happy.' Upset: Hamilton was visibly shaken after a meeting with Rosberg, who is claimed to have admitted guilt . April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second. May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . One in six travellers suffers a mobile phone bill shock after using their handsets abroad. Consumer champion Which? warns today that mobile networks are cashing in on the fact many travellers are in the dark about the cost of using handsets on holiday. A new cap on call costs comes into effect at midnight tonight that will offer some respite for British families travelling to other EU states. Cheaper: It will be less expensive to use a mobile abroad from midnight on July 1 (File photo) However, the reduction in charges will only apply to EU states, which means travellers to other popular destinations such as Turkey, the US, Australia and the Far East will continue to suffer punishing bills. The Which? research found that many people did not understand that caps on mobile phone charges only apply when travelling within the EU. A spokesman said: ‘We found one in six people who have taken their mobile on holiday abroad in the past year have been shocked by a high mobile phone bill, of these one in four were charged more than £40 over their usual monthly usage. ‘Worryingly nearly half – 45per cent - of mobile users who have been abroad in the last 12 months said they didn’t know that the price caps don’t apply to the whole of Europe, with 48 per cent believing that they do.’ A Which? spokesman said: 'We found  one in four were charged more than £40 over their usual monthly usage' The new cap on what are called roaming charges come into effect on July 1. These put a limit of 19¢ plus VAT a minute on the cost of outgoing calls, which equates to a total of 18.24p a minute, including VAT, for British consumers. The cost of sending a text is capped at 6¢ plus VAT, which equates to 5.76p for UK families. The figure is 20¢ plus VAT – or a total of 19.2p – for one MB download of data. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘Capping EU mobile roaming charges is welcome news for millions of travellers, especially those who have faced expensive charges for data roaming when their mobile hasn’t even left their suitcase. ‘Consumers travelling within the EU should now be much clearer on the charges they have to pay.’","New cap on charging introduced at midnight but only for travel within EU .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Aldi has cleaned up in the washing-up wars after new research found its own brand washing-up liquid performs better than its competitors and it is more than half the price of its nearest rival. The latest Which? washing-up liquid tests reveal Aldi as the winner for the first time just pipping Fairy Platinum to the prize. And a pound's worth can wash a staggering 14,873 plates compared to Fairy Platinum's 5,069. Aldi's budget washing-up liquid has topped the poll according to a value for money test by Which? Researchers put 13 washing-up liquids from supermarkets and major brands up to the test, ranging from Tesco Lemon washing-up liquid to Persil Lemon Burst. The products were tested on a number of factors including fat removal, foam duration, plates washed per £1, and plates washed per 100ml. Researchers tested the washing-up liquid's fat removal quality by pouring 1.2kg of animal fat on to 742 plates and counting how many are cleaned until the fat starts being re-deposited on the plates. The foam duration measures how long the foam lasts before it looks like you have to change the water, and how good the product is at cleaning less intensive grime. The final score was calculated by adding the results from the fat removal and foam duration tests and coming up with a percentage score. Fairy Liquid was able to wash 5,000 plates for every £1 worth of the product according to researchers . The final scores ignored the price of the product, and concentrated on the performance tests. Aldi Magnum Premium washing-up liquid topped the charts with a final score of 89 per cent, one per cent higher than the score Fairy Platinum Original received. Researchers found that the Aldi washing up liquid cost 79p, and washed 14,873 plates per £1 of the product, and washed 2,350 plates per 100ml. Whereas, Fairy Platinum Original costs £1.70, and washes just 5,069 plates per £1 and 2,250 plates per 100 ml of the product. A Which? spokesman said: 'We first tested washing up liquid in 1959 and this year we've put 13 washing- up liquids from supermarkets and major brands to the test and found Aldi's Magnum Premium washing-up liquid performed the best, with a score of 89 per cent. 'It was also great value for money at 79p for 500ml. 'Fairy Platinum was a close second, with a score of 88 per cent, but was more expensive at £1.70 for 383ml. 'Aldi and Fairy washed a similar numbers of greasy plates per 100ml, but Aldi's Magnum Premium washed nearly three times as many plates per £1 spent. 'Tesco's Expert Lemon washing-up liquid was the worst performing with a score of 37 per cent and only washes 1,200 plates per 100ml. 'Aldi's Magnum Premium, in comparison, washes 2,350 plates per 100ml. Which? editor, Richard Headland, said: 'We first tested washing up liquid 55 years ago, but the past few years seem to have been the most competitive with supermarket own labels giving the major brands a run for their money.'","Housewives can wash more than 14,800 plates with £1 of Aldi's liquid .

'We do have some outbreaks of rain currently pushing into the South West of the country,' he said. 'While these are sporadic at the moment we are expecting wet and windy conditions overnight and into tomorrow.' 'We do have a Yellow 'be aware' Warning in place for most of England and Wales,' he said, which is due to an area of low pressure pushing in from the west. He said the warning should especially be heeded by anyone hoping to make day trips on the Bank Holiday, since 'this is going to lead to some unpleasant travelling conditions.' He added: 'It's going to be for much of England and Wales quite an unpleasant Bank Holiday. However, if you're in Scotland, whilst it's not a Bank Holiday, things are going to be much nicer. It's not going to be warm, but it's going to be a lot clearer.' In the medium term, according to Mr Waite, the heavy train would 'sink away' but there would still be lingering showers on Tuesday. On Wednesday many parts would start dry, but cloudy. 'But we are expecting the rain to come back on Thursday and it's going to stay a little unsettled towards the end of the month.' Netweather forecaster Nick Finnis said: 'A change is looming for the new week, as Atlantic low pressure systems queue up to bring rather wet and windy weather at times, particularly across England, Wales and Ireland [on Monday] and Tuesday and across most of the UK later in the week. 'A cloudy start to what will be a generally cloudy Bank Holiday Monday across England and Wales, with occasional outbreaks of rain spreading northeast reaching most parts during the morning. 'The rain turning heavy and persistent at times across Wales and southern England - where we could see as much as 30-40mm [1.5ins] fall by the end of the day.

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Susan Neill-Fraser is behind bars for a crime she and her family adamantly claim she didn't commit. But now legal experts have thrown their support behind the innocence plea, saying that her murder conviction of killing partner Bob Chappell on Australia Day in 2009 is 'a serious miscarriage of justice'. They even went as far as saying the case is the 'worst injustices in Australian history'. The grandmother and mother-of-two is currently serving a 23-year jail sentence for the murder of the Hobart man whilst aboard his yacht - the 'Four Winds' - on Tasmania's Derwent River. Scroll down for video . Susan Neill-Fraser with her partner Bob Chappell, daughters Sarah Bowles and Emma Fraser-Meeker . Neill-Fraser was convicted for the murder of her partner Bob Chappell on Australia Day in 2009 . Neill-Fraser was jailed for murdering Mr Chappell - her partner of 18 years - on the Australia Day weekend five years ago and has since been held at Risdon Women's Prison in Tasmania. The day before the murder, the couple had spent the day together on the yacht when Mr Chappell decided he would stay aboard overnight while his partner returned home on a dinghy. The morning after, the yacht was discovered half-submerged and Mr Chappell was missing - presumed dead. Although his body was never found, the prosecutor told the court that Neill-Fraser attacked Mr Chappell and dumped his body in the River Derwent. While Neill-Fraser has lost two attempts to overturn the conviction, she and her family maintain her innocence. And so do the legal experts, reported 60 Minutes. They likened the accusations of Neill-Fraser to Lindy Chamberlain's murder conviction of her baby. The day after Australia Day, 2009, Mr Chappell's yacht was discovered half-submerged and he was missing, presumed dead . The day before the murder, the couple had spent the day together on the yacht when Mr Chappell decided he would stay overnight aboard the yacht while his partner returned home on a dinghy . Dr Robert Moles ranked the Neill-Fraser case to be the worst injustices in Australian history. Daughter Sarah Bowles, who continues the fight to free her mother, says her faith in the Australian justice system has shattered . 'The fact of the matter is, the case was carefully tailored to fit a particular outcome and the preferred scenario,' he said on the program which aired on Sunday night. 'It didn't take into account all the other factors.' They include the mystery DNA of then homeless 16-year-old Meaghan Vass found on the deck of Four Winds. She denied ever being on the yacht and the prosecution said that her DNA was on board due to 'secondary transfer'. But this was rejected by the Victorian Police Forensic Office, which stated in a report that 'there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the DNA detected was the result of a secondary transfer'. Dr Moles believes this is enough to warrant a retrial. 'You don't have to establish that Sue Neill-Fraser is innocent, you don't have to establish that Meaghan Vass is guilty of anything,' he said. 'You just have to show that the case put to the jury was incorrect and that would be in itself sufficient to warrant a retrial.' Another homeless person, this time a man with a criminal history, was allegedly near the yacht at the time of incident. The mother and grandmother maintains her innocence as she serves a 23-year jail sentence in Tasmania . But Paul Row was only interviewed by police three years after Mr Chappell's disappearance and a year after Neill-Fraser's conviction. Soon after the questioning, Mr Row left Tasmania. Another one of the prosecution's claims was criticised by lawyer and former police officer Barbara Etter. While the court was told that a Four Winds dinghy had been covered with Mr Chappell's blood, Ms Etter said an independent expert had verified there had been 'none' of his blood in the boat. Ms Etter believes the murder case wasn't thoroughly investigated. 'We're seeing the same error that was made in Lindy Chamberlain over 30 years ago,' she said. Yet new evidence is not admissible on appeal in Tasmania, like most of Australia. Daughter Sarah Bowles said her faith in the Australian justice system has been shattered. But she continues the fight to free her mother with hope that justice will finally be served.","Susan Neill-Fraser was convicted for the murder of her partner Bob Chappell on Australia Day in 2009 .

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . Fascinating images have emerged from an Australian Aboriginal tribe's annual pilgrimage to their sacred sites along Queensland's western deserts. Melbourne photographer Brook Mitchell documented the spiritual event of the Marrinyama men who embark on the journey each year as a way of keeping their local traditions and lore alive. The men spend three months of their summer at bush camps near the desert outpost town of Cloncurry in Queensland's north-west, where  temperatures average in the high 40Cs. They're also known as the 'Kangaroo Society' for the self-inflicted ceremonial marks cut into the arms of the men with sharp rock fragments to resemble the scratch from a kangaroo. Mitchell said he was invited to follow the group led by Lance Sullivan, born Tjupurrula Maarij Tjarra and now elder of the Yalarrnga Nation, perform rituals such as the kangaroo and emu dances to wake up their ancestors. 'It was a powerful experience,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The society's desert rituals are equal parts age old tradition and self renewal, with the men all looking to their past for the strength to act as positive role models amongst troubled communities. 'As Lance asserted: ""without our past we have no future, without our culture we have nothing"".' Mitchell said the men were strikingly dressed in their feathered headdresses - known as dhoeri - while they also mixed blood with the red earth to create paint for the caves at 'Majumba Ndia', also known as Kangaroo dreaming. 'The paintings were retouched and added to with paint made from a mixture of red ochre, water, blood and honey,' he said. Mitchell was amazed to witness how determined these men were to keep their culture alive, even if it means inflicting severe pain in the process.

"By . Becky Barrow for The Daily Mail . Switching from expensive supermarkets to cheap discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl has triggered the first annual drop in the amount of money spent in supermarket since records began 25 years ago. The Office for National Statistics said people are spending £36million a week less in supermarkets than they did last year. It said Britain’s supermarket price war had helped to cause the fall as they desperately battle to lure shoppers through their doors, rather than those of their rivals. A rise in the use of cheap discount stores such as Aldi instead of expensive supermarkets has triggered the first drop in the amount of money spent in supermarkets since records began 25 years ago . In July, the amount of money spent in supermarkets and other food shops fell by 1.3 per cent, compared to the same month last year. It is the first time since the ONS’s records began in January 1989 that the amount of money spent by Britons in supermarkets has ever fallen on a year-on-year basis. In its monthly report, it stated: ‘The fall in the amount spent in July suggests that prolonged discounting and price wars were having an effect on overall sales.’ Supermarket giants, such as Tesco, Morrisons and the Co-op, have revealed price-cutting moves in recent months in a bid to lure back shoppers who have switched to cheaper discount stores. For example, Morrisons has promised to cut off a total of £1billion from more than 1,200 items over the next three years. A packet of Jammie Dodgers has dropped from £1.09 to 49p and a 250g pack of the supermarket’s own-brand butter has fallen from £1.49 to £1, it said yesterday. Tim Denison, a director of the research group Ipsos Retail Performance, said: ‘Food retailers escaped the worst of the recession, in stark contrast to the non-food retailers, but are now feeling the heat as the economy recovers. ‘The years of austerity have left their footprint on shopping habits with the popularity of discounters growing. ‘The price war among the Big Four is really damaging them all and making it into a race to the bottom.’ The British Chambers of Commerce, the business lobby group, said the figures highlight ‘the strong competition among retailers.’ A report published by the Bank of England on Wednesday said it had also noticed the ‘intense competition among retailers, especially in food’. The Bank of England this week reported increased competition among retailers, 'especially in food' It also said there is ‘an increasing polarisation’ among food shoppers towards either the ‘premium’ end or the ‘value’ end, with many shoppers using a mix of both. For example, they might buy all their meat in an expensive supermarket which sells good quality meat, but buy everything else form tinned tomatoes to bags of apples in a discount shop. Cheaper trips to the supermarket represent a huge relief for families at a time when workers have faced six years of pay freezes or paltry pay rises. Some have even been hit by pay cuts. The average pay rise in the private sector is just two per cent, above the current rate of inflation of 1.6 per cent according to a report published today [fri] by the pay research firm XpertHR. But some workers are still being hit by a pay freeze, with seven per cent of pay deals resulting in a pay freeze. Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, the accountancy firm, said: ‘Many consumers are yet to feel the benefits of the economic recovery and are reluctant to let go of their recessionary behaviours, particularly when shopping for food.’","Switch from supermarkets to discount chains triggers annual spending drop .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia . A Muslim community spokesman has received more chilling threats, this time from a Twitter account linked to Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar, who is thought to be currently waging jihad in Syria and recently posed with two decapitated heads. Keysar Trad, who heads the Islamic Friendship Association, was warned in the message about him having contacted the Australian Federal Police. The person who sent him the post also said they knew where Mr Trad lived. Scroll down for video . Target of threats: Prominent Muslim community spokesman Keysar Trad revealed that he had received a series of chilling threats. Mr Trad often speaks for the Islamic community in front of the media. Jihadist Mohamed Elomar in one of many graphic images posted on social media recently. Mohamed Elomar's comrade Khaled Sharrouf with his children in front of an ISIS flag. 'Didn't you know I already have your full details,' started the disturbing message Mr Trad received five days after he had reported an earlier threat to the Australian Federal Police. 'Why would you put urself and family at risk calling AFP u Apostate. 'Wrong move.' Earlier, Mr Trad had received a threat which read: 'Don't u know the penalty for the muslim who aids thr kuffar (infidels) against his muslim brothers, stop hindering men from Allah's path.' The account also suggested Mr Trad had two wives, which he does not, and insisted he stop assisting the 'kuffar'. The AFP was approached for comment. Mr Trad told Daily Mail Australia 'email threats' would not deter him from speaking up about his religion. Mr Trad, who used to work for Sheikh Taj el-Din al-Hilali, has urged Muslims not to go to Syria to fight at his regular Friday sermons at the mosque in Sydney. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who discussed his new terror laws with Mr Trad this week, told reporters on Thursday that ISIS beheadings like that of American journalist James Foley could happen here in Australia. The chilling message tweeted to Keysar Trad from an account linked to Mohamed Elomar . This week Mr Abbott (right) spruiked his government's proposed new terror laws to prominent members of the Islamic community including Mr Trad (left). Latest horror: Propaganda images emerged yesterday of American journalist James Foley being brutally executed by a jihadist with an East London accent. Another journalist, reporter Steven Joel Sotloff, is also in the hands of ISIS. After the release of a horrific video featuring the murder of an American journalist, Mr Abbott said countries like Australia must remain vigilant to the threat of terrorism. 'It just goes to show that this is not just something that happens elsewhere,' Mr Abbott said. 'It could happen in countries like Australia if we relax our vigilance against terrorism and potential terrorism here on our shores.' Social media accounts linked to Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf posted disturbing pictures of beheaded bodies in late June and in early August. Sharrouf's seven-year-old son was also pictured gripping a decapitated head in the city of Raqqa, Syria. The abhorrent post made headlines around the world and was condemned by US Secretary of State John Kerry. Khaled Sharrouf's unidentified son was pictured lifting up a severed head earlier this month. Khaled Sharrouf: The militant walked out of Australia on his brother's passport in December 2013 in a major security bungle. An earlier image of Khaled Sharrouf, who is currently believed to be fighting in the Middle East. Sharrouf, from south-western Sydney, famously slipped out of Australia on his brother's passport in December 2013 in what was considered a major security breach. His wife Tara Nettleton and their children also left the country at a later date. Mr Trad is not the only Australian community leader to receive threats from ISIS militants. Dr Jamal Rifi, an Islamic leader who has been critical of the actions of Elomar and Sharrouf, also received death threats from an Abu Hafs account last week after he publicly condemned their actions. That social media account was suspended immediately after Daily Mail Australia revealed the threat. You've probably seen him on TV or heard him on the radio. But the prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad has been the target of scathing criticism from outspoken commentators who say he doesn't really represent the Muslim community. Critics including News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt point out the Islamic Friendship Association he appears in the media as a spokesman for only has 12 members. In Thursday's Daily Telegraph newspaper, News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt questioned Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to invite Mr Trad to a meeting with Islamic leaders this week. Not fans: Andrew Bolt and Senator Cory Bernardi have raised a number of questions about Mr Trad . To that claim, Mr Trad said the IFA is a think tank that works with 'other community groups'. He said he spends much of his time volunteering with the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, an umbrella organisation of the country's Islamic groups as an executive board member. Mr Trad said he chooses to speak out because few Muslims wanted to talk with the media.  'I'm already out there on the front line. I'm already a big target, I've got the scars to prove it.' South Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi, one of Mr Trad's most vocal critics, branded him an 'apologist' for Islamic extremists. Mr Bernardi told Daily Mail Australia: 'Many of Mr Trad's views are not compatible with the values and social mores that have built our nation and that underpin Western civilisation...' 'As I am an optimist by nature I choose to believe that someone of Mr Trad's character and history is not representative of Australian Muslims. 'If he is we should all be very concerned.' Mr Trad fired back: 'This is a man who lives with a lot of fear in his life. 'All he has to do is give me a call I'll take him to have a coffee. 'He can scan me for any accessories. I won't even bring a pen so he wont feel afraid.' Mr Trad said he lives on an 'austere wage' but is not on a pension. The last major project he was paid for was his book of love poetry, Forays of the Heart, released in October 2013. 'A heart in love, But a heart in pain, Chirps like a dove, Does itself disdain': The book of love poetry released by the Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott is reportedly considering sending Royal Australia Air Force aircraft to join the US in carrying out air strikes against the Islamic State. The US has stepped up its strikes against Islamic militants in northern Iraq this month, and is considering extending air strikes to Syria.

US warplanes have hit a wide range of Islamic State militant targets, including artillery, armoured personnel carriers, armoured Humvees, light trucks, mortar positions, checkpoints and roadside bomb emplacements. There's potential for the air campaign to expand into Syria, in which case the US would have to call on aircraft and other elements of its military based in the Middle East and possibly Europe. Australia could also join the US's air campaign, as well as extend its military role in Iraq more generally, as was laid out in Mr Abbott's foreign policy speech at Adelaide University last week, The Australian reported. 'We will do what we reasonably and prudently can to encourage American leadership because that leadership provided global security and stability,' the Prime Minister said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, pictured on Friday, is reportedly considering sending Royal Australia Air Force aircraft to join the US in carrying out air strikes against the Islamic State . 'We are talking to our partners about how we might contribute to international efforts to protect people against the advances of the ISIS terrorists.' As the US began its airstrikes earlier this month, Mr Abbott said the Australian Government was looking at joining the US in 'humanitarian airdrops' over northern Iraq. 'This is a potential humanitarian disaster,' Mr Abbott said, in reference to the tens of thousands of people - mostly women and children - surrounded by Islamic State fighters threatening to kill them. Mr Abbott said RAAF aircraft is prepared to participate in humanitarian food drops in Iraq, and has two aircraft in the United Arab Emirates that could assist 'within days'. Previously, Australia has been unable to answer US calls for air strike assistance due to concerns about the self-defence capabilities of RAAF aircraft. But The Australian reports that the RAAF now have aircraft suitable for Iraq.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A star student has missed out on a full scholarship to Stanford because a computer glitch meant his high school failed to send his transcripts to the college. Lincoln To, a 17-year-old who graduated from Serra High School in San Mateo, California with a 4.67 GPA, had been named a finalist for a full QuestBridge scholarship to the university. But he was stunned when he received a letter saying he had not been considered because his application was incomplete. 'Considering the fact that I was rejected purely because [the school] made a mistake, that made me really upset,' To told San Diego 6, admitting that it was hard to return to class after the error. Let down: Lincoln To, 17, was devastated that a glitch in his school's system meant his transcripts had not been sent to be considered for a full scholarship. He is pictured at his high school graduation, right . 'I could be going to the top engineering school on the west coast. I could be having a great time at one of the best schools in the world.' The high school later confessed to the glitch, admitting that a technical error with a new system had caused a delay in the transcript. Staff wrote to the university to explain the situation, saying: 'Because Lincoln trusted our electronic system and it failed, Lincoln lost or missed out… It was out of Lincoln's control and he is a very deserving student of this scholarship.' The university would still not consider To. He has now started his freshman year at UCLA instead - on a full scholarship. Apologies: San Diego Unified School District spokerson Ursula Kroemer admitted they had made a mistake . Moving on: To has forgotten about Stanford, pictured, and has started at UCLA on a full scholarship instead . To and his family were so upset by the glitch that they filed a claim against San Diego County asking for $250,000 - the value of the scholarship - but the claim was denied. The San Diego Unified School District said they are working to overcome the problems with its student information software and transcript procedures after the system caused issues for several students. 'We have to do what's right by our students, and we made a mistake,' San Diego Unified School District spokesperson Ursula Kroemer told KGTV. Administrators wrote a blanket letter in February explaining that the district was having trouble with its system and asked colleges to show San Diego Unified students leniency for missed deadlines.

"He promised his Doctor will be ‘less user-friendly’ and a ‘little darker’. However yesterday, just hours after Peter Capaldi finally made his  debut as the 12th Doctor, many fans questioned whether the timelord was now too scary for their children to enjoy. As the 80-minute extended episode unfolded, fans took to Twitter to celebrate the show’s return, 51 years after the very first episode. Scroll down for video . Peter Capaldi finally made his  debut as the 12th Doctor. But many fans questioned whether the timelord was now too scary for their children to enjoy . But some revealed the season-opener, called ‘Deep Breath’ had left their children more than a little unnerved. A tweeter called Northsea_view said the show was ‘still scary’ and asked: ‘Shouldn’t it be on after the watershed? It disturbs children’, while  Andy Piper ‏complemented the ‘fantastic performances’ of Capaldi and co-star Jenna Coleman, who plays sidekick Clara Oswald, describing the show as ‘funny, scary and exciting’. Vaughan Anscombe tweeted ‘#drwho clock work robots still scary just ask my daughter. She’s behind the sofa’, while a user called babesaurus wrote: ‘I liked it but I think it’s too scary for children.  Anyone have thoughts?’ A peak of 7.3 million viewers - and an average 6.8million -  tuned in to the BBC1 show - which was also played simultaneously at 440 cinemas in Britain, with cities in America, Australia and New Zealand hosting simultaneous broadcasts. The episode achieved a 32.5 per cent share of the audience. Its nearest rival, Casualty achieved only 4.2 million but overnight figures are considered increasingly unreliable as many people now watch television on catch up services such as iPlayer. Capaldi and co star Jenna Coleman had travelled 35,000 on a global publicity tour ahead of the new series, visiting seven countries over 12 days and stopping in cities including New York, Seoul and Rio de Janeiro . Capaldi, perhaps best-known as a foul-mouthed spin doctor in The Thick Of It, spots different things about his new form, including his accent. Capaldi’s Doctor announces 'I am Scottish I have gone Scottish', which he says is good because 'I can complain about things'. ‘Deep Breath’ saw Capaldi’s hero investigate a string of gruesome murders in Victorian London. Capaldi and Coleman had travelled 35,000 on a global publicity tour ahead of the new series, visiting seven countries over 12 days and stopping in cities including New York, Seoul and Rio de Janeiro. Capaldi replaced Matt Smith, 31, in the title role.  At 56, he is also the oldest since the first, William Hartnell. Smith popped back for a small appearance in a telephone call to Clara and he asks her: 'Please tell me I didn’t get old - anything but old. I was young. Oh, is he grey?' Jim Shelley, reviewing the opening episode of the new series on Mailonline, said Capaldi had ‘quickly confirmed that he has the type of wily charisma that makes it a role he was born to play.’ A few weeks ago Capaldi said in an interview his Doctor will be 'less user-friendly' adding: 'I was keen he be a little darker. He’s struggling with himself and who he is.' A spokesman for the BBC said it was unable to produce data on any complaints the corporation may have received about the episode at the weekend.","Peter Capaldi has finally made his debut as the 12th Doctor Who .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A judge has shaved slices off the squabbling owners of a famous New York deli, claiming he couldn't care less about the couple who 'made millions of millions of dollars on the backs of dishwashers and cleaners and pastrami slicers' they allegedly underpaid. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper admonished Carnegie Deli owners Marian and Sandy Levine during their divorce proceedings Wednesday after Mrs Levine accused him of making light of pastrami puns at previous court dates. According to The New York Daily News, he retorted, saying he '(couldn't) care less about both of these people, in a sense' and slammed them for wasting the court's time. The Levines recently agreed to a $2.65 million settlement after they were accused of cheating workers out of wages for more than 10 years. Angry: Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper admonished Carnegie Deli owners Marian and Sandy Levine, pictured in happier times, during their divorce proceedings Wednesday . They are now divorcing after a 22-year marriage because Mr Levine allegedly had an affair with a former hostess at the deli. Cooper recently ordered Mrs Levine, who inherited the business from her father, Milton Parker, to pay over $11,000 in alimony to her retired husband. And on Wednesday he denied Marian Levine's motion to throw out this decision. According to the Daily News, she claims Mr Levine lied about his assets, stole shared money by forging her signature and purchased a $1 million home in Florida in his daughter's name to cut her out. Cooper said in court that Mrs Levine's lawyers had accused him of making light of a joke made by Mr Levine's lawyer who referred to one of Mrs Levine's claims about alleged missing funds as being 'all smoked meat and mirrors.' But Cooper said it was arrogant to suggest he spent that much time thinking about them. 'This is not a case where I lose sleep at night,' he said, according to the Daily News. Lawsuit: The Levines recently agreed to a $2.65 million settlement after they were accused of cheating workers out of wages for more than 10 years at their famous Carnegie Deli in Midtown, pictured . 'This is not some case where I have people with disabled children, where I have people who can't afford to make next month's rent.' However, Cooper later apologized if he did in fact offended anyone. Mr Levine left swiftly after the hearing while Mrs Levine sobbed in the courtroom, according to the newspaper, before telling waiting reporters she would like to tell her story at a later date. The Carnegie Deli, located at 854 7th Avenue adjacent to Carnagie Hall in Midtown, was opened in 1937 and is now in its third generation of owners. The Parker family's delicatessen is among the most visited restaurants of its type in the city, according to the New York Convention & Visitors Bureau, and is often dubbed the most famous deli in America. In April, a judge signed off on multi-million dollar settlement in a lawsuit filed by 25 current and former Carnegie Deli workers who said the owners had been cheating them out of wages for years.","Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Matthew Cooper chided Carnegie Deli owners Marian and Sandy Levine during divorce proceedings Wednesday .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . Prince Andrew has revealed he remained friends with Sarah Ferguson after their divorce 'more for family than anything else'. The royal spoke about the couple's split and continued friendship in a candid interview with US satellite TV channel CNBC. The couple married in 1986 but separated in 1992 and divorced four years later. But they have remained on good terms and have brought up their daughters, Princesses Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24, together. Scroll down for video . Prince Andrew has said he stayed friends with Sarah Ferguson (right) for 'the sake of family' in a  new interview . The couple, pictured at daughter Beatrice's graduation in 2011, have called themselves 'the world's happiest unmarried couple' In his latest interview, to be screened in the US this week, the 54-year-old said of their relationship: 'It's just part of life's rich tapestry if you have been married to somebody,' the Sunday Times reported. He added: 'I just see it as illogical not to be a friend at the end of the day, regardless of what your circumstances are.' The Duke and Duchess of York have made no secret of their amicability since their split and are said to describe themselves as 'the world's happiest unmarried couple'. The Duchess, 54, who still lives at the Duke of York's home in Windsor, even visited the Queen's estate in Balmoral, Scotland for a break earlier this summer. It is believed the Duke's TV interview is a bid to improve his image worldwide after his acquaintance with convicted American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The couple married in 1986 (left) but divorced a decade later - however they have since remained close friends . Andrew reportedly said of the scandal that he accepted he had to 'live with the rough and live with the smooth' in a 'free world, with freedom of speech'. He also used the interview to promote his iDEA scheme, which aims to improve young people's computer and digital skills to help them get a job. The technology-loving Duke is promoting the scheme with pop star Will.i.am and the pair are said to 'compare smartphones' when they meet up. But Will.i.am's phone caused embarrassment in a recent interview about the scheme, when it went off as the pair were answering questions on live TV. After the incident, the Prince told the Black Eyed Peas frontman: 'I leave my digital devices in the car when I am doing engagements - based on the fact that they might accidentally go off.' Talking about the scheme in his latest interview, Andrew said: 'I believe that the next generation are as capable and have greater opportunities than our generation ever had. 'So it's about making those possibilities more relevant and more alive to young people today.' The Duke used the interview to speak about a new scheme he is fronting with pop star Will.i.am (right), which helps young people gain skills in computing .","Royal couple divorced after decade of marriage in 1996 - but stayed friends .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A gang who stored drugs in the drains and toilets of a health supplements shop have been jailed for over 100 years. The group of 11 men used Anthony Donnelly's Protein Masters store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, as a front for their criminal enterprise. But the conspiracy was uncovered in July last year when a 10kg pack of amphetamine worth £227,000 was found in a van stopped by police near Doncaster. Jailed: The gang of 11 men were convicted after police found thousands of pounds worth of drugs, including ringleader Anthony Donnelly (left) jailed for 12 years and Ben Mullins (left) for 18 years and eight months . The drugs were linked to Protein Masters and a warrant was executed at the vacant shop a few weeks later. Officers from Nottinghamshire Police and the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) discovered over seven kilograms of a substance in residue form which contained amphetamine in buckets, drains and toilets. They also found a vacuum packing machine and mixing tools, similar to those used in the construction industry. Investigations led detectives to associates of Donnelly, 31, and Ben Mullins, 33, who were found with large quantities of drugs. Michael Lawrence, 25, was discovered with three kilograms of high purity cocaine worth an estimated £600,000 which was bought in Humberside. The scene: This is the toilet of Protein Masters store where the stash of drugs were found . And Andrew Brimble, 48, was caught with 67 kilograms of amphetamines worth about £1.3million as he drove through Pinxton in Derbyshire. The gang of 11 men, from Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Liverpool, Manchester and Yorkshire, either admitted or were convicted of a host of drugs related crimes. And ten of them were jailed for a total of 105 years at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday. Mullins, of Ripley, Derbyshire, admitted production and supply of amphetamines and selling cocaine and was jailed for 18 years and eight months. Ringleader Donnelly, of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply amphetamines and was handed a 12-year term. Sentencing the gang, Judge James Sampson said leader Donnelly was an arrogant, dishonest man whose word was worthless. He said the men 'were trading in pernicious drugs' that 'destroyed families and blighted lives'. Judge Sampson added: 'All of you in various ways and varying degrees were peddling misery in the towns and cities in this country.' Gang members Daniel Robinson, 30, of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, and Craig Donnelly, 23, of Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire, were jailed for 17 years each. They both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply amphetamine but were found guilty of conspiracy to produce amphetamine and conspiracy to supply cocaine after a trial. Michael Lawrence, of Stanton Hill, Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and cannabis with intent to supply and was jailed for nine years. And Richie Fido, 29, of Brinsley, Nottinghamshire, was jailed for five years and four months after he admitted conspiracy to produce amphetamine and conspiracy to supply amphetamine. Condemned: The judge told the men including Craig Donnelly (left) and Daniel Robinson (right) - both jailed for 17 years - they were trading drugs which 'destroyed families and blighted lives' Richie Fido (left) was jailed for four years and five months after admitting conspiracy to produce and supply amphetamine. Michael Lawrence (right) admitted possession of cannabis and cocaine with intent to supply . An 11th man, Joshua Patchett, of Awsworth, Nottinghamshire, will be sentenced next month. After the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Alan Mason, of EMSOU, said: 'This case demonstrates the complexity of drugs supply conspiracies which operate through a network of associates, some of whom may be located in different parts of the country, let alone the region. 'The East Midlands forces are determined to dismantle criminal groups which supply drugs to and within our region, and through EMSOU the forces have been targeting organised crime for a number of years now. 'This is the third case of its kind to be concluded at court this month and it is very satisfying to know that in just a matter of a few days more than 30 determined criminals from across the region who attempted to bring drugs into our communities have now been put behind bars.'","Police found thousands of pounds worth of drugs stashed in drains .

John Onyett, 76, was left with wounds to his arms, hands and leg after being mauled by a Japanese Akita in a 'horrendous' attack outside his late daughter's home in Leeds . The pensioner had been forced to spend one week in hospital where he underwent surgery to repair the horrific wounds. But he was temporarily released from Leeds Royal Infirmary so he could attend the service. His daughter died after struggling with alcoholism for several years. The dog - which belonged to a man who used to live with his daughter - is now due to be destroyed. No arrests have been made because the incident took place on private land and the dog is not a banned breed. Mr Onyett, who has eight grandchildren, said: 'I was so upset that I might have to miss the funeral because of what happened. 'I don't remember a lot - only feeling like my arm was going to be ripped off and being in terrible pain. 'If . it had been a child, I've no doubt their arm would have come straight . off.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . 'I love it': Dame Helen Mirren, pictured with her husband Taylor Hackford in 2012, said that there was a time that she didn't want to get married . Marriage can be hard work but couples are too quick to give up on it, according to Dame Helen Mirren. The 69-year-old Oscar winner, who wed director Taylor Hackford in 1997, said that it has required a great deal of effort to remain together and provided her advice for marital harmony. She said: 'It’s hard to live with someone . else, who isn’t you. They have annoying habits and so do you. A lot of . people get married when they haven’t really thought it through. 'But I . also believe that sometimes people give up on marriage too quickly.’ She added: ‘It’s not . a state of bliss and there was a time when I never wanted to be . married. Now I love it.

And actually we appreciate the lack of romance in the other person. ‘I’d be completely horrified if Taylor gave me a Valentine’s card! That’s not our sort of relationship at all - we would pour cold water on that sort of thing. ‘We even forget to get each other birthday presents - I’m always thinking the day before, “Oh, I must get Taylor something for his birthday”. ‘Without being corny, we try simply to be considerate to each other every day rather than lavishing each other with gifts.’ But she said Mr Hackford always sends her one present - a bunch of roses to calm her stage fright. ‘The one thing that Taylor does always do for me, though, is to send me a bouquet of yellow roses on a first night for luck,’ she said. ‘When they arrive, I know they’re from him and I love that.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . An international team of astronomers has discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit. Planets traditionally travel in a uniform, singular direction, around a star. However, the free-floating planet, named PSO J318.5-22, has been found without a host. Its movement isn't structured, scientists do not understand how it formed and they are baffled by what - if anything - controls it. Artist's impression of free-floating planet PSO J318.5-22. The planet doesn't appear to have a host star and scientists from Hawaii University's Institute of Astronomy aren't sure how it formed. It is believed to be around 12 million years old, and is considered a newborn in planet terms . Orbits are created by a balance between the forward motion of a body in space, such as a planet or moon, and the pull of gravity on it from another body, such as a large planet or star. An object with a large mass goes forward and wants to keep going forward; however, the gravity of another body in space pulls it in. There is a continuous tug-of-war between the one object wanting to go forward and away and the other wanting to pull it in. These forces of inertia and gravity create the orbit. If the movement of one object is too strong, the object speeds past the other and doesn't enter orbit. If the movement is weaker than the pull of gravity, the object will be pulled into the other one and crash. When a planet doesn't have a star, in theory, it should carry on moving and not remain still because there are no forces in place keeping it there. PSO J318.5-22 appears to be staying relatively still but doesn't have a host star to keep it in place. PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 lightyears away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter. Astronomers believe it formed 12 million years ago, and is considered a newborn in planetary terms - Earth is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old. Dr Michael Liu of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii identified the rogue planet from its 'faint and unique heat signature'. He used the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) wide-field survey telescope on Haleakala, Maui to make the discovery, before following it up using other telescopes across Hawaii to validate his claims and make sure the find wasn't a fluke. These follow-up observations found that PSO J318.5-22 has all the same properties of other gas-giant planets found orbiting around young stars - yet PSO J318.5-22 is all by itself. 'We have never before seen an object free-floating in space that that looks like this. 'It has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars, but it is drifting out there all alone,' explained Liu. 'I had often wondered if such solitary objects exist, and now we know they do.' Extrasolar planets, or planets found outside the solar system, have been discovered at various points over the past decade. Around a thousand of these were found when their host stars began wobbling or dimming because of the pull of the planet. However, only a small amount of these planets have been directly imaged, all of which are around young stars less than 200 million years old. Astronomer Dr. Liu used the Pan-STARRS 1 wide-field telescope on Maui to make the discovery. PSO J318.5-22, pictured, was discovered during a search for failed stars known as brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are faint and are red in colour. PSO J318.5-22 stood out because it was 'redder than even the reddest known brown dwarfs' PSO J318.5-22 is one of the lowest-mass free-floating objects known, perhaps the very lowest, according to Liu. But its most unique aspect is its similar mass, colour, and energy output to these directly imaged planets. 'Planets found by direct imaging are incredibly hard to study, since they are right next to their much brighter host stars. 'PSO J318.5-22 is not orbiting a star so it will be much easier for us to study. It is going to provide a wonderful view into the inner workings of gas-giant planets like Jupiter shortly after their birth,' said Dr. Niall Deacon of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. Based on its distance and motion through space, the team concluded that PSO J318.5-22, shown in red, belongs to a collection of young stars called the Beta Pictoris moving group . PSO J318.5-22 was discovered during a search for the failed stars known as brown dwarfs. Due to their relatively cool temperatures, brown dwarfs are very faint and are red in colour. Liu and his colleagues have been mining the data from the PS1 telescope for many years. PS1 scans the sky every night with a camera sensitive enough to detect the faint heat signatures of brown dwarfs. PSO J318.5-22 stood out because it was 'redder than even the reddest known brown dwarfs.' Infrared spectra taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility . and the Gemini North Telescope showed that PSO J318.5-22 was not a . brown dwarf, based on signatures in its infrared light that are best . explained by it being young and low-mass. 'We often describe looking for rare celestial objects as akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. So we decided to search the biggest haystack that exists in astronomy, the dataset from PS1,' said Dr. Eugene Magnier of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Dr. Magnier leads the data processing team for PS1, which produces the equivalent of 60,000 photos every night. Astronomers from Sweden and Finland believe orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny, cold dust clouds in space. Research has shown there could be as many as 200 billion 'free-floating' planets in our galaxy alone. Until now it was assumed that such 'rogue planets' must have been ejected from their solar systems. But new observations point to the likelihood of some free-floating worlds forming on their own. Astronomers . used several telescopes to observe the Rosette Nebula, a huge cloud of . gas and dust 4,600 light years from Earth in the constellation of . Monoceros, the Unicorn. The nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet-forming clouds, dubbed 'globulettes'. Each has a diameter less than 50 times the distance between the Sun and the planet Neptune. Dr . Carina Persson, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, . Sweden, said: 'We found that the globulettes are very dense and compact, . and many of them have very dense cores. 'That . tells us that many of them will collapse under their own weight and . form free-floating planets. The most massive of them can form so-called . brown dwarfs.' The scientists believe countless . millions of nebulae such as the Rosette have bloomed and faded away . during the Milky Way’s long history. Many could have given birth to . free-floating planets. The total dataset to date is about . 4,000 terabytes, bigger than the sum of the digital version of all the . movies ever made, all books ever published, and all the music albums . ever released. By regularly . monitoring the position of PSO J318.5-22 over two years with the . Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the team directly measured its distance . from Earth. Based on . this distance and its motion through space, the team concluded that PSO . J318.5-22 belongs to a collection of young stars called the Beta . Pictoris moving group that formed about 12 million years ago. The . eponymous star of the group, Beta Pictoris, has a young gas-giant . planet in orbit around it, yet PSO J318.5-22 is even lower in mass than . the Beta Pictoris planet and 'probably formed in a different fashion.'","Floating planet PSO J318.5-22found by Hawaii's Institute of Astronomy .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Apple has said it will replace the sleep/wake button on iPhone 5 handsets - two years after customer complaints started appearing . Apple has finally admitted to the existence of a problem with the sleep/wake button on the iPhone 5. Two years after customer complaints began appearing online, the Cupertino-based company has launched a free replacement scheme for any users affected by the power button issues. The group claims a ‘small percentage’ of iPhone 5 handsets - typically manufactured before March 2013 - have faulty mechanisms that can lead to problems with the switch. The fault prevents the device from being turned on and off, or locked in the usual way. This has caused some iPhone models to stop working intermittently. While Apple hasn’t placed a number on the amount of handsets affected, the term for ‘iPhone 5’ on Google has the query ‘iPhone 5 sleep button not working’ as one of the top searches. Forums are also filled with complaints dating back two years - before the time Apple claims the manufacturing error occurred. ‘The sleep/wake button is very unresponsive,’ one user wrote on the Apple forum in April 2012. ‘It's fine when pushing on the left most side of the button, but the right is completely unresponsive.’ Apple has now launched a dedicated website where users in the U.S. and Canada can submit their serial number to see if they qualify for the replacement scheme. The firm claims a 'small percentage' of iPhone 5 handsets, manufactured after March 2013, have faulty mechanisms that can lead to problems with the switch. The fault prevents the device from being turned on and off, or locked in the usual way, causing some iPhone 5 models to stop working intermittently . Affected users can then send in their iPhone for inspection through the post, call in at an Apple Store or visit another authorised service provider listed on the site. If affected users decide to take their handset to an Apple store, they will receive a 16GB iPhone 5 on loan while theirs is fixed. Those who have paid for an out-of-warranty replacement to fix the problem may also be eligible for receiving a refund from Apple. Broken iPhones, such as those with cracked screens, do not qualify until other issues are addressed. The replacement process is currently limited to the U.S. and Canada, but there are plans to launch in other countries on 2 May. Following reports of phones crashing and data being lost, more users have come forward to complain about other problems with their Apple devices since updating to the latest iOS 7.1.1 software. Users have told MailOnline that phones are dying despite having battery life, while apps and Apple services have begun freezing or acting erratically. Apple pushed out the minor update for its iOS software earlier this week and some users have been left having to restore their devices, consequently losing all their pictures, apps and other personal data. According to the initial reports, the majority of the problems occurred when trying to update the devices using Wi-Fi, also known as Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. When updating an iOS device there are two options – over the air, or via iTunes. When using OTA, the phone has to be plugged into a charger. However, a number of customers have had the same issue when updating over a cable. One person told MailOnline: 'Mine was on the cable all the time during the update and still it has crashed. 'I’ve tried restoring three times now and it fails with an ‘internal error’. Not sure where to go now, Apple are much less than helpful.'","Apple claims a 'small percentage' of iPhone 5 handsets are affected .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A 17-year-old Instagram photographer spends less time snapping selfies and more time taking breath-taking and often illegal views of New York City. Humza Deas, 17, spoke with New York Magazine about the growing popularity of urban exploration, the incriminating drive to take the perfect photograph of New York City, and about receiving death threats for speaking with the media. Deas and other Instagram outlaws, namely one named Last Suspect, compete against one another for followers and frighteningly gritty urban snapshots. Scroll down for video . Urban explorer: Humza Deas is most known for climbing New York's bridges . New heights: Last Suspect also spends his free time scaling bridges and skyscrapers to take the perfect photograph . Walking the line: Climbing to the top of buildings is bothe dangerous and illegal but that's what makes urban explorers who they are . Deas has 31,000 followers just trailing behind last Suspect's 51,000. New York magazine explains that both Deas and last Suspect are part of a group of Instagram users called a 'K' or someone with over 10,000 followers so that the last letter of the number of followers is replaced with a K. Not only do they shoot alike, they dress alike and can be seen wearing photographer's backpack's and Nike shoes so that they can climb the tallest building or even scale the top of a bridge. Two other well-known Instagram outlaws go by the name of demidism and Konstenn and their work reflects the same adventurous  qualities. New York Magazine says urban exploration is no new trend. Adventure seekers have long been trespassing onto New York's most coveted landscapes. Instead of merely observing the structures, however, modern urban exploration has taken the social media trend with it and is becoming more and more about taking the perfect photograph than secretly enjoying city views. Urban Instagrammers are more like graffiti artists than they are the urban explorers of a decade ago. Instead of thriving on just an experience, they photograph the structures and leave their mark by posting a photo on Instagram--or leaving a little something to remember them by. Deas' name blew up on July 22 after a mysterious someone changed American flags on the Brooklyn Bridge to big white flags. Instagram Fame: Urban explorers like Last Suspect take to the streets to capture gritty shots . Every corner: Instagram outlaws like Konstenn capture photos from every creeping corner . Top photographers: Instagram outlaws have risen to skyscraper heights of social media fame . Make it shine like the top of the  Chrysler!: Photographers like demisdism take beautiful and frightening images at the same time . Deas, who is known for scaling bridges, didn't change the flags but woke up to thousands of messages from fans asking him if it was him. In reality two German artists Mischa Leinkauf and Matthias Wermke changed the flags and admitted it to the New York Times this week. Deas publicly said that he didn’t change the flags but the stunt got Deas an interview nonetheless. Deas' friend Neil cuts the hair of a WPIX reporter who wanted to do an interview with an Instagram bridge-climber. Deas told the reporter the best time to scale bridges is at night and he mentioned his Instagram rival Last Suspect who he said jokingly took credit for the flag prank. He then shared a snap of Last Suspect with the words 'you shouldn't take credit for someone else's work.' Last Suspect asked his followers to later boycott Deas and Deas received death threats. Tunnel vision: Humza Deas is focused on photographing New York's most fascinating structures while flirting with danger . Camera flash: Humza Deas snaps his camera and then he's gone to explore some other urban terrain . Electrifying: Humza Deas' work shows the power and grit of New York paired with uncontrollable nature . City lights: Not only is the bridge better to climb at night so as not to get caught, it's also just plain beautiful . People accused Deas of trying to sneak his way to the top of Instagram fame by exposing coveted secrets. Believe it or not, Deas didn't start scaling buildings until earlier this year after seeing a video of Russian daredevils climbing a 2,073-foot Shanghai Tower. 'I was like, damn, this is so dangerous,' he said of seeing the video for the first time. New York magazine explains how it was so dangerous he wanted to try it out on his own. 'I’m thinking, Hey, they’re in China, they’re not in New York...I can show New York this kind of photography.' In April, Deas made the decision to climb the Brooklyn side of the Williamsburg Bridge. It only took him 15 minutes. He went on to climb the Queensboro Bridge, Hell Gate Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge, and the Williamsburg Bridge another six times. Don't fall!: Humza Deas risks his life almost every time he takes a photograph . Light at the end of the tunnel: Humza Deas has received death threats for speaking out about his work in the past and now he keeps a low profile . Bridge over troubled water: Even though Humza Deas has made some rivals while taking photographs he still manages to take spectacular shots . He later advanced to climbing New York's tallest skyscrapers. Though Deas walks the narrow bridge between legal and illegal, he seldom gets caught and has a plan for when he does. Deas once got caught photographing a girl from the 53-floor Eventi Skyscraper on Seventh Avenue. When cops arrived, Deas told them he had a New York State Regents exam the next day and so the police let him off with a warning. 'I knew he wouldn't arrest me because I had a test in the morning,' Deas quipped. 'He's a dad.' New York Magazine reports that Deas has been trying tom keep a low profile following the white flag incident. As he and a reporter passed the Manhattan Bridge he said, 'If I really wanted to, I could do it,' 'The NYPD is not superhuman.' He suspects it's time to take a photograph: Last suspect shows off his chops by photographing this storm . Crossing the line: hen it comes to climbing bridges, no height is too tall for brave photographers like demisdism .

"By . Guy Adams . When Mark Thomas and Rebecca Howe registered the birth of their daughter Casey at Birmingham’s City Hospital in Winson Green in 2011, they left the section for their occupations blank. Today, the information that was — or rather was not — on Casey’s outwardly unremarkable birth certificate is entirely relevant to a rapidly overheating national debate. Mr Thomas and Ms Howe, an unmarried couple, are now known to millions as ‘Mark and Becky’, the young, jobless couple whose lives and parenting skills dominated this week’s episode of the controversial Channel 4 show Benefits Street. Mark Thomas, 23 and Becky Howe, 23, pictured outside their house on James Turner Street . To the programme’s five million viewers, the duo’s apparent inability to identify what they actually do for a living will not have come as much of a surprise. For, as the narrator of Benefits Street has frequently reminded us, neither one of these suddenly notorious 23-year-olds has ever held down a full-time job. Instead, the couple raise Casey and her four-year-old brother, Callum, in an apparently chaotic household, on the combined proceeds of jobseekers’ allowance, child benefit and child tax credit. The show tells how they moved to James Turner Street, the Victorian terrace of 99 properties where the documentary was filmed, just over two years ago. Their rent has since been paid by the State. To cover the remainder of their living costs, they rely on government hand-outs which currently total around £250 a fortnight. Though the programme has provoked much controversy, wherever you stand it’s certainly hard to watch very much of Benefits Street without reflecting on how drastically things have changed since the Victorian terraces at its centre were built. Half a century after the welfare state was established to provide a temporary safety net for those unlucky enough to have fallen on hard times, its ethos has shifted, with benefits becoming a way of life for many. And if you want to appreciate the scale of that shift, you need only take a few tentative steps up Mark and Becky’s family tree. Birth, marriage and death records reveal that despite their own employment records, the couple both come from respectable working-class stock. Take Becky’s great-grandfathers, Alfred Leach and Percy Addison. In the early 20th century, they were, respectively, an electrician’s mate and a gamekeeper from Rugby in Warwickshire, according to local archives. Those living on the street of Victorian terraces have changed substantially over the years. Previously, most families held down respectable jobs for all their adult lives . Her grandfather, Bernard, born in 1933, was a carpenter, and her grandmother Irene worked for British Rail. Her late father, David, described himself as a chauffeur on her 1990 birth certificate. Becky appears to be the first generation of the Howe family to have fallen into the welfare trap. And they have fallen hard. Indeed, all three of her siblings are understood to have claimed some form of benefits. Mark’s family tree is similarly a tale of hard graft – until, that is, it reaches the modern era. This week, I met Derek and Jean Cleaver, a retired couple who live with their English bull terrier, Zulu, in a tidy former council house in Northfield, a suburb half an hour’s drive from central Birmingham. Derek and Jean, who are 81 and 76, have two children, 11 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. They also happen to be Mark’s grandparents. The couple have lived in Birmingham their entire adult lives, and proudly tell how they both spent more than half a century in full-time employment. At times, each held down two jobs, in order to properly provide for their family. ‘We weren’t scroungers, and we always paid taxes, because that’s how I was brought up,’ Derek told me. ‘Jean was the same. She kept a full-time job until she was 72.’ The difference between Derek’s life and those of his grandchildren is, perhaps, an object lesson in some of the ways traditional working-class culture has been undermined by welfarism. Derek was the son of Jack Cleaver, a grocer’s assistant, who later became a chimney sweep, and Edith Cleaver, a housewife. He grew up with six brothers and three sisters in a small terraced house in Small Heath, just east of Birmingham city centre. As a child, before the War, he recalls going out to earn money sweeping snow with his siblings so the family could afford a turkey for Christmas dinner. In 1946, when he was 14, the family’s perilous finances forced him to leave school and take a job in the building trade. For 25 years, he worked long hours doing up Ansell’s pubs. After marrying Jean, and quickly finding himself with two daughters to feed, Derek took a second evening job, at a local cinema. ‘At the end of each day, I was exhausted,’ he says. ‘I used to leave home at half past seven in the morning and finish at half past four. Then I would go to the West End picture house and work as a doorman. I had two jobs, but we needed the money in those days.’ Circumstances didn’t improve until the Seventies, when Derek found work at the local British Leyland plant. ‘We were then able to afford to go to Rhyl for holidays,’ he recalls. ‘Sunny Rhyl every year. We would get a caravan. We didn’t have a lot, but we were happy.’ In the Eighties, they were able to purchase a council house. An officer walks the street. The Cleavers blame the government for giving residents money 'for doing nothing' Little wonder, given this relentless existence of labour, that Derek has nothing but contempt for what he sees as the ‘something for nothing’ culture propagated by aspects of the welfare state. ‘Kids today, they might say they want a job, but you never see them out and about actually looking for work. ‘Why should they, when the Government will give them money for doing nothing? At half past seven in the morning, they’re all in bed.’ Jean, the daughter of a ‘general labourer’ from Yardley, is also a grafter. She began work in a local factory aged 15, then after getting married took a job on the tills at Woolworths. She briefly quit work after giving birth to two daughters, Mandy (who is Mark’s mother) and Wendy, in the early Sixties, before returning to the grindstone after being offered night shifts in a Birmingham printing factory. ‘I used to work at night, so my mother would stay over and look after the girls for me,’ Jean recalls. ‘When she retired, I was able to change to day shifts.’ Jean took a full-time job at an amusement arcade where she remained for the rest of her working life. In later years, it gave her a unique insight into what she sees as the endemic abuse of welfare. ‘Every day, you’d see these people. They’re not disabled, but they are collecting disabled benefits, and bring the money right in and pour it into the slot machines. ‘Others would come into the arcade: they’re unemployed, but they aren’t looking for a job, they’re spending four or five hours a day at machines.’ Little wonder, then, that Derek and Jean raised their daughters to be similarly industrious. Mandy worked on the tills of a local supermarket as a teenager, before getting a job in a fish shop. She married a carpenter, Mark Thomas Snr. Mark Snr and Mandy had three children, but divorced shortly after the birth of a son in 1990. That son is the Mark Thomas who is at the centre of Benefits Street; he was raised largely by a stepfather, Craig Messer. Given their views on the virtues of hard work, not to mention the state of the welfare system, you might expect Derek and Jean to be deeply upset by the grandson who has emerged from the first three episodes of Benefits Street. But they say there is an important fact missing from Channel 4’s portrayal of Mark and Becky. It emerges that the couple both suffer from learning difficulties. Indeed, they first met as teenagers when they attended the Selly Oak Trust School, which describes itself as being a ‘specialist’ establishment ‘for unique students with special educational needs’. Mark, who admitted fiddling his benefits on the show, is led from his house by a police officer. His grandparents say the man claims as he suffers from learning difficulties . Their condition, which was not mentioned on Monday’s programme, goes some way towards explaining aspects of the couple’s parenting technique, which prompted widespread derision after the show aired. ‘The show presents him as a scrounger,’ says Jean, ‘without explaining why he has found it hard to get work. I know, because I know Mark, that he’s tried and tried to get a job. If someone offered him work, he’d start tomorrow.’ Asked why they failed to mention Mark and Becky’s learning difficulty during the programme, Channel 4 said last night that it was satisfied the couple had made an ‘informed decision’ about appearing in the show. ‘As with all the residents featured, if they wanted filming to stop at any point, it did,’ the channel said. All of which leaves Derek cold. ‘I hate people who want something for nothing. Who doesn’t? But that’s not my grandson. He has been mistreated here.’ Special pleading by a loving grandfather? Or do Derek’s words reveal a certain cynicism at the heart of the series — and perhaps a deeper problem in the welfare state, which offers handouts to people like Mark and Becky rather than helping them rise above their problems and enter the world of work and self-reliance. There’s no doubt this series has generated shockwaves. The question is whether they will help produce any meaningful social change — and see the residents of Benefits Street rediscovering the work ethic which was second nature to their grandparents.","Mark and Becky are a young, jobless couple on the controversial show .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Food stamps will be handed to the poorest and neediest when cash handouts are scrapped in favour of vouchers next week. Many local authorities are expected to take part in the scheme under which vouchers will be issued to the most vulnerable, rather than cash grants or loans. They will be issued to help tide people over in times of financial crisis, and recipients will be able to exchange the vouchers for food, nappies and other essentials, but not alcohol or cigarettes. Thousands of the most vulnerable people will be given vouchers redeemable for food and essentials from April . The voucher scheme is being introduced from 1 April under changes to benefits outlined in last year's Welfare Reform Act. The food stamps will replace the discretionary part of the government-run Social Fund, which issued immediate, small cash grants and loans to people on low or no incomes who needed help urgently. Now, instead of the money being handed out by central government, it is being devolved to local authorities in England and devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. The current budget of £178.2m will be handed down to a local level, plus start-up costs of £72m, for councils to spend as they see fit. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the move was not about cost-cutting, as there was no reduction in budget, but rather was intended to ensure the money was spent where it was most needed. He said: 'We’re reforming the Social Fund because it is complex, over-centralised and poorly targeted, and replacing it with local provision to ensure this money goes to those most in need. Vouchers will be issued to those most at need at a local level in England, Wales and Scotland (file image) 'We will transfer the current annual funding for crisis loans and community care grants to local authorities in England and the devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland. 'They will receive the full programme budget of £178.2 million a year in addition to administration and start-up costs of over £72 million which represents a fair settlement.' The vouchers will be adopted in the wake of the abolition of the Social Fund's discretionary scheme, under which the needy were given crisis loans, repayable out of their benefits, or community care grants. Local authorities may offer vouchers redeemable at supermarkets, food banks, or those that may be exchanged for hot meals . The Social Fund's regulated scheme, which governs cold weather payments, Sure Start maternity grants, funeral expenses and the Winter Fuel Grant, will be unaffected, the DWP says. It will be up to the local authorities how they spend the money, but many of those in England are said to have confirmed their plans to issue one-off, single-use vouchers to those who apply for emergency assistance. Some authorities are planning to hand . out food parcels, and will divert extra funds to local food banks to . enable them to buy more supplies and take on more staff to help. And others may issue the money as repayable loans, similar to the crisis loans available under the previous system. Bath and North East Somerset council is one authority planning to offer vouchers, and a spokesman told MailOnline the council intends to use their allocation to offer a mixture of vouchers and discretionary payments. Spokesman James Hinchcliffe said: 'These may be supermarket vouchers or electricity or gas vouchers, or they may be Discretionary Support payments, for example to help with housing payments or essential household items.' A spokesman for Newcastle City Council said it was also planning to offer a mixture of clothing and fuel vouchers, food parcels, and emergency travel costs. Critics said the scheme may stigmatise those already in trouble, but the Government insists the plans, which will enable local authorities to set their own eligibility criteria, will mean the money will go where it is needed most.","Vouchers will be redeemable for food, nappies and other essentials .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The show, which features 'stars' such as Black Dee, has given Channel 4 its highest ratings for two years with 5.3million watching last night . Benefits Street has become the most viewed programme on Channel 4 in almost two years, drawing an audience of 5.2million for its latest offering. The series, which follows the lives of people on James Turner Street - where 90 per cent of residents are on benefits - saw off competitionfrom ITV's The Bletchley Circle and BBC 1 drama New Tricks. Last night’s programme, the third episode of the series which explored the 'stars' relationships with their children, drew in a record 21.5 per cent of all TV viewers. The figures, combined from Channel 4, Channel 4 HD and Channel 4 plus one, beat last week by 100,000 viewers. The programme has courted controversy from the start, with the inhabitants of James Turner Street in Birmingham saying that the producers 'did anything they could' to get the most shocking footage. Although the people who appear on the programme were not paid for their appearance - which could affect their ability to claim benefits - they claim producers used gifts instead to assure their co-operation. Becky Howe, 23, features in the show alongside her partner Mark Thomas, . also 23, and their children Casey, two, and Callum, four. She says that residents were given energy drinks, cigarettes and fast food in order to take part, and that alcoholic 'Fungi' was allegedly given cans of beer for participating. While the figures are impressive, they fall short of the Paralympic ceremony, watched by 7.7million and are far cry from the heyday of Channel 4 viewing, when in 2004 Friends, the finale, drew an audience . of 9.6million, and in 2002 when the Big Brother season three final saw 10million people tune in. Channel 4's last big hit, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, also drew larger numbers with 9.7million people watching the show in February 2011. A Channel 4 spokesperson said: 'Part of Channel 4’s remit is to stimulate debate and Benefits Street has done this on a national scale, evidenced by the large audiences tuning into the programme as well as the high volume of media coverage and social media comments.' In the latest allegations against the show, it was reported at the weekend that the children of some of the 'stars' are being abused and bullied at school. Last night's episode focused on the children of Benefits Street - such as White Dee's son Gerrard . Confessions: Mark Thomas and Becky Howe confessed to benefit fraud on the show . Desmond Jaddoo, part of the Birmingham Empowerment Forum, said that even adults have been pulling up outside the playground to shout abuse at children as they play outside. The realities of life on the notorious Birmingham road - where ninety per cent of residents receive state hand-outs and petty crime and drugs use are rife - caused a national outcry after the first episode was aired this month. Viewers were shocked at scenes in which residents confessed to fiddling their benefits, a serial theif was followed around on a shoplifting spree and an alcoholic tried to make some easy cash by gathering up free magazines and trying to sell them as copies of the Big Issue. Mr Jaddoo said that the problem was worst at the Oasis Foundry Academy, which is on James Turner Street, but that it applied to schools around the area. The controversial fly-on-the-wall documentary series focusing on the lives of residents living on James Turner Street, in Birmingham has divided the nation since it began on January 6 . The programme follows the lives of those who live in James Turner Street in Birmingham, 90 per cent of whom are on benefits . In February 2012 7.7million viewers tuned in to watch the Paralympic Closing Ceremony . He told MailOnline: 'People are driving down the street hurling abuse. 'There is stigmatisation of the children at the local school. And indeed other children at other schools have been bullied - at secondary schools too. 'No matter how sympathetic teaching staff will be, children are now going to school with that stigma attached to him. They will be the true victims of all of this.' 1.

"By . Andy Dolan . and Christian Gysin . and Lucy Osborne . They complained that the television series had made them look like ‘complete scum’. But one of the female ‘stars’ of controversial Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street is today unmasked as a convicted criminal. ‘White Dee’ – the self-proclaimed ‘mother of the street’ – stole from the vulnerable to fund her lover’s crack habit, the Mail can disclose. White Dee: The self-proclaimed 'mother of the . street', pictured on Facebook, was once convicted of stealing cash . destined for vulnerable council tenants when she was working as an admin assistant at a local authority . She and her friend ‘Black Dee’ – nicknamed by their neighbours on account of their colour – featured heavily in Monday’s first episode, portrayed as hubs of a close-knit working-class community. White Dee’s conviction as a thief emerged as another resident told of his ‘shame’ at living on the street and said that his insurance company was now threatening to withdraw cover on his vehicles as a result of the documentary. The takeaway owner added that his children were being teased about their address at school. Channel 4 could face a police probe over the documentary, which featured thief Danny Smith demonstrating his tricks of the trade as a shoplifter and boasting about his ill-gotten gains. John O’Shea, a Labour councillor in Birmingham where the series was filmed, said that Channel 4 appeared to have ‘aided and abetted shoplifting’. The broadcaster had yesterday received almost 400 complaints about Monday’s show. Shame: White Dee's conviction emerged . as another resident said his insurance company was now threatening . to withdraw cover on his vehicles and his children were being teased at school as . a result of the documentary . One of the main characters, ‘White Dee’ – real name Deirdre Kelly –  was portrayed as a streetwise single mother-of-two who uses her knowledge of the benefits system to help her neighbours in James Turner Street, Winson Green, a deprived inner-city area  of Birmingham. But the Daily Mail can reveal that while the ‘mother of the street’ may look out for those living around her, she once had no scruples about stealing more than £13,000 from the city council which employed her. The theft included envelopes of cash given to social workers to look after by ‘most vulnerable’ tenants. A court heard Kelly had worked as an administration assistant for her local authority in Birmingham for seven years but began stealing cash and cheques from a safe, while manipulating paperwork in a bid to cover her tracks. Kelly, now 42, was rumbled by an internal audit. She claimed in court that she had used the cash to feed her partner’s crack cocaine habit and pay bills. The mother was only spared prison because she had no previous convictions and to ensure her children were not put into care. She received a suspended sentence and was ordered to carry out 220 hours’ unpaid work, and was sacked as a result of the ‘mean-spirited and calculated’ theft. Black Dee: The other 'star' of the first episode . - real name Samora Roberts - complained that programme-makers . duped her into taking part by promising the series would be about the . residents' sense of community . Her fellow ‘star’ of the documentary, . ‘Black Dee’ Roberts, 32,  has complained that programme-makers duped her . into taking  part by promising the series would be about the residents’ sense of community. The . unemployed youth and support worker said its focus on ‘people in the . street living off benefits, taking drugs and dossing around … makes . people out as complete scum’. Taken away@ West Midlands police said Mark . Thomas, 23, had contacted officers to make a complaint and went to the station to give a statement . Black Dee – real name Samora Roberts – . is currently on bail in connection with a ‘racially aggravated . incident’ in James Turner Street last August, and a drugs bust last . June. She has protested her innocence in relation to the drugs raid. The revelations emerged as another resident, who admitted on camera that he and his girlfriend had been caught fiddling their benefits in the past, was photographed being taken away by police. The West Midlands force later said Mark Thomas, 23, had contacted officers to make a complaint and was taken to a police station to give a statement. His partner, Becky Howe, 23, suggested the complaint concerned a ‘family matter’. Kelly did not return calls about her conviction last night. Roberts did not comment. Channel 4 last night said it had no plans to edit the episode for its 4oD online catch-up service. A spokesman said it had not handed unused-material from the ‘human and objective’ documentary to police, and would only do so on receipt of a court order. The spokesman also admitted that welfare claimants featured in Monday’s programme were paid ‘small expenses’ such as electricity used during filming. West Midlands Police said officers would watch the series in its entirety before deciding whether to seek additional footage. The force has not been given preview copies of forthcoming episodes.","White Dee stole £13,000 while working as admin assistant at local authority .
