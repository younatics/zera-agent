"London, England (CNN) -- A taxi driver shot in the back by Cumbrian gunman Derrick Bird has described how he dived for cover as he watched Bird shoot a friend in the face. Twelve people were killed in a shooting rampage which began in the port town of Whitehaven on Wednesday and ended with Bird, also a taxi driver, apparently shooting himself near a remote Lake District village. Don Reed said he watched in horror as Bird walked up to a taxi rank in Whitehaven and shot another driver, Darren Rewcastle, at point blank range. ""He turned up and shouted 'Darren' before walking up to him and taking his face off. I saw it. He just shot him,"" Reed, a former soldier, told the Liverpool Echo. ""Then Derrick pulled up by me, raised his shotgun and got me in the back as I took a flying dive. Half the bullet got me and the other half went into a shop window across the road."" Reed said his military training ""kicked in"" as he crawled away on hands and knees, using cars for cover. ""I got next to Darren Rewcastle on the floor. His face was gone. I stood up and Derrick came forward as I tried to open taxi doors to put between us."" Bird then drove away, shooting several other taxi drivers in the town, the Echo said. Reed said he had known Bird for 20 years. He said Bird had been on vacation to Thailand with some of his victims. ""I haven't a clue why he did it, it's beyond my comprehension,"" Reed told the Echo. Reed was taken to a local hospital for treatment for a gunshot wound and later released. A local taxi firm owner said Bird had been involved in a dispute with other drivers at the rank -- including Rewcastle -- who he had accused of taking ""fares"" from the back of the queue. ""There's been an argument on the rank which was in relation to taking people off the back of the rank, instead of sending them to the front,"" he told the UK's Press Association. ""It's an ongoing thing. It came to a head on Tuesday night and maybe, with any other problems Derrick had, it contributed to his behavior."" Meanwhile residents of the village of Boot have spoken of how their idyllic Lake District hamlet became the center of a frantic police manhunt as cars were forced off the road and drivers witnessed a woman shot in the face. ""Two cars came screeching down, one after another because they had been almost road-raged off the road by this bloke. After that they saw him shoot the girl in the face,"" Rose Bogg, 63, told PA. Bogg said residents were warned to stay indoors. ""There were helicopters around the place because they were searching for him... It was really scary. We knew he was in the area and we had heard he was on foot by then but nobody knew exactly where he was."" After two hours, Bogg and her husband heard that the gunman had shot himself nearby. ""This is just an out of the blue thing. Everyone is very shocked,"" she said.","Taxi driver ducked for cover as a colleague was shot dead at point blank range .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain will step up its inspection of North Sea drilling rigs following the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the government announced Tuesday. The government will also increase monitoring of offshore drilling compliance and has asked a new oil industry group to report on Britain's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills, Energy Secretary Chris Huhne said. ""The events unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico are devastating and will be enduring,"" Huhne said in a statement. ""What we are seeing will transform the regulation of deep water drilling worldwide. It's my responsibility to make sure that the oil and gas industry maintains the highest practices here in U.K. waters."" Current measures are up to standards but must be strengthened in light of the Gulf of Mexico spill, Huhne said. ""It's clear that our safety and environmental regulatory regime is fit for purpose,"" he said. ""It is already among the most robust in the world and the industry's record in the North Sea is strong. For example, we already separate regulation of operations and safety. ""But the Deepwater Horizon gives us pause for thought and, given the beginning of exploration in deeper waters West of Shetland, there is every reason to increase our vigilance."" Tougher steps are already being taken, Huhne said. They include doubling the number of drilling rig inspections by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), which is responsible for licensing, exploration, and regulation of oil and gas developments on the U.K. Continental Shelf, he said. The DECC is also reviewing the indemnity and insurance requirements for operators on the U.K. Continental Shelf. Huhne said Britain's stringent safety regulations came into force after the Piper Alpha disaster in July 1988, when a gas leak led to a major fire that engulfed the platform in the North Sea. Of the 229 people aboard the rig, 167 died. Operators of oil rigs must now analyze the potential dangers on an installation, the consequences of any incident, and their methods to control the risks.","Britain to step up North Sea oil rig inspections .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Caste and religion are potential headings on matrimonial columns of Sunday newspapers. At times, matchmaking classifieds profile mystical birth-chart defects of the candidates. In India, marriages are solemnized as a well-guarded union. But the country has now moved to at least unshackle divorce. Officials Friday announced measures to stem delays in seeking an early end to failed alliances. India's federal cabinet approved ""irretrievable breakdown of marriage"" as a ground for couples to part ways, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told reporters. Under original Hindu marriage laws, both estranged partners have to appear at court proceedings for settlement of their lawsuit for divorce by consent. But it's not uncommon for a petitioner to skip tribunal dates deliberately in order to keep the case dragging in India's notoriously sluggish legal system, authorities acknowledge. ""This has been causing considerable hardship to the party in dire need of divorce,"" Soni said. Officials believe the new legislation, now due for clearance by parliament, will eliminate harassment of either party in the case and abuse of the existing law on dissolving marriages. There was no official data on divorces immediately available, but matchmakers say four in 100 marriages fail in India. With the country transforming into a modern economic powerhouse, divorce is increasingly seen as an acceptable way out of unsatisfying relationships. ""Divorce doesn't seem to be biased any more. It's uniform among all castes, cities and income groups,"" said Vivek Pahwa, the head of SecondShaadi.com, a marriage bureau for second-timers. Pahwa's portal aims at India's internet-using divorcees, widows and widowers. More than one-fourth of his clients, he says, are women, especially in jobs. ""It's reflection of financial independence,"" he said. He was referring to a growing number of Indian women joining the workforce who he says refuse to remain trapped in unwanted marriages. Indian laws allow limited one-sided separation. Cruelty and desertion can serve as a premise for seeking divorce without consent. Separately, the country has harsh laws to protect women, such as in cases of physical torture over dowries. But data shows a surge in crimes against women. Police across India registered 195,856 crimes against women in 2008, up from 140,601 in 2003, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.","India seeks to speed divorces .

"(CNN) -- Director Chen Kaige's films often examine the close ties of love, passion and friendship, but his own relationship with his artist and filmmaker father is one that has informed much of his life and colored his work. Chen Kaige captures the pains and passions of relationships on the silver screen. As a 14-year-old red guard during the Cultural Revolution, Chen denounced his father for creating subversive art. While his father forgave him, Chen has found it hard to truly forgive himself. ""I knew it was the wrong thing to do. If I didn't know, then I could've forgiven myself,"" he told CNN. Chen has already touched upon such a significant moment in his personal life in his award-winning 1993 film, ""Farewell My Concubine."" It brought him international-acclaim and a host of accolades, including Cannes Film Festival's Palme D'or. Like ""Farewell My Concubine,"" Chen's latest film, ""Forever Enthralled"" (""Mei Lanfang"" in Mandarin), once again delves into the world of Beijing opera, and it has proven to be a hit in China since its release in cinemas in December. However, capturing the Cultural Revolution remains one of Chen's ambitions -- not only to explore the circumstances that colored the relationship with his father but an exploration of a crucial time in Chinese history. ""It's not because I was hurt and so many people hurt that I want to do my revenge. It's not like this. This is the lesson that the Chinese people must learn, no matter what,"" Chen told CNN. ""I hope that my generation of directors or writers could do something to tell people the truth, to tell people what really happened at that time; why a young son of a film director, you know, could denounce his own father, like I did. I was still shocked,"" he said. Now 56 years old, Chen studied at the Beijing Film Academy, directing his first feature film ""Yellow Earth"" in 1984. After the success of ""Farewell My Concubine,"" he eventually took up the offer to direct a Hollywood film in 2002 -- ""Killing Me Softly,"" with Heather Graham and Joseph Fiennes. While failing to impress the critics or register a hit at the box office, Chen remains sanguine about the experience. ""I think I've learnt a lot from that. Although I fully understand why audiences didn't really enjoy that film that much. ""In the industrial system [of Hollywood] people don't really care if you're making a good film or not. People care about whether the film can make money. It's a completely different thing, you know. Quite honestly, I wasn't very comfortable to do films that way,"" said Chen. Chen will continue to make films in China and finds the country's recent transformation as significant as earlier periods of change during his lifetime. ""I ask myself whether it's a progress or we're just going back to where we not necessarily need to be. I don't know. I mean, I'm not trying to say anything politically. But I feel if you look at the very beginning of Charles Dickens' novel, 'A Tale of Two Cities,' 'It was the best times, it was the worst times...' this is the simple answer,"" he said. Time will tell if today's China will be part of Chen's cinematic sweep in the future.","Chinese director Chen Kaige found international fame with 'Farewell My Concubine'

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored his 33rd and 34th goals of the season as Barcelona crushed Valladolid 4-0 to retain their Spanish Primera Liga title by three points from Real Madrid, who were held 1-1 at Malaga on Sunday. The 22-year-old Messi put the icing on the cake of a memorable campaign for him personally, helping Barca finish the season on 99 points, the most points gained in Spanish league history. With arch-rivals Madrid breathing down their necks, just a point separated the two sides going into the final match of the season, Pep Guardiola's side knew that only a victory would guarantee their fourth league title in six seasons. And they were handed the perfect start when visiting defender Luis Prieto managed to slice Pedro's 27th-minute cross into his own net. Pedro was instrumental in Barca's second goal four minutes later, sliding the ball through the goalkeeper's legs after latching onto Messi's pass. Argentine maestro Messi then took over. He netted his first -- and Barca's third -- on the hour mark when tapping home after Yaya Toure's powerful run had split the Valladolid defence. The scoring was completed with 15 minutes remaining when Messi fired home after against being set-up by Toure. Speaking to reporters after the match, Barca captain Carlos Puyol said: ""Real Madrid had a great season and made life tough for us but we fought hard to win this title with a huge points tally. ""It is really nice to celebrate this title in front of our fans. We have had some difficult moments and they really helped us get through them."" The victory also meant Real's result became redundant, although their failure to win now increases the pressure even further on coach Manuel Pellegrini. Pellegrini's side fell behind on nine minutes when Sergio Duda finished fired Malaga ahead, although Dutchman Rafael van der Vaart earned the visitors a point with a superb turn and strike. The final day results mean that Valencia (third) and Sevilla (fourth) join Barca and Real Madrid in next year's Champions League. Meanwhile, Valladolid's defeat means they join Xerez and Tenerife in being relegated to the second division -- while Malaga and Racing Santander both survive the drop.","Barcelona crush Valladolid 4-0 to retain their Spanish Primera Liga title .

"(CNN)  -- Facebook's privacy problems have been in the news ... again. Although complaints may have started deep in the blogosphere, even Time Magazine has made them its cover story. In response, Facebook announced a new privacy model to address complaints that it's too darn hard to actually navigate privacy settings on Facebook. (Well, duh.) It's not yet clear whether Facebook's changes will satiate the Facebook citizenry (let alone the rabid critics), but the conversations about privacy settings tend to emphasize only a fraction of the core concerns. Facebook rightfully believes that it's important to give users control over their settings, to empower them to make decisions about what's accessible. But Facebook can also be condescending, suggesting that they know what's best for their users because they have so much data about them (which they do). Unfortunately, Facebook's data tells them a lot about what people do but little about why they do it. They know that people aren't quitting Facebook, but that doesn't mean that users aren't frustrated or concerned (or would be if they understood what was happening). Don't get me wrong -- the privacy settings are confounding even for the most experienced digerati and I'm very glad that they're addressing this fundamental issue. But in doing so, I hope that they realize that the main reason for so much public outrage goes beyond privacy settings. The issue is fundamentally about trust and informed consent. When people share information with Facebook, they become vulnerable to Facebook. They trust Facebook to respect their interests. Facebook has the power to expose people in ways that make their lives really miserable. Because of that power, it's crucial that they stop telling users what's best for them and start engaging in a more meaningful dialogue. Changing things and then forcing users to opt out is manipulative. Instead, they should be seeking informed consent -- actively working with users to help make sure that they understand what's at stake in their choices. It is unacceptable for a company like Facebook to trick people into ""consenting"" to make their data more visible than they might think that it is. People should be able to understand Facebook's changes and have choices available that allow them to make appropriate decisions. When Facebook changed its privacy settings in December, far too many people clicked on through without realizing that a few mouse clicks meant that they were exposing their status updates to the world. Many people may know exactly how not-private their Facebook profile or updates are. But do they? I recommend using ReclaimPrivacy to scan your privacy settings. Keep in mind that ""Everybody"" is more than the people searching for you on Facebook -- this includes every company or individual who wants to use your information for any purpose. In many ways, it's more accessible than simply posting something on a public website and waiting for Google to find it. And keep in mind that ""Friends-of-Friends"" means more than the people that you'd invite to a birthday party. I talked with a young woman who vowed that she'd never friend her mother; she didn't realize that if she friended her aunt and her aunt friended her mother than ""Friends-of-Friends"" included her mother. Do people really know who is included in their ""Friends-of-Friends?"" Facebook doesn't just need to fix its privacy settings. It needs to fix its attitude and repair its relationship with its users. Facebook isn't just a space for users to share; it is built on the backs of people and profits off of the data people entrust to them. An abusive relationship is simply unacceptable. Facebook must go beyond paternalism and start empowering users to help guide the future of the service. It starts with committing to an opt-in approach to changes and developing features that allow users to have complete transparency as to how their data is exposed to, and used by, third parties. It then requires innovating ways to actively engage participants. Facebook built a platform for mass sharing, but if it wants to change the world, it must also develop mechanisms for informed participation. With great power comes great responsibility.","Facebook's data says what people do but little about why they do it .

"London, England (CNN) -- Police in Gambia have seized a record haul of Europe-bound cocaine worth hundreds of millions of dollars, a statement from British authorities said Wednesday. The 2,100 kilograms (4,630 pounds) of cocaine has a street value potentially worth many times higher since it is often diluted with cutting agents. ""It is highly likely a large proportion of these drugs would have found their way onto the streets of Europe and the U.K.,"" said Neil Giles, deputy director for the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA), Britain's version of the FBI. ""Taking this cocaine, and the profits that it would have generated, out of the hands of criminals is a major blow to their operations,"" he said. Gambian police arrested 12 suspects including a citizen of the Netherlands and Venezuelan employees of a Gambian-based fishing company and confiscated arms and cash from suspected warehouses. British agents were called in to help with forensic investigations which led authorities to a hidden room stashed with cocaine that originated in Latin America, SOCA said. The bust -- the largest ever single seizure of cocaine in West Africa -- occurred last Friday in the capital of Banjul, according to SOCA. In recent years, Colombian and Mexican drug cartels have crossed the Atlantic Ocean and expanded into West Africa, working in tandem with local criminal gangs to carve out a staging area for an assault on the lucrative European market. Officials with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency say that not one West African country has been left untainted by drugs. Africa's Gold Coast is sometimes referred to now as the ""Coke Coast."" A driving force has been an expanding European market for cocaine, while use in the United States has declined from its peak in the 1980s, the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime said in its 2009 annual report. Criminals traffic about 250 tons of drugs to Europe each year, though not all of it makes it there, according to the United Nations. The European market totals about $11 billion. It's estimated that 27 percent of the cocaine that entered Europe in 2006 came from Africa. ""It has long been feared that cocaine traffickers might seek to exploit Gambia and other countries in the region as warehousing locations for drugs en route from South America to Europe,"" Giles said. He called the seizure ""highly significant"" because it showed the commitment of Gambian authorities to crack down. CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","Cocaine bust largest ever in West Africa, SOCA says .

"Hartford, Connecticut (CNN) -- I knew every last American had been touched by the World Cup when my father-in-law told me how much he enjoyed ""the first few innings"" of the Brazil-Ivory Coast match. Needless to say, he's just discovering soccer. He still thinks a red card is what communists keep in their wallets. And yet, like so many of his countrymen, he's suddenly been laid low by World Cup fever, whose symptoms include a dull headache and a stiff neck, the result -- in my case -- of practicing headers in the driveway. (""Practicing them for what?"" my wife inquired. But you never know when that call-up will come for the U-50 national team.) At long last, soccer ignorami in this country are becoming part of the international community. For most of this past week, I (an American citizen) felt schadenfreude (a German word for ""joy in the misery of others"") at the spectacular implosion of Les Bleus (the French national team, which mutinied against its own coach while crapping out of the tournament). That's three countries in a single emotion, the kind of geopolitical awakening most of us only get in America when walking into an International House of Pancakes. And so I can't stop singing that song from Nike's ubiquitous World Cup commercial, in which Italian lounge singer Bobby Solo serenades Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro with a chorus -- ""Che Cannavaro, Che Capitano"" -- that is as insidiously unshakeable as the World Cup itself. I interviewed Cannavaro in Milan a dozen years ago and have followed and occasionally covered international soccer for two decades. In America, I sometimes act like one of those bores who saw the Beatles in Hamburg before they made it big: that guy who feels smugly superior to the mass of fans who later fill the bandwagon. This kind of smugness has its advantages. A fellow school parent asked me yesterday: ""What's the name of that guy who coaches Argentina?"" When I said, ""Diego Maradona,"" she replied: ""How do you know all this stuff?"" Maradona is only the greatest soccer player of all time and one of Earth's most famous inhabitants, but I kept those secrets to myself, letting her think I'm a soccer sophisticate and repository of the game's most obscure trivia. I'm just happy that more people care, that the next time my father-in-law hears the name Donovan, he'll think of the American whose 91st-minute goal sent the U.S. to the knockout stages of the 2010 World Cup, not the Englishman whose song ""Mellow Yellow"" went to No. 2 in the charts in 1966. Someday, when my father-in-law thinks of 1966 as the year that England last won the World Cup, the tournament will have finally realized its manifest destiny. It will truly have conquered the world. It's almost there now. More and more Americans are succumbing. You may have noticed your fellow cubicle jockeys sounding like one of those English soccer announcers currently on loan to ESPN: decrying ""cynical"" tackles, praising ""beautifully weighted"" passes and pronouncing themselves, at the water cooler, too ""knackered"" to work. iReport: Do you have World Cup mania? Last Sunday, I saw a brand-new Manchester United license plate frame on a car in our church parking lot. The next day, an 8-year-old saw my toddler in an English soccer jersey at the park and yelled, correctly: ""He's got an Arsenal shirt on!"" These are hopeful signs. In much of America, in the month it is named for, the June bug abruptly appears, reaches maturity in July and then quickly dies off. Typically, the World Cup does the same. But this time, I think soccer, as grass-dwelling pests go, will be harder to eradicate. I know the game will be eating my lawn for years to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Rushin.","Steve Rushin is thrilled that more people are caring about soccer .

"Washington (CNN) -- A divided Supreme Court has ruled the government has the power to criminalize ""material support"" of a foreign terrorist organization. The 6-3 decision Monday preserves a key provision of the 2001 Patriot Act, amid claims it threatens the free-speech rights of Americans who would assist non-violent activities of certain militant and terror groups. At issue was the portion of the federal law that allows prosecution of those who provide ""any service, training, expert advice or assistance"" to a foreign terrorist organization, as designated by the U.S. government. ""Providing foreign terrorist groups with material support in any form,"" wrote Chief Justice John Roberts, ""furthers terrorism by straining the United State's relationship with its allies and undermines cooperative efforts between nations to prevent terrorist attacks."" Justice Stephen Breyer authored a powerful dissent, fearing the law could be interpreted too broadly by the government in the name of protecting Americans. ""Precisely how does application of the statute to the protected activities help achieve that important security-related end,"" he asked. Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, federal prosecutors have pursued ""material support"" cases against at least 125 individuals or organizations, winning convictions in about half of those cases. Nearly every domestic terrorism-related prosecution has included the charge as part of the indictment. Groups listed as ""foreign terrorist organizations"" by the State Department include al Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah. A federal appeals court in San Francisco, California, struck down several parts of the legislation, finding them too vague to satisfy the Constitution. The government then asked the high court to intervene and uphold the law. The key plaintiff in the appeal is the Humanitarian Law Project, a Los Angeles, California-based non-profit that says its mission is to advocate ""for the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts and for worldwide compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law."" It sought interaction with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a group active in Turkey. Known as PKK, the party has been labeled a terror organization by the United States and the European Union. Its leaders have called for militancy to create a separate Kurdish state in the parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran where Kurds are a majority. In its appeal to the high court, the government noted that ""since its inception, the organization has waged a violent insurgency that has claimed over 22,000 lives."" Humanitarian Law Project claimed it wanted to advocate on behalf of the PKK before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, and conduct other advisory sessions and public awareness campaigns. Breyer, in an unusual step, read a portion of his dissent from the bench. He said the majority wrongly read the law ""to forbid the teaching of any subject where national security concerns conflict with the First Amendment. The Constitution does not allow all such conflicts to be decided in the government's favor."" Breyer was supported by justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. The court's majority opinion was not a complete victory for the government and came with an important caveat. The activity in question can be banned only if ""coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups."" The justices gave no specific guidance on how that distinction should be made. The court also said the law does not extend the ban on material support to domestic groups. ""The government is wrong that the only thing actually at issue in this litigation is conduct,"" said Roberts. ""Plaintiffs want to speak to [certain foreign designated groups] and whether they may do so under [the federal law] depends on what they say. If plaintiffs' speech to those groups imparts a 'specific skill' or communicates advice derived from 'specialized knowledge' -- for example, training on the use of international law or advice on petitioning the United Nations -- then it is barred. On the other hand, plaintiffs' speech is not barred if it imparts only general or unspecialized knowledge."" Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan had argued the administration's case as solicitor general, back in February. That was before she was tapped by President Barack Obama. ""Hezbollah builds bombs,"" she said of the Palestinian militancy group. ""Hezbollah also builds homes. What Congress decided was when you help Hezbollah build homes, you are also helping Hezbollah build bombs. That's the entire theory behind this statute, and it's a reasonable theory."" Ralph Fertig, a 79-year-old civil rights lawyer who founded Humanitarian Law Project 25 years ago, told CNN he feared being arrested if he continued his international outreach efforts with groups designated as terrorists. ""My mission would be to work with these groups, to try and convince them to use peaceful means to resolve these ongoing conflicts,"" he said after the arguments. He filed the lawsuit against the government. There was no immediate reaction from his group or the government. But human rights groups criticized the ruling. ""The Supreme Court has ruled that human rights advocates, providing training and assistance in the nonviolent resolution of disputes, can be prosecuted as terrorists,"" said David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights. ""In the name of fighting terrorism, the court has said that the First Amendment permits Congress to make human rights advocacy and peacemaking a crime. That is wrong."" The Patriot Act was passed six weeks after the 9/11 terrorism attacks. It included amending a previous anti-terror law to strengthen the ""expert advice and assistance"" provision, making it a crime punishable by a 10-to-15 year prison sentence. The case is Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project (08-1498).","NEW: Applies only to activities coordinated or controlled by foreign terrorist groups .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's father will ""pursue any and all appropriate legal action"" to prevent his daughter from becoming ""another Hollywood statistic"" because of alcohol and substance abuse, Michael Lohan's lawyer said Monday. The much-publicized dispute between the actress-singer and her father boiled over last week when Michael Lohan persuaded a sheriff's deputy to help him enter her Hollywood home to check on the welfare of her 16-year-old sister. Lindsay Lohan's lawyer said it was ""nothing more than a publicity stunt."" Michael Lohan's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in a written statement Monday he was reacting to ""a problem millions of Americans have: What can a parent do when an adult child appears to have a serious alcohol or drug problem? What can a parent do when that adult child's life appears to be spiraling out of control? ""He has watched along with the rest of us over the past few months as Lindsay has been photographed partying and clubbing night after night, appearing as though she is under the influence of alcohol or substances,"" Bloom said. ""He is heartbroken about her current condition. With his own two eyes, just last week, he has seen her looking worse than ever."" Lindsay Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence. In the second incident, she also was charged with cocaine possession. She is on probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction and is participating in a required alcohol counseling program. She told the British newspaper The Sun earlier this year that she feared for her life while abusing substances to deal with family problems in 2007. She said she has since learned to embrace life instead of drugs. Her father said he flew to Los Angeles last week because of reports he was getting from friends about his 23-year-old daughter's behavior. ""Michael is not going to stand idly by and watch his daughter become another Hollywood statistic,"" Bloom said. ""He intends to do everything in his power to prevent Lindsay from becoming another Marilyn Monroe, Anna Nicole Smith, Michael Jackson, Heath Ledger or Corey Haim."" Bloom said she was hired ""to pursue any and all appropriate legal action to save and protect his daughter.""

"ALBANY, New York (CNN) -- Nick, 16, says ecstasy is rampant in his high school, with kids often mixing the drug with meth and other substances. More than half of all ecstasy seized in the United States last year was laced with meth, authorities say. ""You just have to know the right person. It's about as easy as any other drug. You just gotta ask for it,"" says Nick, who asked that his last name not be used. ""It's easy to get."" Law enforcement officials say stories like these highlight a disturbing trend they're seeing across the country. Most alarming, they say, is not only is ecstasy back after years of decline, but most of the time it's laced with meth. More than 55 percent of the ecstasy samples seized in the United States last year contained meth, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, compared with 44.5 percent the previous year. And the drugs are coming in at rapid pace from Canada.  Watch ecstasy's pipeline into U.S. » . Almost 5.5 million pills of ecstasy were seized in the states bordering Canada in 2006 (the most recent year for which full statistics are available) -- an almost tenfold increase since 2003, top drug enforcement officials say. ""They drive them in. They bring them in by boat. They bring them in by plane. They bring them across by people just carrying them across their back much like the southwest border,"" says Ed Duffy, an assistant special agent in charge for the Drug Enforcement Administration's northern region. Because meth is less expensive than ecstasy, mixing the two saves producers money, but it also makes it more dangerous, officials say. Ecstasy can cause sharp increases in body temperature and can result in liver, kidney or heart damage. When laced with meth, officials say, the combination can cause more severe harm because meth can damage brain functions, as well as lead to an increase in breathing, irregular heartbeats and increased blood pressure. The National Institute on Drug Abuse says meth -- or methamphetamine -- is a ""very addictive stimulant drug."" Law enforcement officials say European countries cracked down on ecstasy production in the early 2000s and manufacturing moved to Canada. And now, Asian gangs in Canada have been smuggling the chemicals needed to make ecstasy from China and India, officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police tell CNN. Finished pills are then pushed in vast quantities into the United States, a flow that's difficult to stop because of the vast, largely unpoliced border, officials say. Those on the front lines in Canada and the United States say they are working closely and sharing intelligence to try to stem the flow. Canadian officials also say they have a good relationship with Chinese law enforcement. The Mounties have created teams across Canada focused on identifying the criminal organizations producing ecstasy and meth and say they have shut down 17 labs in the past year. ""The labs that we're finding now are what you refer to in the United States as super labs. We call them economic-based labs,"" says Raf Souccar, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Each lab produces more than 10 pounds of ecstasy in one batch, he says. ""It's not your mom and pop operation. It tells me that it is criminal organizations that are, yes, more sophisticated and producing it for profit as opposed to producing it to fuel their habit."" It's then finding its way into schools, like Nick's in Albany, New York. ""I have been seeing an increase in pill use among the teens in general,"" says Greg Reid, a counselor at Equinox Community Services Agency, which sponsors drug counseling and other activities for youth in Albany. ""They do something called 'pharming' where they throw a bunch of pills into a bowl and kind of choose or take out the pills they want."" Ecstasy pills are often among the drugs of choice in the bowl. ""I have seen that increase in the past two years,"" Reid says.

"Grozny, Chechnya (CNN) -- It has been ten years since my last visit to Chechnya. I knew the place had changed. I didn't realize how much. For a decade, Chechnya was the most violent, hopeless, war-torn corner of Russia. Russia's impoverished, conscript army had been locked in an ugly struggle with Chechen insurgents that left the region's capital, Grozny, a smoking ruin. Much of the civilian population was either homeless or had fled. Meanwhile, even the most courageous reporters and human rights activists thought twice about sneaking into the republic. By the end of the 1990s, Chechen gangs made a lucrative business out of kidnapping and ransom. The kidnappers became quite adept at chopping off hostage body parts on camera, to provide gruesome video incentive for swift payment. Imagine my surprise, then, when Russian government minders pick us up at Chechnya's newly-constructed airport, and then send a busload of foreign journalists to sparkling downtown Grozny without any armed escort. A decade ago, the only illumination in Grozny would have come from tracer bullets and the campfires of traumatized residents whose homes had been destroyed. Today, a giant, Turkish-built mosque glows at the center of a park rigged with rows of retro-style street lamps. Families wander around on sidewalks in the balmy air. There is not a single gunman or soldier in sight. For the next two days of this Kremlin-supervised junket, I strain to find signs of the bullet-holes and shrapnel scars that once seemed to pock-mark every piece of concrete in Chechnya. Instead, in Chechnya's second largest city of Gudermes, I find armies of workers -- including migrant laborers from East Asia -- busily constructing high-rises and roads. Downtown Gudermes is getting an architectural face-lift. Ten years ago, when I wandered off from a Russian military ""embed"" trip to Gudermes, Chechen locals joked openly about how much I would be worth if they kidnapped me, prompting me to hustle back to my army escort. Today, residents sing a very different tune. ""We thought it would take 50 years to rebuild this town,"" one Chechen man wearing in a wide-brimmed black hat tells me. ""It's a miracle how quickly this has happened here!"" The Kremlin clearly spent untold billions of rubles rebuilding the most unruly of Russian republics. It also struck a deal several years ago with a brash former rebel fighter named Ramzan Kadyrov. His Chechen security forces began taking the lead in operations against the insurgents. Today, Kadyrov is the president of the Chechen republic. This fiercely loyal supporter of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has adopted the bizarre habits one comes to expect from a Middle Eastern despot. Kadyrov races around his fiefdom driving his own black SUV, dressed in shiny track suits and baseball caps. His mansion, a half hour's drive out of Grozny, has its own horse race track, a show room full of antique guns and sabers, the Cyrillic initials ""RK"" carved into the building's façade and a private zoo full of lions, tigers and other big, endangered wildcats. The roars of one of these animals echoes throughout the compound as we wait until well after midnight for a press conference with the Chechen strongman. When Kadyrov finally arrives, he makes an announcement of victory. ""We are in the final stages of our struggle,"" he says, and then goes on to claim there are only 187 fighters left in Chechnya's insurgent movement. Most of them, he adds, are foreigners. But peace in Chechnya has come at a disturbing price. For some reason, critics of Kadyrov and his security forces keep getting killed. Last July, Natalia Estemirova, an activist with the human rights group Memorial, was kidnapped in broad daylight in downtown Grozny and later found dead with two bullets to the head. ""This crime couldn't have been committed without the participation of some law enforcement agencies,"" says Dokka Itslaev, the Chechen man who has assumed Estemirova's former position at Memorial. ""Certain forces in Chechnya reserve the right to kidnap, kill or torture whoever they want."" More recently, police in Austria linked one of Kadyrov's top aides to the January 2009 shooting death in Vienna of Umar Israilov. The former Chechen rebel served in Kadyrov's security forces and later testified against Kadyrov before the European Court of Human Rights. Moments after his murder, Austrian police said one of the suspects called a cell phone in Chechnya believed to belong to one of Kadyrov's right-hand men, Shaa Turlayev. Turlayev visited Vienna and met with the suspect a few months before the murder. Kadyrov denied any links to the murder, while delivering a lengthy monologue. ""I knew this guy [Umar Israilov] personally,"" he said during the midnight press conference. ""It would have been so stupid and so obvious to kill people in broad daylight. Why would I do this? Did he kill any of my people? If he did, maybe then I would have considered it."" The Kremlin now relies on Kadyrov, along with the many potentially explosive skeletons in his closet, to guarantee peace and stability in Chechnya. But while Chechnya has stabilized, the neighboring Russian regions of Dagestan and Ingushetia have grown more violent then ever, with frequent car bombs and assassinations. Caucasus experts say the Chechen nationalist movement that once challenged Moscow has morphed into a broader Islamist rebel movement that threatens to engulf the Russian North Caucasus. That violence seems worlds' away from the brand-new ice skating rink that we visit in Grozny one night. Dance music throbs as young Chechen men on ice skates crash into each other, laughing; some of them hug the sideboards to avoid collapsing on the ice. It is a silly, wonderful sight to see in a city that had endured so many years of war and hopelessness. But how long can Kadyrov's huge public works projects and scary security forces ensure stability, with so much trouble brewing nextdoor and unemployment still sky high within Chechnya? The cliché that Chechnya is ""skating on thin ice,"" springs to mind -- especially after I notice that one of the Chechen men, teetering comically on the ice, is skating with a pistol strapped to his belt.","Chechnya has seen construction surge in formerly war-torn areas .

"VERACRUZ, Mexico (CNN) -- With Hurricane Dean hours away from a second dangerous encounter with Mexico, government officials warned residents of Veracruz and other coastal towns to prepare for its arrival. A resident tries to make his way through a flooded street in Chetumal, Mexico, Tuesday. Not only is the area particularly prone to flooding, a nuclear plant near the city supplies power to much of northern Mexico. While the facility itself is safe, high winds could affect some pylons carrying electricity away from the plant, CNN's Karl Penhaul reported. Winds were picking up and waves were growing higher as evening fell in Veracruz, he said, even though Dean's predicted landfall was 12 to 18 hours away. After raking Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula earlier, making landfall as a Category 5 storm -- the most extreme level on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity -- Dean was back to Category 1 as it entered the Bay of Campeche later Tuesday. It was forecast to build back up to Category 2 intensity before its second landfall. At 11 p.m. ET, Dean's maximum sustained winds remained near 80 mph as the storm moved  west-northwest at near 18 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. ""On this forecast track, Dean is expected to be very near the coast of central Mexico during the day Wednesday,"" according to the center.  See the storm's projected path » . Authorities set up temporary shelters around Tuxpan, Mexico, with the capacity to hold thousands, according to Ramon Rodriguez, municipal president of the city. The evacuation of 5,000 people in the urban areas and 4,500 people in the rural areas was under way, he said. Residents of unstable areas were being urged to go to temporary shelters as soon as possible. On the Yucatan, Mexico's tourist areas dodged a bullet, but President Felipe Calderon expressed concern for some of the peninsula's poor Mayan communities that may have borne the brunt of the storm.  Watch Dean batter Mexico » . ""We still have to know what happened in the more isolated communities,"" Calderon said, speaking at a summit in Quebec, Canada, with President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The Mexican leader left the summit early, saying he would head to the Yucatan to ""supervise the rescue missions"" which will concentrate on the poorer indigenous communities. ""I have a great deal of concern for the housing and the lack of services in that general area for the indigenous people there and that will be the main area of concern for us,"" he said. Calderon said the government suspended oil production near the city of Campeche, Mexico's main oil production center, as Dean passed -- cutting off about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day -- and evacuated nearly 20,000 workers from oil platforms in the area. Downed power lines and damaged buildings were reported in Mexico and northern Belize. But even in the hardest-hit area, Red Cross officials said, no deaths were reported and there was only one minor injury, CNN's Gary Tuchman said.  See CNN correspondents track Dean through Mexico » . Streets were flooded in Chetumal, just south of where Dean's center made landfall around 4:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. ET) with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (266 kph), according to the hurricane center.  Power was out in the coastal city, where most of the 130,000 residents appeared to have heeded government warnings to seek shelter or evacuate. But overall, there was no major damage in Chetumal and the sense was that ""this could have been a lot worse,"" CNN's Harris Whitbeck reported. Watch CNN coverage as Dean made landfall . The storm's eye passed just south of the resort areas of Cozumel and Cancun, Mexico, striking a rural and sparsely populated area. Watch as Dean sweeps through Playa del Carmen . Some of those Mayan communities Calderon spoke of were evacuated several days ago, Whitbeck said. About 3,500 Mayan Indians fled from a nature preserve where they live. But many other isolated communities must still be checked out. Ancient Mayan ruins in the town of Tulum, south of Cancun, held up well, resident Enrique Perez told CNN. But the town itself was battered. Local officials say about a third of the hotels and beach cabins in Tulum were damaged, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, in Jamaica, residents cleaned up fallen trees and debris Monday as the island nation started to recover from its brush with Dean on Sunday.  See I-Reports of what Dean has done across the Caribbean » . Dean is being blamed for at least nine deaths in its march across the Caribbean, including two in Jamaica, two in Haiti, two in Martinique, two in Dominica and one in St. Lucia. Mexico's Yucatan resort region was devastated in 2005 by Wilma, a Category 3 hurricane. But lessons learned from the fierce storm helped the Yucatan area better prepare for Dean, Quintana Roo Tourism Secretary Gabriella Rodriguez told CNN. ""This was a piece of cake compared to Wilma,"" she said. The U.S. military's Southern Command, said it had deployed a 25-person damage assessment team to Belize. Ahead of the storm, the Mexican government deployed 4,000 troops to the area, and a state of emergency was declared in the inland state of Campeche, where residents were bracing for as much as 20 inches of rain in some places. Forecasters do not believe Dean presents a threat to the United States, although officials in Texas continued to make storm preparations just in case Dean's path takes an unexpected turn. A hurricane warning remains in effect along Mexico's Gulf Coast from the tip of the Yucatan's Gulf Coast near the town of Progreso, northward to Tampico, where ""preparations ... should be rushed to completion,"" the NHC said.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain is reeling from its most severe drought in 70 years with the nation's reservoirs on average just half full, the Environment Ministry reports. The tower of a former church, underwater before the drought, reappears in the Mediano reservoir. Rainfall has been less than half of what's considered normal for the last six months and reservoir levels were already low after two years in which normal rain levels failed to rebound from the driest 12 months on record -- October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2005. The worst-hit areas are the Catalonia region -- whose capital, Barcelona, is the nation's second-largest city -- and central Spain in the Castilla-La Mancha region near Madrid, according to Antonio Mestre, a climate specialist at the State Meteorological Agency in Madrid. The Baells reservoir near Barcelona is about 20 percent full, and in some places it appears to be bone dry. A little row boat could this week be seen resting on the sandy dirt bottom of the reservoir. In a nearby village, Gelida, trucks already bring drinking water every week because the town's three wells are too dry. It's become a political headache for Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who is just starting his second term. ""Despite the difficult drought years,"" Zapatero said in the investiture debate in parliament, ""there's been no shortage of drinking water anywhere in the country."" But Barcelona might run out by October. The government has decided to quickly build a water pipeline for 60 kilometers (37 miles) along the major AP-7 highway, to pump water in to Barcelona, if necessary by the autumn and depending on reservoir levels at that time. The project would cost 180 million euros ($280 million). The water would come from the Ebro river and that has sparked protests from the regional governments of Valencia and Murcia, down the Mediterranean coast from Barcelona, that the central government is favoring Barcelona. Valencia and Murcia leaders this week threatened to take the case to the Constitutional Court, the highest in Spain. Barcelona-area officials already have restricted the use of water for home gardens and parks and public fountains. They have also considered bringing drinking water in by boat. To tackle chronic water shortages, Spain in recent years has also invested heavily in desalination plants, which take the salt of sea water to make it drinkable -- but several are not yet finished, including one that would serve Barcelona. The latest drought hits Spain just after tens of thousands of new vacation homes have sprung up en masse along the coast in recent years, along with dozens of new golf courses thirsting to stay green. ""The amount of water resources depend not only on precipitation, but also on consumption,"" Mestre said. ""The water demand in Spain has increased a lot in the last 10 or 15 years."" Despite recent showers, the past six months are the driest period in Spain in 70 years, when record-keeping began, Mestre said. Farmers also compete for the water, to irrigate their fields, which are suffering in the latest drought. Some critics say that successive Spanish governments have repeatedly taken short term measures during droughts, rather than making long-term water-use plans. One old fisherman at the Riosequillo reservoir - an hour north of Madrid and just a third full despite the recent rains - said he'd never seen it so bad. ""We'd have so much progress,"" said Gregorio Consentini, the 78-year-old fisherman, ""but we're doing badly."" To make matters worse, he didn't catch any fish that day -- which he also blamed on the drought. E-mail to a friend .","Spanish reservoirs on average half full after six dry months .

"(CNN) -- The problem of planes hitting birds comes down to a key fact: ""We're competing for airspace,"" says Richard Dolbeer, a biologist who spent 20 years studying the problem at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Richard Dolbeer says ""bird strikes that would disable both engines on an aircraft is fortunately a rare event."" Populations of large birds have increased dramatically since the 1970s, when environmental regulations were instituted in the United States. Birds have become more accustomed to living in urban environments near airports and the number of airline flights has risen sharply, according to Dolbeer. Dolbeer, who retired in September 2008 and is now a consultant on the issue, spoke with CNN hours after a US Airways plane crash-landed in the Hudson River in New York after an apparent bird strike. He retired as National Coordinator for the Airport Wildlife Hazards Program and was chairperson of Bird Strike Committee-USA from 1997-2008. CNN: How big a problem are bird strikes? Dolbeer: Every year, approximately 7,000 to 8,000 bird strikes are reported to the Federal Aviation Administration primarily by commercial airlines nationwide. The reporting is a voluntary system. It's not mandatory, so we know that not all of the bird strikes are being reported. We estimate that as much as 80 percent of the strikes are not reported. It's a fairly common occurrence to have bird strikes, but to have bird strikes that would disable both engines on an aircraft is fortunately a rare event. CNN: What are some of the most serious instances of bird strikes? Dolbeer: In 1995, at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, a Boeing 707, a wide-bodied jet adapted to military use as a surveillance plane, ingested Canada geese into two of four engines. It crashed a mile away and killed 24 airmen. In Rome, Italy, in November, a Boeing 737, which is very similar to the Airbus 320, flew through a flock of starlings and both engines were disabled. The pilot was able to land the plane on the runway, but it collapsed the landing gear and did extensive damage to the aircraft. There were a few injuries, but no one was killed. Last March in Oklahoma City, a business jet was taking off and it struck a flock of white pelicans, which is another species which is increasing. It crashed into a wood lot and killed all five businesspeople aboard. The root of the problem right now is that because of the very successful wildlife conservation programs in North America since the 1970s, we've seen a tremendous resurgence of many wildlife species, particularly large bird species -- species that weigh over 4 pounds, including Canada geese, snow geese, bald eagles, great blue herons, double-crested cormorants, turkey vultures and black vultures. In fact, of the 36 species of birds in North America that weigh over 4 pounds, 24 of those have shown population increases, nine have shown stable populations and only one has shown a decline in the last 30 years. The Canada goose population in the United States -- the resident Canada geese, not the migrant birds from Canada -- has increased from 1 million birds in 1990 to about 3.9 million in 2008. In addition to these populations increasing, they've also adapted to urban environments. They're not afraid to associate with people. Traffic doesn't bother them, aircraft don't bother them. So they're more likely to be seen near airports. Another important factor is modern turbofan aircraft like the Airbus 320. Their engines are much quieter than older aircraft. And almost all the noise comes out of the back of the engine. Birds are less able to hear or see modern aircraft. There are more airplanes in the sky, more birds in the sky and this is where the conflict comes in. The number of strikes being reported is definitely increasing. In 1990, the FAA had approximately 1,750 strikes reported. And in 2007, the last year we have data, we had 7,600. Some of that may be due to a little better reporting, but there are also more aircraft flying today. CNN: What can be done to prevent these strikes? Dolbeer: There are three basic things that airports can do and many airports are doing. One is habitat management at the airport to make it as sterile as possible for birds -- by eliminating standing water, keeping grass where you don't have weeds producing seeds which attract birds, reducing perching areas for the birds, posts and things birds can perch on, covering up garbage, not allowing landfills close to an airport, making an airport as sanitary as possible. That would also include rodent control -- eliminating small mammals that owls and hawks might be attracted to -- and insect controls. Habitat management is the No. 1 defense. The second is dispersal of birds by a trained bird control crew that goes out and uses pyrotechnics and other means to scare the birds away when they do come onto the airport. Some airports use trained dogs. A few airports train falcons. The idea is to scare the birds, harass the birds. The third area is removal of birds when the habitat management and dispersal do not work. Sometimes Canada geese become accustomed to the harassment and they're not scared by it anymore. Airports get permits to remove some Canada geese by using a shotgun to demonstrate to the other birds that this is not a place to be. These are very selective lethal controls. Now, with regard to aircraft, there is research under way looking at can you enhance the visibility of aircraft to birds, using UV reflective paint since birds can see in the UV-range and using flashing lights. Are there things which can be mounted on aircraft to make them more visible to birds? This is just in an experimental stage. One final area of research is the use of bird-detecting radar to help air traffic control and pilots to detect the birds and help drive planes around concentrations of birds. This is not operational, it's in a developmental stage. None of these things are going to be silver bullets. No one technique or procedure is going to solve the problem. CNN: Are enough resources being applied to solve this problem? Dolbeer: It's an area that needs more attention. Airports have bird control programs to varying degrees. It has not been a high-profile area of work. We need to devote more resources to this problem, particularly given the increasing number of birds we have. We're competing for airspace. It's a complex issue. This incident will perhaps really focus peoples' attention to do a better job of solving the problem.","Richard Dolbeer: Planes are contending with an increasing number of birds .

"Anchorage, Alaska (CNN) -- It's 3 degrees and snowing outside the Alaska Volcano Observatory in Anchorage, but inside the operations center, things are heating up. Geologist Michelle Coombs monitors the Redoubt volcano from the Alaska Volcano Observatory. ""This is kind of the nerve center, if you will,"" says geologist Michelle Coombs, who is at the helm of a bank of video monitors showing readouts from sensors on Mount Redoubt, a volcano about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage. The sensors measure seismic activity on the volcano's summit. Scientists at the observatory combine that information with data gathered from daily airplane flights to the volcano to measure gases and try to figure out if and when Redoubt is going to blow. ""We're seeing lots of little earthquakes right now,"" says Coombs. ""As that magma rises, it breaks rock as it gets to the surface, and it also it gives off gases, and that leads to the seismic activities were seeing now."" When the magma, or molten rock, makes it to the surface, the volcano will erupt. A siren goes off, and one of the video monitors goes haywire. Is the mountain erupting?  Learn more about Mount Redoubt » . ""That's just a little alarm. There was just a little bit of increased seismic activity,"" Coombs says reassuringly. ""It's a special kind of earthquake particular to volcanoes called a long-period earthquake. It has more to do with fluid and gases than with breaking rock.""  Watch Coombs keeping an eye on Redoubt » . Since the monitors first showed increased activity on January 23, the observatory has been staffed 24 hours a day. Scientists here are calling in reinforcements; several geologists from the Lower 48 have been making their way north to help. Coombs thinks Redoubt will erupt within days or weeks. No one lives near the mountain, which sits on the Cook Inlet and is largely surrounded by glacier ice. That means there is no direct danger from lava flows, but huge clouds of ash could spread throughout Alaska. When Redoubt last erupted in 1989, it spread ash across Alaska for five months. ""Geologists like to use the past as a key to the future, and previous historical eruptions of Redoubt have produced ash clouds of up to 40,000 feet above sea level,"" says Coombs. She notes that at current weather conditions, ""it would take about three hours for that ash to leave the volcano and arrive in Anchorage."" The ash is composed largely of silica, which is similar to tiny fragments of glass. Down on the ground, the ash can be dangerous to breath in and can damage cars as their engines draw the ash into their engines. But it is usually a nuisance. However, in the sky, the ash clouds can create very dangerous flying conditions for jets. ""For jet aviation, it's a very severe hazard because jet engines run at a very high temperature. And once that silica-rich ash gets ingested into the engine, it can remelt and coat the insides of the engines and freeze up those engines,"" says Coombs. ""That's really the major thing we are trying to avoid here."" The day after the 1989 eruption of Redoubt, a 747 flew into an ash cloud near Anchorage and all four engines stalled. The pilot was able to get two of the engines restarted, and the plane landed safely. Coombs says airspace around the volcano and Anchorage may be closed if Redoubt erupts. When the alarms aren't blaring, Coombs sends out the official Twitter feeds from the observatory and tries to stay warm. She is eight months' pregnant. ""People have been joking, 'Are you going to name him redoubt?' "" she says with a laugh, then shakes her head and gets back to her monitors.","In the cold Alaskan winter, geologist keeps watch on Mount Redoubt .

"(CNN) -- ""Planet in Peril: Battle Lines"" traveled to a place off the coast of South Africa known as ""shark alley,"" one of the best places in the world to see great white sharks. CNN traveled to ""shark alley"" off the coast of South Africa, one of the best places in the world to see great whites. Shark tourism has become big business, bringing in more than $30 million every year to South Africa. The experience is a major draw for tourists, but it's controversial. Local surfers and swimmers say it is changing shark behavior and may be causing more attacks.   Anderson Cooper swam with these great white sharks -- without a cage -- as part of his report for ""Planet in Peril: Battle Lines."" He talked about the experience Thursday morning with ""American Morning"" anchors John Roberts and Kiran Chetry. Anderson Cooper: We went diving with great white sharks. There is a big controversy over whether or not these cage tour operators are actually changing sharks' behavior. They chum the water to attract the sharks, tourists get in the water, and so we had the opportunity to go cage diving and also to go free diving with the sharks, which is a pretty rare thing.

"PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Trash litters its cities. Electricity is sporadic at best. There is no clean water. Medical and educational services are limited. Basic infrastructure is severely lacking. ""Planet in Peril"" met in a secret location with members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta. These are not conditions that should plague one of the richest oil states in the world. Hundreds of billions of dollars has been made from the Niger Delta's oil reserves and many people have gotten very rich. Conversely, the average Nigerian has suffered as a result of the country's oil prosperity. The United States Agency for International Development says more than 70 percent of the country lives on less than a dollar a day -- the population is among the 20 poorest in the world. Oil companies are only part of the equation. The other is the Nigerian government. Transparency International, a global organization intent on stamping out corruption, has consistently rated Nigeria's government one of the most corrupt in the world. Nigeria's federal government and oil companies split oil profits roughly 60-40. The money is then supposed to make its way down to the local governments to fund various projects. Somehow, little money actually reaches its intended destination. Nigeria's own corruption agency estimates between $300 billion to $400 billion has been stolen or wasted over the last 50 years.  Lisa Ling travels to secret location to meet notorious Nigerian militant group » . Gov. Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers state, one of the largest oil producers of Nigeria's 36 states, acknowledges past problems with corruption, but thinks progress is being made. ""There's a lot of improvement,"" Amaechi said. ""The work being done by the corruption agency and the federal government has somehow been able to control the level of corruption in government."" Over the last few years, a culture of militancy and violence has arisen in the absence of jobs and services. Kidnappings for ransom, robberies and even murder happen with regularity. The biggest and most powerful armed group is the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND. They say they are at war against the Nigerian military and the oil companies operating there. MEND, formed in 2005, said it has more than 30 camps throughout Nigeria. Members are armed with high-tech weaponry they said was obtained from ""foreign sources."" Hundreds of people have been killed on both sides and countless oil workers have been kidnapped. Over the years, MEND's attacks on oil pipelines have halted oil production and, therefore, raised the price of oil around the world. They demand oil profits be distributed to average Nigerians of the Niger Delta and said they will not stop their attacks until their objectives have been fulfilled.  See environmental battle lines for ""Planet in Peril"" » . The battle is over oil -- one of the world's most valuable resources. But to most Nigerians -- oil is a curse. It has provoked an environmental disaster of monstrous proportions. Since the 1970s, the United Nations estimates there have been more than 6,000 oil spills in the Niger Delta -- that is equal to more than 10 times the amount spilled from the Exxon Valdez in 1989. Yet, there is no international outcry and rarely are the spills reported, even to most Nigerians. They are still happening and the consequences are nothing short of devastating. Communities along the Niger Delta have lived off subsistence fishing and agriculture for decades. Collecting food becomes impossible when a spill happens, like one that occurred in August. The waterways and mangroves are blanketed in thick brown oil sludge that goes on for miles. Toxicity overpowers the air and a sense of lifelessness pervades the landscape. Many say it will take 10-15 years for the area to be free of contamination -- if the cleanup effort commences in a timely manner. The August spill was a result of a leak from an old pipeline that had corroded. It took the oil company three months to clamp the leak, but the company said it wasn't reported for a full month after it began. Once the leak was reported, the company said it was denied access to the site by the community. Leaders of the village deny that, and the finger-pointing between the two sides is nothing new -- there is no love lost here.  Who is telling the truth? Who knows? Either way, the creeks are blackened. This is life in the Niger Delta.","Nigeria is one of world's richest oil states; people are among poorest in world .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved the nomination of federal Judge Sonia Sotomayor to become the nation's first Hispanic Supreme Court justice, setting up a final confirmation vote by the Senate. With Republican senators' support, Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation by the full Senate is a virtual certainty. The 13-6 committee vote was mostly on partisan lines, with one Republican joining the panel's Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. At least five Republican senators have announced their intention to support Sotomayor, making confirmation by the Democratic-controlled Senate a virtual certainty. Sotomayor, 55, is President Obama's first nominee to the nation's highest court. She would be 111th person to sit on the Supreme Court, and the third female justice. The Judiciary Committee held a four-day confirmation hearing earlier this month that foreshadowed Tuesday's vote, with Democrats praising Sotomayor's 17-year record as a federal judge and her made-in-America story as a minority woman who rose to success through hard work and opportunity. Republicans questioned her judicial neutrality, complaining about speeches in which she made controversial statements, including her hope that a ""wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences"" would reach a better conclusion than a white man ""who hasn't lived that life."" Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the lone Republican to back Sotomayor, said Tuesday that he still has concerns about her impartiality. Some of her speeches ""bugged the hell out of me,"" Graham said, but he added that some of his own speeches probably ""bugged the hell out of people on the other side"" of the political divide. Graham praised Sotomayor's competence and qualifications, and he joked that she was unlikely to be worse than the justice she was chosen to replace, David Souter, a liberal. ""She can be no worse than Souter from our point of view,"" he said to fellow Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, who opposed Sotomayor.  See how Sotomayor compares with Supreme Court justices » . Graham also noted that Sotomayor is a unique historical figure. ""This is the first Latina woman in the history of the U.S. to be nominated to the Supreme Court. That is a big deal,"" he said, although he said it was neither a reason to vote for or against her. It was the first time that any of the Republican opponents had voted against a Supreme Court nominee put forward by either a Democratic or Republican president. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said Tuesday that he ""genuinely wrestled with this decision,"" but that in studying Sotomayor's speeches, articles and cases, he found a ""troubling approach to judging"" that the judge's testimony before the committee did not resolve. He said he believes she gave short shrift to constitutional rights and used inappropriate legal standards in deciding cases. Democrats on the panel praised the judge, with Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California saying: ""I see her as a most impressive person on a number of different levels."" Referring to Sotomayor's judicial record, Feinstein said she found ""no example of infidelity to the law."" Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a former Republican and the longest-serving member of the panel, said Sotomayor was the best nominee of the 11 he has reviewed over the years. Specter also praised the ""wise Latina"" comment, saying: ""If a woman didn't stand up for women, I wouldn't think much of her."" Obama's Democratic Party holds a 58-40 edge in the full Senate, with two independents considered part of the Democratic caucus.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Two key Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee announced their opposition to Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor on Friday, a further sign the party's conservative base is uniting against President Obama's first high court pick. Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination is to be put to a vote in the Judiciary Committee next week. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the former chairman of the committee, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, head of the party's Senate campaign committee, announced on the Senate floor their intention to vote against the 55-year-old federal appeals court judge. Hatch's decision came as something of a surprise. The veteran Republican has voted for every high court nominee in his 32-year Senate career, including President Clinton's two liberal choices, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Hatch had praised Sotomayor's ""credentials and experience"" and the fact that she would be the first Hispanic justice. But despite the nominee's compelling life story, Hatch said that controversial off-the-bench comments by Sotomayor troubled him. ""I reluctantly, and with a heavy heart, have found that I cannot support her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Hatch said in a written statement. ""In truth, I wish President Obama had chosen a Hispanic nominee that all senators could support. I believe it would have done a great deal for our great country. Although Judge Sotomayor has a compelling life story and dedication to public service, her statements and record were too much at odds with the principles about the judiciary in which I deeply believe."" Cornyn candidly admitted that his opposition to Sotomayor could carry political risks in his home state, where one-third of the electorate is Hispanic. ""Voting to confirm a judge -- this judge or any judge -- despite doubts would certainly be the politically expedient thing to do, but I don't believe it would be the right thing to do,"" he said on the Senate floor. ""Many of her public statements reflected a surprisingly radical view of the law,"" he said. He argued that the ""stakes are simply too high for me to confirm someone who could address all these issues from a liberal, activist perspective."" Seven other Republicans have said they would vote against Sotomayor. Five mostly moderate GOP lawmakers announced their intention to back her. A vote is scheduled for Tuesday in the Judiciary Committee, followed by an expected final floor vote a week later. There is little doubt about the outcome, and Republican Party leaders have said no filibuster is planned. Conservative groups have been pushing Republican senators to rally hard against Sotomayor. The National Rifle Association stressed the intensity of its opposition to her nomination Thursday, warning senators that their votes will be considered in its future candidate evaluations. Among those supporting Sotomayor is conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, whose folksy questioning of the nominee during last week's confirmation hearings attracted wide attention. His decision brought a rebuke from the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network, which slammed Graham's support ""based upon his apparent willful blindness to her record, both on the bench and off, of indulging her own ethnic and gender biases, personal political views, and liberal agenda in the name of 'law.'"" The network's counsel, Wendy Long, dismissed Graham's ""cynical, pandering comments during the Judiciary Committee hearings, which were clearly aimed at drawing attention to himself rather than illuminating the role of the court in our constitutional republic."" Some Republican moderates have privately expressed concern that attacking Sotomayor could hurt the party's efforts to attract more Hispanics and women, especially since her confirmation seems assured. Sotomayor's ""wise Latina"" comments were cited by Cornyn and others as reason for opposing her. The Texas Republican said Sotomayor was less than forthcoming when explaining her remarks in a 2001 speech. Sotomayor told a group of Hispanic law students that ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experience, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" She has echoed the sentiment in related talks she has given over the years. Cornyn said the remarks contrasted sharply with her pledge during her confirmation hearings to rule on cases without personal bias. ""Who is the real Judge Sonia Sotomayor?"" he asked.","Sen. Orrin Hatch says nominee's off-the-bench comments are troubling .

"PINEDALE, Wyoming (CNN) -- Call it modern horse-trading. Balancing the nation's energy needs with its interests in protecting wildlife and habitats. An antelope grazes near a gas well in Jonah Field, one of the hot spots for natural gas in Wyoming. The practice is playing out in Wyoming, where energy companies pumped 2.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from the ground last year -- produced in 20 of the state's 23 counties. That's enough gas to heat every home in Michigan for seven years. And good-paying jobs, public works projects and money for higher education have benefited Wyoming. But there's a trade-off: Wildlife populations are taking a hit. Populations of the West's iconic mule deer are down where drilling is prevalent; the sage grouse, a bird which conservationists consider a harbinger of how other wildlife are faring, has seen adult populations plunge near gas rig sites. If grouse aren't surviving, biologists say, that means bad news for animals like antelope, bighorn sheep and pygmy rabbits. Five years ago, there were about 10,000 wells spread across Wyoming. By the end of 2007, the federal Bureau of Land Management estimates that 30,000 wells will be pumping natural gas.  Watch a bird's eye view of a natural gas field » . Companies such as Shell, EnCana, BP and Questar operate the rigs. ""The West is the last unexploited frontier for gas reserves in the U.S.,"" said Fadel Gheit, an Oppenheimer and Co. senior energy analyst. ""Market prices are skyrocketing. We've drilled the Gulf of Mexico down to Swiss cheese."" But Gheit concedes, ""It's not good for the environment, no question."" On a June morning, standing in the middle of one of Wyoming's largest gas fields, Brian Rutledge, a wildlife biologist and the executive director of the Audubon Society of Wyoming, surveys acres of endless sage brush and rigs in the distance. ""These lands are some of the last vestiges of the American West we have, home to hundreds of species who won't survive if their habitat is fragmented by rigs,"" he said. ""Once it's gone, it's gone. A boom goes bust eventually."" ""We have to ask ourselves, 'Is getting cheaper gas now worth the future cost to the land?' "" Recent studies have shown the sage grouse and mule deer are in jeopardy, their habitat hurt by gas drilling, biologists say. Power lines are convenient places for raptors and other grouse predators to perch. Rigs sit on sagebrush, the grouse's primary food source. And loud activity disrupts the grouse's mating rituals. Mule deer are down by 42 percent in areas where drilling is prevalent, according to a 2006 study conducted by independent ecologists and biologists and paid for by gas corporation Questar. Gas corporations are required to perform wildlife analysis of lands where they intend to drill. Between 2001 and 2005, University of Montana biologist David Naugle attached radio collars to birds in and outside gas fields in northeast Wyoming. He found as much as an 80 percent reduction in adult birds inside the Powder River Basin, a hot spot of gas production. Matt Holloran performed his doctoral thesis at the University of Wyoming on the effect of gas drilling on the grouse on the Pinedale Anticline. ""It's getting worse over time,"" said Holloran, now a senior ecologist with a private conservation firm. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service opted not to classify the bird as endangered in 2005. But a representative said the recent numbers are alarming and the agency may move to reassess the decision.  See a sample of endangered species around the country » . So concerned by the grouse's dwindling numbers, Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal called a summit on the bird last month, drawing hundreds of conservationists, scientists and gas industry executives. ""We have a bull's-eye on our back,"" Freudenthal said. ""I see it as an imbalance. The BLM has one objective and that is drilling. It wasn't always this way. There used to be some concern for habitat preservation, and I'm worried that's gone out the door."" Freudenthal's comments were echoed in more than 90,000 letters the public submitted to the BLM in June objecting to the agency's plan to allow 8,000 more gas wells on 1.6 million acres in a field near Pinedale. But BLM spokeswoman Cindy Wertz said biologists are performing thorough wildlife and habitat assessments before drilling commences and gas companies are required to repair the land when drilling ends. And gas companies are spending money to repair the damage they do, like replanting sage brush, which is food for animals. ""We are drilling more, yes, and the sage grouse numbers are challenging. But our wildlife protections are the same as they've always been,"" Wertz said. That, however, is not what a 2006 internal BLM document stated. It said the agency failed for six years to monitor air pollution caused by drilling on public land in the West. The BLM provides ""no evaluation, analysis or compiling"" of data tracking drilling affects on the environment, it reads. BLM's lead biologist in Pinedale between 2004 and 2006, Steve Belinda, quit because he says the agency values gas development over wildlife protection. ""The habitat used to be treated as a valuable resource,"" he said. ""Now the BLM biologist acts as a support person to get permits processed, period."" The majority of the wells in Wyoming are on two fields in Pinedale, a town with one grocery store and a weekly newspaper. Folks here talk about a popular bumper sticker: ""Lord, thank you for the boom, may it not go bust."" Lauren McKeever, an assistant to Pinedale's mayor, has watched the town's classrooms double, filled with children of gas employees who have moved here. Many of those children enjoy the town's new multimillion-dollar aquatic center, bought with gas industry revenue.  See how gas drilling has changed Pinedale » . ""I think the vast majority of folks here understand that our country is in dire need for energy resources,"" she said. ""But, at the same time, I don't think many of us are willing to destroy priceless values in the process of obtaining the natural gas."" Recently, the state Legislature approved giving $2 billion from gas revenue to public schools over the next two years and taxes on groceries have been eliminated. Last year, an endowment created by gas industry taxes grew to $500 million, enabling every Wyoming high school student with above-average grades to attend college in the state. Around the corner from the aquatic center, Levi Licking has just returned home from his job operating a front-end driver for Questar gas. The 30-year-old father of two makes $20 an hour, more money than Licking believes he could earn at any business within 80 miles. ""The gas industry is the best thing that ever happened to Pinedale,"" he said. ""This is the same place it was before -- only with more money.""

"Editor's note: Laura Gómez is professor of law and American studies at the University of New Mexico. Gómez, who has a Ph.D. in sociology and a law degree from Stanford University, is the author of ""Manifest Destinies: The Making of the Mexican American Race."" Laura Gómez says Sonia Sotomayor's ""wise Latina"" comment has been taken out of context. (CNN) -- It is likely that Judge Sotomayor will face some questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee this week about her 2001 ""wise Latina"" remark. In a speech at a Berkeley conference on Hispanic judges, Sotomayor said, ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" Her comment has been lampooned on the cover of the National Review, where cartoonists apparently could not quite fathom a wise Latina judge, choosing to portray Sotomayor as a Buddha with Asian features. It has caused Rush Limbaugh and others to label her a ""racist,"" and it has caused even liberals to bristle. I was a speaker at the conference Sotomayor's speech kicked off, and I would like to put her comment in context. Entitled ""Raising the Bar: Latino and Latina Presence in the Judiciary and the Struggle for Representation,"" the conference brought together -- for the first time, to my knowledge -- judges, lawyers, scholars and law students to consider the state of Latinos in the judiciary. By 2050, Hispanics will be 30 percent of the U.S. population, and yet the number of Latino judges remains tiny. The number of female Hispanic judges is even smaller; Sotomayor is one of two Hispanic women among federal appellate judges, and there are not much more than that among the hundreds of federal district judges. Part of the impetus for the conference was to signal the potential crisis for our courts in the 21st century if we do not get more Latino lawyers interested in becoming judges and more appointed to the bench. In this context, I did not find Sotomayor's comment controversial. As I look at the speech eight years later, I'm struck by how measured and careful she was in making the claim. First, the sentence I have quoted here followed Sotomayor's acknowledgement that there is no universal definition of ""wise."" Second, she presented the statement as aspirational by using the phrase ""I would hope""; she was talking as much about the ideal of diversity as its reality. Third, she specified that she was talking not about all Latinas and all white men but about ideal types; she invoked a ""wise"" Hispanic woman who has had a particular set of life experiences and white male judges who have not ""lived that life"" (suggesting that some white males could, in fact, bring a similar empathy and/or life experience to the bench). Fourth, she went out of her way to say that she thought this would be the case ""more often than not,"" rather than all the time. Finally, in the next sentence of her speech, Sotomayor went on to specify that she was addressing the dynamics of an appellate court with multiple judges (such as the three-judge and en banc panels on which she sits as an appeals court judge and the Supreme Court), rather than talking about a trial court context in which a single judge presides. She was referencing the group dynamics on a U.S. Supreme Court of nine justices who converse publicly during oral arguments and privately during conferences over cases. In these settings, who a judge is, in all the ways that matter, undoubtedly affects his or her own thinking about cases as well as that of the other justices. Does anyone that doubt that Justice Thurgood Marshall's identity as an African-American male or his experience as a civil rights lawyer shaped his judicial philosophy and influence his fellow justices some of the time? Most watchers of the Supreme Court have similarly concluded that Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have had a great impact on their colleagues in cases of particular interest to women, such as abortion and sex discrimination. Ultimately, whether, holding other things constant, women of color make ""better"" judges than white men is an empirical question that we are unable to answer definitively any time soon, given the small numbers of minority judges. That inquiry itself begs the question of quality explicit in Judge Sotomayor's comment: What makes one judge better than another? Better for whom? Some political scientists have argued that the appropriate measure is essentially political: Is the judge better for those who elected the president who nominated the Supreme Court justice? At the end of the day, a judge's race and gender may have less impact on how she decides a particular case than how the larger public perceives the court on which she sits. In a society in which African-Americans and Hispanics, in particular, report high rates of dissatisfaction and lack of faith in the courts and other criminal justice institutions, the racial and gender makeup of the judiciary has greater relevance. Of 111 Supreme Court justices, all but four have been white men. It's past time the nation's highest court looked more like the nation.

"Editor's note: Anthony S. Barkow prosecuted federal and local crime for 12 years in the U.S. attorney's offices for the Southern District of New York and for the District of Columbia and is now the executive director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University School of Law. Anthony Barkow says Sonia Sotomayor would provide the perspective of a former prosecutor on the high court. (CNN) -- Many have noted Judge Sonia Sotomayor's personal story -- from being raised by a single mother in a public housing project in the Bronx to top honors at Princeton and Yale and now, potentially the Supreme Court -- will give her a perspective that other justices lack. But commentators typically miss another life experience of Sotomayor's that will bring diversity to the court. If she is confirmed, she would be the only justice with experience as a local prosecutor. For five years, Sotomayor was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. In that position, she interacted with some of the poorest, most troubled residents of New York and handled matters ranging from shoplifting, prostitution and petty drug offenses to robberies, child abuse and murders. Sotomayor's experience on the front lines in a big city's fight against crime will bring a much-needed perspective to the court. Only Justice Samuel Alito has any real background at all in criminal law. He was an assistant U.S. attorney and was later U.S. attorney in New Jersey. It's quite likely that, as a result, Alito may have disproportionate influence on his colleagues in criminal cases because he can refer to that experience. But Alito was never a local prosecutor and has deep exposure only to federal criminal law. Federal criminal cases make up only about 6 percent of all criminal cases, and they typically involve complex white-collar crimes and large-scale narcotics trafficking. Federal prosecutors do not typically see the day-to-day carnage in neighborhoods from murders, rapes, burglaries, robberies and assault, or interact with the victims of those crimes. Nor do they see low-level vice crimes such as prostitution, small-time drug deals or gambling. The other justices are even further removed from the realities of street crime. The only other justice who has even a modicum of criminal justice experience is Justice Breyer, whose exposure to criminal law as an architect of the federal sentencing guidelines was not to victims and criminals but to data and number crunchers. The other justices' professional experiences are even more insulated from life on the streets. They spent their time in lofty government appellate or legal counsel positions, working in the halls of Congress, devising litigation strategies at top law firms or public interest organizations, or pondering legal questions as academics. Even the justices' experiences on the bench isolated them from the real world of criminal law. Not a single member of the current Supreme Court served on a state court -- the courts that handle about 94 percent of criminal cases. For that matter, no one on the Supreme Court served on a federal district court, the trial courts in the federal system that see federal criminal cases up close. Here, too, Sotomayor fills a critical gap. In addition to her time in the DA's office, she was also a federal district court judge for six years. Sotomayor would bring a much-needed dose of reality when it comes to criminal law issues. It is all too easy for someone who has not spent time working on these issues to caricature them. For conservatives, the risk is assuming all crimes are a failure of personal responsibility that lead to serious breaches of public order and demand incarceration and a tough response. For liberals, the risk is seeing every defendant as a victim of poverty or society's failures. The reality, as  Sotomayor knows well, is far more complicated. She has seen the human condition up close and personal. She knows the pain of victims and has looked into the eyes of defendants who have committed unspeakable acts with no remorse and are unredeemable. She has also seen defendants who need treatment and jobs, not prison. Many of these individuals may have committed petty crimes, such as shoplifting or drug possession, to feed an addiction. This interaction with the criminal justice system also showed Sotomayor on a daily basis just how powerful the state is and the tragedy that is every single criminal case. In no other area is government more intrusive. This is the power to lock someone in a cell, or even to take away life. Sotomayor's experience shows her that this government power is sometimes necessary -- and sometimes isn't. She also knows that, in every criminal case, people suffer, and not just victims and defendants. Family members, children and entire communities pay the price when we send away too many people for too long or fail to pay attention and don't provide neighborhoods enough protection. One never knows how personal experience will translate to life on the bench. But Sotomayor's experience in a big-city prosecution office would likely to make a difference on a bench that deals with crime every day but has very little real-world exposure to it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony S. Barkow.","Anthony Barkow: Sonia Sotomayor's experience would set her apart on top court .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor has been given the American Bar Association's highest rating for ""professional qualification,"" a political boost less than a week before her confirmation hearings begin in the Senate. Confirmation hearings for Sonia Sotomayor's Supreme Court nomination are set to begin next week. An ABA committee that reviewed her record concluded unanimously Tuesday that she is ""well qualified"" to sit on the high court. The nation's largest association of attorneys has been evaluating nominees to the federal bench for five decades. Sotomayor was last evaluated by the ABA in 1998 when she was nominated for the appeals court seat she now occupies. She was also rated ""well qualified,"" but the vote then was not unanimous. Her confirmation hearings for the high court begin Monday, and Judiciary Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, applauded the ABA evaluation, saying it ""should eliminate the doubts of naysayers who have questioned Judge Sotomayor's disposition on the bench."" The 55-year-old judge from the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit would replace the retired Justice David Souter. The peer-review process by the ABA focuses only on a nominee's ""professional qualifications and does not consider a nominee's philosophy or ideology,"" according to the group. It says its ""impartial evaluations"" focus on integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament. Past administrations have quietly worked with the ABA to provide the identity of potential nominees before they were publicly nominated. No other group has such advance access, but the ABA's role is unofficial. The George W. Bush administration refused to consider or accept the ABA evaluations, saying the organization had given lower ratings for some conservative nominees, and that the ABA had publicly held liberal positions on social and political matters. Officials in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush made the same complaint. The ABA's Standing Committee continued to rate Bush judicial nominees, but only after the president had made the choices public. Justice Clarence Thomas was rated ""qualified"" -- the middle of three possible ratings -- when he was being considered for the Supreme Court in 1991. ""Not qualified"" is the lowest rating possible. George W. Bush's nominees -- Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito -- received unanimous ""well qualified"" ratings. Harriet Miers withdrew her 2005 high court nomination before the ABA could release its evaluation. A letter from White House Counsel Greg Craig to Leahy on Tuesday indicated the ABA had again gained its privileged access to the administration's nominee for evaluation. Republicans stepped up their attacks on Sotomayor's qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court. Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, questioned her judicial temperament in a Tuesday floor speech. ""As we consider her nomination to the Supreme Court, my colleagues should ask themselves this important question: Is she allowing her personal or political agenda to cloud her judgment and favor one group of individuals over another, irrespective of what the law says?"" In particular, McConnell was critical of Sotomayor's views in a highly watched workplace bias claim decided last week by the Supreme Court. The justices ruled in favor of white firefighters in New Haven, Connecticut, who alleged reverse discrimination, claiming they were denied promotion because of their race. As a federal appeals judge, Sotomayor had ruled for the city, saying officials had the discretion to withdraw promotion tests when too few minorities would have qualified for advancement. The high court majority ultimately rejected her conclusions. McConnell repeated concerns raised by some conservatives that Sotomayor might favor certain groups over others because of her personal views. ""It's a troubling philosophy for any judge -- let alone one nominated to our highest court -- to convert 'empathy' into favoritism for particular groups,"" he said.","American Bar Association unanimously gives Sonia Sotomayor its highest rating .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Supreme Court justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor has quit her membership in a women's club, the New York-based Belizean Grove. Judge Sonia Sotomayor says the club does not discriminate. ""I believe that the Belizean Grove does not practice invidious discrimination and my membership did not violate the Judicial Code of Ethics, but I do not want questions about this to distract anyone from my qualifications and record,"" the 54-year-old New York federal appeals judge wrote. The American Bar Association's judicial code says that a judge's extrajudicial activities ""must not be conducted in connection or affiliation with an organization that practices invidious discrimination."" It adds, ""An organization is generally said to discriminate invidiously if it arbitrarily excludes from membership on the basis of race, sex, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, or sexual orientation persons who would otherwise be eligible for admission."" According to the group's Web site, ""The Belizean Grove is a constellation of influential women who are key decision makers in the profit, nonprofit and social sectors; who build long-term mutually beneficial relationships in order to both take charge of their own destinies and help others to do the same."" A woman who answered the phone at the club, located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, said no one was immediately available to comment. Sotomayor announced her decision to withdraw from the club effective Friday, in a letter to Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, the committee's ranking member. Her confirmation hearings begin July 13. Sotomayor met Tuesday with six senators, courtesy visits with the lawmakers who will decide whether she will become the nation's 111th justice. She has provided thousands of pages of material to the committee, but some Republican senators had asked for more information, including about her participation in the club. About 115 women are in the group, according to its Web site. Its leaders said it was created as a counterpart to the all-male social club the Bohemian Grove, which also has an influential network of leaders. Sotomayor told senators her group is not purposely exclusive. ""To the best of my knowledge, a man has never asked to be considered for membership. It is also my understanding that all interested individuals are duly considered by the membership committee,"" she wrote in her letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee. She added that men participate in the group's activities, including trips, hosting events and talks. Sources indicated Sotomayor was recommended to the Belizean Grove by Mari Carmen Aponte, a corporate director and former top official at the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration in Washington. The only female member of the high court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, belongs to the International Women's Forum, which has an exclusive membership. Former justice Sandra Day O'Connor also participated in similar women-only groups, an issue that was raised during her 1981 confirmation hearings. Among the Belizean Grove's members are Marion Blakely, former chairwoman of the Federal Aviation Administration; and Edie Weiner, leading futurist consultant and best-selling author.","Supreme Court justice nominee resigns from Belizean Grove .

"Editor's Note: This is the last in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice. Sotomayor was nominated to U.S. district court in 1991 and federal appeals court in 1997. (CNN) -- Sonia Sotomayor had been a federal appeals court judge for about four months when Ellen Chapnick got a phone call in 1998. The Columbia Law School lecturer's students had worked and studied with Sotomayor as part of a program at the school, but Chapnick figured the partnership had come to an end with the judge's new job. ""She called me up and said, 'You know, I really miss your students. Isn't there something we can do about that?'"" recalled Chapnick, now Dean of the Social Justice Program at the school. ""And, of course, a judge rarely asks a question when she doesn't know the answer."" That call, and the partnership that would continue another six years, captures the essence of the woman who has spent years on the federal bench, friends and colleagues said. They remember a tireless worker spending late hours in her chambers or on projects like the college course: A tough decision-maker who would pick apart any lawyer foolish enough to come to court unprepared; a thoughtful jurist whose years as an aggressive prosecutor endeared her to law enforcement even as she developed a reputation as a social liberal; and a child of the Bronx who maintained a heart for people from all walks of life as she ascended to the legal world's loftiest positions. ""Her hobby is people,"" said Chapnick, who became friends with the woman now going through Senate confirmation hearings on her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. ""I've been in situations with her when everybody else around the table is a lot 'less important' -- if you define importance by positions of power and prestige -- and she's asking them questions.""  Watch Chapnick on how Sotomayor put students 'through the wringer' » . In 1984, Sotomayor, now 55, worked at Pavia & Harcourt, a ""boutique"" law firm in New York that focuses on international business issues. Her job included representing Fendi, the Italian luxury goods company that wanted to crack down on imposters selling knockoffs of its high-end handbags. Steven Skulnik, a colleague at the firm, remembered tagging along with Sotomayor on a police raid of a counterfeit operation in Harlem. He waited in the van. Sotomayor charged out alongside the officers. ""She had no fear,"" said Skulnik, now with the New York firm Squire Sanders. ""That's just her personality. She's the first one in."" He and others also recall her working long hours with a laser-like focus as she prepared for a case. ""[Co-workers] would walk by in the morning, and she'd be reading something or writing something,"" he said. ""You'd say, 'Hi, Sonia,' and she wouldn't even look up. She didn't notice. ""She would really bore in and make sure there was nothing about the case that she didn't understand."" That dedication hit her private life, Sotomayor has admitted. She told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" in 1986 that her workload ""was a contributing factor"" in the divorce three years earlier from Kevin Noonan. Work also made it difficult to date then, she said: ""A man who calls you three times and all three times you answer, 'I've got to work late.' ... After the third time he begins thinking, 'Gee, maybe she's not interested.'"" She left the law firm to take up President George H.W. Bush's nomination in 1991 and served as a U.S. District Court judge from 1992 to 1998. President Bill Clinton nominated her for a seat on the 2nd District U.S. Appeals Court in 1997, and she was confirmed more than a year later by the Senate to the position she still holds.  See Sotomayor's life in pictures » . Sotomayor's most high-profile moment on the bench -- and the one that probably brought her as close as a judge ever comes to winning fans -- came in 1995, when, with a stroke of the pen, she ended the Major League Baseball strike. The 1994 playoffs and World Series had been scrubbed because of the strike and the following season was threatened. Sotomayor, a lifelong Yankees fan, ruled in New York district court in favor of the players against the owners who she said were trying to undermine the league's labor system. She told lawyers she didn't need to hear witnesses or see more documents after their arguments.  See some of Sotomayor's high-profile decisions » . Chapnick said Sotomayor later talked about the case with a touch of irritation about some of the attention that came with it. Sotomayor remembered critics saying it was ""outrageous"" that a woman was deciding a case about baseball, Chapnick said. ""She said, 'Why don't they ask me? I'd tell them I had a mitt growing up,'"" Chapnick recalled Sotomayor saying. In her attorney and judgeship years, Sotomayor has made a good living, but not an extravagant one. She earned about $230,000 in her last year at Pavia & Harcourt and not much more as a judge, according to a questionnaire filed with the Senate. Of about $1.1 million in assets, nearly $1 million is the home she owns in Manhattan -- nice, but not exorbitant by the borough's standards. At Blue Ribbon Bakery, nearby her Greenwich Village home, workers say Sotomayor, who was diagnosed with diabetes as a child, stops in almost daily for sturgeon toast or breadsticks and a cup of decaf. She's thought of as just another neighbor and customer, Sasha Acosta-Cohen said. At work, Sotomayor the judge is described as straightforward, direct and no-nonsense.  See how Sotomayor might fit in with the Supreme Court justices » . A former clerk said she can be ""prickly from the bench"" but is friendly away from it. ""When she's in oral arguments, and when attorneys show up and they're either unprepared or are maybe raising a weak argument, she's very quick, and she's very exacting and intellectually demanding,"" Robin Car said. Away from the bench ""she's really just a warm, extremely kind and caring person."" Car recalled a 2001 conference at Hofstra University at which Sotomayor introduced Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the court's most conservative members. ""I think he was a little bit unsure what she was going to say or what she was going to do,"" Car said. ""She went, and she did the introduction, and he responded, 'Wow, that was the most thoughtful introduction I've ever received.'"" ""Thoughtful"" is a word Chapnick also used to describe Sotomayor. She remembers a letter from a former student telling her how, as a Hispanic woman from a poor background, she'd been inspired by Sotomayor during the course the two taught together. In reviews of the course, students wrote ""not just how it shaped their view of the law but how it shaped their view of themselves,"" Chapnick said. She said the last time she saw Sotomayor, the prospective Supreme Court justice joked with her about their course, saying a possible move to Washington was no reason to quit. At least, Chapnick said, she thinks it was a joke.","Colleagues recall Sotomayor as tireless, focused worker .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Days before the start of Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearings, a new national poll indicates that by a narrow margin, Americans would like the Senate to confirm her as the next Supreme Court justice. Critics warn confirmation hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor could turn into a partisan battle. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Friday, 47 percent of people questioned would like to see the Senate vote in favor of Sotomayor's confirmation, with 40 percent opposed and 13 percent unsure. Sotomayor, a New York federal appeals court judge, was nominated by President Obama in May to succeed retiring Supreme Court Justice David Souter. The poll suggests a partisan divide, with nearly seven in 10 Democrats supporting Sotomayor's confirmation, Independents split, and nearly two out of three Republicans opposing Senate confirmation. Read the poll (pdf) ""Republican opposition to Sotomayor's confirmation is a higher level of opposition from the party out of power than any Supreme Court nominee has faced in the past two decades,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Only 32 percent of Republicans opposed Ruth Ginsburg's 1993 nomination by President Bill Clinton to the high court, Holland said. ""In 2005, when it was the GOP's turn to appoint justices, only 35 percent of Democrats opposed John Roberts, and 46 percent of Democrats opposed Samuel Alito the following year,"" Holland said. ""And even when Bush nominated Harriet Miers, opposition among Democrats to her confirmation hit only 53 percent."" The poll also indicates that Americans are split over whether senators are justified in voting against Sotomayor, based solely on her stand on the issues. Americans seem to agree that the confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which begin Monday, could turn into a partisan battle. Six out of 10 said a major fight between Democrats and Republicans will occur, with 38 percent saying that the hearings will be a relatively easy process with bipartisan agreement. The percentage of those who would like to see Sotomayor confirmed in the CNN poll is lower than in other national surveys released in the past few weeks. ""One possible reason why the CNN poll shows less support for Sotomayor than other recent polls is a difference in the question wording,"" Holland said. ""Polls by other organizations have described Sotomayor as Barack Obama's choice for the Supreme Court. But in order to make historical comparisons, the CNN poll used a question dating back to 1987 that does not mention the president's name."" Americans can be swayed by a familiar name, in this case Obama, when questioned about someone who has not been in the public eye, Holland said. ""Some of Obama's popularity may have rubbed off onto Sotomayor in polls conducted by other organizations,"" Holland said. ""Ultimately, however, Supreme Court nominees rise or fall on their own merits."" The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey was conducted from June 26 to 28, with 1,026 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.","Almost half of Americans favor Sonia Sotomayor as Supreme Court justice, poll says .

"(CNN)  -- American billionaire tycoon Donald Trump could never be accused of underselling himself and his myriad of business projects so it came as no surprise when he said wanted to build the ""world's best golf course"" in Scotland.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- While most sitting Supreme Court justices refuse to comment about current and future nominees to that bench, one member says she can't wait to welcome Judge Sonia Sotomayor to that exclusive club. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg her views occasionally are ignored by the male justices. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the only women on the nine-member court, told a group of lawyers and judges this weekend she was ""cheered"" at the nomination of Sotomayor. Ginsburg said the 54-year-old federal appeals court judge brings ""a wealth of experience in the law and in life. I am glad to no longer be the lone woman on the court, and look forward to a new colleague well-equipped to handle the challenges our work presents."" Her remarks were made at a semi-private conference in Upstate New York. The justice has made no secret of her desire to see greater gender diversity on her court. She has lamented the departure of her friend and colleague Sandra Day O'Connor in 2006. She told USA Today just weeks before Justice David Souter announced his retirement that more women should join her. ""Women belong in all places where decision are being made,"" she said. ""I don't say [the split] should be 50-50. It could be 60 percent men, 40 percent women, or the other way around. It shouldn't be that women are the exception."" Sotomayor has drawn controversy with her remarks at a 2001 speech: ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" She has echoed the sentiment in related talks she has given over the years. Ginsburg spoke weeks before Sotomayor was tapped for the high court about observations she and O'Connor had made in the past that were similar to Sotomayor's. ""You know the line that Sandra and I keep repeating... that 'at the end of the day, a wise old man and a wise old woman reach the same judgment'?"" she told USA Today. ""But there are perceptions that we have because we are women. It's a subtle influence. We can be sensitive to things that are said in draft opinions that [male justices] are not aware can be offensive."" Ginsburg used the word ""same"" to describe the outcome, Sotomayor used the word ""better,"" a wording she has told senators privately she now regrets. Ginsburg noted gender differences are ""seldom in the outcome."" But then, she said, ""it is sometimes in the outcome."" Ginsburg expressed frustration in that interview with how her male colleagues view her role, and how they view certain cases. She said in closed door conferences where all the justices gather to decide cases and pending appeals, her views occasionally are ignored. ""When I will say something -- and I don't think I'm a confused speaker -- and it isn't until somebody else says it that everyone will focus on the point."" The same thing can happen in the public setting of oral arguments, the 76-year-old justice said. A case from April dealt with whether school officials abused their discretion by conducting a strip search on a 13-year-old female student who was suspected of carrying ibuprofen medicine, in violation of the school's anti-drug policy. In arguments, she asked a lawyer for the school, ""After Redding [the student] was searched and nothing was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice principal's office for over two hours, and her mother wasn't called. What was the reason for... putting her in that humiliating situation?"" Her colleague Justice Stephen Breyer had noted, ""I'm trying to work out why is this a major thing to, say, strip down to your underclothes, which children do when they change for gym,"" Breyer said. ""How bad is this, underclothes? That's what I'm trying to get at. I'm asking because I don't know."" Ginsburg countered that the girl was told by female staffers ""to shake [her] bra out, to shake, shake, stretch the top of [her] pants."" In another case this term, the court ruled time off given women decades ago for pregnancy leave cannot be counted when deciding pension eligibility. Ginsburg dissented strongly, noting, ""Certain attitudes about pregnancy and childbirth throughout human history have sustained pervasive, often law-sanctioned, restrictions on a woman's place among paid workers and active citizens."" The appeal had parallels to a similar workplace discrimination claim involving Lily Ledbetter. The former tire company manager alleged she was paid less than her male counterparts for equal work for about two decades, but did not find out about the discrimination until she was about to retire. The high court in 2007 ruled against her, saying existing federal law did not allow such lawsuits to be filed so late. Most workers had 180 days to file a claim after the first discriminatory pay decision. But President Obama, in the first bill he signed when taking office in January, made law the Lily Ledbetter Act. It nullified the high court decision and said every new paycheck received over the years based on a discriminatory act -- regardless of when the first discrimination occurred -- would extend the statute of limitations 180 days. Ginsburg told reporter Joan Biskupic that oral arguments in the 2009 pregnancy case were, ""just for me, Ledbetter repeated."" Ginsburg is still recovering from surgery and post-operation chemotherapy after an early diagnosis in January for pancreatic cancer. Ginsburg has had no outward signs of complications, and has kept up with her busy schedule, both on and off the bench. She has told friends and colleagues privately she is doing well, and plans to be back on the bench for the start of the fall term. Sotomayor's Senate confirmation hearings will begin July 13.","Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg happy about possibility of female colleague .

"(CNN) -- This week marks one of the most-exciting non-major events of the golf season -- the Players Championship at the famed TPC Sawgrass. With a deep field and a great course, you won't want to miss any of the action. Before the tournament tees off, we had a chance to catch up with TPC Sawgrass PGA Head Professional Matt Borocz, who provided some inside insight on the home of the PGA Tour. PGA.com: Thanks for joining us. This week presents one of the most exciting on the schedule with the Players Championship. What is it that makes the Players such a special event? Borocz: It's the Players Championship... The Players is crown jewel of the PGA Tour. The world's best golfers are on a course that demands the highest level of shot-making and offers an unbelievable fan experience. It's also the highest purse in golf with the champion taking home $1.71 million at the end of the week. The Players Stadium Course was specifically built to host the Players Championship and offer our fans the best possible viewing. Everyone wants to see the action on the final three holes, especially the 17th. It's the lure of the hole and watching the best players in the world challenge the island green. PGA.com: We can't talk about the Players without mentioning the world-famous, par-3 17th island green, which you just touched on. I recently heard a promo with a player saying, ""51 weeks a year, No. 17 at TPC Sawgrass is the easiest hole in the world for Tour players."" I don't know if I would agree with that, but of course, that 52nd week is the Players. We know why it's daunting, but it's less than 150 yards. Is there any truth to what that Tour player said? Borocz: A few stats on the 17thhole -- it plays 121 yards from the middle of the championship tee to the front of the green. To the back of the green it's 146 yards. The 17th green is 3,912 square feet compared to the average of 4,500 square feet. The challenge of the 17th hole is its ability to taunt the mental toughness of a player. It's a very calculating shot because you have to factor the wind, firmness of the green and avoid looking at the body of water surrounding the island green. During the Players, you add in the thousands of fans! We give tours every day to visitors and the No. 1 comment of amazement is, ""The green looks so small compared to television."" Making a par 3 on the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass will bring a smile to all players, whether they are a novice or the best players in the world. PGA.com: Henrik Stenson of Sweden is your defending champion. Through the years with the likes of Stenson, Sergio Garcia, Adam Scott, Stephen Ames, Steve Elkington, Greg Norman, Nick Price -- the list goes on -- the Players has had quite a list of international champions. What is it about the course that yields such diverse champions? Borocz: In the 36-year history of the Players, 10 of the victories have been by international players. The Players Stadium Course does not favor any style of player. The goal of former Commissioner Deane Beman was to create a golf course that had balance in regards to distance, wind direction and shot-making. He wanted to create a goal course that was fair and would challenge every skill of the game. The goal at the end of week is to crown the greatest player in world. The diversity of the field allows the Players and PGA Tour to expand the scope of the tournament to a world-wide audience. PGA.com: In 1994, Greg Norman won the Players with a remarkable 24-under 264. That's by far the best winning score in tournament history. Is there any chance someone could come within a sniff of that this year? Borocz: In 1994, when Greg Norman set the overall tournament record, the conditions started off perfect the first round with 76 players shooting under par. Norman started off on Thursday with a course-record round of 63, followed by three rounds of 67's to beat Fuzzy Zoeller by four shots. In 1994, the Players was played in March. With the tournament now being played in May the course is much firmer and faster conditions. In March, we had a lot of inconsistency in weather. It could be in the high 70s and beautiful or in the 50s with rain. The temperatures have become much more consistent, but the golf course plays much differently. When played in March, the golf course was overseeded. It's now Bermuda grass all year. The golf ball has more opportunity to run through the fairways and the greens. The forecast is shaping up to be a beautiful week. PGA.com: Final question. What's the best part about working at TPC Sawgrass? Borocz: Excellent question... TPC Sawgrass is a very special place being that it's the home of the Players and PGA Tour. It is a privilege to work around such a passionate and dedicated group of people. Everyone on our team is focused on creating a magical experience for the Tour players, members and guests. Every team member comes to the club with a positive ""can do"" attitude. We have a team that is extremely dedicated and passionate about their role at the club. One of the most special things about TPC Sawgrass is the interaction with all the people that travel from all over the world to visit. Many of them have personal stories and connections why TPC Sawgrass is their favorite course. There are definitely days that you have to pinch yourself. We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to work at such a beautiful place that is showcased to the world every year. As a club and being apart of the PGA Tour, we have a lot of involvement with local charitable organizations. Almost every month we have a charitable initiative that we are giving back to you. It's an honor and a blessing to be a part of such a great team.","The Players is ""crown jewel"" of the PGA Tour .

"(CNN) -- American golfer Anthony Kim hopes to be fit for the prestigious Ryder Cup teams event in October after deciding to have a thumb operation that will rule him out for up to three months. Kim, who is second on the U.S. Ryder Cup points list behind Phil Mickelson, pulled out of this week's Players Championship at Sawgrass due to shoulder complications caused by the problem. The world No. 11, who helped the United States beat Europe in 2008 to reclaim the trophy, had an operation in Maryland, Baltimore on Wednesday. ""While I had hoped to be able to continue to play through the injury, compensating for it was starting to cause other issues, including a sore shoulder. We had to get it fixed,"" the 24-year-old said in a statement. Kim claimed his first PGA Tour title in two years when he won the Houston Open last month despite being troubled by the torn thumb ligament, and then finished third at the Masters. However, he will now miss the second major tournament of the golf season, the U.S. Open in June, and possibly also the third -- the British Open in July. But he should have plenty of time to get fit for the Ryder Cup, which was first staged in 1927, at the Celtic Manor club in Wales on October 1-3. Kim tied for seventh at the Quail Hollow Championship last weekend, where he revealed how much he wanted to be ready to take on the Europeans again. ""I want to play in the Ryder Cup, and that's a huge goal of mine,"" he told reporters. ""It was probably one of the greatest moments I've had playing golf, or greatest weeks I've had playing golf, playing for the U.S., dreaming about being on that team. So I want to be healthy for that. I just want to time it right."" Kim's surgeon, Dr. Thomas Graham, said he was pleased with how the operation went. ""Anthony sustained a high-grade partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament of his left thumb several months ago, and over the course of the last several months of tournament play, the status of the ligament proved insufficient for Anthony to compete on Tour,"" the chief of the National Hand Center in Baltimore said. ""I was extremely pleased with how the repair of the ligament went and would anticipate that Anthony will be able to return to play in 10-12 weeks.""","Anthony Kim will be sidelined for 10-12 weeks after deciding to have thumb operation .

"(CNN) -- A flurry of late birdies helped American Jason Bohn secure his second PGA Tour title at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans. The 37-year-old, who celebrated his birthday on Saturday, completed his third round at the rain-affected tournament on Sunday morning before carding a five-under 67 later in the day to secure the title. Bohn recorded birdies at three of the final four holes to finish on 18-under and stave off the challenge of second-placed Jeff Overton by two shots. He was inches away from an eagle on the last after a superb approach. ""This is life changing,"" he told the PGA Tour Web site. ""I'm probably the only guy on the PGA Tour who has got tears when he's putting out on the 18th hole. ""When I hit the shot on 15 and made the great putt on 16, I knew if I stayed patient I had it."" Bohn's only other tour success came at the B.C. Open in 2005 and since then he has had a number of injuries, including surgery on his back. After his triumph he said he'd told his caddie before the final round that he was planning on a quiet afternoon. ""I just said I probably wouldn't say much because I'm capturing all of this,"" Bohn said. ""I want to take this one to the grave. I want to remember every little detail that I missed on my first one."" Bohn fought off the challenge of fellow American Overton, who finished second ahead of Troy Merritt, on 16-under. Meanwhile, Ian Poulter and Padraig Harrington have confirmed they will play in the European Tour's flagship PGA Championship at Wentworth, England. Both players had boycotted the event in the last two years due to the state of the greens but agreed to return after moderations to the course by South African golfer Ernie Els. Poulter told the UK Press Association: ""It is a great championship and I am looking forward to checking out the modifications to the West Course which Ernie has undertaken. I am sure the changes will be for the better.""","American Jason Bohn secures his second PGA Tour title in New Orleans .

"Editor's note: Abigail Thernstrom is the author of ""Voting Rights -- and Wrongs: The Elusive Quest for Racially Fair Elections,"" published this month by the AEI Press. She is the vice-chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Her writing can be found at http://www.thernstrom.com/. Abigail Thernstrom says ethnic and racial politics haven't faded away with the election of Barack Obama. (CNN) -- Some of us thought the election of Barack Obama as president might signal a fading away of the old identity politics. The assumption that fundamental lines of division in politics are set by race and ethnicity would seem to be a bit passé when 43 percent of white voters cast their ballots for a proudly ""post-racial"" African-American. But the president himself has made identity politics front-page news with his selection of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as his Supreme Court nominee. She played an important role in the New Haven firefighters' case (Ricci v. DeStefano) now awaiting decision by the Supreme Court. Sotomayor and two colleagues simply brushed aside the important constitutional and statutory questions raised by the city's decision to discard the results of a race-neutral test given to applicants for promotions within the department. Too many men of the ""wrong"" color had passed it -- that is, all of those who scored highest were white except for one Hispanic. Those firefighters had worked hard to get the test results they did; the lead plaintiff, Frank Ricci, is dyslexic, but he had been on the force for 11 years and was determined to become a lieutenant, so he paid an acquaintance more than $1,000 to read textbooks onto audiotapes and make flash cards. Ricci gave up his second job in order to study long hours -- and aced the test. President Obama, in his famous Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, race speech during the campaign, said that when whites hear ""that an African-American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed ... resentment builds over time."" Yes. And when firefighters are denied promotions they earned simply because they are white, resentment builds. Discarding that test has struck many as an instance of racial preferences run amok. Will the real Barack Obama please stand up? Did he mean to imply in that Philadelphia speech that the ""empathy"" he claims to celebrate extends not only to minority victims of injustice, but also to whites? And is he a man who remains eager to move beyond identity politics, as he suggested numerous times in the course of his campaign -- or not? Questions abound. He has tried to downplay Sotomayor's now infamous declaration that ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life,"" suggesting that it was nothing more than a poor choice of words. But in the same speech, Sotomayor wondered ""whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society."" And, most remarkably, she stated: ""Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences ... our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging."" ""Inherent physiological or cultural differences""? Can the president possibly believe that Latina women -- and indeed minority women in general -- are born to see questions of law in a different and better light than white men or even men of color? It's in their physiological and cultural makeup. A fact of nature. If indeed the president believes in such disturbing racial determinism, weep for our nation. Either the president is a man of many parts, untroubled by his own conflicting views, or he is an immensely skilled and coldly calculating politician who is eager to court the Latino vote and knows that few senators are likely to vote against a ""first."" Identity politics is on the line in Ricci and also in another forthcoming Supreme Court decision, a key case involving minority voting rights. Later this month, the Supreme Court will decide whether in 2009, black candidates for public office can win running in majority-white settings. At issue in ""Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder"" is the constitutionality of a key, temporary provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that was renewed for the fourth time in 2006 on the theory that voting discrimination had just become ""more subtle"" than it was four decades earlier. The renewal meant that the Justice Department could continue to insist on districting maps that were carefully racially gerrymandered to elect black and Hispanic candidates. Legislative quotas have been the remedy for persistent racial exclusion -- seats reserved for candidates who are the choice of minority voters. But is America still a nation steeped in the muck of old-fashioned racism -- the results of the 2008 election notwithstanding? Are we condemned to identity politics in choosing firefighters for promotion, in drawing districting maps for legislative bodies (from school boards all the way up to congressional delegations), and in a multitude of other spheres into the indefinite future? Sonia Sotomayor's nomination suggests that the answer will be yes. A sad thought. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Abigail Thernstrom.","Abigail Thernstrom: There were hopes ethnic politics would fade after Obama's win .

"(CNN) -- Australian Sam Stosur continued her giant-killing habit at the French Open by beating top seed Serena Williams to book a place in the final four.

The seventh seed will play Jelena Jankovic in the semifinal after the Serb beat Yaroslava Shvedova, from Kazakhstan, 7-5 6-4. It means there will be a brand new Grand Slam winner by the end of the week, with none of the final four yet to break their duck at the major championships. The match went with serve in the opening set until Stosur won five games in a row with some scintillating tennis, to clinch the first 6-2. Stosur continued strongly in the second to go 5-3 up before Williams rallied and leveled at 5-5. The top seed went on to take it on a tie-break. In a tense deciding set breaks were exchanged early on before Williams edged ahead to lead 5-4. Stosur held her nerve to survive a match point and go on to take the game.

"(CNN) -- It's about that time of year, when dyed green rivers and Guinness beers flow, the shamrock sunglasses and leprechaun T-shirts come out, and corned beef and cabbage enters the mainstream menu. Harvey Losh felt and showed his Irish spirit as he marched in a Seattle St. Patrick's Day parade. With St. Patrick's Day one week away, the Irish across America -- and those who just want to be Irish for a day -- are preparing to celebrate, if they haven't started already. When it comes to St. Paddy's, many people think of the annual parades. The American invention originated in New York, which still has the largest, but the green season is about so much more. For hundreds of years in Ireland, people have observed the feast of St. Patrick, a fifth-century missionary credited with saving pagans on the Emerald Isle. On the feast day of March 17, which falls during the Lent season, the Irish can cut loose: sing, dance and enjoy meat, even on a Friday, when it would otherwise be prohibited. Irish Americans, who account for more than 12 percent of the U.S. population according to the U.S. Census Bureau, mark St. Paddy's Day and celebrate their heritage in numerous ways that may go unnoticed to the casual observer or outsider. Here are glimpses into how some of them do it. Political wit a hit in Boston, Massachusetts . The link to Ireland couldn't be stronger than it is in Massachusetts, where a quarter of the population claims Irish heritage. And while the state capital is awash in green cheer at this time of year, a tradition of exchanging political barbs has kicked off each morning of the St. Patrick's Day parade, dating back about 60 years. The March 15 breakfast, including song and dance amid the playful ribbing, was an outgrowth of the community's involvement in politics, which runs as deep as Irish humor. ""It allows people to see their elected officials [local, state and national] in a role they don't normally see them in,"" explained state Sen. Jack Hart (or, as he says it, ""Haht"") of south Boston, who's hosting the political roast for the eighth year. The televised event draws about 4 million viewers and ""beats the Sunday morning talk shows."" Neither Sen. Ted Kennedy nor Sen. John Kerry is expected this year, but getting a call from the nation's highest office isn't unheard of. Vice President Joe Biden has attended, and Hart said they're working on getting the attention of President Obama. Or is that O'Bama? Honoring their ancestors in Savannah, Georgia . They may not match the Irish population numbers of Boston, New York or Chicago, but several Southern cities, including Savannah, Georgia, have deep green roots. The city's annual parade, which dates back 185 years, draws about 400,000 and is reportedly the second largest in the country, according to the parade committee Web site. Behind the public fanfare, however, there's a lower-key event that John Forbes, the parade committee chairman, touts as more important to the southern city's Irish Catholics: the Celtic Cross Mass and ceremony. The Sunday event, on March 15 this year , starts at 11:45 a.m. in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, where members of all the Irish societies come together to pray before walking in procession to the Celtic Cross (made of stone from Ireland) in Emmet Park. ""That's just a big day for us,"" Forbes said. Away from all the commercialism, ""to us, it's in honor of our ancestors."" Kicking up their feet in Chicago, Illinois . The night before Chicagoans see their river turn an emerald green, an annual dyeing practice that dates back 40 years, the Irish community and other observers will gather for one of its newer traditions: Irish Dance Chicago. Drawing 400 to 500 participants ages 4 to 17, the 3-year-old event showcases the Irish step dancing skills learned in six area schools that are dedicated to passing along this piece of culture. It begins at 7 p.m. March 13. Step dancing, a tradition popularized by 1994's ""Riverdance"" show, involves rapid foot work while keeping the upper body stiff. It's also a platform for traditional Irish music and costumes. For parents who usually spend time carting their children around, the event offers them a chance to ""finally get to see their kids perform ... showcasing the styles they have,"" said Kathy O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the Irish American Heritage Center, which hosts the weekend's kickoff event. ""It's important to carry on heritage,"" she said. A taste of tradition in Seattle, Washington . During Irish Week in Seattle, which features everything from a genealogy conference and run to street painting and the passing of a shillelagh (an Irish walking stick), one particular event rose to our attention. The decades-old Irish soda bread baking contest, which happened Saturday, attracts more than 100 competitors each year. The bread dates back to about 1840, traditionally features a cross on top ""to ward off evil"" and uses bicarbonate of soda -- instead of  yeast -- for rising, said Mike McQuaid, a spokesman for Seattle's Irish Heritage Club. ""It was simple to make, the ingredients were easy to find, and it was very filling,"" said Mary Shriane, who oversees the contest and grew up on her mom's soda bread. It was a staple in Irish homes ""up until 40 years ago,"" she continued. ""And it's a tradition we like to keep alive."" Green grows in the desert of Phoenix, Arizona . When Mary Moriarty and her husband, a retired New York police officer, moved to the ""valley of the sun,"" she wasn't sure what to expect. Looking around during their first St. Paddy's Day parade in the Southwest, she said, ""I remembered thinking, 'This is it?' "" But 14 years later, the chairwoman of the St. Patrick's Day Faire and operations manager for the Irish Cultural Center knows that the desert connection to the lush green Emerald Isle is as real as anywhere else. This year's parade starts at 10 a.m. Saturday and is followed by festivities in the park adjacent to the cultural center. ""We will naturally have liquid libations,"" Moriarty said. ""You can't have an Irish party without liquid libations."" But it's not all about drunken revelry. Their center's groundbreaking in 1999 began by dedicating a memorial to the ""Great Hunger,"" or the mid-19th century potato famine that led to death, disease and mass emigration, Moriarty said. And the center, today, is a place where the estimated 400,000 Phoenix-area residents with Irish heritage can learn about their culture, including traditional foods, music and dance. ""The United States is made up of immigrants from all over the world ... and it's very important for all the different groups to celebrate what they brought with them,"" she said. ""Yes, you are American, but you still have to realize where your ancestors came from.""","Irish Americans, who make up 12 percent of U.S. population, prepare to celebrate .

"(CNN) -- They were there for Michael Jackson. Crowds rushed into the memorial service before it started and walked slowly out when it ended. They were celebrities. Motown founder Berry Gordy came. So did singer and songwriter Smokey Robinson. Diana Ross sent her wishes, as did Nelson Mandela. They were fans -- two girls from Canada who were given their tickets by a complete stranger. A pair of men who wanted to fulfill a Mexican tradition by distributing memorial ribbons. A woman who wore a dress laden with Jackson buttons. They cheered as his golden casket was wheeled out to a brightly lit spot below center stage. They cried as Lionel Richie sang ""Jesus Is Love."" And when Gordy called him ""the greatest entertainer who ever lived,"" they rose for a standing ovation.  Photos: Stars honor Michael Jackson » . The people came to say goodbye to Michael Jackson.

Others came ticketless, simply to be a part of the tribute to the ""King of Pop,"" who died June 25 just before a planned series of concerts titled ""This Is It."" The atmosphere was peaceful, almost festive. Police had ringed a perimeter around the center and adjacent Nokia Theatre with barricades, but crowds were lighter than expected -- perhaps because authorities appealed to people to watch the event on TV at home. The mood was buoyant among groups of eager mourners who gathered around cell phones to watch mobile video of the event. One ticketless fan, Deonerae Minter, said he showed up to get a glimpse of the funeral procession and to be a part of the event ""instead of just watching it on TV."" Chu Nguyen and Eriko Nakayama both came dressed in black in honor of the occasion. ""It's for him, just to be respectful,"" said Nguyen of his black suit and tie. ""We feel like it's a real privilege for us to be here,"" Nakayama said. A young girl, clearly born long after Jackson's 1980s ""Thriller"" album, sported the singer's trademark sequined glove, sunglasses and a gray hat. Inside the Staples Center, the audience responded to the memorial service's rich, spiritual atmosphere. One man raised his hand during Richie's performance of ""Jesus Is Love,"" as if he were in church. A woman, who said she had traveled from France, shouted, ""Michael, j'taime"" -- ""Michael, I love you."" Another person yelled, ""long live the king."" Some raised their voices: Crowds outside the Staples Center yelled ""Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!"" Some hushed them: Many gasped in heartbreak when Usher, after performing the Jackson song ""Gone Too Soon,"" knelt to pay his respects to Katherine Jackson, the entertainer's mother, and the family. Some let their music do the talking -- Stevie Wonder performed ""Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer,"" while John Mayer did an alternately gentle, alternately soaring ""Human Nature."" Others offered humble stretches of silence as Jackson's picture was shown on a giant screen above the stage. Just before the event's conclusion, Kenny Ortega, director of Jackson's ""This Is It"" concerts, said it was only fitting to have the service at the Staples Center, where Jackson had been rehearsing for the London shows. ""We knew we had to invite the world to join us here in Michael's house,"" he said. And the world was there. CNN's Jacque Wilson, Paul Chase and Thom Patterson contributed to this report.","Fans came out by thousands to pay tribute to Michael Jackson .

"(CNN)  -- Filipino boxing legend Manny Pacquiao has dropped a shock hint that he might quit the ring -- because his mother does not want him to fight anymore. Pacquiao is widely expected to fight Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a much-hyped showdown later this year, but the 31-year-old claims his place in boxing history is already assured following the successful defense of his WBO welterweight crown against Joshua Clottey last week. ""I reached my dream as a boxer without Floyd Mayweather in my career. I do not need him, they are the ones who need me,"" he told reporters as he returned home to his customary hero's welcome in the Philippines on Monday. The fighter, known as ""Pacman"" by his fans, is now concentrating on his political career. He is standing for election in the Sarangani province on May 10, on the platform of opposition senator Manuel Villar's Nacionalista Party. Pacquiao's personal Web site has carried media reports detailing how his mother Dionesia has implored him not to fight anymore, prompted by the ear injury he picked up in his battle against Miguel Cotto last year. ""She kneels down and cries every time [she asks me to quit]. That's a heavy burden when it's my mother doing that,"" he told reporters after meeting Filipino President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in Malacanang on Monday morning. ""I have been boxing since I was 12 years old. Now I'm 31, so I'm seriously thinking about it. I will discuss it with my family. ""I have been in boxing for a long time and I have given so many honors to my country. Even without the elections and the politics, my retirement will largely depend on my family's decision."" Villa, a millionaire property developer, met Pacquiao at the airport and the boxer was quick to sing his praises. ""What we need now is a man who rose from poverty, who understands the call of the poor like myself,"" Pacquiao said. Pacquiao has now won 12 straight fights and titles at seven different weights to establish himself, according to the rankings by respected boxing magazine Ring, as the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. A money-spinning fight against the undefeated Mayweather fell through earlier this year when the American insisted on Olympic-style drug testing, leading to a war of words and a stalemate in negotiations. Pacquiao opted to fight Ghana's Clottey, whom he beat in 12 rounds, while Mayweather will take on fellow American Shane Mosley on May 1. Any likely meeting between the two would probably be the richest in box office history and be staged at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, although Pacquiao filled the home stadium of the Dallas Cowboys NFL team -- where the Mayweather fight was initially scheduled to be held -- for his bout with Clottey.","Manny Pacquiao announces that he may retire from boxing due to his mother's concerns .

"(CNN)  -- The promoter for Filipino world champion boxer Manny Pacquaio, Bob Arum, has confirmed the ""super fight"" with American Floyd Mayweather Jr. will not happen after mediation talks between the two parties failed. ""The fight is off, Floyd Mayweather walked away,"" Arum told the USA Today newspaper in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Pacquiao and Mayweather had asked retired federal judge Daniel Weinstein to help the two parties resolve a dispute, which had threatened to derail what was expected to be the most lucrative bout in the history of the sport. However, after two days of further negotiation, Arum said no agreement could be made with Mayweather, with the result that both fighters would now miss out on a potential purse of $40 million each. ""It's not surprising. I always felt that he wasn't going to do the fight. He knows Manny will beat him. Mayweather's never stepped into the ring with a guy he had any question but that he was going to beat. Our guy was agreeable, Mayweather wasn't,"" the Top Rank promoter said. ""That's why there's never been a (Shane) Mosley, there's never been a (Antonio) Margarito, there never was a (Miguel) Cotto, and there's no Pacquiao. ""Floyd Mayweather is a coward. He will never fight anyone that will remotely give him a tough fight. ""It would've made millions and millions, and he walked away from it ... I'm not disappointed in the sense that I always knew it was going to be this way."" The welterweight title bout was thrown into doubt when Mayweather demanded that random drugs testing should be employed before the fight, a request that prompted Pacquiao to take legal action for defamation. Arum said Pacquiao will turn his attention to fighting undefeated Israeli WBA super welterweight champion Yuri Foreman on March 13 or March 20. Filipino pugilist Pacquiao had been infuriated by the insistence of Mayweather and his team at Golden Boy Promotions that both fighters submit to Olympic-style blood testing in the buildup to their pay-per-view extravaganza. Pacquiao filed a lawsuit in a federal court in Las Vegas last week for  defamation against Mayweather and others for allegedly claiming he had used performance-enhancing drugs. The bout at welterweight appeared to be virtually set after other issues around the cut of the purse for each fighter were settled, but then the drug-testing row erupted over the Christmas period. Pacquiao became a five-weight world champion after his WBO welterweight title win over Miguel Cotto in November, while the unbeaten Mayweather returned from a 21-month retirement to beat Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez in September.","Top Rank promoter Bob Arum, confirms the ""super fight"" with American Floyd Mayweather Jr. is off .

"(CNN)  -- Rafael Nadal stepped up his bid for a fifth French Open crown with a straight sets win over former world number one Lleyton Hewitt in Paris on Saturday. Second seed Nadal was made to fight hard against a determined Hewitt, but wrapped up a 6-3 6-4 6-3 victory in two hours 28 minutes on the Philippe Chatrier court at Roland Garros. Nadal was often extended in cold and windy conditions but said he is running into his best form for the second week of the grand slam. ""I am playing better now and today was a good test against Lleyton and to win against him in three sets is very good news,"" he said in a courtside interview. Hewitt made an immediate break of service against Nadal, but the Spaniard immediately retrieved it and a further break saw him take the opener. It was Hewitt's turn to hit back after the early loss of his service in the second  but once again it was Nadal who pulled clear to take a two sets lead. The third set again followed the same pattern, with Hewitt having to hit back after an early loss of service before slipping to defeat on the third match point. Nadal will now play young Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci, who beats Croat veteran Ivan Lubicic 7-6 6-2 6-4, in the fourth round. Earlier, sixth seed Andy Roddick made a third round exit to Russian qualifier Teimuraz Gabashvili to continue his dismal run at Roland Garros. The big-serving American has never got beyond the last 16 in the clay court grand slam and was roundly beaten 6-4 6-2 6-2 by world number 114 Gabashvili. ""I've fought through a couple of matches that were a bit dicey but today I got outplayed from the first ball,"" Roddick told AFP. ""He played good tennis. Credit to him. He got the best of me and he was getting the best of me on 70 percent of the points."" Gabashvili will now play Austrian Juergen Melzer, who shocked ninth seed David Ferrer, easing to a 6-4 6-0 7-6 win over the Spaniard, who had been favored to challenge in Paris. But 22nd seed Melzer was always on top and wrapped up victory in the third set tiebreak which he claimed seven points to one. Third seed Novak Djokovic booked his place in the second week with a relatively comfortable 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-2 win over Victor Hanescu, the 31st seed from Romania. The Serbian has a last 16 clash with American Robby Ginepri, who shocked Spanish 16th seed and 2003 champion Juan Carlos Ferrero, 7-5 6-3 3-6 2-6 6-4.

In court documents posted on the gossip site Radar Online, Candi Holyfield claims Evander Holyfield struck her February 1 after she asked him about the heat being cut off. She said her husband told her she needed to put God first and asked her whether she had been tithing, then struck her when she refused to show him check stubs of payments to the church. The couple was in bed, she said, and ""he got up and turned the light on and started looking at my face and told me he was sorry, that he knew he shouldn't have done that."" But, she alleges, Evander Holyfield ""has hurt me before and ... been violent in the presence of children."" Candi Holyfield says in the documents that the abuse began about six months into their marriage. In 2008, she said, Holyfield choked her in front of the couple's daughter and the housekeeper, and in 2009 he struck her in front of their children. The emergency protective order was granted, according to the documents posted on Radar Online, pending a hearing set for February 18. Holyfield, 47, is a four-time heavyweight boxing champion, and has estimated winnings of more than $200 million. During the summer, his $10 million home in Fayette County was under foreclosure, but was pulled from the auction block at the last minute.","Protective order filed against boxer Evander Holyfield, according to court records .

"(CNN) -- Olympic cycling champion Bradley Wiggins has left American outfit Team Garmin-Transitions to join his native Britain's first professional elite-level line-up. The 29-year-old, who has won the last two Olympic individual pursuit titles and finished fourth at last year's Tour De France, has signed a four-year contract with Team Sky. He had been with Garmin for only one season, and needed to win a release from his contract for 2010 to join up with Sky, backed by broadcasting giant BSkyB. ""Although we understand his strong desire to be a part of the UK's first-ever Pro Tour team, we would have loved to continue with him through 2010. His departure is not the outcome we hoped for,"" Garmin said in a statement on Thursday. Team Sky officials were delighted to add Wiggins to a roster that already features Geraint Thomas, Ian Stannard, Russell Downing, Peter Kennaugh, Chris Froome and Steve Cummings. ""Brad will be at home in Team Sky. It is the perfect fit and he will be a marquee rider for us,"" said team principal Dave Brailsford, who is also British Cycling's performance director. ""He is an exceptional athlete -- a great performer at a great age. And he will get better still. ""At Team Sky he can continue to develop, surrounded by some of the coaches and performance experts who have worked with him for years as part of the British Cycling set-up. ""With his experience he will help us to develop our great young talents too."" Team Sky's first major race will be the Tour Down Under in January. Wiggins is hoping to build on his 2009 season with another strong showing in cycling's premier event, the Tour de France, after joining his sixth professional team since starting out with the Linda McCartney outfit in 2001. ""It has been an amazing year for me and my ride at the Tour has given me the drive to aim even higher,"" he told reporters. ""I know I can continue to develop and Team Sky is the perfect place to make that happen. ""Team Sky has huge ambitions, not just for the team but for cycling and inspiring the public to ride. It's an amazing project and the next four years will be very exciting. ""Obviously it was always going to be a difficult situation to leave Garmin. I was surrounded by friends, had close relationships with the riders and some of the staff. ""But there was was only ever going to be one team I would leave that team for, and that was of course to come home to Team Sky and pretty much everyone who has helped me to my Olympic success.""","Olympic cycling champion Bradley Wiggins leaves American outfit Team Garmin .

"(CNN) -- Cowering in a school restroom stall, young Charles D'Angelo would eat his lunch alone to escape classmates bullying him about his weight. A woman at his Catholic school's rectory let him watch the news with her during his break instead of playing outside. After losing 160 pounds, Charles D'Angelo got a shirtless picture of himself shown in Cosmopolitan. During high school, he got a doctor's note to excuse him from physical education. After years of overeating and under-exercising, he ballooned to around 360 pounds and felt depressed. But before-and-after photos he posted on iReport.com show how the St. Louis, Missouri, resident transformed himself from overweight teen to muscular man. Now a fitness coach, his mission in life is to make exercise fun so that kids will want to stay healthy. ""I'm not saying 'poor me,' but I went through a lot of pain and terrible days,"" D'Angelo said. ""I do believe that if my story can help others, then I'll do what it takes."" The need for better health habits seems greater than ever. More than 17 percent of youths ages 12 to 19 were estimated to be obese after a 2003-2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. That number was just 5 percent in the late 1970s. When D'Angelo was 17, he decided to get in shape. He initially focused on weightlifting and gym workouts to build up his muscles, calling the iPod one of the best products ever invented for those seeking to get fit. Growing up in an Italian family had taught him that food and emotions go together, whether at weddings or funerals. He used to munch on junk food during recess, but as he got older, he forced himself to eat planned, healthy meals. iReport.com: Shedding pounds, becoming a fitness coach . At 23 years old and a muscular 204 pounds, he has kept his excess weight off for five years and sports a rippling six-pack. He says he even got a shirtless photo of himself showcased in Cosmopolitan magazine. He hopes his success will make him a role model for obese kids, and he tries to come up with fun and supportive ways of exercising.  Watch iReporters 'dancasize' and show off fun workouts » . ""I was just scared to death of being tested or compared. I don't think we should measure people based on how many push-ups can you do, how many sit-ups can you do."" Keeping exercise fun and personally fulfilling is key to helping him stay with his workouts for the long haul. He enjoys watching TV while he works out. Boot camps and other group activities provide the camaraderie he craves. One of his clients owns a local gym that ""looks like an arcade,"" which he points to as an example of another way of giving exercise a better image. Wii Fit and Dance Dance Revolution stations are available. D'Angelo also said he feels he would have benefited from more-structured eating habits and routines as a child. Anything that gets the body moving can be good exercise, said Janet Fulton, a CDC epidemiologist. The government recommends the equivalent of 150 minutes of brisk walking or other moderate exercise per week. The time spent can change based on the intensity of the exercise. Fulton said regular workouts help ward off disease and keep weight stable over time. In combination with properly balanced nutrition and caloric intake, increased physical activity can help with weight loss. Whether exercise or nutrition are more responsible for increases in obesity over the last 30 years is unclear, Fulton said, but people seeking to lose weight should focus on both areas and pay attention to what they eat. She suggested doing an enjoyable exercise in the company of others. iReport.com: What's your fun exercise? ""Find a buddy, even if you're walking your dog. You cannot only do that, but do it with your family. Be a member of the team and get your social support that way."" Over time, D'Angelo developed confidence, and he says he wants to help others do the same. Dating seemed to be out of the question when he was heavier, but he now has a girlfriend. He says losing the weight and building his confidence have gone hand in hand. Many other iReporters said they also felt bad about exercise as kids and posted their own ideas for pleasurable alternatives that could help beat obesity. Staci Lambert-Westcott of Stephens City, Virginia, took up exercise and fitness to help manage the diabetes she was developing. Getting married and having children made maintaining her weight a challenge. When she got up to 247 pounds and at age 29, she decided to get fit. Now 37, she recalls getting an ego boost after losing a significant amount under the cover of winter clothing. When spring came, a neighbor thought Lambert-Westcott's husband had a new woman in his life. Throughout her personal weight-loss journey, she learned to get over her childhood dislike of exercise. As she lost pounds, she grew more comfortable exercising in public. Lambert-Westcott got to know the owner of her gym and eventually bought the business from him. She had always dreaded going to physical education class, so she tried to offer fun options for women when she was in charge. iReport.com: Bought the gym, lost 135 pounds . ""The classes were extremely popular because they were fun, and mom and daughter could come together. While mom was working out, daughter was working with a coach in the back."" Though she eventually sold the gym to go back to school, she continues to work out and maintain her healthy weight. Keeping the pressure off workouts is key, said fellow iReporter Jonathan Lund, 35, of Duluth, Minnesota. As a fitness trainer at a hospital, he works with everyone from elite athletes to patients at the facility. His experiences as an overweight teen helped show him how to help others be healthy. ""I have to remind myself, it took a lot of work to get these people out of the house and into this club,"" he said. He grew up self-conscious about excess weight and felt like he couldn't keep up with the other kids. Individual activities such as running helped him take off the weight. ""I never thought I could play sports or do anything like that. I always felt really intimidated by that. I also didn't like the aspect of team sports because it wasn't much of a workout because usually, you'd be sitting on the sidelines and you'd play for five minutes."" iReport.com: Lund stops to post an iReport at a marathon . He now runs marathons but got his start walking and increasing intensity little by little. He describes the long-distance events as ""addictive."" Along the way, Lund has battled a lot of negative thinking about himself. Despite the dozen or so marathons he's completed, including the Chicago Marathon on Sunday in Illinois and the recent Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lund's insecurities have stuck with him into adulthood. He pushes forward anyway. ""I still feel like a fat kid, even though I'm not anymore,"" he said. ""I feel like I have to keep running in order to keep up. But at the same time, it's the best therapy that there is. All that negative stuff gets worked out in your mind.""","Readers overcame childhood obesity, dislike of exercise through fun fitness .

"(CNN) -- Whoever said names will never hurt you was wrong, according to a new study. A new study suggests exposure to verbal put-downs from peers can make it harder for good students to achieve. The study from the University of Illinois suggests dealing with classmate put-downs can make it harder for good students to learn and make it more difficult for students who are behind to catch up. The first-of-its-kind study cited a national sample of data from the U.S. Department of Education on more than 10,000 high-school sophomores in more than 650 U.S. high schools. One in five respondents claimed they were often ""put down"" verbally by their peers in school. ""I think it's sort of a wake-up call for a lot of us that this kind of verbal harassment is going on in schools, and it's contributing to a learning environment that is quite disruptive for kids,"" said Christy Lleras, a University of Illinois assistant professor of human and community development, who worked on the study.  See details about K-12 schools, teachers » . It's not only an issue at public schools. Lleras said the research shows these put-downs are just as big a problem in private high schools as well. Referring to private schools, Lleras said, ""They were certainly doing a good job at making their kids feel safe, but they were not insulating them from emotional harm."" Results of the study indicate boys are likely to experience these put-downs more often than girls, especially at private schools. The university's study also measured the issue among racial and academic lines. African-American high school students who considered themselves very good students were shown to be more likely to be the victims of verbal abuse from their peers. Lleras believes the put-downs are a way of coping for students when they are struggling to do their classwork. Regardless of the reason, she thinks it's time schools did something about it. ""A lot of time we've been focusing on physical abuse -- bullying,"" said Lleras. ""However, if one in five kids (is) experiencing this ... this is something that's become an everyday culture among our adolescents. I think knowing that, schools are going to have starting to address it.""

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada -- LeBron James put on another shooting clinic in a 118-81 rout of Argentina as the United States locked up a tournament gold medal to go with an Olympic berth at the FIBA Americas Championship on Sunday. James and Chauncey Billups hoist the trophy after the U.S. won the FIBA Americas title to go with an Olympic berth. James, who had a perfect night against Uruguay earlier in the tournament by hitting all 11 of his field goals, led the heavily-favored Americans with four three pointers in the third quarter and capped his night with a game-high 31 points.

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt completed his hat-trick of sprint titles at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin as he helped the all-conquering Jamaican side power to victory in the men's 4x100m relay final. Bolt (second right) celebrates his third gold medal after helping Jamaica to victory in the 4x100m relay. Bolt ran the third leg, handing off to individual bronze medallist Asafa Powell, as Olympic champions Jamaica took gold in a new championship record of 37.31 seconds. Jamaica had rested Bolt and Powell in the heats and were always red-hot favorites to win. ""I wasn't really thinking about getting three gold medals because I could be in better shape,"" Bolt, who broke his own world records in the 100 and 200m with times of 9.58 and 19.19 respectively, told trackside reporters. Trinidad, who chased Jamaica home in Beijing last year, again took silver with Great Britain claiming the bronze medal. The United States were disqualified on Friday for an illegal baton change despite winning their semifinal. Jamiaca's victory, their seventh gold medal of the games, ensured the nation won both sprint relays after their women claimed gold in the women's 4x100m relay earlier on Saturday. Individual 100m champion Shelly-Ann Fraser led the team to victory in a time of 42.06 seconds to take gold ahead of the Bahamas, while Germany pulled off a surprise to claim third place. Defending champions the United States failed to reach the final when Muna Lee struggled to get hold of the baton on the second handover from Alexandria Anderson and stumbled before pulling up with a hamstring injury. The U.S. relay performances in Berlin's have been a carbon copy of last year's Olympics where neither team reached the final or finished their heat. Elsewhere, Kenya's Abel Kirui comfortably won the men's marathon with a well-timed break in the last four miles of the race. Kirui produced a sustained burst to pull clear of team-mate Emmanuel Mutai and win gold in a championship record time of two hours six minutes and 54 seconds. Mutai finished 54 seconds behind in second position while Ethiopia's Olympic bronze medallist Tsegaye Kebede again took third place. Kenya were celebrating again when Vivian Cheruiyot outsprinted defending champion Meseret Defar of Ethiopia to win the women's 5,000 meters. Cheruiyot, a Sydney Olympic Games finalist at 16, who won silver in the last worlds in Osaka in 2007, had led for much of the race but was overtaken by Defar with 150 metres to go to the finish. It looked like Defar would be celebrating an Ethiopian gold in the absence of injured team-mate and Olympic champion Tirunesh Dibaba, but Cheruiyot produced a stunning fightback to cross first in 14 minutes 57.98 seconds. As Defar eased off in the knowledge that she had been beaten, Cheruiyot's compatriot Sylvia Kibet stole in for silver in 14:58.33, for the second one-two podium finish for Kenya following the men's marathon. The result was a blow to Ethiopia, for whom Olympic champion and world recorder holder Dibaba was injured but would have been pre-race favorite if fit. In the field events, Olympic champion Steven Hooker of Australia added the men's pole vault title to his Beijing crown by clearing 5.90 meters. The 27-year-old, whose personal best of 6.06m makes him the second highest vaulter in history, showed his confidence by sitting out the early rounds and only came in at 5.85m which he failed to clear. But he opted to raise the bar and nailed 5.90m at his first attempt which was enough to give him the gold medal with Frenchmen Romain Mesnil and Renaud Lavillenie claiming silver and bronze. American Dwight Phillips regained his men's long jump title to fulfill his dream of winning in the same stadium and same event where Jesse Owens triumphed at the 1936 Olympic Games. The 31-year-old, the 2004 Olympic champion and 2003 and 2005 world champion, won gold with 8.54 meters to beat South Africa's Olympic silver medalist Godfrey Mokoena (8.47m) while Australia's Mitchell Watt took bronze (8.37m). Poland's Anita Wlodarczyk won the women's hammer with a new world record throw of 77.96 meters. The 24-year-old beat defending champion Betty Heidler of Germany, who took silver with a national record of 77.12m, while Martina Hrasnova of Slovakia won the bronze with a throw of 74.79m.","Usain Bolt completes his hat-trick of gold medals at the World Championships .

"(CNN) -- Brazil and Portugal played out a disappointing draw as Group G reached its climax but both cruised into the last 16 of the World Cup. Striker Nilmar came the closest to breaking the deadlock for Brazil, as his shot was diverted onto the crossbar by Portugal goalkeeper Eduardo. Brazil finish as group winners and will face either Spain, Chile or Switzerland in the second round. Portugal go through as runners up and will face either Spain or Chile. Ivory Coast comfortably beat North Korea 3-0 in the group's other match but it wasn't enough to give them hope of qualifying in place of Portugal. Brazil 0-0 Portugal . During a cagey opening in Durban, neither side created any chances of note in the opening 20 minutes of the game, that was dominated by a series of niggly fouls. Brazil defender Juan was lucky not to see a red card as he hand balled a long pass that would have released Cristiano Ronaldo. The first real chance came on the half hour mark as Nilmar met striker Luis Fabiano's cross but Portugal goalkeeper Eduardo turned his effort onto the crossbar. Fabiano then headed narrowly wide of the target as he met Maicon's cross from the right flank. Ronaldo registered Portugal's first effort on target five minutes before the break but his powerful shot was easily gathered by Brazil goalkeeper Cesar. A series of fouls disrupted the flow of the game, as the referee produced seven yellow cards before half-time arrived -- including one to Tiago for diving. Fabiano forced Eduardo into another save with a looping header before Simao tested Cesar at the other end but his shot was right at the 'keeper. A powerful run from Ronaldo created a chance for Raul Meireles but his flick towards goal brushed the side-netting via a touch from Cesar. Substitute Ramires brought a superb save out of Eduardo near the end as his shot was deflected towards the top corner but both sides were content to hold out for a point. Ivory Coast 3-0 North Korea . Ivory Coast knew they needed to rack up as many goals as possible against North Korea to have any chance of qualifying and they opened the scoring within 15 minutes. Yaya Toure collected Arthur Boka's cross before stroking the ball into the far corner. Just a minute later, full-back Romaric hit the post. In the 20th minute striker Didier Drogba smashed a shot against the crossbar before Romaric nodded the rebound into the net. Gervinho nearly made it 3-0 seven minutes before half-time but his shot from an angle flicked off the outside of the post. Drogba came close to adding a third after the break but his diving header flew over the crossbar before substitute Salomon Kalou smashed a shot over the bar from close range. With ten minutes remaining Kalou met Boka's cross to fire into the net and despite having two goals disallowed for offside, the Ivory Coast couldn't add to their tally.","Brazil and Portugal draw 0-0 in Durban .

"(CNN) -- Spain's World Cup campaign finally burst into life as they beat ten-man Chile to finish top of Group H and avoid a last 16 clash with tournament favorites Brazil. David Villa and Andres Iniesta scored the goals as the European champions leapfrogged their opponents into top spot courtesy of a 2-1 win. Switzerland failed to take advantage of Chile's defeat and grab the last qualification spot, as their game with Honduras finished 0-0. Spain will now face Portugal in the second round while Chile will play Brazil. Spain 2-1 Chile . Spain headed into the game knowing that a win would be good enough to take them into the second round as group winners. Liverpool striker Fernando Torres had an early chance to put them in front but he headed over from Xavi's cross. Chile's first chance came in the tenth minute when Jean Beausejour crossed for Mark Gonzalez but the winger couldn't direct his effort on target. In the 24th minute Barcelona striker David Villa broke the deadlock. As Fernando Torres raced to latch onto a long pass, Chile 'keeper Claudio Bravo rushed out of his goal to clear, but Villa latched onto the loose ball to stroke it into the net. Defender Gerard Pique should have made it 2-0 when he put a free header over the bar from ten yards out, but he had to be alert seconds later to deny Beausejour an equalizer. Then came the decisive passage of the game as Villa squared for Andres Iniesta to place a shot into the corner. In the build up to the goal Chilean defender Marco Estrada tripped Torres and was sent off after being shown a second yellow card. Chile's ten men did hit back within minutes of the restart as substitute Rodrigo Millar's shot deflected off Pique and into the net but they failed to create any chances after that. There was a worry for Spain as striker Torres was substituted on 55 minutes. The 26-year-old was injured at the end of the Premier League season with Liverpool and began Spain's opening game on the bench. Chile pushed forward in search of an equalizer late on but Spain made their extra man count to retain possession, kill off the game and secure top spot. Switzerland 0-0 Honduras . Switzerland knew they had to beat Honduras to have a realistic chance of going through through but it was Honduras who enjoyed the majority of possession in the early stages. Midfielder Gokhan Inler squandered Switzerland's first opportunity, shooting wide form the edge of the penalty area. Striker Eren Derdiyok then headed wide from six yards out after meeting Stéphane Grichting's right wing cross but the teams went in level at the break. With Chile trailing to Spain, Switzerland poured forward in search of the goals that would have lifted them into second spot and meant qualification for the last 16. But it was Honduras who had a glorious chance to take the lead just after half-time when Edgar Alvarez's cross found David Suazo unmarked six yards from goal but the striker somehow managed to put his header wide. Then only a brilliant reaction save from Switzerland 'keeper Diego Benaglio prevented Edgar Alvarez from scoring as Honduras broke quickly. Switzerland's Alexander Frei was next to go close as he met Hakan Yakin's free-kick at the far post but he couldn't direct his effort on target. Both teams threw players forward to try and find a winner but it ended 0-0.","Spain beat Chile 2-1 to go into last 16 as winners of Group H .

"(CNN)  -- Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is set to play his injured captain Didier Drogba from the start of their crucial World Cup Group G clash against Brazil on Sunday. Drogba fractured his arm during a pre-World Cup warm-up match against Japan but still managed 25 minutes during Ivory Coast's 0-0 draw against Portugal in their opener on Tuesday. The Chelsea star wore a cast to protect his injury and came close to making the breakthrough after coming off the bench. Former England boss Eriksson was clearly satisfied with what he saw and his performances in training. ""It wouldn't be surprising if Drogba plays from the start against Brazil. He came on for 25 minutes against Portugal and it went well,"" Eriksson told AFP. Brazil opened their campaign with a 2-1 win over North Korea but face stiffer tests against the Ivorians and Portugal in the so-called ""Group of Death."" Drogba's goals powered Chelsea to the English league and FA Cup double and is clearly vital to the Ivory Coast cause despite still recovering from the surgery to his arm on June 5. Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz was unhappy that Drogba had been allowed to play, suggesting he was receiving special treatment for world governing body FIFA. Meanwhile, Fabio Capello, coach of Eriksson's former charges, said he would not change his policy of not revealing his team to his squad until two hours before kick off. ""Always (on) the day of the game, not the day before,"" he replied to reporters who wanted to know if he was standing by goalkeeper Robert Green, whose astonishing blunder gifted the USA their equaliser in their Group C opener.

"(CNN) -- Alicia Azzopardi was laid off just before Christmas. It couldn't have happened at a better time. Trent Vondrasek, who went from the auto industry to an unpaid internship, poses with his children. ""I was so upset when I left my job,"" said Azzopardi. ""I was crying, and I just didn't know what to do."" The same week that she got laid off, Michigan State University accepted her into its accelerated nursing program. Even better, she learned she qualified for a grant from the Michigan Nursing Corps. The state-funded initiative, which provides her with a $25,000 stipend, is addressing Michigan's nursing shortage in part by rewarding workers who have been laid off. ""My tuition is pretty much 100 percent paid for, and I don't take that lightly,"" said Azzopardi, 28, who has a background in business and sales. While trying to survive in the state with the highest unemployment rate in the nation, Azzopardi and others are taking advantage of their job losses by pursuing careers they've always wanted. Michigan's 14.1 percent unemployment in May towers above the national average of 9.5 percent, according to U.S. Department of Labor statistics for June. ""It's a really hard thing to change careers when you didn't want to,"" said Martha Mangelsdorf, author of ""Strategies for Successful Career Change."" But starting over at an older age carries less of a stigma than it once did. ""It's not like the 1950s where people started with one company and stayed there for the rest of their working career,"" Mangelsdorf said. The oldest intern . For Trent Vondrasek, 42, chasing the dream translated to becoming the oldest intern at the Lansing, Michigan, mayor's office, after he lost his job in October as a consultant for General Motors . But the father of three had found himself hobbled by a major career decision in his 20s that continues to plague him. He quit college to take a sales job for an auto supplier. ""One of the mitigating factors [potential employers] are looking for is, do you have a college degree? And I don't have one. Even though I've got 18 years' experience, I'm not even considered,"" said Vondrasek. Now, Vondrasek is trying to break into politics, but has found that he has to make his way up the ladder. As an unpaid intern, his peers were about half his age. He also was older than some of his superiors. ""I learned a lot from them, and I think they learned some things from me also,"" Vondrasek said of the other interns. ""Because of my sales experience, I'm used to dealing with people."" Vondrasek highlighted one episode of his new career that he said brought him exceptional job satisfaction. He helped protect a woman from losing her electricity and from a mortgage company that was threatening to foreclose on her home. The woman had complained that agencies would not return her calls. Vondrasek used his influence and links to the mayor's office to talk with the agencies. Vondrasek also studies political science at Lansing Community College. He's paying tuition out of his own pocket, which is a challenge as his family tightens its belt. ""I fully realize that by going into public service, I'm not going to be financially as sound as I was in the automotive industry, because I got paid extremely well for what I did,"" he said. ""But if I can get more self-satisfaction out of it and be prouder of what I'm doing on a day-to-day basis, then for me, that's a win."" Still, Vondrasek said, he probably would not have taken this route if he had not been laid off. Volunteering and pursuing avenues where you excel, ­like Vondrasek did, can ­help career-changers make the best of the situation, said Mary Beth Sammons, author of ""Second Acts that Change Lives: Making a Difference in the World."" ""This is an opportunity to look where your heart is and to follow your passions,"" she said. Sammons has her own story to tell. Based in Chicago, Illinois, with a journalism background, she began writing her book last fall after losing her job as vice president of a Web site for people facing health crises. ""I had already done the second act, taking my journalism skills and putting them in a place I thought was meaningful -- helping people that were sick and dying,"" said Sammons, 52. ""I suddenly realized I had to create another act for myself."" Her next personal chapter became writing about people who reinvented themselves. How to manage a successful career change .

"(CNN) -- American striker Clint Dempsey says the U.S. team has drawn confidence from impressive performances against Brazil, Spain and England but says Friday's World Cup clash with Slovenia is a match his side cannot afford to lose. Dempsey struck the lucky shot which slipped through England goalkeeper Robert Green's hands to earn a 1-1 draw for the U.S. in its opening game of the World Cup last Saturday in South Africa. But the Americans played well to avoid defeat against one of the World Cup's most highly fancied teams and Dempsey said the experience of reaching last year's Confederations Cup final had given the American players the confidence to compete with the competition's best sides. The U.S. team beat European champions Spain 2-0 in the semifinals of that tournament and led Brazil by two goals in the final before going down 3-2 to a late winner. ""Before the game (against England), we knew that if we played our best, we would get a result out of the game and we did that at the Confederations Cup playing against the top teams,"" Dempsey told CNN. Midfielder Michael Bradley also said the U.S. team had become ""battle hardened."" ""We've had three or four years of playing against the best teams in the world. We've gotten to the point where when we've stepped onto the field against a team like England, there's a sense of we've been here before,"" Bradley told CNN. ""We know what the game is going to be like and we know what we need to do to be successful. That mentality is going to take us where we want to go."" With the top two in the group advancing to the knockout stages, the U.S. and England are favorites to progress ahead of Slovenia and Algeria. But with Slovenia beating Algeria in their opening game, Dempsey said the U.S. could not afford to slip up against a team representing the smallest country to qualify for the finals. ""If we lose this game, potentially we'll be out of the tournament, so we have to go out there and make sure that, yeah, we do take chances going forward but calculated risks,"" said Dempsey. ""You can't just say 'everybody go because we've got to post a win' and be countered and get scored on."" Bradley, the son of U.S. coach Bob Bradley, said the American players would treat Slovenia with the same respect they showed England. ""The term favorites or underdogs... these words, you guys use them but they're not words that we use,"" Bradley said. ""We had a lot of respect for England, we knew it was going to be a difficult game, and I can tell you we have a lot of respect for Slovenia and we know that will be a difficult game too.""","Michael Bradley says U.S. team is battle hardened after Confederations Cup .

"(CNN) -- Italy have admitted they do not know when star goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will be able to return to action at the 2010 World Cup. Buffon, who helped Italy win the tournament in Germany four years ago, had to be substituted at half-time during his team's 1-1 draw with Paraguay on Monday because of a sciatic nerve problem. The Juventus stopper initially said he hoped ""to recover in two days"" but an official Italy team statement was less optimistic. ""[He] has a strong sciatic problem,"" it read. ""It's impossible to estimate when he might return."" Italy's next match is against New Zealand on Sunday June 20, with a contest against Slovakia four days later. The Azzurri had to come back from a goal behind against Paraguay and will need to improve dramatically if they are to win the tournament and match Brazil's record haul of five World Cups. Meanwhile, Dutch winger Arjen Robben is still eight days away from full fitness, according to Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk. Robben was back in training on Tuesday following the hamstring injury which ruled him out of their 2-0 victory over Denmark, but is likely to miss the June 19 clash with Japan. Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta is fit for Spain's opening World Cup match against Switzerland on June 16 after overcoming a thigh injury.

"Editor's note: Rudy Ruiz founded RedBrownandBlue.com, a site featuring multicultural political commentary. He is host of a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show and wrote a guide to success for immigrants (""¡Adelante!"" published by Random House). He is co-founder and president of Interlex, an advocacy marketing agency based in San Antonio, Texas. Rudy Ruiz says taxing fattening foods is a good way to combat the epidemic of obesity in America. SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- I recently accompanied my family to one of the top-selling movies in America, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs."" All I could think of, aside from struggling ironically to keep my children from overindulging in junk food, was that members of Congress should watch the movie. It might inspire them to add an important dimension to health reform: smarter food policy. In the movie, a town nearly dooms itself via gluttony. As hamburgers, steaks and ice cream rain down, residents feast euphorically, oblivious to their expanding waistlines -- until a child succumbs to a food coma. The movie is a thinly veiled allegory for our nation's obesity epidemic. It serves up -- in digestible terms -- the dysfunctional relationship between government, industry and parents in engineering and promoting a glut of food that keeps dollars in our pockets and smiles on our faces in the short term, while rendering us dangerously unhealthy in the long term. Beyond the movie magic, it's a sobering reality that two-thirds of Americans are afflicted by the obesity epidemic. Our bulging waistline correlates to our ballooning health care budget, accounting for $147 billion a year in medical bills, according to a study funded by the CDC Foundation and published this summer in the health policy journal Health Affairs. Experts at Johns Hopkins call the trend ""a public health crisis,"" projecting that by 2015, 75 percent of Americans will be overweight or obese. Shockingly, the Center for Children's Health Innovation reports that by the time kids enter kindergarten, over 26 percent are already overweight or obese. As I surveyed the theater, those stats ceased to surprise. While my children drank water and nibbled on a negotiated ration of candy, their peers lurked beyond enormous buckets of popcorn and towering cups of soda balanced precariously on their laps. Fast forward to my point. In improving America's health, are we missing a key plotline? Wouldn't the best way to control escalating health costs be to become healthier to begin with? Are rising costs driven not only by corporate greed, but also by self-destructive behavioral patterns? If the government is serious about tackling our nation's health problems, then it should address food's role in the looming crisis. To Congress' credit, proposed reforms emphasize increased prevention. But if socioeconomic incentives to consume harmful food persist, unhealthy patient behavior will prevail at monstrous cost to all of us. The affordability of unhealthy food is at the congested heart of the matter. According to TIME magazine, the largesse of taxpayers enables McDonald's to offer a Big Mac, fries and a Coke for under $5. Our tax dollars underwrite Agriculture Department subsidies to corn farmers. Cheap, abundant corn enables mass production of economical, aggressively marketed beef and pork. The corn syrup that sweetens soft drinks and candy oozes from the same source. That's why it's so cheap to be fat and -- comparatively -- so expensive to be thin. In response, a comprehensive preventive health strategy should: . • Shift subsidies away from corn toward the production of fresh fruits and vegetables as well as organic farming, so healthier, more natural foods become as accessible as Happy Meals. • Tax fast food, soft drinks, and packaged foods high in processed fats and sugars to decrease demand for unhealthy food. A study published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine recommends a tax on ""sugar-sweetened beverages,"" projecting that for every 10 percent rise in price, consumption of soft drinks would decline a corresponding 8 to 10 percent, leading to weight loss and reduced health risks. • Regulate youth nutrition marketing, preventing paradoxes like the teaming of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" -- despite its well-intentioned message -- with Burger King for a promotion heavily advertised on children's TV. While some will argue that more taxes and regulations are the last things we need and that the government has no place telling people what to consume, precedent exists for both. We already tax and regulate other harmful products -- like tobacco and alcohol -- because it's common sense to dissuade individuals from nasty habits that cost our entire society. Plus, tax proceeds would help underwrite health reforms and preventive education. And since the government's current subsidy system enabled our transformation into an obese nation in the first place, why shouldn't the government implement a corrective course of action encouraging families onto a healthier track? I hate to spoil the movie, but in the end, the endangered town didn't solve its problems by building more hospitals and paying doctors and insurance companies to treat and cover those who overate or were flattened by mammoth meatballs. Instead, the townspeople simply destroyed the machine drowning them in supersized food. Likewise, Congress must rage against the machines not only of the health care industry tasked with healing us, but also of the food industry making us sick. Drawing inspiration at the movies, they might even find that in the dark sanctum of the theater, it's easier to reach across the aisle, hold hands, and craft a happy ending that leaves America clamoring for a sequel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.","Rudy Ruiz:  America's obesity epidemic costs the nation billions .

"(CNN) -- Slovenia edged out 10-man Algeria 1-0 in Sunday's World Cup Group C match at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. A strike from Slovenian captain Robert Koren in the 79th minute found the net after the Algerian goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi made a clumsy attempt at parrying the ball away. The result put Slovenia top of Group C with three points, ahead of England and the U.S. who shared a point on Saturday. Algeria are bottom. Who's creating a World Cup Twitter Buzz? Algeria were forced to play the last 20 minutes with 10 men after substitute Abdelkader Ghezzal was sent off for a second bookable offence on 72 minutes.

Follow the World Cup on CNNArabic . Barely 10 minutes later, Ghezzal deliberately hand-balled trying to reach a ball knocked forward from midfield, leaving the referee no option but to show him a red card. Until Ghezzal's sending-off, Algeria looked the better of the two teams, showing more initiative going forward than the more defensively-minded Slovenian team.

"(CNN) -- The music of Hugh Masekela is the sound of South Africa. In a career that has spanned more than 50 years his songs have expressed both joy and indignation, exploring themes of inequality and hardship, protest and hope. Hugh Masekela, still an inspiration. More than just an inspirational musician, Masekela was an inspirational campaigner against apartheid and is now helping to build a new South Africa. Masekela was born on 4 April 1939, in Witbank, South Africa. He started playing the piano when he was six, but seeing Kirk Douglas play a jazz trumpeter in the movie ""Young Man with a Horn"" inspired him to switch instruments. When he was 14, he was given his first trumpet by the chaplain at his school, renowned anti-apartheid campaigner Trevor Huddleston. Within six months Masekela got together with some school mates to form the Huddleston Jazz Band. He went on to join Alfred Herbert's African Jazz Revue and the Jazz Epsitles, and played in the orchestra for the hugely successful South African musical ""King Kong,"" whose cast included his future wife, legendary singer Miriam Makeba. Watch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg ». But South Africa's apartheid laws were making life increasingly difficult. After recording their first record Masekela and The Jazz Epistles were primed for a national tour, but after the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960 the government banned gatherings of more than 10 people, so the tour had to be abandoned. Masekela was determined to further his musical education and moved to London in 1960, studying at the Guildhall School of Music, before leaving for New York, enrolling in the Manhattan School of Music and immersing himself in the city's buzzing jazz scene. After finishing his studies Masekela planned to return to South Africa to teach music, but he found himself cut off from his homeland. ""When I was ready to come back, I couldn't. The place [South Africa] was impenetrable,"" he told CNN. ""By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to."" Resigned to living in the U.S., Masekela began making a name for himself as a musician, fusing jazz, Latin, African and pop influences in a style all of his own. In 1968 he recorded the breezy instrumental pop tune ""Grazin' in the Grass,"" which gave him a surprise number one hit and became the best-known song of his career. In the 70s he began to divide his time between the U.S. and Africa, living in Guinea, Liberia and Ghana. Incorporating more African influences in his music, he went on to record classics such as ""Home is Where the Music is,"" ""Stimela"" and ""Soweto Blues."" See Hugh's career in photos. » . In Botswana he started a music school and set up a mobile recording studio. Nelson Mandela heard about the projects and sent Masekela a birthday message telling him to ""keep up the good work."" Masekela was so moved that he immediately wrote ""Bring back Nelson Mandela,"" which became an anthem for the anti-apartheid movement. But his vocal opposition to apartheid made him a potential target for South African security forces and he was forced to leave Botswana for London. It was there that he co-wrote the music for hit Broadway musical ""Sarafina!"" Masekela went on to play with Paul Simon on his Graceland tour, along with other South African artists including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Miriam Makeba. It wasn't until 1990, following the release of Nelson Mandela, that Masekela was finally able to move back to his beloved South Africa. ""It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa,"" he told CNN. ""It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening."" Since moving back to Johannesburg, Masekela has continued to record platinum-selling albums and has toured all over the world, but he is also heavily involved in helping his homeland fulfill its potential. Having himself struggled with alcohol and drug abuse in his younger years, Masekela now supports drug-rehabilitation project the Musicians and Artists Assistance Program of South Africa. Another of his projects is to help black Africans own a stake in the country's media outlets. He recently told Al Jazeera, ""TV, broadcasting, manufacturing, management and publishing should be owned by Africans. Until that happens we won't be able to project ourselves, we'll always project from the perspective of those who have exploited us."" The struggle against apartheid may be over but Masekela is still fighting inequality and hardship, and at 70, he is still a source of inspiration and hope.","Musician Hugh Masekela was an inspirational campaigner against apartheid .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- More than 100 security guards have been protesting outside some of the World Cup stadiums this week in South Africa, calling on soccer's world governing body FIFA to upgrade their pay. Along with dealing with security, the guards handle tickets -- so a strike delayed the start of Monday's match between world champions Italy and Paraguay in Cape Town. Local police had to be brought in to the stadium to handle security. Protesters were out again Tuesday outside of Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Protesters sang and dance, some holding placards that read: ""We want our money and then we will feel it."" The strikes have been frowned upon by tournament organizers, but FIFA did not immediately respond for a request for comment. ""Although we have respect for workers' rights, we find it unacceptable for them to disrupt match-day proceedings and will not hesitate to take action in such instances,"" Danny Jordaan, the CEO of South Africa's World Cup organizing committee told South Africa's news agency News 24.

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands made a winning start to their World Cup campaign as a moment of defensive madness cost Denmark dearly in Johannesburg, while Japan defeated a disappointing Cameroon 1-0 in Monday's other Group E match. The Dutch failed to live up to their pre-tournament billing as one of the favorites, needing an own-goal less than a minute into the second half to settle their nerves and pave the way for an eventually comfortable 2-0 victory. Dirk Kuyt sealed the win with five minutes left, then defender Simon Poulsen -- earlier at fault for the opening goal -- made a spectacular clearance from under his own crossbar to prevent an even more damaging defeat. Keisuke Honda was the hero for Japan in Bloemfontein as his first half goal proved enough to beat 1990 quarterfinalists Cameroon and give the Asian side their first World Cup win on foreign soil. Netherlands 2-0 Denmark . The Netherlands started the match in at Soccer City with star forward Arjen Robben on the substitutes' bench still resting his injured hamstring, but still boasted attacking potency in Robin Van Persie and Kuyt plus the midfield presence of Mark van Bommel and Rafael van der Vaart. But Denmark slightly edged the first half as striker Nicklas Bendtner -- who made a surprise recovery from injury to start the match -- headed wide, and then set up Thomas Kahlenburg for a shot that was well saved by Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. But the game turned some 40-odd seconds after the halftime restart when Poulsen, who plays for Dutch club AZ Alkmaar, inexplicably headed Van Persie's cross onto the back of his helpless teammate Daniel Agger and into the net. The unlucky Agger was later credited with the own-goal by world governing body FIFA. With Bendtner going off after an hour, the Danes lost all attacking impetus despite the introduction of 18-year-old forward Christian Eriksen, the youngest player to appear so far at this year's tournament. It became only a matter of time before the Dutch extended their lead, with Wesley Sneijder's deflected shot looping onto the top of Thomas Sorensen's crossbar. Kuyt wrapped it up soon after with a simple chance, following up as Eljero Elia broke free down the left and beat Sorensen with his low shot but hit the post. Poulsen then made some amends for his earlier error as he got back to clear with Sorensen again beaten in the 88th minute. ""The players were a little tense and frustrated in the first-half, we wanted to play beautiful football, but we lost the ball too often,"" Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk told AFP. ""Things got better after the first goal, then you saw what we are capable of doing, we could have won by more. It was a huge relief when the second goal went in."" Japan 1-0 Cameroon . Both Japan and Cameroon came into the World Cup on a poor run of form, with the Asian team having lost four of the previous five games and the Africans winless in seven. After a dull opening, Japan started to press forward and deservedly took the lead seven minutes before the break. Daisuke Matsui swung over a deep cross from the right which eluded the entire Cameroon defense before landing at the feet of Honda, who calmly passed the ball into the net. Cameroon captain Samuel Eto'o, who appeared isolated on the right wing in the first half, carved his side's first real opportunity early in the second. Cutting in between three defenders, the Inter Milan forward cut the ball back from the byline and teed up Eric Choupo-Moting, whose curled shot went narrowly wide. Japan, who reached the last 16 on home soil in 2002, were organized and disciplined throughout and could have extended their lead when Makoto Hasebe's long-range strike drew a flying save from Hamidou Souleymanou. Shinji Okazaki fired the rebound against a post, only to be flagged offside. Moments later, the woodwork was shaking again at the other end of the pitch as Stephane Mbia's fierce shot from outside the area smashed against the crossbar. Cameroon, the highest-ranked African side at the tournament, laid siege to the Japan goal in stoppage-time but could not find a way past the impressive Eiji Kawashima.","Own-goal from Denmark defender puts Netherlands on the way to 2-0 Group E victory .

"(CNN) -- A late penalty by Asamoah Gyan handed Ghana a deserved 1-0 victory against Serbia in the opening Group D match played in Pretoria on Sunday. The striker, who plays for French club Rennes, emphatically converted from the spot past Vladimir Stojkovic in the 84th minute to the obvious delight of the partisan crowd. The victory was the first by an African team at this year's World Cup. Ghana were awarded their penalty after Serbia substitute Zdravko Kuzmanovic needlessly hand-balled a cross which looked to be drifting harmlessly out of his team's penalty area. Amid delirious celebrations of the African supporters in the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Serbia struggled to find an equalizer and it was Ghana, the four-time African champions, who should have made it 2-0 before the final whistle. Who's creating a World Cup Twitter Buzz? Ghana -- popularly known as the Black Stars -- started the match at a high tempo and created chances throughout the match, never allowing the Serbian defense to settle. This attacking pattern was set early on when Rosenborg midfielder Anthony Annan volleyed the ball wide after two minutes and Ghana's captain John Mensah headed a free kick wide of the far post in the 19th minute. Ghana continued to press forward in the second half and came closest to scoring when Gyan rose high above the Serbian defense meeting a long throw from John Pantsil, only to head the ball just wide of Stojkovic's left post. Serbia created fewer chances than their opponents but probably had the better opportunities to score. CNN's World Sport blog . The giant Serbia striker Nikola Zigic should have given his country the lead in the 58th minute when he met Dejan Stankovic's cross at the far post but his control let him down and the ball dribbled away to safety. And later, when Serbia had been reduced to 10 men after Aleksandar Lukovic received his second yellow card in the 73rd minute, Serbia squandered a fantastic opportunity to break the deadlock. Striker, Danko Lazovic broke away from Fulham's John Pantsil on the left goal-line and managed to cut the ball back into the middle of the area which Milos Krasic then struck fiercely at goalkeeper Richard Kingson, who parried the ball to safety. The resulting corner saw Manchester United's Nemanja Vidic narrowly head over the crossbar.

"(CNN) -- Unfancied Switzerland inflicted the first big shock of the World Cup by consigning European champions Spain to a surprise 1-0 defeat in Durban. It is a nightmare start for Spain, which arrived in South Africa ranked as the second best team in the world. It will surely now have to win its next two group games to avoid an embarrassing exit before the knockout stages. Gelson Fernandes' 52nd minute strike for the Swiss came completely against the run of play, and will hardly be remembered as one of the tournament's finest, but despite pouring forward in the game's dying stages Spain could not salvage a point. The Swiss now share top spot in the group with Chile, which produced an impressive display to beat Honduras 1-0 in Wednesday's early kickoff. Jean Beausejour grabbed the only goal of the game, bundling home a cross from Mauricio Isla, but Chile could and should have scored more after squandering a host of chances. Switzerland 1-0 Spain . A spirited rearguard action earned Switzerland one of its most famous victories at the World Cup as it held on for a 1-0 win over Spain. Coach Vicente del Bosque will have plenty of soul searching to do after Spain dominated possession but struggled to create any clear cut chances. In a labored opening half, it was Spain defender Gerard Pique who forced the first save of the match as he twisted free in the penalty area before having his shot smothered by Switzerland goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. Barcelona striker David Villa was next to get a sight of goal as he drew Benaglio before curling a chip wide of the post but the Swiss negotiated their way to the break without conceding. With the second half seven minutes old Switzerland shocked Spain by scoring with its first attack of note. Blaise N'Kufo released Eren Derdiyok who took a tumble over the onrushing Iker Casillas, but as the ball squirmed loose Gelson Fernandes prodded it into an empty net. Spain responded by introducing Liverpool striker Fernando Torres but it was Villa who had the next chance, racing onto a through ball from Andres Iniesta only to be thwarted by Benaglio. Then as Villa turned on the edge of the area the ball ran free to Iniesta, who struck the ball narrowly wide of the far post. Torres then blazed wide from just inside the area before Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso crashed a venomous shot against the bar from 20 yards out. As the Spanish launched numbers forward they left gaps at the back and Derdiyok nearly put the game beyond their reach as he wriggled past Carles Puyol in the box before prodding a shot against the foot of the post. Torres blasted a volley over the bar in the closing stages but Switzerland duly held on to claim three points and register its first ever win over Spain. Spain's defeat means it now has no margin for error in the next two games against Honduras and Chile. After the game Del Bosque told AFP: ""We tried to play. They played very far back and tried to counter-attack. They defended very well. We were playing to win and this victory has escaped us. We may not have shown our true personality as a team. ""It's not a good sign to start off in this way but we have an obligation to cope with that and face the next two games trying to win. That'll be our goal for the next two matches. ""Of course, you can lose in football, but I feel we'll try to get even. We must really give everything. It's pointless standing there with our heads hanging low. The next matches will be good."" Chile 1-0 Honduras . Chile kicked off its first World Cup campaign in 12 years with a comfortable 1-0 victory against unfancied Honduras on Wednesday, but needed a fortuitous first-half goal to triumph in South Africa. The South Americans, who qualified second from their region behind Brazil, dominated the Group H opener in Nelspruit against a 38th-ranked team who scraped the final place in the CONCACAF zone. But for all its silky skills and intricate passing, coach Marcelo Bielsa was left frustrated on the sidelines as Chile could not translate its possession into goals as Honduras -- playing at soccer's showpiece event for the first time since 1982 -- defended stubbornly. The breakthrough came in the 34th minute when Jean Beausejour bundled the ball into the net after a low right-wing cross by Mauricio Isla. The forward claimed just his second international goal in 28 appearances, though television replays suggested the ball went in illegally off his arm after deflecting off a sliding Honduras defender. The Central Americans had another slice of poor luck in the first minute after halftime when Gary Medel was brought down by Edgard Alvarez on the edge of the penalty area -- but the referee ruled it was not a foul despite the Hondurans' appeals for a spot-kick. Chile playmaker Alexis Sanchez should have made it 2-0 just after an hour, but screwed his shot wide after a superb burst through the defense had put him clear on goal. Waldo Ponce then inexplicably stooped to head the ball straight at Honduras goalkeeper Noel Valladreas from close range when it seemed easier to score, having been set up by a well-worked free-kick. Chile had the ball in the net again with 15 minutes to play, but Jorge Valdivia was ruled offside after teammate Sanchez clearly used his hand to set him up -- for which he should have been booked by referee Eddy Maillet of the Seychelles. On Tuesday, Honduras became the first nation to select three brothers in a World Cup squad, with striker Jerry Palacios called up to replace the injured Julio Cesar de Leon.

"Washington (CNN) -- Dr. Phil McGraw, better known simply as Dr. Phil, brought his fiery brand of advocacy to Capitol Hill Thursday on the topic of student cyber-security, and specifically online bullying. As part of a panel at a House Healthy Families and Communities Subcommittee hearing, McGraw compared the World Wide Web to the Wild, Wild West of older times. ""The gunslingers are keyboard bullies. They are these people that with anonymity attack other students in a way that can completely destroy their reputations,"" he said. McGraw described it as a pervasive problem. ""With MySpace and Facebook, email, chat rooms, there are so many of these things with so much power that they constitute weapons of mass destruction when it comes to communications with these kids,"" he said. A recent Pew study found that 73 percent of American teenagers who are online use social networking sites. McGraw said he has received tens of thousands of letters from kids asking for help with bullying. The subcommittee was looking at the topic of cyber-bullying as they are considering the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, more commonly known as the No Child Left Behind Act.","Dr. Phil participates in panel at Capitol Hill .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- The hosting of the 2010 World Cup by South Africa was always going to be an occasion for celebration among football lovers around the world, but for former soccer greats who call the continent home, the event has a significance beyond mere fandom. Having moved from a period where only four African sides qualified for the World Cup in 44 years since the first event in 1930, the continent now boasts some of the greatest stars in global soccer. Superstars like Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast), Michael Essien (Ghana) and Samuel Eto'o (Cameroon) may have global fame and great riches thanks to their talent, but for every modern legend from Africa there are just as many pioneers who helped break down the barriers to allow such opportunity. Former players such as Kalusha Bwalya (Zambia), Abedi Pele (Ghana) and Salif Keita (Mali) may not be household names that roll off the tongue, but they all played a crucial role in breaking down the prejudice that existed, and hampered, the abilities of players from Africa. One such pioneer was Nigerian great Jay-Jay Okocha -- a skilful attacker who help guide the Super Eagles to Olympic gold glory in 1996 -- told CNN he believes that the World Cup proves African football has finally come of age. ""I think we have contributed a lot to world football and we are glad that FIFA have finally recognized and believe that we belong,"" said the 36-year-old, who played in the top leagues in Germany, France, England and Turkey before retiring in 2008. ""It's not just a game for us, it's like a religion, it's like a tradition. We bring a lot of colors, we bring a lot of emotion and we bring a lot of enthusiasm to the game."" 2010 World Cup: A catalyst for a new South Africa? Another great who did much to break down the barriers holding back footballers from Africa was Jomo Sono. The South African former striker played during the apartheid era and significantly was one of the first black players to take part in the previously illegal activity of cross-color matches in the 1970s. Sono was South Africa's youngest-ever professional and easily one of the country's greatest football talents. But despite playing for the Orlando Pirates and the New York Cosmos alongside Franz Beckenbauer and Pele, he was unable to play in world competition due to the international ban that existed on the racist South African government. For Sono, hosting the World Cup is bitter sweet: ""It's difficult to describe, it's difficult being an ex-player who never got to play. I feel like I could turn the clock back and play now. But everything happens for a reason,"" he told CNN. Sono controversially sacrificed a lucrative career in America to return to apartheid South Africa in an attempt to help the country to change. ""They needed role models, they needed people who made it in spite of the regime, so (they) knew they could do it too. Was it a sacrifice? Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison. That's sacrifice. Me, I played football,"" Sono said in an interview for Ian Hawkey's ""Feet of the Chameleon"" book. No African side has ever progressed past the quarterfinals of the World Cup, so many hopes rests on hosts ""Bafana Bafana"" to perform well. As a former technical director for the side Sono had some words of advise for his former students: ""I know how the players are feeling. I'll be speaking to them the day before the games. They will call me at night and I'll say go out there and enjoy yourselves and don't put pressure on yourselves,"" he told CNN. Amos Adamu, a member of the executive committees of football's world governing body FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF), said whatever the progress of South Africa, new standards are being set. ""African football has reached the stage where it's compared favorably with football in any part if the world,"" he told CNN. ""If you look at African players, they are all around the world and they are very outstanding players. I'm very proud that African football has got to that level."" Adamu also attacked critics who have said that the cost of South Africa hosting the World Cup is too high, and instead claimed the tournament will leave a lasting legacy for the country. ""People complain that it's a waste of money, but it's important that the organizers and the countries know that the benefits are very enormous,"" he said. ""No country hosts the World Cup and remains the same. Hosting these games brings a lot of financial social and economic benefits to the nation.""","Legends of African football gathered at a pre-World Cup gala dinner in Johannesburg .

"(CNN) -- He didn't look like much when I first saw him strolling up to me at a campsite in Harriman State Park, New York, exactly two years ago. His hair was stringy and unkempt, his thin face unshaven. A smudged shirt and dirt-covered pants hung from his wiry, 50-year-old frame. I was leaving the communal bathroom, having just plugged my drained cell phone into the outlet by the sink, when I saw him. He nodded warmly as we passed and I found myself suddenly wondering if I had just seen the last of my phone... When he saw me again, he said with incredible glee, ""Isn't this the most beautiful morning?"" I nodded and then went back into the bathroom to find my cell phone right where I left it. Needless to say, I felt more than a little guilty about being so judgmental. And that's how I met Ralph Benitez, the man who would eventually become the heart of my fatherhood documentary, ""The Evolution of Dad."" A short time later, I was washing some silverware at the campground sink when Ralph appeared with his own dishes. As we scrubbed, he told me how his sons had brought him camping trip and how lucky he felt to be with them. ""You know, fatherhood saved my life. It did. I wouldn't be alive now if I hadn't become a dad,"" he confessed, explaining that before his three sons and one daughter were born, his life had been all about ""sex, drugs and rock-'n-roll."" As we finished the dishes, Ralph talked about his kids. He said one of his sons was gay and how, despite his cultural background, he accepted his son unconditionally. He told me about his 4-year-old granddaughter, for whom he was now a surrogate dad. I was startled and a little chastened. Here was this guy, who, minutes earlier, I had worried would steal my phone, and who I now realized completely personified everything that was noble about fatherhood. He lived in the Bronx with his family, didn't have a computer and sometimes he didn't even have phone service. There was a great divide between this man from an inner city Latino community and me, a white Jewish guy from the affluent suburbs. But the differences in our backgrounds dissolved as we quickly forged a friendship. I visited Ralph and his family several times that summer, filming as much as I could of this dad who spoke for so many fathers. Witnessing Ralph with his granddaughter, Kayla, as he lovingly took her to the park or for a stroll to the corner deli, was inspiring. Kayla's biological father wasn't in the picture and Ralph had dutifully stepped into the role. And then there were the kids in the neighborhood who all looked up to him, many lacking dads of their own. Ralph called his two-bedroom apartment ""the safe house"" because, in this particularly tough area of the Bronx, it was a place that friends and family and neighborhood kids could come and always feel secure. For Ralph, the world was a horn of plenty. ""You see?"" he would often say to his wife, ""If you have faith, God will provide."" His wife Vilma, always the anchor to his exuberance, would roll her eyes with a ""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" and although they occasionally squabbled, the love they shared with each other and everyone else in this safe haven was always tangible. If wealth could be only measured in love, then Bill Gates would've had nothing on Ralph. Sadly, there was a sense of urgency to film Ralph as quickly as possible because his health was rapidly deteriorating -- Ralph had full-blown AIDS. Miraculously, he had managed to survive for more than 10 years with the virus because he had volunteered himself as a test subject for any of the experimental drugs that Sloan Kettering was trying. He was even among the first to take ""the cocktail."" As we sat together in his driveway one day, he told me that the doctors had recently told him that his medicine was becoming increasingly less effective and there was nothing more to do. Still, we continued to spend time together and Ralph remained upbeat and hopeful. One of my best memories of Ralph occurred while taking a break from shooting, sitting with him in his driveway. In the heat radiating from the pavement, we ate plantains that Vilma had graciously cooked for us and talked about what was going on in the world, about our families, about anything. It was like we had known each other our whole lives. As the summer slid away, so did Ralph's health. His family became less interested in being filmed, and Ralph explained that they were having a hard time coping with the fact that he wouldn't be around much longer. Ralph Benitez passed away one snowy day in December 2008. Even though his passing wasn't a shock, it took a while for me to get over it. I'd never had a film subject die before, let alone a friend. Ralph agreed to be in the film because he wanted to be remembered and because of how important he understood fatherhood to be in the lives of our kids. I wish he could've seen the finished film. But even though he didn't, I think he felt lucky to know that a part of him would live on in this way. For me, I just felt incredibly blessed to have met such an astonishingly wonderful man and a remarkable dad.","Filmmaker Dana Glazer feared Ralph Benitez would steal his phone when they first met .

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- It may surprise the casual visitor at Arlington National Cemetery to see a rubber duck on a headstone or an old football helmet lying in the manicured grass of a fallen soldier's grave. After all, America's most hallowed ground is the final resting place for war heroes, astronauts, even a U.S. president. But it happens all the time, especially in Section 60, where many of those killed in the current wars are buried. Leaving a flower arrangement is still common. And many graves have tiny American flags placed on them. But this new generation of warriors are frequently remembered with mementos like cans of beer, teddy bears and even tiny bottles of hot sauce. The message in the mementos is unknown but likely very personal. ""I have seen everything from report cards to an Alabama football ticket stub,"" said Roderick Gainer, a curator with the Center of Military History. ""Obviously, these deceased service person was a Crimson Tide fan. Letters, hotel keys. I've seen jewelry, lots of things."" Gainer is part of a new effort by the Army to make sure these items don't end up in the trash. For the first time the Army, which runs Arlington National Cemetery, is collecting many of the items left on the graves, cataloging them according to what grave they were left on and storing them for posterity. Before this effort began late last summer, most of the items were thrown away. Some cemetery employees tried to gather some special mementos, but no record was kept about what graves those items came from. Now, curators from the Center of Military History are making sure a thorough record is kept. ""We are going by, grave to grave, on a weekly basis recovering items that have been left and then we basically put these items into a database and photograph the grave,"" Gainer said. Read about the demanding work of Arlington's burial crews . Then the mementos are put into plastic bags with a note card with the date of collection, the fallen service member's name and the grave number. Not everything is saved. Perishable items like food or flowers are left on the grave. But if a note is attached, it's collected and saved. A plain pebble on top of a headstone will be left alone, but if someone has written or painted something personal on the stone, it will be saved. They even save some of the empty beer and liquor bottles that often turn up next to the headstones. And on some graves, like that of Pfc. Kenneth Zeigler, nothing is disturbed. Zeigler's mother asked the Army not to collect anything off his grave and the curators gladly respect her wishes. There was a case where some items were collected from a grave, but the family didn't want the items moved, so the center returned the materials to the family. The curators also pay attention to when the materials are left. If they are birthday cards and a birthday is approaching, they will usually leave them. But if the birthday has passed, they will collect them. While Gainer does this job every week, some things still get to him. Like a poem left on Cmdr. Phil Murphy-Sweet's grave that reads: . ""In Arlington, a small white stone there, . a small white stone, three little pebbles, . an inscription, and a patch of green grass. That's where he'll stay. He should be home laughing with kids or still serving his country. But instead, he stays there."" The poem is signed ""Jeanne and Lelila Musgates."" But it's unclear why it was left on Murphy-Sweet's grave. Were they relatives, friends or just patriotic Americans who wanted to remember a fallen soldier? Once the poem and all other mementos have been collected, catalogued and saved, the Army secretary will decide what will be done with them. They may become part of a museum exhibit. Or maybe, someday, a historian will go through them to teach about the two wars.","Most fallen soldiers of current wars are buried in Section 60 .

"(CNN) -- There is good reason to hope that Israel has been paying attention to Central America in the past year. In the event that it has not, it might fall on the U.S. to give Israel a crash course. Israel is not the only small, open country whose recent actions have alienated much of the world. Last June, the Honduran military expelled Honduran President Manuel Zelaya at gunpoint, unleashing a tragic series of events including human rights abuses, economic contraction and international isolation. Late last month, Israeli commandos killed nine activists seeking to breach the Gaza maritime blockade with a humanitarian aid shipment, and the international community reacted with horror. After both events, officials in power in Israel and Honduras resorted to similar narratives: The world misunderstood them and underestimated the threats they faced. These government accounts expanded the distance between each country and the world, demonstrating that real change will not come while the leaders promoting these narratives remain in power. In Honduras, the coup prompted an unprecedented international rejection; in Israel, international reproach has mounted over time, with the flotilla attack providing the most recent justification for anti-Israel rhetoric. In both countries, the sitting governments explained that the world did not fully grasp the perilous, external threat they face -- in Honduras, chavismo (the left-wing ideology associated with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's government); in Israel, the existential threat of Hamas and Iran. Both countries, despite increasing international criticism, remain heavily dependent on U.S. recognition and support. Rejection from other countries hurts, but they can withstand it so long as they have backing from the United States. After last year's coup, the Honduran political establishment closed ranks, widely supporting Zelaya's illegal expulsion as a defense of the rule of law and the defeat of chavismo. Then-de facto President Roberto Micheletti bristled at the international community's condemnation, at one point declaring the secretary general of the Organization of American States unwelcome in Honduras as anything but a tourist and feeding pro-Micheletti demonstrators anti-OAS chants. To rally his supporters, Micheletti consistently painted Honduras as the victim and refused to cede ground. The first signs of a similar reaction after the flotilla raid appeared quickly in Israeli political discourse. The Israeli government's media office circulated a spoof video of flotilla activists singing ""We Con the World,"" for which they later apologized. Now, Israel has rejected calls for an international inquiry into the raid, instead unilaterally appointing a panel that could focus attention on the activists' bellicosity rather than Israeli soldiers' use of lethal force. But the actions of Benjamin Netanyahu's government can hardly be described as gaffes or mere blindness to world opinion. Rather, they reflect a deliberate effort to drum up domestic support. Such propaganda plays to the Israeli suspicion that the entire world is, more or less secretly, anti-Semitic, making it impossible for the Jewish state to receive a fair hearing. By playing to these primal fears, rooted at the core of Zionist historical consciousness, Netanyahu is able to rally much of the nation behind him, while making himself virtually impervious to domestic criticism. Micheletti has not paid the price for his misdeeds, and neither will Netanyahu, but Honduras has and Israel will. While Micheletti received amnesty and a lifetime congressional salary, even a new election and the creation of a truth commission has not enabled Micheletti's successor, Porfirio Lobo, to re-establish ties with most of Latin America. As Lobo's recent exclusion from international summits in Madrid and Lima illustrates, Honduras continues to suffer the economic and political effects of isolation. Similarly, in Israel, the flotilla incident may have heralded the demise of Israel's only healthy relationship in the Middle East. Reacting only hours after the incident, Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that Israel's actions were ""totally contrary to the principles of international law,"" branding them as ""state terrorism."" Ankara also immediately rejected Israel's commission, threatening to review its Israel policy if Israel does not accept an international investigation. Like Micheletti, Netanyahu can likely withstand the current crisis by turning his back on the storm of international criticism and celebrating Israel's avowed defense of its sovereignty against Islamist extremists. Netanyahu knows that Israel's backers in the U.S. are much stronger than those of a country like Honduras, where Obama's administration could be more assertive without provoking as much domestic backlash. Right before a midterm U.S. election, Netanyahu is banking on the Obama administration not reacting strongly against Israel. In fact, the United States predictably shielded Israel from harsher United Nations Security Council condemnation and has expressed preliminary support for Israel's internal inquiry. The United States ultimately played a similarly unhelpful role in Honduras, removing pressure at a critical moment for Zelaya's reinstatement as a condition for recognizing the November elections. This act paved the way for the Honduran Congress's landslide rejection of Zelaya's restitution. Much as last year's crisis in Honduras could not end with Micheletti in the presidential palace, it is hard to imagine peace coming to Israel with Netanyahu in power. But the more important lesson for Israel that Netanyahu should learn from the Honduran crisis may be that unjustified state violence, and government defenses of these actions, prevents even a renewal in leadership from compensating for these errors. In short, Israel will pay a longer-term price for its government's deplorable reaction to the flotilla attack. But, even if Netanyahu fails to take note of the lessons issuing from Central America, President Obama should not. The United States should change its tack, reject Israel's recent actions and remind it that a special relationship with the U.S. is not carte blanche for human rights violations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Altschuler and Fredrik Meiton.","Daniel Altschuler, Fredrik Meiton see similarities in Honduran coup, Israeli flotilla attack .
After each, they say, both governments said world didn't appreciate threats they faced .
Such defenses expanded distance between each country and the world, pair says .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Visitors to a popular tourist destination in Rome should soon get their first look at a once-formidable world that has been hidden from public view for nearly 2,000 years. For the first time, the Colosseum plans to let visitors explore an underground corridor that has previously been off limits. It's a place where gladiators once prepared for battle and lions and tigers were caged before entertaining a bloodthirsty public, architect Barbara Nazzaro of the office of the Rome Archaeology Superintendent told CNN. The Colosseum plans to open the underground section in August. In the underground maze of tunnels, the Romans kept ""every type of exotic animal that they were able to bring here,"" including rhinos and snakes, Nazzaro said. Elephants and other animals could walk freely without scraping their head on the ceiling -- with plenty of room to spare. Completed in 80 A.D., the Colosseum once held 50,000 to 60,000 people and reached an impressive 130 feet in height. It was constructed with enough stone to build a 15-story building, though less than half of the structure now remains, said Nazzaro. For more than 400 years, wealthy and poor alike attended ultra-violent spectacles in the Colosseum, including executions which often concluded with fights between Roman warriors. There were four floors, each dedicated to a specific class, according to colosseum.net, a website dedicated to amphitheaters and coliseums around the world. The upper floors were for the lower classes and women, while the lowest was for the most prominent citizens, sitting just above the underground passageways. The more gore and blood, the happier and more involved people became, Nazzaro said. ""It is difficult to understand nowadays."" Listed as one of the seven wonders of the world, the Colosseum requires the equivalent of more than $860,000 a year (700,000 euros) to maintain, according to the archaeology superintendent's office. Opening the underground corridor for the public will coincide with an extensive restoration of the Colosseum, the office said. It will cost an estimated $2.5 million (2 million euros) to open the new attraction to tourists. Yet restoration plans don't stop there. Efforts to find sponsors to help fully restore the entire Colosseum, including more of the underground section, are underway. That could cost the equivalent of another $40 million (32 million euros), officials said. The Colosseum attracts an estimated 4 million tourists a year and generates roughly $38 million (about 30.5 million euros) in revenue from such things as ticket sales and souvenirs, according to the archaeology superintendent's office.","Colosseum plans to open underground corridor in August .

"Washington (CNN) -- Education Secretary Arne Duncan has spent the past couple days backpedaling from comments he made Sunday suggesting that Hurricane Katrina was good for New Orleans' failing schools. But, while he's apologizing for poor word choice, his comments echo a truth spoken by many in New Orleans. ""It was a dumb thing to say, and I apologize,"" Duncan said Tuesday. In a Sunday broadcast of TV One's ""Washington Watch with Roland Martin,"" Duncan was asked about the progress New Orleans schools have made since Katrina hit in 2005. He replied: ""This is a tough thing to say, but let me be really honest. I think the best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans was Hurricane Katrina. That education system was a disaster, and it took Hurricane Katrina to wake up the community to say that 'We have to do better.' "" Excerpts of the interview were released by the show Friday. Shortly afterward, numerous networks and newspapers picked them up, sparking the controversy that continued once the remarks were broadcast. Friday evening, Duncan called New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to explain what he meant, his office said. Duncan said Tuesday that he regrets what he said but insisted that the storm motivated the city to reinvest in its children like never before. ""I said it poorly. And my point was very simple. Hurricane Katrina was a devastating, devastating tragedy. The progress we've seen subsequent to that has been absolutely remarkable. The teachers, the principals there are working so incredibly hard,"" Duncan said. ""Almost all the students missed three months, four months, six months. I talked to students who missed more than a year off school, and yet they came back. And in a short amount of time, four years, they came back, subsequent to the devastating tragedy. Amazing progress. And I just tip my hat to the hard work there. I was simply trying to point out how impressed I am, the remarkable commitment and the sense of urgency."" Several Louisiana officials defended Duncan's remarks. The state's superintendent of education, Paul Pastorek, said, ""I know it's a strong statement, but it's actually quite accurate. It was a pathetic system before the storm."" Paul Vallas, superintendent of the Louisiana Recovery School District -- a special program administered by the state with the aim of boosting underperforming schools -- noted that ""local people have said that time and time again."" Duncan said in the TV One interview that New Orleans in the past ""was not serious about its education"" but called the school system's reform since Katrina ""unbelievable."" Duncan has made several trips to New Orleans since becoming education secretary one year ago. His most recent was October 15. Regarding that city, Duncan said, ""What this is about was this huge sense of urgency. And folks understood you had to literally build from the ground up. ... I just want to do whatever I can to continue to support the remarkable, remarkable progress."" Education is a priority in the Obama administration, as evidenced by the president's proposed 2011 budget, released Monday, which would increase federal education spending by 7.5 percent, or $4 billion. Duncan is using federal dollars to promote reform in state and local school systems. He also is overhauling former President George W. Bush's Elementary and Secondary Education Act, better known as the No Child Left Behind Act. But Tuesday, he said, ""We talk about the growth of No Child Left Behind, and New Orleans is a prime example. Is it where it needs to be? No. Still, clearly, it's a long journey, a long ways to go. But the progress has been amazing.""","Arne Duncan said hurricane was best thing to happen to city's failing schools .

"About 1 in 7, or 13.5 percent of adults who encountered intense dust clouds after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11 were later found to have asthma, compared with just 8.4 percent who had no dust cloud exposure, researchers in Atlanta and New York City reported on Tuesday. Among rescue workers, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. Likewise, among various groups of people connected to the Twin Tower collapse, rescue and recovery workers were more likely to have a diagnosis of asthma (12.2 percent) than passers-by (8.4 percent). The results are from a survey, conducted from November 2006 through December 2007, to assess the health status of more than 46,000 adults five to six years after the disaster. Health.com: Bad air day? Here's how to survive . That such a horrific event left lasting physical and emotional scars is, perhaps, no great surprise. Among adults with no prior diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23.8 percent have reported symptoms after September 11, and the prevalence of symptoms has increased over time, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The mental health effects, which can be debilitating and often chronic, ""seem to be the largest health problem coming out of 9/11"" says Lorna Thorpe, Ph.D., the deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Division of Epidemiology and one of the coauthors of the study. ""But immediately after the 9/11 event, I don't think there was a clear understanding of what the physical impacts would be."" Health.com: Is your child's asthma under control? Take this test . People in the vicinity of the collapse had ""the potential to inhale huge amounts of particulate matter,"" observes Joan Reibman, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the school's Bellevue Asthma Center, who was not involved in the study. ""We think that could act as a real irritant to the airways."" Some 23 million Americans have asthma, a lung condition that causes airway swelling and inflammation. People with asthma may experience repeated bouts of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest. Anthony M. Szema, M.D., an assistant professor of medicine and surgery and the head of the allergy diagnostic unit at SUNY Stony Brook School of Medicine, has studied the effects of the World Trade Center collapse on children living in Manhattan's Chinatown. His team's most recent study, accepted for publication in Allergy & Asthma Proceedings, will show that the rate of asthma at the closest elementary school to the World Trade Center (29 percent) is high compared with the rate of asthma in children in the general population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 9.3 percent of U.S. children have asthma. ""[The new study] is entirely congruous with our findings,"" he says. Health.com: As a new mom, I struggled with my daughter's chronic cough . The CDC's Robert M. Brackbill, Ph.D., M.P.H., led the team of New York City and Columbia University researchers whose study examined the longer-term health impact of exposure to Ground Zero and its varying effect across groups of people. The analysis is based on data from the World Trade Center Health Registry, described as the largest post-disaster-exposure registry in U.S. history. More than 71,000 rescue and recovery workers, lower Manhattan office workers, nearby residents, and passers-by enrolled in the registry. Participants were interviewed from September 2003 through November 2004 to record their exposure to the disaster and document their pre- and post-event health status, and again in 2006-2007. Health.com: Diabetes plus stress can equal high blood sugar . For each group followed, intense exposure to the dust plume was associated with new asthma diagnoses. Among rescue and recovery workers, for example, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11. The risk diminished with later start dates. However, even downtown office workers and lower Manhattan residents were affected. Among these people, the risk of asthma was highest if there was a heavy coating of dust in their home or office, compared with no such damage. ""It shows that people who had heavy dust exposure in the initial period, that this was a risk to developing asthma but not the only risk,"" says Reibman, who also serves as the director of New York City's World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, one of three centers dedicated to treating September 11-related conditions. Reibman says the new study is important because, in addition to corroborating previous studies, it should help people with September 11-related asthma realize that their symptoms are real.

"Washington (CNN) -- Having trouble pronouncing an Italian word? If you sit on the Supreme Court, consult an expert. On Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor was announcing the court's opinion in Krupski v. Costa Crociere SpA (09-337), a lesser-known appeal dealing with the scope of the right to file an amended lawsuit to correct a mistake in a party's identity. The newest justice was having trouble pronouncing the name of the cruise ship company at the center of the case. Costa Cruises is a British and American-owned firm based in Genoa, Italy, where it is registered as Costa Crociere SpA. The appeal involved passenger Wanda Krupksi, who tripped over a cable and fractured her leg in 2007 aboard the Costa Magica. At issue was whether Krupski should have sued Costa Cruises or Costa Crociere SpA in federal court. The justice writing the majority ruling typically announces the decision from the bench in a public session, with a brief oral summary that supplements the official written opinion. That's where the fun began. Sotomayor needed help and knew exactly where to turn. ""Costa Cruises responded that she should have sued a related company called Costa ... I'm going to ask my colleague Justice Scalia to say it right,"" Sotomayor said. ""Kroo-chee-ER-ay,"" said Scalia, who is of Sicilian descent and has written a book on how lawyers can shine verbally when presenting their appeals before judges. ""Kroo-chee-ER-ay,"" the first Hispanic justice slowly but correctly repeated. ""I want to put the Spanish accent on it."" Sotomayor has privately told friends that she was pleasantly surprised when joining the court at how friendly and collegial her benchmates have been, welcoming her to their exclusive club. Scalia is among the most verbally adept justices, peppering his bench remarks with humor and well-reasoned legal conclusions. His father was a professor of Romance languages in Queens, New York. Sotomayor, meanwhile, was honored over the weekend in the Bronx, where she grew up. She visited her grade school and then attended a ceremony at the Bronxdale Houses public housing project. It has now been renamed the Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Community Center. She was visibly moved when talking about growing up there and meeting the late Robert F. Kennedy, who had come there in 1958 to tour the projects. The justice, who turns 56 this month, also gave the commencement address at Hostos Community College, where her mother graduated with a nursing degree in 1974. It has primarily served the Spanish-speaking community in New York. By the way, in the Crociere case, the high court ruled unanimously for Krupski. ""Costa Crociere should have known that Krupski's failure to name it as a defendant in her original complaint was due to a mistake concerning the proper party's identity,"" Sotomayor said, with admirable pronunciation.","Newest high court justice gives oral summary of cruise ship case .

"Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington (CNN) -- For the Hoh, life centers on the silver waters just off their reservation. Throughout the tiny Native American tribe's history they have lived and fished on the westernmost point of Washington state where the river that shares their name meets the Pacific Ocean. According to the tribe's legends, the Hoh were created on the river by K'wati or the ""Changer"" in what the tribe refers to as the ""Time of the Beginnings."" In Hoh lore the tribe were ""upside down people,"" who walked on their hands and struggled to throw fishing nets with their feet. K'wati, the legend goes, righted them and taught the tribe to live from fishing the river and ocean. Those same waters now threaten the tribe's future. For tribe member and treasurer Amy Benally, the danger can be seen on the doorstep of her family's home that has stood at the mouth of the river for nearly a century. Benally grew up there with 12 members of her family. Now the home is a gutted wreck from repeated flooding. At first the waters took out the garage and the small building Benally's grandfather used to smoke fish. Then the family had to flee upstairs. ""We'd see the waves and the logs coming,"" Benally said standing in the musty ruin of the home. ""We'd stand out here on the porch, and my grandfather would get mad at us and tell us to come back into the house. It was pretty scary."" Although the lowlands where her family lived were always prone to flooding, Benally said the water rises more often now. ""It never used to be this bad,"" she said. ""The river's changed."" Ernest Penn, the tribe's fish and wildlife officer, is a constant presence on the river and sees the difference too. Cruising up the river in his boat, Penn showed where heavy rains caused a landslide, where erosion changed the river's bank and where, pointing to a stretch of water, a ""big pasture used to be."" The flooding is no small problem for a tribe of just under 300 people who occupy a reservation only one square mile in size. Several homes have been abandoned, other homes and the tribe's community center wear permanent necklaces of sandbags to keep away floodwaters. There is little room for new buildings and even where there is it's unlikely they could be put up -- more than 90 percent of the reservation is in the flood plain, according to tribal leadership. There are no clear culprits for the tribe's woes. According to Spencer Reeder, the Washington Department of Ecology's lead strategist for climate change policy, the increased flooding could be due to a combination of factors including global warming, logging upriver and cyclical weather patterns that have brought heavy rains. According to a department study, the coast where the Hoh live could see an additional rise from climate change in sea levels of as much as 3 feet over the next century. Already, when the reservation floods, the water comes up with terrifying speed. Baseball games have been interrupted, said Penn. ""We'll be waist deep on the ball field."" Last year, Penn decided to move away from the reservation. ""I got two little kids, what if the river came up around them?"" To rescue the tribe's future the Hoh leadership decided to move most of the reservation to higher ground and purchased new land for the expansion. Before they begin building homes though, the Hoh are waiting for Congress to pass a bill that places 37 acres of national park land in a trust for the tribe. The tribe would not be able to develop that land, but the grant would mean that tribe members will continue to live on one piece of land and help the Hoh obtain funding for new housing. According to a spokesman for Rep. Norm Dicks, the Washington state Democrat who sponsored the bill, Congress is expected to vote on the measure by the end of the year. For Tribal Chairperson Maria Lopez, the move away from the water won't come soon enough. ""We are ready to move, we are ready grow,"" Lopez said looking out at the coastline where a major fault line sits. Tribal lore talks of an earthquake and giant wave that devastated the Pacific Northwest coastline 400 years ago. ""What would happen,"" Lopez asked, ""if a tsunami comes while we are here?""","Hoh tribe of Washington state weary of constant flooding .

"LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN) -- Heads of South American nations lent support Monday night to President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who says opposition leaders are trying to overthrow his government. Indigenous people from El Alto, Bolivia, take part in an anti-U.S. demonstration in La Paz on Monday. Confronting their first crisis, members of the four-month-old Union of South American Countries voted to create a commission to support Morales' democratically elected government, said President Michelle Bachelet of Chile. She read a nine-point statement on Chilean TV that calls for the support of human rights and democracy and the preservation of Bolivia's territorial integrity. The statement condemns any attempts to overthrow the government. It also said the new commission would investigate a reported massacre in the Bolivian state of Pando, where violent clashes killed 30 people last week. Those clashes pitted supporters of eastern governors who want autonomy against the central government. The South American leaders also urged dialogue to address disputes in Bolivia. Morales attended the emergency meeting of the union, which is modeled on the European Union and aims to politically and economically integrate South American countries. The president is poised to approve the start of negotiations between his leftist government and opposition leaders of five provinces who demand greater autonomy and the cancellation of a constitutional referendum that would give the president more power. The opposition also is angry over tax money that Morales is diverting from the provinces to fund elderly programs. Morales said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government. ""This is a coup in the past few days by the leaders of some provinces, with the takeover of some institutions, the sacking and robbery of some government institutions and attempts to assault the national police and the armed forces,"" Morales said. Opposition leaders say they merely want their demands met. Police kept order Monday during a march by about 2,000 pro-government groups opposed to the violence in the provinces. The demonstrators marched past the U.S. Embassy in La Paz. Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia last week, blaming the American government for inciting the violence. The United States called the accusations ""false and baseless"" and said Bolivia was making a ""grave mistake."" Most of South America's leaders attended Monday's emergency summit, with the exception of President Alan Garcia of Peru. Protest leaders asked to attend the summit in Santiago, Chile, but it was limited to heads of state. The protests started 21 days ago in Pando, Beni, Santa Cruz, Tarija and Chuquisaca provinces. The opposition groups have blockaded major roads and threaten to disrupt the nation's natural gas shipments, particularly to Brazil and Argentina. Anti-government protesters also have clashed with police and taken over offices and buildings in the five provinces.  Watch some of the violent demonstrations across Bolivia » . Much of the violence has taken place in Pando -- Morales declared martial law there Friday. On Monday, supporters of Morales, or his so-called militias, were gathering in Santa Cruz, and threatening to encircle the city, stoking fears that blood could be shed there. In Pando, it was reported that arbitrary arrests were taking place as the military took to the streets. Houses had been broken into and shot up, and civic leaders were fleeing to Brazil. It was uncertain, meanwhile, whether the Bolivian military remained solely behind Morales. Some signs of divisions had been seen within the military. Opposition leaders say they will not negotiate if there are any more deaths. Vice President Alvaro Garcia said the government will not negotiate about the dead citizens but will rigorously pursue those responsible for the killings. There are conflicting reports over who killed the 30 peasants. Opposition leaders say the peasants were ambushed by local forces. The government says the peasants were armed and initiated the firefight. The opposition has offered to lift the blockades as a goodwill gesture, but the government demanded that the protesters also relinquish the buildings and other property they have seized. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, was elected in December 2005.

"(CNN) -- Matthew Sanchez had rarely seen his father cry. But when Rudjard Hayes looked at the X-rays of his son's spine after a high school football accident, he held his wife close and broke down, not knowing that his son could see him. Matthew Sanchez, now 20, relearned how to walk at Shepherd Center using the parallel bars. Hayes was used to watching Sanchez get knocked to the ground during games and then get back up, but that game in 2004 was different: After getting knocked down, Sanchez, then 15, could not move. ""I knew it was serious, but it didn't really sink in until I saw the X-rays for myself,"" said Hayes, who lived with his family in Sharpsburg, Georgia, at the time. Sanchez's C5 vertebra (in his neck) was fractured. ""I knew the chances of him recovering were basically zero. But I hoped and prayed 24-7,"" Hayes said. ""We are a very faith-based family and believe that you trust the people that are there for you, and things are going to be OK. God will see you through it."" Doctors at Shepherd Center in Atlanta, Georgia, operated on Sanchez's neck, putting in a plate, screws, cables and a piece of bone from his leg. According to Dr. Donald Peck Leslie, medical director of Shepherd Center, less than 1 percent of people with this type of spinal cord injury regain full physical abilities. But Matthew Sanchez was destined and determined to be in that elite group. Days later -- and much sooner than anyone thought possible -- Sanchez started regaining some movement.  Watch part one of Matthew Sanchez's odyssey » . Moving on . Five weeks later, after intensive therapy, Sanchez walked out of Shepherd Center. After six more months of therapy, his sense of normalcy returned. Two years later, he could be a competitive athlete again. ""I just think some people are a little bit more motivated. Matt was an athlete, so he knew how to work hard,"" Cathi Dugger, Sanchez's physical therapist, told Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. Today, five years after his injury, Sanchez has seven triathlons under his belt. Twist of fate . Sanchez's extraordinary recovery was made possible by an unlikely stranger. When the teen was knocked to the ground, the doctor for the opposing team, Dr. John Henderson, rushed to his aid. Knee-deep in mud, Henderson held Sanchez's head in traction for 45 minutes, preventing anyone from moving him. Henderson also insisted Sanchez be transported by helicopter instead of ambulance. Sanchez's mother credits Henderson, in part, for the favorable outcome. ""Our family believes that Dr. Henderson was our angel that night. Our high school did not have a team physician, and I feel certain Matthew could have been moved had Dr. Henderson not prevented anyone from touching him until he could be properly transferred,"" Lorraine Sanchez Hayes said in an e-mail to CNN. Had he been moved, his mother believes, his injury would have been made worse.  Watch part two of Matthew Sanchez's odyssey » . One year after the accident, the family learned that Henderson's son, Army Ranger John Henderson Jr., had been killed in Afghanistan. ""This man had been instrumental in saving our son's life, only to have his own [son's life] taken,"" Sanchez Hayes wrote. Giving back . While most college students spend their summers relaxing, taking extra classes or working to earn money, Sanchez, now 20, chose to spend the past 2½ months giving back to the doctors who put him back together in the best way he knew how: a 4,350-mile fundraising bike ride.  See photos from the bike ride » . In part to memorialize Henderson's son, and in part to raise money for Shepherd Center, Sanchez and three friends -- Anthony Orig, Marina Fleming and Jonny Cromwell -- set out in May on a cross-country expedition to benefit the SHARE initiative, as the We Ride For Shepherd team. Shepherd Center is home to SHARE -- a partnership between the military health care benefits program, philanthropist Bernie Marcus and private donations. Through SHARE, veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and chronic pain can get specialized, cutting-edge treatment at Shepherd Center, and receive housing assistance for themselves and their families. ""Our goal is to educate the VA about what we have available,"" said Dr. Darryl Kaelin, the Shepherd Center physician who oversees the SHARE initiative. He said that many of the smaller Veterans Affairs hospitals might not be aware of the resources available at Shepherd Center. Kaelin said one of Shepherd Center's main focuses is to help people move on with their lives after a catastrophic injury and regain their independence. That's what brought U.S. Army Spc. Dillon Cannon to Shepherd Center as a SHARE patient. Cannon had been in Iraq for about a month when he was shot by a sniper in 2006. He admires Sanchez's fundraising effort. ""Why military personnel? Out of the kindness of his [Sanchez's] heart. It shows that people like that go above what they have to do. I mean he could be working -- making money for himself -- but he's trying to help out people like me,"" Cannon said. Moving forward . Hayes said that he is proud of his son for completing the cross-country journey, but he's even prouder that Sanchez wants to give something back. Sanchez said he couldn't think of a better way to show his appreciation. ""These men and women are over there... risking their lives every day, and we feel like they deserve the best treatment possible,"" he said after completing his 78-day bike trek.","Matthew Sanchez fractured his C5 vertebra while playing football .

"(CNN) -- A police officer in Tucson, Arizona, asks that local law enforcement be exempt from enforcing the state's new immigration law in a lawsuit filed in federal court on Thursday. Officer Martin H. Escobar claims in the suit that the law will ""seriously impede law enforcement investigations and facilitate the successful commission of crimes."" He also says there are no ""race-neutral criteria or basis to suspect or identify who is lawfully in the United States,"" including a person's proximity to the Mexican border, linguistic characteristics and capabilities, skin color, clothing worn or the type of vehicle driven. The law, signed by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23, allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency. Brewer and others who support the law have said it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts. ""Racial profiling is illegal,"" Brewer said after signing the bill. ""It is illegal in America, and it's certainly illegal in Arizona."" Read the complaint (PDF) But Escobar's suit says the law ""is the product of racial bias aimed specifically at Hispanics"" and places every Hispanic within the state at risk of losing his or her constitutional rights. Brewer, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard, the city of Tucson and Pima County Attorney Barbara LaWall are named in the suit. Escobar asks that local law enforcement be exempt ""from engaging any immigration stops, questioning, detention, citing or any law enforcement activity reserved to the federal government."" Escobar, 45, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico and immigrated with his parents when he was 5 years old, attorney Richard M. Martinez said. Tucson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Fabian Pacheco declined to comment on the case because city policies prevent employees from discussing pending litigation. But he said Escobar has worked for the department since 1995 and patrols Tucson's south side. Martinez said his client has spent years working to break down barriers between the Police Department and the predominantly Hispanic community. ""All this law does is put the barrier back up. ... It takes away trust and the rapport and relationships,"" he said Thursday. Spokespeople for Brewer and Goddard did not return requests for comment.","Law allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- About a dozen Italian women have posted an open letter to the pope on the internet in which they claim to have had intimate relationships with priests and urge the church to abolish celibacy for Catholic clergy. The letter was posted on an Italian online forum in March but was not picked up in the media until Global Post, an international news website, reported on it this week. ""The priest, like every human being, needs to live with his kindred, to experience feelings, to love and be loved, and also to conform deeply with another, something which he is hardly willing to do for fear of exposing himself to danger,"" the letter says. The group calls celibacy a man-made law that needs revisiting and adapting to the times. ""We wonder if, like all man-made laws, at a certain time, in a certain historic time, it is not the case to discuss it again and change it or even, as we hope, completely abolish it."" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi had no comment on the matter Friday. The letter was endorsed by about a dozen women, only three of whom signed their names. One of them is Stefania Salomone, 42, a single office manager who lives in Rome and said she had a close relationship with a priest for five years. The relationship was not sexual but platonic, Salomone told CNN Friday. The two were in love, she said, but when the priest admitted his love, he ended their relationship. Salomone said she was aware of the limits of the relationship when it began, but it was very painful to be ""cast aside because of a sense of shame"" felt by the priest. She said she knows of about 40 women who were or are in special relationships with priests. Some are lovers, others ""special friends,"" she said. There are many more throughout Italy, Salomone said. Of those 40, about a dozen of them endorsed the idea of the letter, and some even helped her write it, Salomone said. But only three were willing to have their names associated with it, she said. Another one of the signatories to the letter is Antonella Carisio, who Salomone said had a sexual relationship with a Brazilian priest. In another posting on the website on which the letter appears, Carisio talked about her affair with the priest, saying they spent a lot of time together and slept together at her house. The women decided to write the letter after hearing the pope restate the church's position on celibacy in March, she said. ""We decided that it was (time) to make our reality known,"" Salomone told CNN. ""We wanted to tell everybody that we exist and that we are no longer willing to always be silent about it."" The issue of priestly celibacy is not much debated in Italy, she said, but she said that's precisely the problem. A priest is ""just a man like everyone else. This is a good thing. And he should not be deprived of his right to a relationship."" Salomone said she has not heard from the Vatican about the letter and doesn't expect to. ""I don't really care, to be honest. They are so preoccupied with other things at the moment. The important thing is to call attention to this problem."" CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Women post open letter to pope urging abolition of celibacy .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two popular anti-smoking drugs will now carry warnings about the risk of severe mental health problems, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday. ""Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death,"" an FDA official said. The FDA said Chantix and Zyban will carry the warnings to alert consumers to the risks of depression and suicidal thoughts when using the drugs. The drugs also have been reported to cause changes in behavior, hostility and agitation in users, whether users had a history of psychiatric illness or not. In many cases, side effects started shortly after use began and ended when the medication was stopped. The FDA does not know what is causing the changes and said people taking these products should be monitored by their doctor. ""The risk of serious adverse events while taking these products must be weighed against the significant health benefits of quitting smoking,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death in the United States, and we know these products are effective aids in helping people quit."" The agency also is requiring Pfizer Inc., which makes Chantix, and GlaxoSmithKline, maker of Zyban, to conduct a study looking at how often these serious symptoms occur. Pfizer says it updated its label in 2007 to include information of neuropsychiatric symptoms and has revised the label again to reflect Wednesday's warning. ""The labeling update underscores the important role of health care providers in treating smokers attempting to quit and provides specific information about Chantix and instructions that physicians and patients should follow closely,"" said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison, senior vice president of the primary care development group at Pfizer. ""Quitting smoking is one of the best things people can do for their health, but the quitting process is both difficult and complex."" The FDA says that since Chantix was approved in 2006, the agency has had reports of 98 suicides and 188 attempted suicides. Zyban has had reports of 14 suicides and 17 attempts. Zyban contains the same active ingredient as the antidepressant Wellbutrin and already carried a box warning about the increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior. Neither Chantix nor Zyban contains nicotine, and the FDA said some symptoms could be the result of nicotine withdrawal. Still, the agency said, people using these drugs experienced some of these symptoms while they were still smoking. In a review of side effects in patients using the nicotine patch, the agency said it didn't find a clear link between those products and suicidal events.","FDA: Chantix and Zyban will carry warnings about mental health risks .

"(CNN) -- Boeing says it has notified all 767 aircraft operators about cracks found on two American Airlines 767-300 planes, and by mid-July will recommend more frequent maintenance checks. American Airlines found the cracks in large pylons that hold engines onto the wings of two of its 767-300 aircraft, which Boeing currently recommends inspecting every 1,500 takeoff and landing cycles. ""Boeing will recommend decreasing the number of flight cycles between inspections of the pylon mid spar fitting from every 1,500 flight cycles to possibly as low as every 400 flight cycles,"" the company said late Wednesday. About 260 planes constructed in the same manner as the damaged American Airlines aircraft could be affected by the recommendation, Boeing said. American Airlines spokesman Tim Wagner said the problem was first discovered on one of its 767-300s about two weeks ago during a maintenance check targeting other parts of the aircraft. The airline then found cracking on one more 767-300 after inspecting a total of 56 aircraft -- 767-300 and 767-200s -- a process American Airlines completed Monday night. ""We found these issues when it's best to find them, which is early on,"" said Wagner. The airline has sent the first damaged pylon to a metallurgy lab to try to determine why it cracked. ""Until that metallurgy testing is completed no one knows what the cause is,"" said Wagner. The damaged planes were among American's older aircraft, Wagner added. American flies Boeing 767-300s on international routes as well as long-haul domestic routes. The 767-200s fly primarily transcontinental routes. Airlines have previously found similar cracks at the holes where the pylon attaches to the wing, which led Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration five years ago to recommend checks every 1,500 cycles. At that time, when the FAA issued an airworthiness directive it said, ""We are issuing this (directive)  to prevent fatigue cracking in the primary strut structure and reduced structural integrity of the strut, which could result in separation of the strut and engine.""","American Airlines found cracks on two 767-300 aircraft .

"Editor's note: Claudia Wallis, a former Time editor at large, completed a yearlong Spencer Fellowship at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism in which her reporting focused on the treatment and education of children with autism. To see more of her autism project, visit her Web site. P.S. 176X principal Rima Ritholtz and senior Vicki Martinez celebrate graduation. NEW YORK (CNN) -- All parents have hopes and dreams for their children. Parents of kids with serious disabilities are no different. But in their moments of wildest imagination, the parents of Vicki Martinez, Chase Ferguson and Travis Cardona could not have envisioned high school graduation -- certainly not in the dark days when they first learned their children had autism. But last month, in a spacious high school auditorium in the Bronx, New York, Vicki, Chase and Travis marched down the aisle to ""Pomp and Circumstance,"" resplendent in their caps and gowns, along with 15 classmates at P.S. 176X, a New York City public school with 560 students ranging in age from 3 to 21, all of whom have autism. ""When I came here, I couldn't talk. I talked gibberish,"" the now-voluble Vicki recalls. ""I didn't do my class work; I'd go like this,"" and she proceeds to flap her hands -- a common symptom of autism known as stereotypy or, self-stimulation. On graduation day, Vicki beamed from the high school stage as she collected three awards along with a special education diploma, and wowed the hundreds in the audience by singing ""Besame Mucho"" with the school's Latin band. P.S. 176X is the largest school for children with autism in New York City and very likely the largest in the country, if not the world. Because it is so big, explains principal Rima Ritholtz, it can offer an extraordinary range of services: chorus, band, arts, life skills and cooking classes, vocational training at school and in the community, as well as a wide range of academic programs aligned to the wide-ranging abilities and disabilities of the students. The school operates within five school buildings: three elementary schools, a middle school and high school. P.S. 176X students have full-spectrum autism, not milder forms. About 10 percent of the students attend regular classes at those schools, with an aide to help them, but 90 percent are in special classes, with student-teacher ratios as small as 1-to-1 and as large as eight students with two aides and one teacher. Nationally, there is much debate over how best to educate the nation's rapidly growing and diverse population of youngsters with autism, the prevalence of which has increased tenfold over the past 25 years. The quality of services offered by public schools varies enormously from place to place. Some parents relocate to school districts that offer good autism services. Some persuade or even sue their district to pay for private school placement, which can cost $70,000 a year or more.  Video: see Vicki sing and other highlights from the graduation ceremony » . The right to seek private school placement for kids with disabilities was strengthened in June by a Supreme Court ruling in a closely watched case from Oregon. Under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, children with autism and other disabilities are guaranteed the right to a ""a free appropriate public education"" in the ""least restrictive environment."" ""People have preconceived notions about public school; they think private is better,"" says Ritholtz, who's wrapping up her 12th year as principal of P.S. 176X and is, herself, the daughter of a special education principal. But Ritholtz would happily match her program with almost any of the high-priced private schools. ""I say, let me see their chorus,"" she jokes. While the school cannot necessarily serve children who have multiple handicaps in addition to autism, she allows, ""We will walk a mile before we say we can't accommodate a kid."" The school offers a mix of educational approaches. Some classrooms follow a fairly strict applied behavioral analysis methodology, which tends to put a strong emphasis on one-on-one instruction, using rewards and punishments to spur learning and measuring incremental progress. Other classes use a variety of methods. The school will weigh parental preferences along with what they feel will work best for the child. ""Half the battle is winning the trust of the parents,"" says Ritholtz. ""We understand they are up against a very baffling disability."" While the school does a lot of testing and evaluation, the staff never seems to lose sight of larger questions about the quality of life for its students. Says Ritholtz, ""My father told me not everything that is important can be measured, and not everything you can measure is important."" After watching her son Chase graduate, Teresa Ferguson ticked off the many things he learned at P.S. 176X. ""They taught him so many things I never thought would be possible,"" she says. ""He learned how to make friends, joke, socialize. He learned how to sit still in the classroom. He learned how to read, write, sing, play a musical instrument, stand on a stage and say a speech. These are things I never knew would be possible when he was a toddler."" Planning for graduation and the transition out of school begins when a student is 14, seven years before he or she must, by law, leave the public school system. Terri Giampapa, the transition coordinator and job developer, works closely with families to help them find job placements, adult day programs, sports and recreational activities that will suit the graduate. As part of that preparation, students visit work sites, spend time learning vocational skills and get used to being in larger groups. Some learn to travel and navigate public transportation. Surprisingly, it can be harder to place the more capable graduates who seek job opportunities than those who are more severely disabled and directed to adult ""day hab"" programs. ""Employment is extremely challenging,"" says Giampapa, and it's been made even harder by the recession. Only two of this year's 18 graduates -- Vicki and Chase -- appear to be headed for work. They plan to go to ""supported employment"" situations, meaning that they will be closely trained and supervised. Often such jobs are just 20 hours a week, so the school helps families plan ways to flesh out the week. For those who swim, there may be weekly visits to the YMCA or, in the case of one graduate, weekly appointments at a nail salon for a manicure and a dose of salon community. The goal is to construct a full and satisfying life, explains Rosemary Petrovich, a former assistant principal who still works at the school a few day a week: ""Where are the places to go, people to see, things to do?"" The family of 176X graduate Travis Cardona couldn't be more pleased with his post-graduation plans. Travis, who can read and write but doesn't speak and relies on an electronic communicator, is headed for a day hab program called Quality Services for Autistic Citizens. ""They had no space, and then they made space for him,"" says Travis' aunt and guardian, Ivette Ithier. Ithier says she wept with joy watching her nephew graduate. ""It was unbelievable. A big accomplishment.""","P.S. 176X could be world's largest largest school for kids with autism .

"QINGDAO, China (CNN) -- Another round of toasts and exclamations of ""hajiu"" sounded out around me. I took a sip and set down my small glass of Tsingtao beer as my new friends downed theirs and refilled. Our seafood dinner, perched on the single cluttered table of a tiny antique shop, was punctuated regularly by such moments. A worker operates the giant fermentation units at the Qingdao Brewery plant in Qingdao. I joined in happily, although somewhat bemused, at each increasingly beery celebration of our host, the worldly Captain Jau. My company, a gathering from four regions of China, was engaging me in Chinese drinking etiquette, in the city of Qingdao. A few drinks in the People's Republic of China led me to discover European delights and other unexpected finds in this modest city. You'd be forgiven for not knowing where Qingdao (pronounced Chingdao) is. The Chinese city in Shandong province doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as Beijing, Shanghai, or even Xi'an. The 2008 Olympics gave it a place on the map as China's sailing hub; no longer a secret that holiday-making officials could keep for themselves. But my American spell-check doesn't recognize it (which says more about my spell-check), and you can still find pre-Cultural Revolution manhole covers. So what is it about this city that seduces the unassuming traveler? Nestled on the coast of Shandong province, almost exactly halfway between its big sisters, Beijing and Shanghai, Qingdao features as a handy pit-stop on East coast itineraries. It boasts great infrastructure, a charming climate, alfresco eateries, good coffee, sandy beaches, German history, international hotels, a brand new airport and even a famous brewery. Qingdao could pass itself off as a miniature Seattle if it weren't for the fact that pretty much no one outside of the five-star hotels speaks English, and that communism still articulates itself through the tourist beaches, stoically named Number One to Number Six. ""In mainland China, Qingdao's history is uniquely international; in fact, more of the city's cultural identity is wrapped up in its German colonial past than even its prominent role in the emergence of Daoism"" said Eric Blocher, editor of the English-language magazine Red Star. ""The local culture bureau once joked to us that Qingdao is a 'cultural desert', because it doesn't have the dynastic lineage of Nanjing or Xi'an, or opera for that matter,"" Blocher said. ""But that's not what makes a city livable, or even fun -- if your office is in downtown, you're never more than five minutes from a protected beach; there's always excellent seafood close at hand; you can buy China's best beer fresh, for 10 cents a pound, and walk around drinking it out of a plastic bag."" Following this key advice, I visited Qingdao during the International Beer Festival in late August, an event aimed largely at a domestic Chinese market. The West knows beer. China does not. The annual Beer Festival aims to change this. While the bright lights and myriad beers flowed, one thing was obvious: this was for the tourists. True Qingdaonese people are fiercely proud of Tsingtao beer, produced just down the road on Beer Street, and little else is drunk here in homes or bars. Pijiu, beer in Mandarin, is hajiu in Qingdaonese, the regional dialect. When in doubt, this does as well for a toast as anything else. Indeed, there is no better way of celebrating an occasion than by toasting the guest of honor with a bag of fresh beer. If I was the guest of honor at Captain Jau's table, I certainly wasn't living up to expectations. Particularly not for my self-appointed etiquette guardian and ""pure Qingdao boy,"" Loukas. As I raised my glass for a sip and Loukas jumped to toast the good weather for the nth time, it all became clear. In Qingdao, a beer glass is never raised without a toast. This serves three (frankly ingenious) purposes; beer is drunk in unison; beer isn't consumed too rapidly, since constant toasting would ruin conversation; and everyone finds ways to honor each other for the purposes of toasting. Captain Jau was particularly in favor of the latter as our eccentric host was made subject of most cheers, likewise teaching us the salutations he had learned from the many foreign guests he had cooked for. From the French ""salut!"" to the German ""prost!"" to the Turkish ""serefe!"" Most popular of all was homegrown ""hajiu!"" Alcohol is enjoyed throughout China. Microbreweries are yet to catch on here like they have in Japan and Singapore. For now Tsingtao holds the monopoly, and Qingdao's people aren't complaining. The Tsingtao Brewery, founded in 1903 by German settlers, confiscated by the Japanese in 1915, turned over to state ownership in 1949 and finally privatized in the early 1990s, has witnessed a colorful history. The largest stakeholder, Anheuser-Busch, recently sold majority ownership to Japanese Asahi Breweries. Residents are the first to introduce you to their biggest export. Outside every shop is a barrel or two of Tsingtao, with a ream of clean plastic bags ready to be filled with cheap 3.5 percent beer. Tsingtao beer tastes crisp and sweet (most likely from rice mixed in to cut down on the cost of barley. It is bought by the pound and weighed to prevent gaseous volume manipulation. A pint, when sold in this method, costs around 1.5 renminbi, or 22 U.S. cents. Beer is a way of life here and has been ever since the Germans arrived and erected tree-lined avenues, red-roofed houses and a brewery. The Germans are gone but the beer stayed. And with it, three hajiu-loving generations tell you about their happy memories. ""When I was little, buying beer was one special job I did for my dad every summer day,"" explained Irene Cheung over a fresh bag of beer. ""I was the little girl proudly and carefully carrying the plastic bag home."" It is easier to identify Qingdao by what it is not -- smoggy, crowded Beijing, or nightlife hub Shanghai -- than what it is or hopes to be. This may be the very reason why Qingdao remains largely unvisited by the West. And while there may not be much more than good weather, food and beer to keep you content, that may just be enough to hop on the three-hour flight from Hong Kong, or the one hour 20 minute-journey from Beijing or Shanghai. Following Olympic-based investment, more than 3,000 factories have sprung up in the airport suburbs. You can source anything from shoes to jewels to Durex condoms among the largely Korean-owned industries. If these things aren't up your street, head elsewhere; like functionally named Beer Street, Bar Street, or my personal favorite, Coffee and Tea Craft Street.

"(CNN) -- Yasuni National Park in Ecuador's Amazon region is thought of as the most biologically diverse forest in the world. Covering around 1 million hectares of rainforest in eastern Ecuador's Amazon region, it is home to an abundance of plant and animal life. Dr. Kelly Swing leads the Tiputini Biodiversity Research Center responsible for cataloging the area's amazing array of flora and fauna. Swing has worked in the region for more than 30 years. One of the biggest problems his team faced was spotting the plant life and animals in the deep forests, home to more than 20 threatened or near threatened species. The answer came in 2005 with motion-detecting and heat-sensing cameras, which have captured 28,000 images of many rare animals included curassows, ocelots and pumas. While many species may be barely visible, the biggest unseen threat to the area's survival is from the rich resources of oil buried deep beneath the forest floor. Nearly 1 billion barrels of crude oil are thought to be under the northwest section of Yasuni, worth an estimated $10 billion. In 2007, the Ecuadorian government made an offer that the oil would not be extracted on the condition that developed nations compensated them half of the money that the country would have earned through extracting the oil. The money, it says, would go toward social services for the local and indigenous populations of the area as well as to research into renewable energy technology. ""It's something that will set an example for other areas that have the same condition that we have. There are about 9 or 10 countries that could use this example,"" said Ivonne Baki, lead negotiator for Ecuador. Yet some believe that Ecuador is holding a priceless piece of the Amazon to ransom. Ecuador's vice president, Lenin Moreno, believes otherwise. ""The Ecuadorian people are making the biggest sacrifice here because they are letting go of around $3.5 billion -- money which could be invested in the country's development.""","Yasuni in Ecuador's Amazon region is thought to be the world's most biodiverse forest .

"(CNN) -- If you find yourself asking ""where's the beef?"" you may have a case of the Mondays. Meatless Monday is an increasingly popular movement in which carnivores cut out meat one day a week for health and environmental reasons. The campaign started in 2003 as a nonprofit public health initiative of The Monday Campaigns, in association with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future in Baltimore, Maryland. But aside from the alliteration, why meatless and why Monday? ""Studies suggest we are more likely to maintain behaviors begun on Monday throughout the week,"" according to the Healthy Monday public health campaign. Research compiled by the initiative suggests going meatless conserves water, reduces carbon footprints and lowers intake of saturated fats. ""You certainly don't need to eat meat to get protein. Meat is an important part of your diet, but you don't need to eat it every day of the week,"" Ralph Logiscli, director of the Healthy Monday Project, told CNN. On April 12, Johns Hopkins Hospital's cafeteria began offering only vegetarian options in its Wellness Corner on Mondays. ""If you think chili needs meat, you don't know beans,"" touts a promotional poster featuring the cafeteria's chef, Shawn Fields. There are vocal critics. When Baltimore City Public Schools adopted Meatless Mondays last year as a way to cut costs, conservative commentator Glenn Beck deemed it an indoctrination of children to vegetarianism and veganism and decried it as an over-extension of governmental control. ""Americans love our steaks, we love our chops, we love our burgers, and you'll throw me in jail, my last meal will be a giant steak,"" Beck said. J. Patrick Boyle, president and CEO of the American Meat Institute, wrote the movement was ""depriving children and their parents of the ability to determine what is appropriate for their diets and their own personal circumstances."" The concept of Meatless Monday is not new. During World War I, the U.S. Food Administration called for ""Meatless Mondays"" and ""Wheatless Wednesdays"" to aid war effort. It told the public that ""Food Will Win the War"" though the effort to reserve food to be shipped to American servicemen abroad. The rise of the meatless movement during the past year is speculated to be part of the ""Oprah Effect"" and has drawn some major celebrity supporters. Food activist and author of ""The Omnivore's Dilemma,"" Michael Pollan, announced on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" in April 2009 that he participates in the phenomenon and urged viewers to do so. ""To the extent we push meat a little bit to the side and move vegetables to the center of our diet, we're also going to be a lot healthier,"" he said. Celebrity chef and cookbook author Katie Lee publicly participates in Meatless Mondays, often offering up her meat-free eats on her Twitter (@katieleekitchen) account. ""Delicious lunch on a meat-free Monday at Sant Ambroeus ... arugula salad w/ shaved parmesan and spaghettino arrabiata,"" she wrote in a recent Tweet, and Gwyneth Paltrow's GOOP newsletter shared vegetarian recipes from the perennially star-studded Mr. Chow restaurant. In June 2009, even a Beatle got in on the ""all you need is vegetables"" action. Sir Paul McCartney and his daughters, Stella and Mary, launched Meat Free Monday in the United Kingdom to raise awareness about the climate-changing effects of meat production and consumption. ""Having one designated meat-free day a week is actually a meaningful change that everyone can make, that goes to the heart of several important political, environmental and ethical issues all at once,"" Paul McCartney, a long-outspoken vegetarian, said. ""For instance it not only addresses pollution, but better health, the ethical treatment of animals, global hunger and community and political activism."" It's not just the glitterati getting in on the action; entire cities are promoting a weekly meat hiatus. San Francisco, the home of local food evangelists  such as chef Alice Waters, became the first official Meatless Monday city in the United States on April 7. The city's Board of Supervisors approved a resolution pushing for more vegetarian offerings on Mondays, without requiring them. Whether Meatless Mondays prove in the long run to have any palpable effect on the environment or individual health as Earth Day celebrates its 40th anniversary, it's certainly food for thought.","A growing movement encourages people not to eat meat on Mondays .

"(CNN) -- Six-year-old Falcon Heene was cowering inside the attic above his family's garage. Falcon Heene, to the left of his father Richard, said he was yelled at earlier in day for playing in balloon. He had gotten in trouble several hours earlier for playing inside the family's homemade helium balloon and told his 10-year-old brother Bradford that he planned to sneak inside. Richard Heene, the boys' father, had walked away for just a minute when the tether became undone, causing the balloon to begin floating miles above the house, he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer as he sat next to his family on Thursday's broadcast of ""Larry King Live."" It shocked the couple, who began arguing and screaming, trying to figure out what happened. The balloon -- a family experiment for the couple's anniversary -- was not supposed to go higher than 20 feet above the ground, Mayumi Heene said. The eventual goal, her husband said, was for the balloon to hover over the ground and help ease commutes. But as the balloon continued to drift higher and further out of sight, the family's worries grew.  Watch the family describe how balloon ordeal unfolded » . As police, the National Guard and the media scrambled to figure out what happened, Falcon ran into the attic above the garage. ""The reason why I went up there -- my dad yelled at me,"" Falcon Heene said. ""He didn't want me to play in the flying saucer."" His parents, meanwhile, frantically searched anywhere they could think of. ""We searched any place, even small drawers,"" Mayumi Heene said. ""We searched his friends' houses. ... We went through any possible place."" Falcon, meanwhile, was playing inside a box in the attic. His parents shouted his name as they ran through the house. ""Uh-huh,"" the boy said, when asked whether he heard them. His parents both appeared surprised and asked why he didn't come out. ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" the boy said. When his father was pressed about what his son meant, he became uncomfortable, finally saying he was ""appalled"" by the question. He added Falcon was likely referring to all the media coverage. Authorities say they believe the case was genuine.  Watch Richard Heene react to son's comment » . Richard Heene said his family grew even more frantic after they couldn't find him in the house. They thought he was inside the balloon or had fallen out at one point. Then, as millions worldwide watched, the balloon touched down. ""They said he wasn't in there,"" Richard Heene said as he began to tear up. ""You know, I just kind of lost it at that point."" They knew he wasn't aboard the balloon, but speculation grew that Falcon may have been inside a separate basket that was attached at the bottom. Fearful, the family gathered in house, trying to gain their composure. ""We were sitting on the couch, [and] some of the folks were in the room trying to help us calm our nerves,"" Richard Heene said. ""And my wife, I heard her scream. Falcon came around the corner. I dropped to my knees. I screamed, you know, here he is. He is safe. And he's alive. It was a great moment."" Richard Heene said his son Falcon has done things like this before -- just not on such a grand scale. ""Whenever we tell him things like, you know, it's a bad thing to do, he does go and hide,"" he said. He said that he normally knows his kid's hiding spots, but not this time. ""He scared the daylights out of us,"" Richard Heene said. After a couple of hours of time to cool down, he sat down and talked with his son.

"(CNN) -- A suspected Russian spy is missing after being arrested in Cyprus and released on bail, a police spokesman told CNN Wednesday. Authorities arrested Robert Christopher Metsos, 55, in Larnaca after an Interpol ""red notice"" was served on him, Cypriot police said Tuesday. Police said he was released on bail pending further proceedings but was told not to leave the country and was ordered to check in nightly with police. He did not check in Wednesday and police are searching for him, a spokesman said. Metsos is among 11 suspects in an alleged Russian spy ring in the United States. At the time of his arrest, he was traveling on a Canadian passport and was about to board a flight to Budapest, Hungary. Metsos faces extradition to the United States. His disappearance came two days after the U.S. Justice Department announced the arrest of 10 people on charges of being Russian agents involved in a long-term mission in the United States. Five of the suspects appeared in a New York courtroom on Monday. Four of the five, including a longtime U.S.-based columnist for the Spanish-language El Diario newspaper, were advised of their rights and ordered held due to flight risk, with their next hearing scheduled for Thursday. The other defendant, identified in a court document as Anna Chapman, was denied bail. No additional hearings have been scheduled. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the suspects committed no actions directed against American intereststhe and the arrests are ""unfounded and have unseemly goals."" ""We do not understand the reasons why the U.S. Department of Justice has made a public statement in the spirit of the Cold War,"" said a statement on the ministry's website. ""Such incidents have occurred in the past, when our relations were on the rise. In any case it is regrettable that all these things are happening on the background of the 'reset' in Russian-U.S. relations announced by the U.S. administration."" Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, said American police were ""out of hand"" but expressed the hope that relations would not be harmed. ""I hope the positive developments that have been accumulated recently will not be damaged,"" Putin said. On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said the State Department had no plans to expel any Russian diplomats over the matter. ""I'm not projecting any diplomatic consequences other than the good will that we hope will be there going forward to continue to focus on the issues where we agree and work constructively on the areas on which we disagree,"" Crowley said, adding that officials throughout the State Department had been in touch with various levels of the Russian government to discuss the issue. ""As we've made clear -- and as I think officials in Moscow have made clear -- we are going to work as hard as we can to move beyond this and continue to focus on the many issues with which we have common interest,"" Crowley said. ""Our focus is on the process going forward."" The Justice Department said the suspects were supposed to have recruited intelligence agents, but were not directly involved in obtaining U.S. secrets themselves. They were charged with acting as agents of a foreign government, and nine also were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges include conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney general, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, the Justice Department said. Conspiracy to commit money laundering has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The case resulted from a multiyear investigation conducted by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Justice Department's National Security Division, according to a Justice Department statement. The 11 suspects were charged in two separate criminal complaints. CNN's Terry Frieden, Jill Dougherty, Michael Schwartz, Arkady Irshenko, Elise Labott and Carol Jordan contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect gone after missing Wednesday check-in with police .

"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syrup-like oil on the white sand. Pensacola Beach is open, but the waters from the Park West recreation area to the area just west of Portofino are closed to all swimming and wading until further notice because of large quantities of emulsified oil in shore waters and along the shoreline, the bureau said. ""The shoreline and water along Santa Rosa Sound on the north side of the island is still clean, clear and open for swimming,"" according to the bureau's website. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The beaches in Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Okaloosa Island are open to the public, and the air quality is good, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. ""Depending on the wind direction, tar balls may float ashore in Destin or Ft. Walton Beach later in the week, but cleaning crews are standing by,"" the bureau's website said. Pebble-sized tar balls have been washing ashore on some beaches of south Walton County. The local health department has also issued a health advisory for the area stretching from the Miramar Beach Access eastward to the end of Topsail Hill State Preserve. All beaches remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. ""Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,"" according to the bureau. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. A health advisory is in effect from Walkover 23 on Pensacola Beach, Florida, to the west tip of Santa Rosa Island including Fort Pickens. This advisory extends to the Perdido Key area, including Johnson Beach. ""Because of significant quantities of oil in the water and coming ashore signage and flags advise visitors to not wade or swim in the water,"" according to the park. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website.

"(CNN) -- After just two days of closed-door negotiations, the leaders who had gathered at the International Whaling Commission in Agadir, Morocco, announced no agreement was reached on the IWC chair's proposal to improve whale conservation. Greenpeace did not support the proposal, but we had hoped governments would change it to become an agreement to end whaling, not a recipe for continuing it. It is particularly disappointing to me, because my professional commitment to end the whale hunt in my country of Japan -- which led to the exposure of an embezzlement scandal at the heart of the whaling industry -- has come at significant personal cost. The investigation I conducted with my colleague, Toru Suzuki, led to our arrests in front of banks of media outlets who had been told about it in advance. The homes of Greenpeace office and staff members were raided. Seventy-five police officers were deployed to handcuff two peaceful activists. We were held without charge for 23 days; questioned for up to 10 hours a day while tied to chairs and without a lawyer present. We are now out on bail awaiting verdict and sentencing, expected in early September. If I can risk my future to bring the fraudulent Japanese hunt to an end, if whaling whistle-blowers are prepared to risk their lives to expose the corruption, how can it be that the IWC has yet again failed to take the political risk to pressure my government to end the scientific whaling sham? Since the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling came into force in 1986, Japan has continued to hunt whales under the guise of ""scientific research,"" making a mockery of the moratorium. By claiming that slaughtering thousands of whales, in waters designated a whale sanctuary no less, is a scientific experiment needed to understand whales, Japan has violated the spirit and intention of the moratorium as well as the Southern Ocean Whaling Sanctuary. Iceland and Norway have simply ignored the moratorium. Those two nations, together with Japan, have killed more than 30,000 whales since then. I have always opposed my country's hunt, which is why I decided to join Greenpeace. While it may be an emotionally charged political issue outside Japan, domestically it barely causes a political ripple. In 2006, Greenpeace decided to focus the bulk of its anti-whaling campaign in Japan to bring the issue home. Wholly funded by Japanese taxpayers, the whaling program has produced no peer-reviewed scientific research and has been repeatedly told by the IWC that the so-called research is not needed or wanted. All it has produced is a massive bill for the taxpayers and tons of surplus whale meat that the Japanese public does not want to eat. It has also produced endless rumors and allegations of corruption and mismanagement. Two years ago, following a tip from three former whalers turned whistle-blowers, my colleagues at Greenpeace Japan and I began a public interest investigation  and discovered that indeed, corruption runs deep. All three whalers claimed that whale meat was routinely embezzled, with the full knowledge of government and whaling fleet operator officials. Greenpeace eventually intercepted one of nearly 100 suspicious boxes coming off the ships. Although its contents were labeled as cardboard, 23.5 kilograms of prime whale meat were inside, destined for a private address. On May 15, 2008, we handed over the box to the authorities, with additional evidence of the crime. Initially the Tokyo district prosecutor began to investigate. But we were eventually charged with trespass and theft of the whale meat, valued at nearly 60,000 yen (about $550 at the time). We face from 18 months up to 10 years in jail for exposing the truth behind an industry that is financially, morally and scientifically bankrupt. The U.N.'s Human Rights Council on Arbitary Detention has ruled that our human rights have been breached and the prosecution is politically motivated. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed her concern about our case. Amnesty International, Transparency International, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, countless international legal experts, politicians and more than half a million individuals have raised their voices in opposition to the prosecution. We will be tried and sentenced in September, more than two years after we first exposed the corruption. But the scandal does not end there. Just last week, more allegations emerged that Japan engages in vote-buying and bribery to keep its whaling fleet in the water. And yet, the IWC continues to close its doors and ears to the reality of Japan's commercial whaling. I came to Morocco in the hope that this, the International Year of Biodiversity, could mean an end to all commercial whaling, but I leave knowing that governments are only interested in taking strong public positions on whales but not in taking action to save them, not even behind closed doors. Mine and Toru's political prosecution is a clear sign that Japan has no intention of easily letting go of its debt-ridden whaling program. There are too many vested interests inside the government. That is not surprising. What is more disappointing is that those vested interests have gone unchallenged by the IWC, the body set up to conserve whales. It may be surprising that in this day and age, and given the huge public interest in the issue, conversations about saving whales are held in secret. But the truth is that Japan's whaling program relies on secrecy and corruption to stay afloat. After two years of negotiations, this year's meeting could have been an opportunity for the IWC to actually move forward and end the status quo. But its collective failure means that 24 years after the establishment of the moratorium on commercial whaling, Japan, Iceland and Norway will continue again to hunt whales with impunity. I challenge the commission to throw open its doors and shine a spotlight on the corruption that is so evident, investigate all the allegations affecting the IWC that have been laid clearly before it on numerous occasions and realize that it is not only Japan's international reputation that has been tainted by the failure in Agadir. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Junichi Sato.","Junichi Sato, colleague face charges after  finding corruption in Japan's whaling industry .

"(CNN) -- Police in Norwalk, Ohio, are searching for a 17-year-old girl who has been missing since June 7 after trading text messages with her boyfriend that indicated the two were planning to run away together, police Sgt. Jim Fulton said Monday. Fulton said police believe Abbi Obermiller left her grandparents' home on her own accord late on the night of June 6, but said detectives are ""concerned"" that the situation may have changed and that there is a ""possibility she is in danger."" He declined to elaborate on what information authorities have received that led them to believe her situation possibly changed. Investigators in the case have uncovered a series of text messages between Obermiller and her boyfriend, identified by police and by Obermiller's parents as 20-year-old Robert Young of Norwalk, that appear to be coordinating when she would be picked up from her grandparents' home in the early morning hours of June 7, Fulton said. According to Fulton, Obermiller repeatedly sent messages to Young asking, ""How much longer?"" At 12:45 a.m. June 7, Young responded and told her to ""leave now,"" Fulton said. The last text message from Obermiller appeared to direct Young to her location, Fulton said. CNN could not immediately reach Young for comment Monday night. Young has denied knowledge of Obermiller's whereabouts, according to police. Young has told police the messages were a week old and were sent over Memorial Day weekend while the couple coordinated a swimming date, Fulton said. However, other evidence indicates the couple were  making plans to run away  after Obermiller's parents expressed  disapproval of their relationship,  Fulton said. Young was charged June 14 with obstruction of justice in the case for  his failure to cooperate in the investigation, authorities said. A text message to one of Obermiller's friends sent before her disappearance indicates Obermiller knew she would be going away. In it, she tells her ""bestest friend"" that she won't be able to talk for a while so ""don't forget me,"" according to Fulton. And a note found in her grandparents' home reads: ""I just couldn't take any more of this drama, it's not good for me. Love you all. Hope to see you soon. Love, Abbi,"" according to Fulton. Fulton also said one of Obermiller's friends told police she saw Abbi wearing a wedding ring. ""We do believe that Bobby does know where she's at, he just doesn't want to tell us,"" Obermiller's mother, Rose Obermiller, told HLN's ""Prime News"" on Monday night. Rose Obermiller told ""Prime News"" that she initially approved of her daughter's relationship with Young, but that Young's behavior grew increasingly alarming. ""In the beginning he was a nice Christian boy,"" Obermiller said. ""He went to church, he was on the baseball team, he was on the basketball team (and) he really cared for Abbi. ""But as it went on, he was telling her, 'No I don't want you to be class treasurer; no, I don't want you to go to New York with your choir; no, I don't want you to see these friends and relatives,"" Obermiller said. ""He was telling her what not to do."" Fulton said Young has declined to take a polygraph test in the case.","Abbi Obermiller last seen June 6 .

"(CNN) -- Since assuming the role of executive director of the Black Coaches and Administrators (BCA) in 2001, my most frequently asked question has been: ""What is the reason for the lack of black head football coaches in the NCAA?"" My answers were always objective, not subjective. I focused on the facts. The numbers spoke the truth. Today, we're immersed in the afterglow of a remarkable seven-day collegiate football hiring span. From Dec. 7 through 13, three new head football coaches of color were appointed on the BCS (Bowl Championship Series) level: Turner Gill (Kansas), Charlie Strong (Louisville) and Mike London (Virginia). The earlier November selections of Larry Porter (Memphis) and Willie Taggart (Western Kentucky) elevated the number to five in the current 2009 FBS hiring cycle. We have 13 (11 African-American) head football coaches of color among the 120 FBS (Football Bowl Subdivision/IA) schools. We are experiencing a watershed of success after a sordid history of disappointments. When the BCA released the initial report card in 2003, the FBS had only three head football coaches of color. One year ago, only four African-Americans were head coaches in the FBS. It was the lowest total in 15 years. By the conclusion of the 2008/2009 hiring cycle, the number had risen to nine. BCA report cards revealed increases in the number of people of color brought in for official interviews, but, in reality, the hiring remained abysmal by any acceptable standard. Anyone desiring to become a head football coach on the FBS level had a lesser chance statistically than those seeking to become head coach in the NFL or in NCAA basketball or even a general in the U.S. Army. At the minimum, the number of minority head football coaches should be closer to 20 percent of the opportunities. My statement to college presidents, which accompanied the release of our most recent hiring report, called for the administrators to ""stand up for justice and not block its path."" Finally, it appears the labors of those who have so painstakingly tended to the tree of opportunity for minority football coaches have finally produced the first significant harvest of delicious fruit. What happened to cause the change? No single event or group is fully responsible; it is a collaboration of voices and actions on the issue. I equate it to the steady and deliberate pounding on a huge rock that finally cracks. While the last blow finally splits the rock to the core, all the strokes that preceded it contributed to the break. I believe the BCA has played a significant role in the exposure of the collegiate football hiring issue dating back to the late 1980s. The production of the annual hiring report card and distribution of capable candidate lists has brought awareness, knowledge and accountability to the search and hire process. Dr. Richard Lapchick (DeVos Sports Business Program) has produced multiple reports and studies pertaining to the diversity and inclusiveness of all of collegiate sports and, specifically to football. His call for an ""Eddie Robinson"" rule on the collegiate level, similar to the National Football League's Rooney rule, is heard. The Rooney rule requires that at least one minority candidate be interviewed when a new head coach is appointed. The executive office of the NCAA, led by the strong advocacy of its late president, Myles Brand, has been significant in voice and funding for this change. The vice president of diversity and inclusion, Charlotte Westerhaus, has provided successful professional development under the NCAA Expert Forum (Academy) for football. The five recent hires are alums of the Expert Forum programs. The strong voice of retired NFL head football coach Tony Dungy is being heard. When Tony speaks, the people listen. He has the resume and the platform to state the case for the equitable hiring issue. His expertise and credibility is unquestioned. Winning is always important. Coaches of color are experiencing success. For the first time in history, three current coaches of color will take FBS teams to a bowl game: Randy Shannon (Miami/Champs Sports Bowl), Ken Niumatalolo (Navy/Texas Bowl) and Kevin Sumlin (Houston/Armed Forces Bowl). Two of the past three Super Bowl champions have been coached by African-Americans African-Americans (Dungy and Tomlin). The current success of the Indianapolis Colts with Jim Caldwell as head coach is further testament. The Division IA Athletic Directors, led by president Dutch Baughman, recently adopted an ""Acceptable Standards"" policy to create a prescribed and appropriate standard to administer the business of intercollegiate athletics. Specifically, the intention was to reaffirm a commitment to ethical procedures in the search and hiring process. The recent passage of the state of Oregon's House Bill 3118 was very significant. Initially, this bill was spearheaded by the concerns of a private citizen, Sam Sachs, to the Oregon legislature. Oregon has adopted legislation similar to the NFL's Rooney Rule for all state colleges as a guideline for hiring in athletics. It appears that up to eight additional states will strongly consider similar legislation. Finally, nothing is more significant than the positive effect of seeing the highest office in our country and, for that matter, the entire world occupied by an African-American. President Obama's position and success as a national and world leader speaks volumes. Most of the messages from my office have criticized a process that has progressed slowly, if not begrudgingly, toward equity. Today, I can honestly say our college presidents and athletics directors are standing up for justice and not blocking its path. It's important that we be able to continue to make this statement on a regular basis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Floyd Keith.","Floyd Keith says NCAA colleges are beginning to hire coaches of color .

"(CNN) -- Paraguay booked a place in the last eight of the World Cup for the very first time in their history at the expense of Japan but only after a dramatic penalty shoot out in Pretoria. Japan's Yuichi Komano missed the crucial spot kick and Paraguay striker Oscar Cardozo was the man to seal the game with the winning penalty, as his side triumphed 5-3. Neither side created many chances during 120 minutes of disappointing football, though Japan's Daisuke Matsui hit the crossbar and Paraguay forced goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima into a couple of smart saves. In the end, Paraguay held its nerve from 12 yards to make it to the quarterfinals, where they will face the winners of Tuesday's other last 16 clash between Spain and Portugal. After a quiet opening 20 minutes at Loftus Versfeld Stadium Paraguay fashioned the first opening when Lucas Barrios got into the area and forced Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima into a good low save. Seconds later, Daisuke Matsui struck the bar from 25 yards with a looping shot. Manchester City striker Roque Santa Cruz was the next to go close as he latched onto a loose ball in the area but he dragged his shot wide. Five minutes before halftime Japan created a chance for Keisuke Honda after Matsui squared the ball to him on the edge of the box. He elected to shoot, and sliced his shot wide, when Yoshito Okubo was unmarked to his left. Chances were few and far between for the rest of half as Japan sat deep and made themselves difficult to break down. After the break Nestor Ortigoza worked his way into the penalty area but failed to get a shot off before Cristian Riveros flashed a header right at Kawashima. Japan defender Marcus Tulio Tanaka went close with a header from a corner but both sides struggled to open each other up. As the end of 90 minutes loomed both sides retreated, more than happy to sit back rather than launch men forward, and the game duly went into extra time. Paraguay pressed forward after the restart and substitute Edgar Barreto tested Kawashima with a header, before the 'keeper had to dive at Nelson Valdez's feet to prevent him scoring. Honda then forced Paraguay 'keeper Justo Villar into a save with a free-kick. In the second half of extra time Japan came close to a winner when Yuto Nagatomo's cross was met by Honda but Villar saved, but the game went to penalties. The first six penalties were converted before Komano smashed his shot against the crossbar. Then Cardozo held his nerve to clinch the game.","Paraguay beat Japan to book a place in the last eight of the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- David Villa was Spain's hero yet again as his goal helped them past Portugal and into the last eight of the World Cup with a 1-0 second-round victory in Cape Town. The Barcelona striker registered his fourth goal of the competition just after the hour as he stabbed a shot past Portugal goalkeeper Eduardo, putting him level with Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain and Slovakia striker Robert Vittek as the South African tournament's top scorers. It was just reward for Spain's endeavor against a largely defensive Portugal team, who struggled to get Cristiano Ronaldo into a game between the neighboring European nations. Villa's strike should have been added to but Euro 2008 winners Spain squandered a clutch of clear-cut chances. Vicente Del Bosque's side will now face Paraguay in the quarterfinals on Saturday, after the South American side beat Japan on penalties in Pretoria earlier on Tuesday. Liverpool striker Fernando Torres nearly opened his account at the World Cup inside the first minute as he forced Portugal keeper Eduardo into a smart save. Torres' strike partner Villa was the next to test the keeper, who beat away his low shot. Just four minutes later Villa's near-post effort tested Eduardo again. Portugal's first opportunity came in the 20th minute as Spain keeper Iker Casillas parried Tiago's shot into the air before punching clear when striker Hugo Almeida tried to turn the ball home. Ronaldo tested Casillas with a free-kick from distance and the keeper spilled his powerful shot, before Almeida should have scored when he rose to meet Fabio Coentrao's cross from the left. Five minutes after the break, Almeida burst down the left and his cross took a deflection off Carles Puyol and looped just past the post with Casillas beaten. Torres was taken off for Fernando Llorente just before the hour mark and the Athletic Bilbao striker almost scored with his first touch, but his header from point-blank range was saved by Eduardo. In the 63rd minute Spain made the breakthrough, with a goal made in Barcelona. Andres Iniesta found Xavi, whose flick found the Spanish champions' new signing Villa -- and though his first shot was saved, he tucked the rebound home off the underside of the bar. Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos nearly made it 2-0 soon after but his low shot was brilliantly turned behind by Eduardo. Danny had half a chance to equalize as the ball broke in the area, but Joan Capdevila made a superb block. Seconds later Ricardo Costa was sent off for an apparent elbow on Capdevila, and the red card signaled the end of Portugal's World Cup hopes.","Spain beat Portugal 1-0 to make the quarterfinals of the World Cup .

"CNN -- Spanish champions Barcelona have announced that striker Thierry Henry and midfielder Yaya Toure will leave the club before the new season. France international Henry scored four goals in 15 starts last season for the Champions League semifinalists, as he fell down the pecking order following the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and, last month, Spain star David Villa. The 32-year-old recently returned from the World Cup in South Africa after France failed to win a single game and make it past the group stage of the tournament. ""Right now, he needs to take a step forward. This implies that this coming season, Barca will not have to pay his salary,"" Barcelona director general Joan Oliver said of Henry, who has a year left on his contract. A World Cup winner in 1998 and a losing finalist four years ago, this year he played a minor role as a substitute as his career continued the decline that began with his departure from English club Arsenal three years ago. While contributing to Barcelona's unprecedented treble in 2008-09, capped by a Champions League title, he struggled with injury at times and was even usurped by younger players at the Nou Camp such as winger Pedro. Toure has also been told he can leave the club, with English side Manchester City reportedly favorites to reunite the 27-year-old with his brother and Ivory Coast international teammate Kolo. ""Barcelona director general Joan Oliver has said that the club has agreed the exits of Yaya Toure and Thierry Henry,"" a statement on the club's website said on Tuesday. ""But at the moment the final moves are in their hands. In case of Toure, Oliver has recognized an understanding between the club interested in the midfielder, Manchester City, and Barca, but the transfer cannot be made official yet."" Henry has been strongly linked with a move to American Major League Soccer team New York Red Bulls in the past. He is a big basketball fan and is often seen with close friend Tony Parker of NBA side San Antonio Spurs when visiting the U.S. In 2001, Henry flew out to Philadelphia to help cover the NBA finals for a French television channel.","France international Thierry Henry has been told he can leave Barcelona this summer .

"(CNN) -- One of the men killed in Monday's coal mine explosion in West Virginia knew of the danger but didn't let it bother him, his family said Tuesday. The blast at the Massey Energy Co. mine in Montcoal, West Virginia, killed at least 25 miners; four others are unaccounted for, officials say. The cause of the explosion had not been determined as rescuers worked Tuesday to bore ventilation holes into the Upper Big Branch Mine.

I know everyone thinks that about their loved ones, but Benny truly was a wonderful man,"" Willingham's sister Jean told CNN. ""He loved the Lord, and in church the other day, he thanked the Lord for saving his soul, and he thanked him for watching over him in the mines for over 30 years, and he said, 'If he takes me tomorrow, I've had a good life,' "" she said. iReport: Are you there?

"Washington (CNN) -- The body of Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, will lie in repose in the U.S. Senate chamber on Thursday, two Senate aides familiar with the plans told CNN. Byrd, the longest-serving member of the U.S. Congress, died Monday. He was 92. Byrd served for six years in the House before moving to the Senate, where he served nine terms. Byrd will lie in repose in a closed casket from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET, a senior Senate aide said. Senators and others will be asked to be in the chamber at 10:30 a.m., when Senate chaplain Barry Black will give a prayer. It was unclear whether members of the public would be on the floor or watching the proceedings from the visitors' gallery above. Byrd's body will also lie in repose at the West Virginia state Capitol from 9 p.m. Thursday to 9 a.m. Friday, West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin's office said in a statement, and ""the public is invited to pay their respects. ""A public, formal memorial service will also take place (at) 11:30 a.m. Friday at the state Capitol's North Plaza,"" the statement said. Manchin has ordered flags flown at half-staff at state facilities in Byrd's honor, and ordered the lights of the state Capitol dome turned off until further notice. On Monday, West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant said there will be no election this year to fill the remaining time in Byrd's term, and that the election will take place in 2012. But the timing of Byrd's death contributed to confusion about filling the remainder of his term. Two elections will be held in November 2012, Tennant said -- one to fill the remaining two months of Byrd's term and one for the new six-year term in the Senate that begins in January 2013.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A British journalist has been arrested in connection with the incident a week ago in which a fan entered the England football team's dressing room during the World Cup, South African authorities announced Tuesday. Simon Wright, 44, was arrested in Cape Town on Monday evening, the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS) said. He appeared in Cape Town magistrates' court -- the dedicated World Cup court -- late Monday and was released on bail of 3,000 rand ($393).

The fan, Pavlos Joseph, was arrested after he entered the England dressing room following their goalless draw with Algeria. In the exclusive interview with Wright two days later, Joseph claimed he got lost while looking for the bathroom and then decided to confront the England team about their poor performance. Joseph is out on bail, having surrendered his passport, while he awaits trial on charges of trespassing. Wright will face charges of attempting to defeat the ends of justice and a contravention of the Immigration Act, providing false information to a place of accommodation, NATJOINTS said in a statement. Under the conditions of his bail, Wright had to surrender his passport to police and must report once daily to Cape Town police, NATJOINTS said. In the interview published June 20, Wright wrote, ""As South African police hunted high and low for Pavlos, unaware of his name and scouring CCTV (surveillance camera footage) for his face, the man at the centre of it all was calmly sitting down to breakfast with the Sunday Mirror.""","British journalist arrested over World Cup fan intrusion .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress delved Wednesday into the politically explosive issue of unmanned drone attacks, questioning the legality of operations increasingly used to combat al Qaeda and Taliban militants in countries such as Pakistan. In the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency, unmanned aircraft -- or drones -- attacked militant targets 45 times. Since President Obama took office, the numbers have risen sharply: 51 last year and 29 so far this year. Most attacks have targeted suspected militant hideouts in Pakistan. While the United States is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones -- which are controlled remotely -- U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes. Based on a CNN count, all of the 29 drone strikes this year have hit locations in North Waziristan and South Waziristan, along the 1,500-mile porous border that Pakistan shares with Afghanistan. Several top U.S. law professors debated the legality of the attacks in a hearing before the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, the second such hearing held by the subcommittee within the past two months. ""The United States is committed to following international legal standards,"" said Rep. John Tierney, D-Massachusetts, the subcommittee's chairman. ""Our interpretation of how these standards apply to the use of unmanned weapons systems will set an example for other nations to follow."" The four legal scholars invited to testify, however, offered sharply contrasting views of what constitutes an acceptable legal standard. The biggest controversy appeared to surround the legality of strikes conducted by CIA operatives, as opposed to strikes by the U.S. military. ""Only a combatant -- a lawful combatant -- may carry out the use of killing with combat drones,"" said Mary Ellen O'Connell, a professor from the University of Notre Dame law school. ""The CIA and civilian contractors have no right to do so. They do not wear uniforms, and they are not in the chain of command. And most importantly, they are not trained in the law of armed conflict."" O'Connell also said that ""we know from empirical data ... that the use of major military force in counterterrorism operations has been counterproductive."" The U.S. government, she said, should use force only ""when we can accomplish more good than harm, and that is not the case with the use of drones in places like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia."" David Glazier, a professor from Loyola law school in Los Angeles, California, defended the drone attacks on the grounds that there is ""no dispute that we are in an armed conflict with al Qaeda and with the Taliban."" That fact ""allows the United States to call upon the full scope of authority which is provided by the law of war."" Glazier said there is ""nothing within the law of war that prohibits the use of drones. In fact, the ability of the drones to engage in a higher level of precision and to discriminate more carefully between military and civilian targets than has existed in the past actually suggests that they're preferable to many older weapons."" He conceded, however, that there are legitimate concerns about the CIA's use of drones. CIA personnel are ""clearly not lawful combatants, [and] if you are not a privileged combatant, you simply don't have immunity from domestic law for participating in hostilities."" Glazier warned that ""any CIA personnel who participate in this armed conflict run the risk of being prosecuted under the national laws of the places where [the combat actions] take place."" CIA personnel, he said, could be guilty of war crimes. William Banks, the founding director of Syracuse University's Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism, said the U.S. government has engaged in targeted killings of individual combatants dating at least back to a 1916 border war with Mexican bandits. Banks said the authors of the 1947 National Security Act, which traditionally gives the CIA much of its legal authority, probably didn't contemplate the targeted killings tied to drone attacks. But the statute, he said, was ""designed as dynamic authority to be shaped by practice and by necessity."" ""The intelligence laws permit the president broad discretion to utilize the nation's intelligence agencies to carry out national security operations, implicitly including targeted killing,"" he said. U.S. laws ""supply adequate -- albeit not well-articulated or understood -- legal authority for these drone strikes."" The American Civil Liberties Union sent a public letter to Obama on Wednesday that said the drone attacks are part of an illegal program authorized by the administration allowing suspected terrorists -- including Americans -- to be targeted and killed by U.S. operatives. ""The program you have reportedly endorsed is not simply illegal but also unwise, because how our country responds to the threat of terrorism will in large measure determine the rules that govern every nation's conduct in similar contexts,"" ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said. ""If the United States claims the authority to use lethal force against suspected enemies of the U.S. anywhere in the world -- using unmanned drones or other means -- then other countries will regard that conduct as justified. The prospect of foreign governments hunting and killing their enemies within our borders or those of our allies is abhorrent."" Peter Bergen, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan group, suggested that the increase in drone attacks during the Obama administration is, in part, revenge for the bombing of a CIA base in eastern Afghanistan that killed seven Americans on December 30, 2009. ""The people who died in this suicide attack were involved in targeting people on the other side of the border,"" he said earlier this year. Long War Journal, an online publication that charts data for U.S. airstrikes against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan, says the air campaign ""remains the cornerstone of the effort to root out and decapitate the senior leadership of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other allied terror groups, and to disrupt both al Qaeda's global and local operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Such attacks, which have taken a civilian toll in many cases, have frequently caused tension between Pakistan and the United States.

"New York (CNN) -- For the first time in almost a decade, the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island will go on without its most recognizable face. Takeru Kobayashi, who took home six consecutive titles from 2001 to 2006, will not be participating in the challenge this year because of a dispute with Major League Eating (MLE), the association's president, Richard Shea, said in a statement Monday. The organization describes itself on its website as ""the world body that oversees all professional eating contests."" ""Takeru Kobayashi is currently not scheduled to compete in the 2010 Nathan's Famous July Fourth Hot Dog Eating Contest,"" the statement said. ""Major League Eating has sought to arrive at an agreement with Kobayashi, but contract negotiations have reached an impasse."" Kobayashi says he loves the contest and he would love to participate, but the contract is too restrictive.  Speaking through an interpreter, he said that all his income is earned through competitive eating.  He said the new contract required by the competition would bar him from competing elsewhere in the United States or Canada for a year. Hailing from Japan and weighing in at 160 pounds, Kobayashi, 31, rose to frank-feasting stardom in 2001 when he devoured 50 dogs, shattering the previously held record of 25 1/8. But in 2007, having entered the challenge with a jaw injury, Kobayashi met his match in Joey Chestnut. Chestnut, of San Jose, California, downed 66 dogs to Kobayashi's 63 that year. Kobayashi has not won the competition since. ""We respect his place in the history of our sport,"" MLE Chairman George Shea told CNN. ""Everyone will always remember him for ushering in the modern era of eating."" Chestnut, the reigning wiener warrior for the last three years, gobbled a record 68 hot dogs in 2009. Chestnut, who weighs 230 pounds, is currently ranked No. 1 in competitive eating by the MLE. For a hot dog to be counted as finished, competitors must consume both the hot dog and the bun. Currently ranked third, Kobayashi still holds world records for eating cow brains (17.7 pounds in 15 minutes), lobster rolls (41 in 15 minutes) and rice balls (20 pounds in 30 minutes).","NEW: Kobayashi says contract is too restrictive .

"(CNN) -- Finland has become the first country in the world to declare broadband Internet access a legal right. The move by Finland is aimed at bringing Web access to rural areas, where access has been limited. Starting in July, telecommunication companies in the northern European nation will be required to provide all 5.2 million citizens with Internet connection that runs at speeds of at least 1 megabit per second. The one-megabit mandate, however, is simply an intermediary step, said Laura Vilkkonen, the legislative counselor for the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The country is aiming for speeds that are 100 times faster -- 100 megabit per second -- for all by 2015. ""We think it's something you cannot live without in modern society. Like banking services or water or electricity, you need Internet connection,"" Vilkkonen said. Finland is one of the most wired in the world; about 95 percent of the population have some sort of Internet access, she said. But the law is designed to bring the Web to rural areas, where geographic challenges have limited access until now. ""Universal service is every citizen's subjective right,"" Vilkkonen said.   Should fast Internet access be everyone's legal right? It is a view shared by the United Nations, which is making a big push to deem Internet access a human right. In June, France's highest court declared such access a human right. But Finland goes a step further by legally mandating speed. On the other hand, the United States is the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote high-speed broadband, according to a study released in August by the Communications Workers of America, the country's largest media union. Forty-six percent of rural households do not subscribe to broadband, and usage varies based on income, the study found. In February, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is expected to submit a national plan to Congress. The FCC says that expanding service will require subsidies and investment of as much as $350 billion -- much higher than the $7.2 billion President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package has set aside for the task.","Providers will need to supply connection speeds of at least 1 megabit per second .

"(CNN) -- The wife of CNN talk-show host Larry King suffered an apparent drug overdose last month, just over two weeks after the couple reconciled and dropped their divorce petitions, according to a Utah police report. Paramedics found ""multiple pill bottles all of which were empty"" on her bed, along with a letter a police officer said ""led me to believe that (Shawn) King had intentionally taken the quantity of pills."" Larry King released a statement through his publicist Wednesday saying his marriage is ""still together."" ""We shall go through this difficult time intact as a family,"" King said. Her father, Karl Engemann, called for an ambulance to come to his Provo, Utah, home around midday on May 28 because he found Shawn King, 50, unconscious on a bed. CNN obtained the recording of the 911 call from the Provo Police Department. ""I've tried to wake her up,"" Engemann told the emergency dispatcher. ""I slap her and I holler at her and she opens her eyes halfway and puts them back down again."" Asked if it could be an intentional overdose, Engemann said ""No, no, no, it wouldn't be suicidal."" ""I don't think she did it on purpose or anything, but she may have overmedicated,"" he said. ""Last night she seemed confused about what she had taken the last time she had taken it."" He said his daughter did take ""something to help with her anxiety and her depression."" The police report obtained by CNN said three handwritten pages were found on the bed near her ""indicating that she was leaving, or that she might hurt herself, such as that she wished to be buried in Utah."" ""At this time it is unknown whose writing this letter was in, however, wording on the letter led me to believe that King had intentionally taken the quantity of pills,"" Officer Martin Webb wrote in his report. ""Multiple pill bottles all of which were empty"" were found on the bed with the letters, he said. The prescription medications included Compro, Prometrium, clonazepam, Ambien, Klonopin, Subutex, Cymbalta and Lyrica, the report said. King was taken to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition later that night, the report said. Coincidentally, actor Gary Coleman died in the same hospital just minutes before King arrived there. CNN was unable to reach representatives of Shawn King or her father. Larry King, however, did provide a statement. ""I am extremely supportive of Shawn,"" he said. ""Reports that we have fought are absolutely false. I love her dearly."" The couple filed for divorce within minutes of each other in Los Angeles County Superior Court in April. They announced their reconciliation a month later. ""We love our children, we love each other, we love being a family,"" their joint statement said. ""That is all that matters to us. We owe it to ourselves and our children to continue being dedicated to each other."" The Kings have two sons, ages 9 and 11. Larry King has hosted a nightly prime-time talk show on CNN since June 1985. He previously hosted a late-night national radio talk show.","Paramedics found Larry King's wife unconscious May 28 at her father's home .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after President Obama tapped Stanley McChrystal in June 2009 to be the top commander in Afghanistan, CNN reported that McChrystal would never let a reporter in the room during classified morning meetings he led among senior military officers. McChrystal was known in Washington for his discretion. He kept a low profile, briefly interrupted by two major news events. The general was criticized for the way he handled the circumstances of U.S. soldier Pat Tillman's friendly fire death in Afghanistan in 2004. In 2006, McChrystal was lauded for the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. The media spotlight on McChrystal this week, however, may be the hottest in the general's storied military career. On Tuesday, McChrystal flew from Afghanistan to Washington. His boss, President Obama, has asked the general to explain in person the derisive comments he and his aides made to a Rolling Stone reporter. The magazine's profile on McChrystal, due out Friday, depicts an angry, snarky and foulmouthed general lambasting how the war in Afghanistan is being conducted. McChrystal does not directly criticize Obama in the article, but reporter Michael Hastings writes that the general and Obama ""failed from the outset to connect"" after the president took office. Sources familiar with their first meeting said McChrystal thought Obama looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the room full of top military officials, according to the article. The journalist writes that an unnamed aide to McChrystal mocks Vice President Joe Biden. ""Are you asking about Vice President Biden?'"" McChrystal says with a laugh. ""Who's that? Biden?"" suggests a top adviser. ""'Did you say: Bite Me?"" McChrystal hasn't denied the article's accuracy. In a statement, he called his comments ""a mistake"" and apologized for ""poor judgment."" The general has also fired a press aide over the article, two Defense Department sources told CNN. McChrystal, a West Point graduate and former Green Beret, was a senior official on the staff of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the commander of the highly clandestine Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees the military's most sensitive forces, including the Army's Delta Force. In 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates asked for the resignation of Gen. David D. McKiernan, the former U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal would have ""fresh eyes on the problem"" in Afghanistan, Gates said at the time. McChrystal has pushed a counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan intended to empower the civilian population so much that the insurgency will slowly be demoralized, fractured and defeated. Part of that plan means a prohibition in some areas on lethal air strikes and other attack methods so that civilian injuries and deaths can be avoided. Some U.S. service members have been critical of the move, arguing that the rules have left them vulnerable. In a July 2009 interview with Time, McChrystal explained his approach. ""First thing is, if you take a very small area, you have to try and figure out what is going on in that area. ... It's like knowing what is going on in your neighborhood,"" he said. ""Not just the traffic on the road, but how money is made, who is running rule of law, who do they go to when they have dispute adjudication -- do they go to a Taliban shadow court, a government of Afghanistan official entity?"" "" ... You have to get at the attitudes of the people. And that is why I say you have to immerse yourself in it and understand it before you can confidently assess it,"" he told Time. Just who the man is behind the strategy is tougher to assess. ""He's lanky, smart, tough, a sneaky stealth soldier,"" Maj. Gen. William Nash, a retired officer, told The New York Times in May 2009. ""He's got all the Special Ops attributes, plus an intellect."" The Times reported that McChrystal thrives on a few hours of sleep a night and often eats only one meal a day. He has for years been an avid distance runner. When he did a yearlong fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, he reportedly ran 12 miles a day from his home in Brooklyn to Manhattan. McChrystal's last public apology came during his Senate confirmation hearing for the top post in Afghanistan. He said he was sorry for his role in the way the Pentagon handled Pat Tillman's death. Tillman gave up an NFL contract to join the Army and fight in Afghanistan. He was killed by friendly fire in 2004. A Pentagon investigation found that McChrystal was notified that the soldier was a victim of fratricide. But Tillman's family said they were led to believe he was killed by insurgents. Tillman's mother said last year that McChrystal knew at her son's memorial service that he had died of friendly fire, but did not tell the family. She said McChrystal was ""lying."" Investigations by the Army's Criminal Investigation Division and the Defense Department's inspector general concluded that officers in Tillman's chain of command knew almost immediately that he had been killed by fire from his own platoon. That information, however, was withheld from his family for more than a month, in violation of Army regulations. McChrystal told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he helped expedite the Silver Star award for Tillman before confirming that Tillman was killed by friendly fire. The Army did not take action against McChrystal.","Stanley McChrystal known for keeping a low profile throughout most of his career .

"Washington (CNN) -- The ski-masked creator of the satirical Twittter account @BPGlobalPR provided the comic highlight of the TEDx OilSpill conference on Monday, prancing around the stage and reeling off one fake BP company slogan after another. A New Orleans, Louisiana, environmental activist provided one of the saddest moments when she recalled losing the most important person in her life at  17 when her father was one of 91 men who died in an oil drilling accident off Thailand. And a conservationist provided one of the most powerful moments when he drew a connection between government regulators failing to require safer drilling practices to decades of deregulation. Carl Safina of the Blue Ocean Institute said, ""The oil blowout, the bank bailout, mortgage crisis, all these things are absolutely symptoms of same issue ... we still need police to protect us from a few bad people ... for the last 30 years, we've had a culture of deregulation caused directly by people we need to be protected from buying the government out from under us."" He was called back on stage to take a bow. TEDx conferences are independently organized events, licensed by TED, a nonprofit dedicated to the theme of ""ideas worth spreading."" Watch TEDTalks on saving the oceans . Throughout the one-day session in Washington's Woolly Mammoth Theatre, the flip sides of the crisis were invoked: . What we can see -- stained beaches and boats, dizzying patterns of iridescent sheens on the Gulf's surface, birds drenched in petroleum, miles of boom, some of it hopelessly tangled or unable to prevent oil from drifting into vital marshland. And what we mostly cannot see -- beneath the surface, huge quantities of oil and chemical dispersant that, speakers said, threaten to dramatically harm the undersea world. Along with the news that the X Prize foundation would offer a multimillion dollar award for a solution to cleaning up the oil disaster, the speakers shared devastating portraits of the risks and damage as well as hope for the long-term survival of the Gulf. Here are seven views of the crisis as described at the conference. Casey DeMoss Roberts . Roberts, of the Gulf Restoration Network, sketched the ways in which the oil industry has become embedded in Gulf communities that once relied only on fishing for their livelihood. In one example she cited: The shrimp festival in Morgan City, Louisiana, was renamed the ""Shrimp and Petroleum festival"" in 1960. She recalled her father's death in an offshore oil accident in Asia and contrasted the precautionary principle used in drug regulation, where products are tested for safety before they're marketed, to the oil industry, where she said safety precautions are too often instituted only after an accident. Lisa Margonelli . Margonelli is the author of ""Oil on the Brain: Petroleum's Long Strange Trip to Your Tank"" and a fellow of the New America Foundation. She noted that oil spills tend to be ""politically very galvanizing,"" with photos of oil-soaked birds drawing an emotional public response. The 1969 Santa Barbara spill, which was a tiny fraction of the size of the BP leak, prompted the modern environmental movement, the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, and led to moratoriums on drilling on the East and West coasts. Instead of cutting back on oil consumption, Americans just grew to rely on getting it from other places. Drilling in the Gulf, where there was no moratorium, helped pick up the slack, she said. The U.S. has also ""exported"" its oil spills, she said, by encouraging oil development in places such as Nigeria, which has had thousands of spills in the past several decades. She added that the military and political costs of getting oil from the Middle East and other regions of the world still have to be paid for, though it hits people when they pay their taxes, not at the pump. Ronald Atlas . Atlas, a microbiologist at the University of Louisville, said while the effects of the leaking oil are partly visible, ""in tragic photos of pelicans, gut-wrenching pictures ... what we don't see is what's going on in the world of bacteria."" He said for hundreds of species of bacteria, oil is a food source, and these can contribute to degrading the oil, eventually turning it into inert substances that don't damage the environment. But he warned that the process will take years and years. ""What we discovered 40 years ago, you could speed up the process by adding fertilizer, and ... you could get the bacteria to grow faster."" That research was applied in Alaska, with the result that over a period of years, more of the oil was consumed, Atlas said. He said that by 2001, NOAA found that 99.6 percent of the oil had disappeared from Prince William Sound, 13 years after the Exxon Valdez disaster. David Gallo . Gallo, an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Institution, has used submersibles and robotic vehicles to map the undersea world and is working with other experts and ""Avatar"" director James Cameron on ideas to stop the leak. He recalled his early days thinking about a career in studying the sea: . ""I knew there were sharks and whales and French guys in Speedos swimming around, but I didn't know that most of the ocean hadn't been explored. The seas cover 70 percent of the Earth's surface to an average depth of two miles. ""We've only explored about 5 percent of the world beneath the sea. ... The floor of the ocean, that's a world that has the world's greatest mountain range, it's got thousands of valleys deeper than the Grand Canyon, underwater rivers, underwater lakes, and most importantly in a world where we thought there should be no life at all, there's more life in that world than in a tropical rainforest in terms of diversity and density. We don't how it works, especially a mile deep."" Sylvia Earle . Earle is an explorer who has led more than 50 expeditions, logging more than 6,000 hours underwater. She described her campaign, enabled by the 2009 TED Prize, to build awareness and support for creating ""hope spots,"" protected areas in the oceans to preserve sea creatures. She showed videos of whale sharks being tagged in the Gulf a week ago. She feared they could be affected by the spill because of their habit of feeding by skimming the surface of the water. Earle said she believes the toxic pollutants released into the Gulf will eventually be swept into the Gulf Stream, threatening the Sargasso Sea, a favorite feeding place for the whale shark. ""We need to embrace those places that remain within the Gulf system. We think about restitution for the fishermen, for the hotel owners, but we need to think about giving back to the Gulf of Mexico itself, which supports all this life. ... We are all sea creatures, the ocean is home for all of us."" Watch Sylvia Earle's TED Prize talk . Carl Safina . Safina, of the Blue Ocean Institute, got emotional when he told a story about a bottlenose dolphin splattering oil out its blowhole and seeming to seek help as it followed a fishing boat in the Gulf. He pointed to deficiencies in the cleanup process, saying the use of chemicals to disperse the oil is a strategy to limit the visibility of the leak for public relations purposes, even though the dispersants may be toxic. Booms won't stop the oil in open water; protecting birds' breeding sites is self-defeating since birds fly to other parts of the Gulf to swoop down and catch fish, and even cleaning birds can prove useless if they return to the oil-fouled waters, he said. Ultimately, he said, it's ""not a surprise that if you make 30,000 holes in the Gulf of Mexico, oil would start coming out of one of them."" ""Leroy Stick"" Stick is the humorist behind @BPGlobalPR, which has more than 179,000 followers on Twitter. Not only did Stick keep his ski mask on to keep his identity a secret, but he even posed for a time on stage as another fake character, ""Terry."" ""Terry"" is a BP public relations official who said ""we're sorry, we're not accepting blame for whatever it is you're mad at us for."" He said he wanted to focus on the positive, not the negative, and introduced BP's Atlantis Rig, which at 7,000 feet is deeper than the Deepwater Horizon rig was. ""Is it safe? We didn't ask engineers,"" but showed a fake text message asking federal officials for permission to drill it. The phony reply, also a text message: ""Whatever."" ""If I took off this mask, you would be incredibly underwhelmed, I'm just a guy that had an idea and I ran with it. I realized I had a tool to engage people thru humor."" Then he got serious: ""If you think the status quo is unacceptable, then don't accept it.

VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV/MOTHERBOARD.TV) -- Military checkpoints line the long and winding road from the airport in Cali, Colombia, to the coastal city of Buenaventura. These are expected sights in the long-running conflict we know as the ""war on drugs."" Plan Colombia, legislation passed during the Clinton administration, provided billions in military aid to Colombia to help halt the cultivation and transport of cocaine. It has had only mixed success. Buenaventura, a strategic port city and maritime gateway to Central and North America, is a haven for the newest clandestine agent in the illegal drug trade: the ""narco-sub."" As this decades-old conflict has ebbed and flowed, one thing has remained constant: the sheer ingenuity of narco-traffickers to invent and exploit new methods and routes for smuggling. We were granted access to the Málaga naval base about an hour outside of Buenaventura, which has been at the forefront of interdicting these vessels. The Colombian navy said some cartels are allocating increasing resources to the development of new smuggling technology. Several decades ago, Samsonite suitcases and underwear refashioned with hidden pockets enabled upstart smugglers to carry drugs across borders. Today, narco-subs are at the cutting edge of smuggling technology. The Colombian navy has collected a small group of narco-subs and boats at Málaga. They resemble speedboats with their roofs removed, more than any images you might conjure from ""The Hunt for Red October,"" and most of them aren't engineered to be fully submersible. But despite being built off the grid, having a ramshackle appearance, and occasionally malfunctioning at sea, narco-subs are increasingly used by traffickers to carry millions of dollars of illicit cargo, while evading some of the world's most technologically advanced military equipment. See the rest of Colombian narco-subs at Motherboard.tv . It is unknown how many narco-subs have been deployed. The ones caught so far by the Colombian navy each sports a slightly different shape and set of features -- at least from the outside. But in the dark and musty interior of two semisubmersibles, their shared purpose is clear: to carry illicit cargo, a small crew of men, and enough gasoline for a journey that could last several weeks. What the vessels do not include, said officials, is a bathroom. Miguel Angel Montoya helped spearhead the construction of semisubmersibles for drug smuggling prior to leaving the trade. ""At the beginning, in the times of Pablo Escobar, it was common for planes to leave Colombia and land on clandestine strips in the U.S. or Mexico. Later, that was difficult. ... Innovations in drug trafficking come when the situation hits a crisis state,"" said Montoya. One of his last designs was the ""torpedo,"" an unmanned submersible towed behind another boat on the surface and outfitted with a radio-controlled recovery system in the event the navy captured it. Having temporarily discarded the evidence, the crew could later recover its cargo and continue its journey. The ""torpedo"" represents the height of narco-sub innovation as it was known five years ago. Who knows what might be crawling under the ocean's surface today.

"(CNN) -- Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed joined his troops on the front line Wednesday to fight hard-line anti-government Islamists, a presidential aide told a journalist in Mogadishu. ""The president is on the front line leading the fight against Al Shabaab and he is armed with an AK-47,"" said the aide, who declined to be named. The aide said that the president is accompanied by government soldiers and forces from the African Union Mission in Somalia. The chief of Somali Police, Gen. Ali Mohamed Hassan, told reporters that the drive led by the president marks the beginning of a larger operation against Al Shabaab. Ahmed has a long history of military leadership that has included fighting on front lines. Before he became president in 2009, he led an Islamist movement that took control of the capital in June 2006. After the international community -- led by Ethiopian forces -- ran him from power late that year, he began to cooperate with those same international powers. He became president of a U.N.-backed unity government, which led the country's parliament to appoint him president.

The shelling started after clashes erupted in two parts of the city.

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Soviet spy Oleg Kalugin, who headed KGB operations in the United States in the 1970s and later left Russia to live in America, told CNN Tuesday he is ""amazed"" that Moscow is engaging so heavily in espionage against Washington. Reacting to the recent arrests of 11 alleged Russian spies, Kalugin said that getting the type of information the FBI says the operatives collected ""does not require such a massive assault"" against the United States. ""I am amazed,"" he said. ""It reminds me of the worst years of the Cold War."" Kalugin also said he was ""amused"" by reports of the arrests. ""It is a sign of the decadence of the Russian intelligence services,"" he said. ""Why do they need to use so many people to get information that is openly available?"" iReport: The spies next door? The Justice Department announced Monday that 10 people had been arrested in the United States on charges of being Russian spies on long-term missions in the U.S. A Justice Department spokesman called the suspects ""trained Russian intelligence operatives."" An 11th suspect was arrested Tuesday in Cyprus, Cypriot police told CNN. The government's complaints against the alleged operatives say their mission was ""to become sufficiently Americanized such that they can gather information about the United States for Russia, and can successfully recruit sources who are in, or able to infiltrate, United States policy-making circles."" Kalugin said that has been a mission for Soviet and Russian operatives for decades: to look for potential spies in the United States with the ultimate purpose of placing them in key government agencies like the State Department, Defense Department and the White House. Kalugin added that he was impressed by the ""efficiency"" of the FBI, which apparently was able to keep the suspects under control for several years. He said FBI agents have not ""lost their focus"" and noted that it is difficult to ferret out such spies. The former Soviet spy told CNN he did not believe that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev knew of the pending arrests during his visit to the White House last Thursday, but his impression was that President Barack Obama did know and it was reflected in a ""rather strained"" visit with Medvedev. Kalugin said he now feels that ""something was brewing."" He also explained that he is not surprised that several of the suspects are listed as former Canadian citizens. He said Canada, with a large number of Russian and former Soviet émigrés, has been used for decades by Soviet intelligence as a ""jumping ground"" to pick up people for possible espionage operations in the United States. The reports of alleged Russian espionage, Kalugin believes, ""will sober up some minds in the U.S. who believe that Russia is a totally different country."" Kalugin said former Russian president and now prime minister Vladimir Putin -- himself a former KGB agent -- has restored the role of the intelligence agency, now called the FSB, and its arm that deals with foreign intelligence, the SVR. ""Old habits have been restored,"" he said. ""The United States used to be enemy No. 1 for the KGB,"" he said. ""Now it is priority  No. 1.""","Oleg Kalugin headed KGB operations in the United States in the 1970s .

"(CNN) -- Reigning world champions, Italy have been held to a 1-1 draw by New Zealand in their World Cup Group F match at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit. The All Whites took a shock lead after seven minutes when Shane Smeltz turned in Simon Elliot's free kick from close range. Replays showed that Smeltz was offside when Kiwi defender Winston Reid flicked the ball on to him, but the lineman's flag stayed down. The goal instigated a frenzied period of Italian pressure which eventually told when referee Carlos Batres awarded a penalty after defender Tommy Smith tugged at Daniele De Rossi's shirt in the Kiwi's penalty area. Striker, Vincenzo Iaquinta stepped up and sent keeper Mark Paston the wrong way to level the scores. Italy continued to press in the second half but found no route through a spirited and steadfast defense expertly organized by Kiwi captain Ryan Nelsen. Despite throwing on all his three substitutes by the 61st minute, Italian coach, Marcello Lippi and his players found their attacking edge continually blunted. Even their long range efforts were dealt with. In the 70th minute, Riccardo Montolivo's 25-yard drive fizzed towards goal only for keeper Paston to produce the save of the match and push the ball to safety. The stalemate continued, but New Zealand's Chris Wood could have won it for the All Whites in the 83rd minute when he shot narrowly wide of Federico Marchetti's left post. The result leaves Italy progression to the knockout stage in doubt. A win against Slovakia would ensure qualification, but they must rely on New Zealand getting a result against Paraguay to have any chance of topping their group. Coach Lippi said his team lacked ""lucidity."" ""The result is 1-1 so we just have to pull up our socks and win our next game because we don't want to go home early,"" Lippi said, AFP reported. ""We are in a difficult situation but we are not in a panic situation. We will have to win the next match."" For New Zealand, a team ranked 73 places below Italy in FIFA's official world rankings, the result is one to savor. ""It's an incredible result and it's way above anything we have achieved before against the stature of our competitors,"" New Zealand's coach Ricki Herbert said, AFP reported. ""Anything is possible and we're doing okay for a team who some say shouldn't be playing at this World Cup,"" he added. Paraguay outclass Slovakia . In the other match in Group F, Paraguay beat Slovakia 2-0 at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein. Cristian Riveros' 86th minute strike sealed a comfortable victory for the South American team after midfielder Enrique Vera had given them the lead in the first half. The result leaves Slovakia needing to beat Italy in their final group match this Thursday to have any chance of progressing to the next round. Paraguay, meanwhile, are almost certain to qualify and need just a point against New Zealand to reach the last 16. Paraguay's win was never really in doubt as they pressed forward from the opening whistle, while Slovakia was content to sit back and defend. Paraguay took a deserved lead in the 26th minute. Lucas Barrios picked up the ball outside the Slovakia penalty area before slipping the ball through to Enrique Vera who, with Zendo Strba and Jan Durica bearing down on him, clipped the ball with the outside of his boot past Slovak keeper Jan Mucha. The goal stirred a defensive-minded Slovakia into life forcing them onto the front foot, but their new found urgency failed to create any chances of merit as a succession of promising moves came to nothing. Roque Santa Cruz should have doubled Paraguay's in the 38th minute, when he latched onto a loose ball on the edge of Slovakia's penalty area. The Manchester City striker fired low, but straight at Mucha, who comfortably saved with his feet. Santa Cruz turned provider in the second half, breaking down the left past Slovakia's Vladimir Weiss in the 72nd minute. His cross found an unmarked Vera in the penalty area but he directed his header inches wide of Mucha's right post. But the win was confirmed when Paulo Da Silva was given an age to tee up Riveros on the edge of the box who wasted no time in smashing the ball past Mucha. Weiss went close for Slovakia in injury time, but he and his team toiled fruitlessly in search of a goal for most of the game while Paraguay, who with Santa Cruz, Nelson Haedo Valdez and Barrios had class to spare in midfield.","Italy held to 1-1 draw by New Zealand in Nelspruit .

"(CNN) -- Alan Alda almost died in 2003. He was in a remote area of Chile, doing an episode of ""Scientific American Frontiers,"" and he developed an intestinal obstruction that came within hours of killing him. It was his good fortune that he survived the whole ordeal. Alan Alda rummages through his life in his new book, ""Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself."" Some time later, after he'd returned to the United States and resumed his acting career, he started digging through his house for old speeches and memorabilia. Decades ago, the existentialist philosophers brooded about life's meaninglessness; Alda wanted to find some meaning. ""As a lot of people do who are given a second chance at life, I find myself thinking about things like this,"" he says in a phone interview from New York. ""I notice a lot of people who go through that have a few more questions than they had before about their lives."" It's not like his life had been bad before he almost died. He'd earned lasting fame as Hawkeye Pierce on ""M*A*S*H,"" received a variety of awards and nominations (including Emmy wins and an Oscar nod) and established a long-lasting, happy marriage and family. But there's nothing like escaping death to concentrate the mind wonderfully (to paraphrase Samuel Johnson). So, in the spirit of the examined life, Alda has put his thoughts -- derived from commencement speeches, advice and life experiences -- into a book: ""Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself"" (Random House). ""What is my life adding up to?"" Alda asks rhetorically. ""I want to feel satisfied that I'm spending the time well.""  Slide show: Alda on some influences » . It may seem like an odd pursuit for a man with so many honors, but Alda took the quest seriously. One theme that comes up over and over again is fear: ""It's one of the ways I feel alive,"" Alda says. That's true for both his public speaking engagements and his acting roles, he adds. ""When you escape near disaster you feel great, so I set these little disasters up for myself."" There was the first time he played Hawkeye, for example. ""I was standing, waiting for the word 'action' to come out of a building for the first shot of the show,"" he recalls. But he'd been rehearsing for days and was no closer to getting a handle on the character. In the end, he trusted his instincts. ""I just took a leap into it. ... Sometimes those leaps are the most valuable way to do it."" Alda doesn't diminish the impact of others. He pays tribute to a number of people in the book, from his father -- a well-known stage actor -- to such figures as actor Ossie Davis, scientist Richard Feynman (whom Alda portrayed on stage) and manager Martin Bregman. One Alda story, about actor Bert Convy, is revealing in a number of ways. To many, Convy -- if remembered at all -- is thought of (often derisively) as a game show host (""Tattletales"") or '70s TV guest star. But Convy was also a fine stage actor -- he starred in the original ""Fiddler on the Roof"" on Broadway -- and, Alda remembers, showed courage during the violence of the 1968 Democratic convention in helping free some demonstrators. ""He was an unlikely hero of mine, because he really risked a lot one night in Chicago,"" Alda says. ""He saved some people from possibly getting badly hurt, getting them out of jail."" And Convy, like some of Alda's ""M*A*S*H"" colleagues, is also an illustration of how performers get pigeonholed, a subject Alda has considered deeply. ""That's what usually happens when you get well-known in one part ... which is why it really is fair for actors to get paid a lot of money on television, because it could be the last time you'll see them. That one job for five or six years could turn out to be what their whole career is."" There are also the pitfalls of celebrity itself, the blurring of boundaries between public roles and private life. Alda's been beseeched by troubled people, asked to give talks at medical schools and been stared at in restaurants. The attention, he admits, can be disconcerting. ""People were always curious about actors,"" he says. ""But now it's much more true. ... I think that's partly because the need to sell papers and keep profits up have devalued things a little bit."" He tries to use his fame to his advantage. When talking to a group of budding doctors, he told them that just because he played a doctor on television didn't mean he knew something about medicine -- but he did know something about being a patient. And he's used his interest in science to encourage others, primarily through hosting ""Scientific American Frontiers."" He loves science's give and take -- its determination to not take hypotheses at face value -- and scientists' pursuit of facts. He says he hopes others are similarly inspired. ""All of us depend on people being pretty rigorous about the way they see reality, and if we knew a little bit more about the way [scientists] work, I think we'd be able to support them in some of the things they do that will benefit us,"" he says. So, for all of his own rigor, did Alda come to any conclusions about the meaning of his life? He pauses. ""I think I come to some odd conclusions that sort of bring me back to where I was in the beginning,"" he says. He believes there's more to that existential interpretation: ""I think that what they were constantly saying was that life is meaningless, except for the meaning you bring to it by the choices you make and the things you do."" With that, Alda wraps up the interview. He has an appointment, he says in passing: His granddaughter has some work on display in a photography exhibit, and he doesn't want to miss it. And that, he doesn't need to say, means the world. E-mail to a friend .","Alan Alda had near-death experience in 2003; new book is search for meaning .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan's confirmation hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded Thursday with witnesses for and against the solicitor general, including former military members who slammed her handling of military recruiters on the Harvard University campus. Twenty four witnesses testified about President Barack Obama's pick to replace the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens on the high court. Kagan herself was not there, having concluded her participation in the committee's hearing Wednesday after three days of testimony. Democratic senators have openly predicted Kagan would win confirmation as the 112th high court justice, perhaps by the end of July. Her addition to the high court would mean the nine-member panel would include three women for the first time. The 50-year old Kagan has come under criticism from Republican senators who say that as dean of Harvard Law School, she actively tried to block military recruiters because of the Pentagon's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that bars openly gay and lesbians from military service. ""Dean Kagan's clearly unlawful actions estranged the campus,"" said former U.S. Army Capt. Flagg Youngblood. He called Kagan's actions ""double dealing,"" and a ""condescension to the American rule of law that harmed the interests of the military."" Youngblood attended Yale University as an ROTC member, and is now director of military outreach for conservative Young America's Foundation . Capt. Pete Hegseth of the Army National Guard said Kagan ""encouraged students to oppose and protest the presence of military recruiters on campus."" Hegseth now heads the private group Vets for Freedom. The nominee and the White House have strongly defended her actions, saying that while she opposed the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, Kagan never kept recruiters off the university and never sought to sidestep the law. Another former military member invited by Republican senators to testify did not appear. Retired Gen. Jerry Boykin, who has been criticized for speeches comparing the war on terror as a Christian fight against Satan and suggesting Muslims worship idols, was disinvited by committee Republicans earlier this week. ""Although General Boykin's prior comments concerning the war on terror are unrelated to his scheduled testimony on Dean Kagan's nomination, it is clear that these comments would be used to distract from the very important issues surrounding Ms. Kagan's actions at Harvard Law School,"" said Stephen Boyd, spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's ranking Republican. As Harvard Law School dean, Kagan supported other schools challenging a federal law -- known as the Solomon Amendment -- requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law on March 6, 2006. Just four months after taking the job as Harvard's dean, in October 2003, Kagan offered students her thoughts in a campus-wide e-mail, saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus ""causes me deep distress."" ""I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy,"" she said then, calling it ""a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order."" Kagan received support Thursday from the head of the Harvard Law Armed Forces Association, Capt. Kurt White. Still a student at the Ivy League school, White told lawmakers he saw firsthand Kagan's support of veterans and the military. Her outreach and graciousness ""made a big difference in the lives of the small group of us veterans,"" said White, who was critical of other military members that opposed Kagan's nomination. Among other witnesses invited by the Senate committee's Democratic majority were two people who sued their employers, claiming age and sex discrimination on the job. Lilly Ledbetter said she hoped Kagan would be a sympathetic ear to those who bring legitimate workplace suits. ""I learned who is on the Supreme Court makes all the difference,"" she said. The onetime tire company manager alleged she was paid less than her male counterparts for equal work about two decades, but did not find out about the discrimination until she was about to retire. The high court in 2007 ruled against her, saying existing federal law did not allow such lawsuits to be filed so late. Most workers had 180 days to file a claim after the first discriminatory pay decision. Obama, in the first bill he signed when taking office in January 2009, enacted the Lily Ledbetter Act. It nullified the high court decision, and said every new paycheck received over the years based on a discriminatory act -- regardless of when the first discrimination occurred -- would extend the statute of limitations 180 days. ""If one more person like (liberal) Justice (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg or Justice Stevens were on the court,"" Ledbetter said, ""then my case would have turned out differently."" Jack Gross lost his Supreme Court appeal last year, after he alleged he was a victim of age discrimination when he was passed over for a promotion. He criticized the current conservative court for reading federal laws in a way that makes it more difficult for people like him to claim wrongdoing by employers. Other witnesses included leaders of advocacy groups on opposite sides on the abortion rights debate. A number of notable legal conservatives also voiced contrasting views of Kagan's qualifications. Jack Goldsmith was hired by Kagan in 2004 to be a law professor, and said Kagan showed her openness by hiring several right-leaning faculty members at a campus with a liberal reputation. The American Bar Association told lawmakers why it gave Kagan its highest ""well qualified"" rating, following a detailed evaluation of her to be a justice. ""Almost all of the experienced, dedicated and knowledgeable sitting judges, former solicitors general from both parties, legal scholars from top law schools across the country, and lawyers who have worked with or against the nominee in government or court, describe the nominee as outstanding in all respects and cite specific evidence in support of that view,"" said Kim Askew, who coordinated the ABA evaluation panel.

"Cape Town, South Africa(CNN) -- The president of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea pledged a series of reforms Monday, saying he wants to ensure peace, political stability and transparency in the central African nation, ranked among the world's most corrupt. ""However,"" President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo said, ""we must remember that Equatorial Guinea is a relatively young nation, inexperienced and, just like a ship, our comprehensive program of reforms will take some time to turn us around, in time for what is called Horizon 2020."" Obiang, who seized power in a 1979 coup, was re-elected in November in a vote that human rights groups criticized as unfair. Obiang won with 96.7 percent of the vote. The government said at the time that the elections unfolded ""in an atmosphere of tranquility and peace."" Human Rights Watch, however, said after the election that conditions in the country ""cast serious doubt about the credibility"" of the vote. ""In recent weeks, (the government of Equatorial Guinea) has stifled and harassed the country's beleaguered political opposition, denied the opposition equal access to the media, imposed serious constraints on international observers and failed to set out clear terms to allow journalists to monitor the election,"" the organization said in a statement. Transparency International, a nongovernmental organization that examines corruption worldwide, has ranked Equatorial Guinea as among the world's most corrupt countries. Obiang, speaking Monday at the Fortune/TIME/CNN Global Forum, said his nation would improve in rational use of resources, social sector development, legal institutions, relations with human rights organizations and environmental conservation.","President wants to ensure peace, political stability and transparency .

"Washington (CNN) -- It has long been the dream of many a liberal advocate: to have an unabashedly outspoken, cleverly articulate justice who can take on the conservative majority and inspire young progressives for decades to come -- a ""Scalia for the Left,"" as many have called it. If confirmed, Elena Kagan may or may not turn out to be that intellectual counterweight to conservatives Justice Antonin Scalia or Chief Justice John Roberts. But Kagan displayed in her confirmation hearing Tuesday what those two men share -- a ready public wit and disarming sense of humor. Time and again, the nominee sought to subtly charm lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee, many of whom tried to press her for candor on a range of contentious issues such as gun rights, executive power and military recruiting on campus. Kagan's funny asides during 10 hours of questioning appeared spontaneous, and colleagues say that is her style: someone who is serious about the law but who enjoys a good laugh, often at her expense. Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pennsylvania, quizzed Kagan on a favorite topic of his-- allowing cameras in the Supreme Court, which most justices oppose. ""It means I'd have to get my hair done more often, Sen. Specter,"" Kagan replied. The senator paused and appeared not to immediately get the joke. But he quickly recovered. ""Let me commend you on that last comment and I say that seriously,"" he said to laughter in the room. ""You have shown a real admirable sense of humor and I think that's really important. ... We are looking for somebody who could moderate the court, and a little humor would do a lot of good."" When it comes to being funny, it helps to have a willing and ready partner. Kagan found that in the folksy, clever phrasing of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who asked her about her 1995 statements criticizing past Supreme Court confirmation hearings as a ""vapid and hollow charade."" ""Let's try to go back in time and say you're watching these hearings and you were critical of the way the Senate conducted these hearings,"" said Graham, drawing chuckles in the hearing room. ""Are we improving or going backwards? And are you doing your part?"" ""I think you've been exercising your constitutional responsibilities extremely well,"" Kagan said, smiling broadly and drawing out the word ""extremely."" ""So, it's all those other guys that suck, not us, right?"" responded Graham to huge laughs. On another occasion, Kagan was left giggling by an exchange between Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. Grassley had asked the nominee about a paper she wrote as a college student that took a critical look at how judges decide cases. ""Is it appropriate for judges to mold and steer the law?"" Grassley asked. ""All I can say about that paper is that it is dangerous to write papers about the law before you've spent a day in law school,"" Kagan said. ""I wrote that paper before I spent a day in law school. I was trying to think about whether to go to law school and I decided to write a paper about law in order to figure out whether I was interested in the subject... So I would just ask you to recognize that I didn't know a whole lot of law."" Her careful answer brought laughs, and Grassley joked it caught him by surprise. ""You know if I accept your answer, it is going to spoil a whole five minutes I had here,"" Grassley responded. ""Chuck, go ahead and accept it,"" Leahy cut in, to laughs. ""Let me enjoy it anyway, will you?"" a smiling Grassley said. Late in the day, conservative Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said he would ask Kagan a ""softball"" question. ""Promise?"" Kagan replied, looking skeptical at first, and then grinning softly. The biggest laugh of the day came from another exchange between Kagan and Graham. The subject was the not so-funny topic of terrorism and the 2009 attempted Christmas day bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner. ""The Christmas day bomber, where were you at on Christmas day?"" Graham asked. ""Sen. Graham, that is an undecided legal issue, which well, I suppose I should ask exactly what you mean by that,"" Kagan began. ""I'm assuming that the question you mean is whether a person who was apprehended in the United States is ..."" Graham interrupted, saying, ""No, I just asked you where you were at on Christmas."" Without hesitation, Kagan replied in perfect deadpan, ""You know, like all Jews, I was probably in a Chinese restaurant,"" tossing her head and shrugging her shoulders in the process. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, clapped his hands animatedly at the comment. To be fair, the members of the court usually labeled liberal -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, and the retired John Paul Stevens -- all display great legal minds but not much sharp-edged humor or the willingness to engage in spirited debate for which Kagan is known. Justice Stephen Breyer is equally smart and he too shares a sense of humor, but that tends to fall on the quirky, self-deprecating side. On the conservative side, friends of Justice Clarence Thomas -- who almost never speaks at arguments -- note he has a great wit and a hearty laugh. Colleagues call him the funniest justice you never hear about. If confirmed as expected, the 50-year-old Kagan could have years of humorous highlights ahead of her on the bench. With Roberts, Scalia, and Breyer, she could help make the traditionally sober court a little more light-hearted. Schumer paid Kagan a high compliment Tuesday, noting Scalia gets the most laughs during high court oral arguments. ""If you get there, and I believe you will,"" Schumer said, ""you're going to give him a run for his money.""","Confirmation hearing displays Elena Kagan's sense of humor .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio inmate, convicted of killing and dismembering a 22-year-old woman in 1991, was executed Tuesday using a new, untested one-drug method of lethal injection, state officials said. Kenneth Biros, 51, was pronounced dead at 11:47 a.m. at a prison in Lucasville, Ohio, the state attorney general's office said in a written statement. His last words, according to Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman Julie Walburn, were: ""Sorry from the bottom of my heart. I want to thank all of my family and friends for my prayers and who supported and believed in me. ""My father, now I'm being paroled to heaven,"" Biros said, according to Walburn. ""I will now spend all of my holidays with my lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Peace be with you all. Amen."" Biros' execution is the first in Ohio since September, when the governor and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for the injections. The one-drug method had never been tried on a U.S. death row inmate. It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein. A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup, officials said. The one-drug method has been used to euthanize animals. The same drug, sodium thiopental, at a much lower dosage, is the first ingredient in the three-drug method previously used in Ohio, as well as in all but one of the other 34 states that allow the death penalty. Some capital punishment opponents claim the sodium thiopental, which renders the prisoner unconscious, can wear off too quickly, and that some prisoners would actually be awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continues. Biros' execution was initially scheduled for 10 a.m., but preparations were delayed as officials waited for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on Biros' request for a stay, Walburn said. The high court without comment denied the request about 10 a.m., and ""we were about an hour behind"" in preparations, she said. The execution began around 11 a.m. Biros died about 10 minutes after the drugs began to flow, she said, but he was not officially pronounced dead until later. Biros, 51, was convicted of killing Tami Engstrom near the town of Warren. He met the woman at a bar and offered to drive her home, and later admitted robbing and attempting to rape her. Prosecutors said Biros dismembered Engstrom and spread her body parts around northeast Ohio and neighboring Pennsylvania. The crime was ""particularly heinous, with 91 pre-mortem wounds,"" according to the clemency report. Biros claimed he acted in a fit of drunken rage. He was involved in litigation challenging the three-drug method and received a stay of execution in 2007 because of his involvement in the suit, according to minutes of a November parole board meeting posted on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections' Web site. His attorney, Timothy Sweeney, had also objected to the one-drug method, saying it was unconstitutional. Sweeney wrote in an appeal that use of the one-drug method would amount to ""human experimentation, pure and simple."" But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month denied Biros' request for a stay, concluding that since Ohio had announced it would change its protocol and rely on the one-drug method, Biros' argument regarding the three-drug method was moot. Biros' last meal was served about 7:45 p.m. Monday -- pizza with extra cheese, mushrooms, onions and green peppers, along with onion rings, deep-fried mushrooms, Doritos, french onion dip, blueberry ice cream, Dr Pepper and cherry pie, Walburn said. During its meeting last month, members of the state parole board heard a prerecorded statement from Engstrom's mother, Mary Jane Heiss, according to the meeting minutes. Heiss said her health was not good but she was saving her strength to attend Biros' execution. ""Since her daughter's death, she has endured nearly 20 years of constant pain and nightmares,"" the minutes said. ""She believes that the nightmares will end with the execution. It makes her sick that Biros tortured and brutally murdered her daughter."" The board voted 7-0 to deny Biros clemency. In attempting to execute Broom in September, authorities tried unsuccessfully for hours to find a vein to administer his lethal injection. Afterward, Gov. Ted Strickland announced he would delay the executions of two other men until March at the earliest. Broom's execution has not been rescheduled. Ohio has put 32 people to death in the past decade.

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- On his knees in the soggy soil, 9-year-old Alexis Ocampo digs deep into the earth, his small gardening rake separating dirt from rocks. ""Look, I found a worm!"" he shrieks. Towering above is Andrea Girardini, calmly instructing Alexis and the half-dozen other children working to clear spots for new crops. ""We can put a squash plant here, and some lettuce over there,"" says Girardini, a director of Semillas al Viento, a community organization that teaches neighborhood kids practical skills that help them put food on the table. ""The children come here and learn how to farm and how to cultivate their very own organic vegetables. Then they bring them home to eat. It's a wonderful alternative to sitting in front of the computer,"" she says. The Semillas al Viento (Seeds to the Wind) farm is located in Isidro Casanova, a poor area in Buenos Aires' sprawling urban rust belt, where green spaces are few and far between. Five years ago, the football-field sized area was overrun with garbage and frequented by criminals, but following a community effort to reclaim it, it now teems with trees, grass and flowers, as well as eggplants, tomatoes, lemons and herbs. There's even a small pond where kids and dogs happily splash around. ""I really enjoy being here. It's like my happiest place to be. The fresh air is great,"" says Alexis. The Semillas al Viento farm is a part of Huerta Nino (My Garden), a nonprofit foundation that works to alleviate malnutrition and starvation in Argentina. Since 1999, it has helped build more than 50 small farms, many of them in isolated villages in northern Argentina. Despite being one of the world's largest agricultural-producing countries, Argentina still struggles to feed its people. ""Hunger is one of the gravest problems that Argentina has right now. At least 300,000 Argentine children are suffering from undernourishment,"" says Juan Lapetini, executive director of Huerta Nino. Nearly 5,000 Argentine children have been educated about sustainable farming practices through the ""My Garden"" program, which has also been endorsed by Argentine celebrity chef Martiniano Molina, and won various awards for its initiatives. Typically, the program is introduced first at rural schools, where the crops that students grow are then taken home to eat. The long-term objective, coordinators say, is to have the children create vegetable gardens at home with their parents. ""Getting parents to change their eating habits, and encouraging them to provide nutritious food to the kids is sometimes the biggest challenge,"" says Lapetini. Following Argentina's economic collapse in 2001 -- when the country defaulted on $100 billion in foreign debt -- poverty, crime and unemployment rates soared. The crisis, coupled with Argentina's lack of philanthropic tradition, led to the creation of HelpArgentina, a U.S. charity that functions as a bridge between international donors and a network of 65 transparent Argentine NGOs, like Huerta Nino. Since 2003, HelpArgentina has channeled more than $3 million in donations to the country, and coordinated the visits of hundreds of foreign volunteers. In January, a group of students from the University of Virginia spent two weeks at the Semillas al Viento farm, working directly with children and instructors to clear additional farming land and build adobe huts and bathrooms. They also left a sizeable donation. ""When you work day-in and day-out with these organizations ... and you know their needs and struggles ... to receive donations from abroad, even if it is a small amount, it literally changes the reality of many of these organizations,"" says HelpArgentina's Jon Teel. ""Witnessing these changes is amazing. And that's why we do what we do.""","Community efforts have reclaimed lots filled with garbage into urban gardens .

"London, England (CNN) -- Counterterrorism officers were Saturday searching the suspected London home of a man at the center of an incident aboard a U.S.-bound passenger flight that Britain's home secretary described as a ""potentially serious security threat."" The search, which focused on a upscale block in the heart of London's embassy district, followed the incident on Friday in which a Nigerian man ignited a small explosive device on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The incident triggered an increase in security at UK airports and at Schiphol in Amsterdam, where the suspect in the attempted attack on a Northwest flight went through ""normal security procedures,"" according to the security officials. In the British capital, a spokesman for University College London confirmed they had a student named Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab enrolled in their Department of Mechanical Engineering from September 2005 to June 2008. The name matched the identity of the suspect said by U.S. authorities to have been involved in an attempted terrorist attack. UK Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he is following the case closely and has assured the public that police in Britain are working closely with U.S. investigators ""to uncover the full background to the incident."" ""We will ensure that the UK continues to have in place the most appropriate security measures to protect the public from the terrorist threat wherever it originates from,"" he said. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown added in a separate statement: ""The security of the public must always be our primary concern. ""We have been working closely with the U.S. authorities on investigating this incident since it happened yesterday. Because of the serious potential threat posed by the incident, I have spoken to the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, whose officers have been carrying out searched of properties in London. ""We will continue to take whatever action necessary to protect passengers on airlines and the public,"" Brown added. One piece of information led police to an ornate building on Mansfield Street in London, where Abdulmutallab may have once lived in a basement apartment. It wasn't clear as to what police were searching for. U.S. security sources told CNN that Abdulmutallab flew into Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on a KLM flight from Lagos, Nigeria. A U.S. administration official said the suspect did not undergo secondary screening in Amsterdam, though Schiphol officials say all connecting passengers bound for the United States undergo secondary searches. Schiphol officials said they boosted the secondary screening for U.S.-bound connecting passengers Saturday, doing body searches and bag checks instead of using the usual metal detectors and X-ray machines. The measures were being implemented at the request of U.S. authorities, a Schiphol spokesman said. There was also increased security Saturday for U.S.-bound passengers in Britain, whether they were connecting through Britain or flying direct. BAA, which operates several British airports including London's Heathrow, said all passengers on U.S.-bound flights will now be subject to the secondary screening at the gate. The screening used to happen on a random basis. There were no reported delays from Heathrow Saturday, but passengers boarding a U.S.-bound Virgin Atlantic aircraft were told there would be no in-flight electronic entertainment in the wake of the incident. Britain's Department for Transport said U.S. authorities requested the additional measures. ""Passengers traveling to the United States should expect their airline to carry out additional security checks prior to boarding,"" BAA said. ""To support this important process, which will take time, we would advise passengers to leave more time to check in and limit the amount of baggage being taken on board the aircraft. If in any doubt, please contact the relevant airline for further information."" The British Department for Transport said it would assess the measures ""as necessary"" as the situation develops. The incident in Detroit will now focus attention on the searching of connecting passengers, especially those going to the United States, CNN Correspondent Richard Quest said. ""Previously discretionary searches are now likely to be mandatory and, certainly in the near future, all U.S.-bound passengers should expect to be searched before boarding the aircraft,"" he said. -- CNN's Per Nyberg and Simon Hooper in London, England, and Richard Quest and Erin McLaughlin in Amsterdam, Netherlands, contributed to this report.","Police in London searching buildings in connection with Detroit plane incident .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN)  -- World leaders, many reeling from a year marked by global economic freefall and a growing threat from global warming and nuclear proliferation, exhorted one another Wednesday to work together to meet those challenges. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi addresses the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday. In his first remarks to the U.N. General Assembly, President Obama noted that he took office last January ""at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust."" He then sought to distance himself from the policies of his predecessor, noting that he had prohibited the use of torture, ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay to be closed and has been working to create a framework to combat terrorism ""within the rule of law."" Obama called on world leaders to work together to effect the change needed. ""No longer do we have the luxury of indulging our differences to the exclusion of the work that we must do together,"" he said. He vowed to pursue an agreement with Russia to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, to combat nuclear smuggling and theft and to support the non-proliferation treaty.  Watch President Obama speak to the United Nations » . He identified North Korea and Iran as countries whose governments ""threaten to take us down this dangerous slope"" and said he is committed to diplomacy in persuading them to live up to their obligations. Obama called for ""more progress"" in the Middle East. ""We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements,"" he said to applause. Obama left no doubt that he believes the danger posed by global warming is a real one. ""Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred. If we continue down our current course, every member of this assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders,"" he said. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also called for world unity in confronting crises -- such as climate change and food shortages -- but he expressed ire at the world body and the United States.  Watch Gadhafi's rant at the U.N. » . In a 96-minute, rambling address in his first appearance before the United Nations, Gadhafi broached conspiracy theories, urged probes into U.S. military activities and took aim at the structure and the actions of the Security Council itself. Dressed in a traditional Libyan cap and robe, he elaborated on what he said is the unfairness of the structure of the U.N. Security Council, which has five permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, each with veto power. ""Are we equal in permanent seats?"" Gadhafi asked. ""No, we're not equals."" He said the Security Council has provided not security, but ""terror and sanctions."" No one should accept the resolutions of the Security Council, he said, adding that the body should be called the ""terror council.""  Watch Gadhafi demand equality » . He also slammed U.S. military actions in places such as Panama, Vietnam and Grenada and called the invasion of Iraq ""the mother of all evils."" On the Middle East, he said the solution for Israelis and Palestinians ""is a democratic state without religious fanaticism"" and said people on both sides want to live in one state. Still, Gadhafi referred to Obama as ""my son,"" and congratulated him on his first U.N. General Assembly speech.  Watch demonstrators for and against Gadhafi » . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced he is ready to work with other nations. ""Our nation is prepared to warmly shake all those hands that are honestly extended to us,"" he told the assembly. ""We welcome real and human exchanges and stand ready to actively engage in fundamental global reforms."" He called for a ""return to monotheism and justice,"" calling it ""the greatest hope and opportunity in all ages and generations."" Ahmadinejad blamed the world economic crisis on capitalism, saying, ""It is no longer possible to inject thousands of billions of dollars of unreal wealth into the world economy simply by printing worthless paper."" He added, ""The engine of unbridled capitalism, with its unfair system of thought, has reached the end of the road and is unable to move."" He added that the time has passed for those people who outwardly espouse democracy and freedom yet who are simultaneously ""violating the very principles to which they aspire."" Ahmadinejad then cited the United States, one of several countries critical of his country's nuclear ambitions, despite Iran's insistence that its program is intended solely for peaceful purposes. He was critical of the situations in Gaza as well as in Iraq and Afghanistan, where ""thousands of innocent people have been killed, injured or displaced, infrastructures have been destroyed and regional security has been seriously jeopardized."" By this time, the U.S. and Israeli representatives had left their seats.  Watch representatives leave their seats » . Before his talk, and blocks away from the United Nations, more than 400 protesters toted anti-Ahmadinejad banners and demonstrated in front of the Iranian U.N. Mission. ""I am very angry,"" said Anna Amiri, an Iranian emigre who traveled from Dallas, Texas, to attend the rally. ""We voted for Moussavi to have a change,"" she said, referring to Mir Hossein Moussavi, Ahmadinejad's main opponent in the election. The results released by Iran said Ahmadinejad won by a wide margin, a conclusion that sparked street protests and violence.  Watch Iranian student tell Ahmadinejad ""Be afraid"" » . At the U.N., French President Nicolas Sarkozy referred to Iran's leaders in his address, saying, ""If they rely on a passive response from the international community in order to pursue their military nuclear program, they will be making a tragic mistake."" Addressing global warming and the economic crisis, Sarkozy said the world is on the threshold of an ecological disaster and called on its leaders to ""invent a new world where the follies of yesterday"" cannot be repeated. Sarkozy said the world has already waited too long for globalization to be regulated, global warming to be fought and nuclear proliferation to be curbed. He called for the Security Council to be expanded to include an African nation, a South American nation, India, Japan and Germany as permanent members. ""The legitimacy of the United Nations depends on this reform,"" he said. He further called for reform of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and urged that their mission be redefined in the wake of the world economic crisis. In his address, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown listed climate change, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, shared prosperity and the need to eradicate poverty as key issues that must be addressed. ""We must grasp this next set of challenges immediately,"" he said. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, noting that 2010 marks the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II, took aim at those who deny the Holocaust happened and called for ""firm and joint resistance to manifestations of neofascism."" He described Russia as prepared to ""follow the path of reductions of nuclear weapons."" In the annual session's opening address, U.N.

"(CNN) -- Abby Sunderland says the next goal awaiting her seems more dangerous and unfamiliar than sailing around the world: getting her driver's license. Sunderland, 16, answered questions about her rescue and on-land plans Tuesday in Los Angeles, at her first news conference since returning to the United States. Sunderland's quest to circumnavigate the globe was cut short when a large wave rolled and crippled her boat in the Southern Ocean near Australia. The rogue wave, which she said rolled her boat while she was down below, broke the ship's mast. A fishing vessel from Reunion Island rescued her. Despite falling short of her goal, she sailed a total of 12,000 nautical miles and became the youngest person to sail around Cape Horn at the tip of South America. While she wants to get back to sailing, she said she will wait a few years before trying to circumnavigate the world again. For now, she plans to finish high school and get back to normal life. Sunderland said she is happy to be home, disappointed that she didn't make it all the way around the world, but proud of what she did accomplish. It's really great to think that I may have inspired some people to go for their dreams"" she said. ""I mean, I'm living proof that things don't always work out the way you plan, but you can only plan so far on an adventure."" Asked her response to those who said she was too young to have embarked on her journey, she said, ""I've crossed two oceans, I've sailed around Cape Horn and Cape Argus -- the question of my age should have been over weeks if not months ago."" iReport: Sunderland speaks out . Sunderland's brother, Zac, family spokesman Lyle Mercer, and Jeff Casher, a technical advisor for her voyage, also spoke at the news conference. The young sailor's mother and father, Marianne and Laurence Sunderland, missed the news conference because Marianne was in labor, Mercer said. They plan to name the child Paul after the captain of the ship that rescued Abby Sunderland, Mercer said. Marianne and Laurence Sunderland have been criticized nationally for letting their child embark on a seemingly dangerous mission alone. In a statement read by Mercer, they said the ""intense personal criticism crossed the line of human decency,"" and that people don't realize how meticulously they planned the trip. ""Parenting isn't easy for any of us,"" they said in the statement. Abby Sunderland said she and her brother, who set the record as the youngest person to sail around the world alone at 17 last year, have grown closer because of their common experience of being isolated on the ocean. Zac Sunderland said at the news conference that he isn't bitter about his younger sister receiving more media attention for her adventure. While plans for a reality show fell through, Abby Sunderland wants to write about her trip for herself and will consider turning it into a book, she said.","Abby Sunderland answered questions at her first U.S. news conference Tuesday .

"Editor's note: Timothy P. O'Neill, a professor at The John Marshall Law School in Chicago, Illinois, has written and lectured widely on criminal law and criminal procedure. Among his articles was a 2007 piece for the Oklahoma Law Review: ""The Stepford Justices: The Need for Experiential Diversity on the Roberts Court."" He is a graduate of Harvard University and the University of Michigan Law School. Timothy P. O'Neill says there are striking similarities in the backgrounds of the Supreme Court justices. CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- With the retirement of Justice David Souter, President Obama has the opportunity to bring a special kind of diversity to the Supreme Court: the diversity of broad and varied governmental experience. It is certainly true that the court needs more racial and gender diversity. Yet the homogeneity of the work résumés of the current justices is unprecedented. The right nominee would help to correct this. Many commentators have noted that this is the first Supreme Court in American history in which every justice has come from exactly the same job: judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But there are other ""firsts"" that are equally disturbing. For the first time in American history, not a single justice has had any legislative experience. Not one has ever been elected to Congress, a state legislature or a city council. For the first time in American history, not a single justice has ever held -- or even run for -- any elective office at any level of government. (Although Souter once served as a state attorney general, that is an appointed office in New Hampshire.) For the first time in American history, eight of the nine justices attended one of only two law schools: Harvard or Yale. (Although Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg graduated from Columbia, she transferred from Harvard Law School.) Traditionally, the Supreme Court has been composed not only of former judges, but also lawyers who have come directly from serving as senators, governors, Cabinet members, heads of administrative agencies, and even from private practice. Yet it has been almost 30 years since a justice has been confirmed who was not then a federal appellate judge. What caused this change? Some point to the acrimony that surrounded the failed appointment of Robert Bork in 1987. Since that time, presidents of both parties have stressed the judicial competence -- not the ideology -- of their appointees. The implied promise is that the technical proficiency of an Ivy League-trained federal appellate judge somehow trumps issues of ideology. This, of course, is an illusion. The cases that come to the Supreme Court are there precisely because they fall between the cracks of established legal doctrine. There is no single ""Ivy League judge's answer"" to any issue pending before the Supreme Court. For example, take a look at the Supreme Court's 2006 term. The Court decided 72 cases. With all the justices coming from the federal appellate bench and eight of them having attended Harvard or Yale, did this help achieve consensus? On the contrary, the percentage of cases in which there was a unanimous decision was the second lowest in a decade. And 24 decisions -- fully one-third of the docket -- were decided by a 5-4 vote, the highest percentage of 5-4 decisions in over a decade. The best example of how there is no single ""judge's answer"" to Supreme Court issues can be found in the eight death penalty cases decided during the 2006 term. The cases had a variety of issues, including questions concerning the selection of jurors, the giving of jury instructions and competence of defense counsel. Yet every single case was decided 5-4. In every single case, Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts held for the prosecution. In every single case, Justices John Paul Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer held for the defense. Every case was decided by Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote: four times for the prosecution and four times for the defense. Looking for a single ""judge's answer"" to an issue before the Supreme Court is usually futile. In order to decide the great legal issues before the court, a justice needs to bring more than mere legal competence; a justice also needs to bring real-world experience, values and intuition. That is why it is self-defeating to restrict the range of possible Supreme Court nominees to the small group of sitting federal appellate judges. Supreme Court decision-making would be richer if it included people who had actually written legislation or had run federal agencies or had governed states. As Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy recently said, there is a need to select Supreme Court nominees ""from outside the judicial monastery."" We should welcome, and not irrationally restrict, the variety of experience that can be brought to Supreme Court decision-making. Professor Lee Epstein of Northwestern has observed that ""Diversity of inputs makes for stronger outputs."" Obama should cast the widest possible net to find a person who can bring a fresh set of experiences and perspectives to the work of the Supreme Court. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy P. O'Neill.","Timothy P. O'Neill: No judge on Supreme Court now has legislative background .
He says none of the nine have held, or even run for, elective office .
O'Neill: All but one attended Harvard or Yale Law School .
He says court would perform better if its membership had broader backgrounds ."
"(CNN) -- Word that President Obama might pile comprehensive immigration reform onto his already-full plate reignited calls from some for an urgent overhaul and brought cries from others that the timing couldn't be worse. New citizens take the oath of citizenship during ceremonies in Montebello, California, on Thursday. ""It's more important than ever to address immigration reform right now,"" said Ian Haney Lopez, a professor of law at the University of California-Berkeley. The financial and cultural dynamics of the economy make reform so urgent, he said. ""I worry that in the context of an economic downturn, the cultural response of that economic downturn will be to search for someone to blame, and that someone usually turns out to be a foreigner or someone perceived as foreigner,"" he said. As a financial dynamic, he said, the economy also calls for immigration reform: ""It's a mistake to understand immigrants as a drain on the economy. Immigrants in fact are the engine of development in this country and always have been,"" he said.  Watch: Is the push for immigration reform real? » . But Carol Swain, a professor of law and political science at Vanderbilt University and author of ""Debating Immigration,"" has little hope that Obama will be the president to reform the system. ""I think the timing could not be worse. I don't understand the timing behind even raising the issue right now with the economy being as poor as it is,"" said Swain, who has identified with Democrats and independents but recently switched to the Republican Party. ""There's just so many Americans of all groups that are unemployed or their future is so uncertain,"" she said. ""It's not a good time to be talking about allowing people who are holding jobs and not entitled to to remain in the country, and continue holding those jobs."" There are roughly 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States. Obama has supported a combination of enforcing laws and opening up the system. He wants to see a pass for citizenship that would mean having an illegal immigrant pay a fine, learn English and then get in line for citizenship. Critics refer to that ""path to citizenship"" as amnesty. Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said the United States has a de facto amnesty situation now, because laws against hiring illegal immigrants aren't enforced. ""If you did enforce it, it would open up many new job openings for American workers who are currently unemployed and need those jobs,"" he said. Legalizing workers and granting amnesty, he said, ""is a massive bailout for illegal immigration. It's a pillaging expedition on the American taxpayer.""  Watch arguments for and against immigration push » . But Haney Lopez argues that the populist outrage about immigration is ""based on a myth."" ""And the myth is that these are people who are sneaking across the border but otherwise have no contact with the country and whom the country otherwise rejects. That they're wholly unwelcome. And that's just not reality,"" he said. The United States and Mexico -- as well as other parts of Latin America and Asia -- have had a pattern of circular migration for more than a century, he said. ""We are a country of immigrants, and immigrants have always been essential to who we are culturally and socially. So it's simply a mistake to see these people as somehow interlopers,"" he said. He sees amnesty as a solution, since undocumented workers are coming to the United States because of the demand. If immigrants were given amnesty and the opportunity to work for minimum wage, Americans wouldn't see themselves as in competition with the undocumented workers, he said. ""The way to reduce the attractiveness of immigrant labor is to legalize immigrant labor,"" he said. The White House downplayed reports Thursday that the Obama administration would push for reform as early as next month, clarifying that while the issue is a priority, the economy comes first. One senior administration official cautioned that immigration will not be on the same track as other key initiatives, like health care and energy, and nobody's promising legislation or a vote this year.  Watch more on Obama's plan to tackle immigration reform » . As a candidate, Obama promised immigration issues would be a priority in his first year. He won 67 percent of the Latino vote. Fierce critics of his plan say that's exactly what this is about. ""There's no way the American people are going to understand a move, a big move for an immigration amnesty now as anything other than a naked party power grab of putting party interest above public interest,"" said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Swain, the Vanderbilt professor, said immigration reform is something that must be done, ""but it needs to be done in the right way."" Involving special interest groups in designing the policy, she said, ""would be disastrous."" She said the only way to truly reform immigration is by having an independent body develop a package for Congress to vote on. Haney Lopez said that denying a route to legalization is ""antithetical to American values,"" and by doing so, ""we are creating a permanent caste system."" ""That's very dangerous for a country like the United States founded on principles of equality and participatory democracy,"" he said. CNN's Candy Crowley contributed to this report.","""It's more important than ever to address immigration reform,"" one professor says .

"Crawfordville, Florida (CNN) -- When Chris Beatty got word about the oil spill in the Gulf, like many Floridians, she wanted to help -- but she wanted to help in a very specific way. Beatty runs an organization called the Florida Wild Mammal Association (FWMA) in Crawfordville, Florida.  The organization houses injured and sick wildlife and nurses them back to health so that they can be released back into the wild. Working very closely with animals, she realized that the region's wildlife could be in serious danger because of the oil spill disaster. The FWMA takes in over a thousand animals a year -- possums, raccoons, deer and birds. Seeing images of oiled birds and wildlife splashed across the news channels, Beatty wanted to be ready in case they were called upon to take in these animals. After recognizing that people in her community were feeling the same way, Beatty and the FWMA organized a volunteer day and opened their doors to locals who wanted to help out. In just that one day they received roughly $19,000 in cash, supplies and free labor, including $5,400 in donations and $13,600 in labor and supplies. Beatty believes that her community wanted to help because the wildlife is so much a part of what the state is all about. ""The whole panhandle is a rural area,"" Beatty said.

"(CNN) -- A new study finds that 54 percent of teens talk about behaviors such as sex, alcohol use, and violence on the social networking giant MySpace -- presenting potential risks even if all they're doing is talking, researchers said Monday. Do you know what your teen has posted on social networking Web sites? The study looked at MySpace profiles of 500 people who identified themselves as 18-year-old males and females in the United States. References to risky behaviors included both words and photos, the authors said. Not all teens who write about risky behaviors in their profiles actually engage in them in real life, said Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, one of the authors of the study, which appears in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. They may instead talk about sex, substance use, or violence because they are contemplating doing those things, or because they want to brag without actually doing what they say, Moreno said. Even if teens have not actually engaged in risky behaviors but merely brag about them online, this can still affect their future behavior, said study co-author Dr. Dimitri Christakis, professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Hospital. Those who lie about the behaviors to show off may receive positive feedback from others -- comments such as ""that's great"" or ""I do the same thing"" -- that encourage them to actually try out the behaviors, he said. Apart from that, teens who claim such behaviors are more likely to be victims of bullying and unwanted invitations for sex, he said. In a second study, Moreno and colleagues identified 190 profiles of 18- to 20-year-olds that contained three or more references to sexual behaviors or substance abuse. The authors then made a profile of their own, called ""Dr. Meg,"" from which they sent a single e-mail to half these profiles, warning them about the risky information and offering information about clinical resources. They found that, after three months, 42.1 percent of the profile owners who received the e-mail -- and 29.5 percent of those who did not -- either removed references to risky behaviors or made their profiles private. ""It's really not that MySpace is bad or good. I think the lesson is that it's a tool, and how you use it determines the kinds of outcome you're going to get,"" Moreno said. Experts say the bottom line is that parents should get more involved in the online lives of their children. ""I tell parents that they should absolutely create their own MySpace and Facebook page,"" Christakis said. The study inspired him to create his own Facebook account, and his 10-year-old already wants to know about his ""friends,"" he said. In some cases, parents should even have their children's passwords for these social networking sites, especially when the children are around age 13 or 14, said Vivian Friedman, child-adolescent psychologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Friedman was not involved with the study, but she is well aware of the problem. One of Friedman's patients, the daughter of a preacher, posted nude photographs of herself online, a move that cost her father his job, Friedman said. But she said 54 percent as a figure for profiles with risky behaviors seems too high, given that most of what happens on social networking sites is ""chit-chat."" ""I have parents that catch their kids bragging about something on MySpace, and when you actually confront them, the kid says 'I really wasn't doing it,' and they can prove they were not at the party where they were supposed to have been drinking,"" she said. Beyond keeping a watchful eye on risky interests and pictures, parents should also use social networking sites such as MySpace -- which had about 120 million users as of this summer -- as an opportunity to learn about their childrens' favorite movies and hobbies, as well as their top friends, she said. ""You so often hear parents say 'I don't even know my kid anymore.' Here's a very easy tool to get to know your kid again,"" she said. , .","Study: 54 percent of MySpace profiles of 18-year-olds mentioned risky behaviors .

"South Padre Island, Texas (CNN) -- Hurricane Alex made landfall along the northeastern coast of Mexico Wednesday night as a Category 2 storm with 105 mph winds, the National Hurricane Center reported. As the storm lashed a sparsely populated area about 110 miles south of the Texas border, Gulf Coast residents hunkered down in shelters.  Maximum sustained winds were 100 mph as Alex moved to the west at 10 mph. At least 1,000 people in southern Texas were taking shelter in evacuation centers as Alex's winds and heavy rain squalls bore down on the coastline, officials in Cameron and Hidalgo counties reported. Brownsville, Texas, appeared to be taking the brunt of Alex's outer bands after as many as six tornadoes were reported in the area, officials said. Sgt. Jimmy Manrrique, spokesman for the Brownsville Police Department, said the city was receiving ""an intense amount of rain"" and flood waters were reported to be as high as 2 feet in some areas. In Harlingen, just 30 miles north of Brownsville, wind gusts of up to 65 mph were reported hours before the storm's expected landfall. No injuries were immediately reported from the twisters near Brownsville, but some damage was reported, including downed trees and power lines, weather and emergency management officials said. Carol Rumsey was riding the storm out in her Los Fresnos, Texas, home, not far from Brownsville and about a half hour from the coast. She told CNN Radio on Wednesday night that her house had an eerie feel as the storm approached. ""You board up your windows and it's like living in a dungeon,"" she said. ""You can't hear anything, you can't see anything."" She said she had considered evacuating as the region was being pummeled by heavy rain and occasional gusts of wind, but said ""this is the price you pay for living in paradise."" Meanwhile, authorities in South Padre Island closed the Queen Isabella Memorial Bridge -- which crosses to the popular vacation spot -- as a precaution ahead of the approaching Alex. At 10 p.m. CT (11 p.m. ET), the storm's maximum sustained winds were 100 mph as it headed west at 10 mph, the National Hurricane Center reported. Forecasters said the storm was expected to continue in that direction and move farther inland over northeastern Mexico Thursday. Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 205 miles from the center of the storm and hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles, according to the hurricane center. Heavy rain and thunderstorms associated with the outer bands of Alex were affecting the entire Gulf Coast from Texas to Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Brownsville received more than 4 inches of rain by Wednesday afternoon, the weather service said. Harlingen Assistant Fire Chief Cirilo Rodriguez said his region was expecting 7-10 inches of rain. Coastal flood advisories have been issued for Louisiana and Mississippi. Minor coastal flooding is expected along the shore due to a prolonged strong southeasterly wind caused by the large counterclockwise circulation of the hurricane. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday that the state is prepared for the storm. The State Operations Center is fully activated, he said, and Texas continues to work with federal and local authorities to track the hurricane and the BP Gulf oil disaster. ""As Hurricane Alex grows in strength and approaches landfall, Texas is ready to handle this storm and its impact,"" Perry said in a written statement ahead of the storm. ""My message to South Texans is to finish your preparations, stay connected to credible information sources and heed the warnings of your local officials, who are closely integrated with the state's emergency management effort that has been mobilized to prepare for Alex's impact."" President Barack Obama issued a federal emergency declaration for Texas ahead of Alex's expected arrival, the White House said Tuesday night. After the hurricane made landfall around 9 p.m. CT (10 p.m. ET), forecasters from the National Hurricane Center changed the hurricane warning to a tropical storm warning for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A tropical storm warning issued earlier remained in place along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Port O'Connor. A hurricane warning was in place for the coast of Mexico from the mouth of the Rio Grande to La Cruza, Mexico. The storm continued to move away from the massive BP oil catastrophe near the Louisiana coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico, but it already was complicating cleanup efforts. The storm created 12-foot waves Tuesday and oil-skimming ships were sent to shore from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. The rough seas may force crews to replace and reorganize booms meant to deter the oil from reaching shore, reported CNN's Ed Lavandera. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist said that even though Florida may dodge any problems with this storm, the Atlantic hurricane season is just beginning. ""In Florida, we've had a lot of hurricanes a number of years ago, but we handled them very well,"" he told CNN's Campbell Brown. ""The difference and the distinction that we face now is that we have a Gulf of Mexico that's full of oil. So our hope and our prayer is that we don't have a mixture of hurricanes with oil that could potentially damage the beautiful beaches of Florida. But if we do, we're prepared for it."" Pat Ahumada, the mayor of Brownsville, said the city was expecting to distribute 60,000 sandbags and provide shelter for roughly 2,000 families.  Utility crews were on standby to handle outages.  At the same time, the state government provided 90 buses in case an evacuation is needed. ""I expect about 10 percent of residents to evacuate voluntarily, which already started yesterday,"" Ahumada said Tuesday.  ""I see a steady flow of people going out, but no bottlenecks -- which is good. ""We're not taking it lightly,"" he said.  ""We're ready for a worst-case scenario.""

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Fifteen Africans died while trying to reach Spain's southern coast in a small, overcrowded boat, Spanish officials told CNN on Thursday. Thousands of African migrants risk their lives trying to reach mainland Europe in small, overcrowded boats. Rescue teams located the craft late Wednesday off the coast of Almeria province and helped it ashore. Aboard were 33 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa and a dead woman. They told authorities that 14 others, including nine young children, had died en route and were dropped overboard, officials told CNN. The survivors included men, women and a months-old baby.It was the second incident in a week involving African migrants. Authorities said a ship overturned off the coast of Motril, killing 14 people -- 23 others were rescued. Spain is the preferred route to Europe for many Africans. Hopeful immigrants typically pay hundreds of dollars to illegal smugglers for a seat on a small boat. The number of attempted crossings usually increases during the summer months when the seas are calmer, Paco Gil, government spokesman in Seville told CNN. The Ministry of Interior said illegal crossings by boat from Africa declined 54 percent in 2007, from a year earlier. A total of 18,000 people were tallied. The decline is due to increased sea patrols off West Africa, along with increased repatriations, officials said. More than 56,000 illegal immigrants were returned to their native countries last year -- a six percent increase compared with 2006. Officials hope the large number of repatriated immigrants will send a message that the costly and perilous crossing could result in nothing more than a trip back home. Immigrants from Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa make up 10 percent of Spain's population of 45 million. Morocco and Romania are the leading sources, with more than 500,000 immigrants from each nation. Ecuador has sent more than 400,000. The total number of immigrants to Spain from sub-Saharan African countries is far less, but their plight on the boats has sparked a great deal of media attention.","Craft found with 33 people from sub-Saharan Africa and a dead woman .

"(CNN) -- A woman jumped a barrier at the start of Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica and knocked down the pope, briefly disrupting ceremonies. Screams erupted from onlooking worshippers when the woman ran toward Pope Benedict XVI and grabbed onto his vestments as he walked down the main aisle of the church, video footage showed. He was quickly helped to his feet by his aides -- prompting cheers from the crowd -- and the service was resumed, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told CNN. The woman was removed by Vatican guards, Lombardi said. John Allen, senior Vatican analyst for CNN, said such security breaches aren't uncommon. ""As compared to say, the president of the United States, the security membrane around the pope is pretty thin and fairly permeable,"" he said, citing similar past incidents, including one that happened last Christmas Eve. Allen said that generally, these disruptions are caused by people who aren't seeking real harm, but who want to be close to the pope. Benedict began what has traditionally been a midnight Mass at the Vatican at 10 p.m. as officials sought to keep the 82-year-old pontiff from a late night. Celebrants in Bethlehem, the traditional birthplace of Jesus in the West Bank, however, joined the Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal for a midnight Mass attended by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and other Palestinian officials. Outside the Church of the Nativity, erected over the site Christian tradition says was the place of Jesus' birth, the faithful gathered under the watchful eyes of heavily armed Palestinian police. But Palestinian shopkeeper Nadia Hazboun said the security situation in the West Bank has improved in the time since the militant Hamas group took over Gaza and Abbas' Fatah movement abandoned the narrow strip of land between Israel and the Mediterranean for the West Bank. ""It was bad, now it is good,"" he told Voice of America radio. ""I told you, before anybody take the law in his [own] hands. But now the law [is] with the police. We have security, we have calm, we have now the best situation in Bethlehem.""Were you there? Share pictures, video . Christmas Eve in Bethlehem is a popular destination for American Christians, including Iowan Paul Edelman. ""Just the festivities, the idea that this is the birthplace of Christ, and you get to see all the historic places and share it with people from around the world; it's a very nice experience,"" he told Voice of America radio.","Woman tried to reach pope at start of midnight Mass .

"(CNN) -- Target Corp. this month will open 27 new stores employing a total of more than 4,300 people, the company said. One of Target's two new Hawaii stores awaits its Sunday grand opening. The stores' openings will come just weeks after the retailer cut 600 people from its headquarters staff amid what it called weaker-than-expected sales. The retailer will hold grand openings for the 21 general merchandise stores and six full-grocery SuperTarget stores on Sunday. The new sites include the company's first two stores in Hawaii. Each general merchandise store employs 150 to 250 people, and each SuperTarget has 200 to 300 workers, the company said. In late January, Minnesota-based Target cut its headquarters staff by 9 percent and eliminated 400 open positions. The company, citing difficult economic conditions and sales that didn't meet expectations, also said it would soon close an Arkansas distribution center that employs 500 people and would cut back on planned new-store openings. ""We are clearly operating in an unprecedented economic environment that requires us to make some extremely difficult decisions to ensure Target remains competitive over the long term,"" Gregg Steinhafel, Target president and CEO, said in a news release that month. Retailers in the United States took a hit last year as a weak economy weighed on consumer spending. Retail sales fell six straight months until January, when sales rose 1 percent, according to the Commerce Department. However, retail experts said they were skeptical a rebound had taken hold. Still, two other retailers also announced plans to expand. Kohl's announced last month that it intends to open 55 stores in 2009, and Dollar General in February said it is looking to open more than 400 stores. Target reported its fourth-quarter net earnings were 40.7 percent lower than the same quarter a year earlier. Same-store sales in January were 3.3 percent lower than a year earlier. December same-store sales fell 4.1 percent. Target's new general merchandise stores are in Rogers, Arkansas; Santa Clarita, California; Pensacola, Florida; Bethlehem, Georgia; Honolulu and Kapolei, Hawaii; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Las Vegas, Nevada; Paramus, New Jersey; Cincinnati, Lebanon and Reynoldsburg, Ohio; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; Philadelphia and Exton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Houston, San Antonio and San Marcos, Texas; Midlothian, Virginia; and Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. The new SuperTarget stores are in Kissimmee, Florida; Canton, Georgia; Hillside, Illinois; and Pflugerville, Allen and Lewisville, Texas. The new locations will increase the number of Target stores to 1,699, the company said. CNNMoney.com's Parija B. Kavilanz contributed to this report.","Retailer's new stores to open in 16 states .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio man says he is seeking a jury trial on a charge of driving under the influence that was slapped on him after he crashed the vehicle he was piloting -- a barstool. The barstool was welded to a small metal frame attached to a five-horsepower lawnmower engine. ""It was just an accident. I mean a little minor accident,"" Kile Wygle, 28, explained in an interview this week with CNN affiliate WSYX. His homemade vehicle was made from a barstool welded to a small metal frame attached to a five-horsepower lawnmower engine, four wheels and a lawnmower steering wheel, according to the Newark, Ohio, police accident report. Officers responding to a report of a crash with injuries March 4 said they found Wygle nursing his injuries and highly intoxicated. According to the police report, when asked how much he had had to drink, Wygle responded, ""a lot."" He crashed during his attempt at a U-turn while speeding down the street in front of his home -- a daring move from atop the specialized barstool even for the most nimble and sober of men. Measuring 6-foot-1 and 230 pounds, and after having consumed what he later told an officer was 15 beers, Wygle appeared to be neither. He was treated at a hospital for minor injuries. According to the police report, Wygle claims his unique vehicle can reach a speed of 38 miles per hour, though at the time of the crash he was going around 20. He entered a plea of not guilty.","Kile Wygle: ""It was just an accident. I mean a little minor accident""

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Spain commemorated victims of the March 11, 2004 Madrid train bombings with somber ceremonies on Tuesday at three stations in the capital where 191 people died in the Islamic terrorist attacks. A bouquet of flowers for a victim of the 2004 bombings is attached to railings near Atocha station. King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero attended the main ceremony at Atocha station, where most of the casualties came when bombs exploded on one train inside the station and a second on the tracks just outside. Some of the survivors of the attack, which left 1,800 people wounded, gathered with the king and prime minister at the train bombing monument -- a circular glass structure in front of the station that was inaugurated on the third anniversary of the attacks. There were no speeches, just the placement of a floral wreath and the performance of ""Da pacen domine,"" a song for peace, by an orchestral and choir ensemble. Other smaller memorials were held at the Santa Eugenia and Pozo stations down the line from Atocha, where the other two trains were torn apart by explosions four years ago. ""This year it was especially delicate to reach the anniversary,"" Pilar Manjon, who lost a son in the bombings and is president of the March 11 Victims Association, told Spanish radio network SER. ""Everything has been stirred up again. There were elections again."" Zapatero  won an upset victory in 2004 three days after the bombings, and was re-elected last Sunday. A Spanish court last October convicted 21 people in connection with the attacks. Seventeen of those were Islamic terrorists and four were Spaniards who were sentenced for supplying explosives stolen from a Spanish mining operation that ended up being used in the attacks. Seven people were acquitted. Various appeals to that sentence are still pending before Spain's Supreme Court, which is expected to rule on the cases later this year. A few other suspects thought to be linked to the bombings could yet face trial, including two in Morocco and another in Spain. Authorities say Spain remains under constant threat from Islamic terrorism. Al Qaeda reports regularly mention Spain -- among other countries -- as a target, and more than 300 suspected Islamic extremists have been arrested in the country since the bombings. Besides the train bombing trial, a separate trial concluded last month with the convictions of 20 men, mainly Algerians and Moroccans, for Islamic terrorist activity in Spain. In another case, a judge held in prison for investigation 10 men, mainly Pakistanis, who were arrested last January in Barcelona on suspicion of planning al-Qaeda style attacks in Spain, Germany, France, Britain and Portugal.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Mercedes Gorden remembers August 1, 2007, like it was yesterday. Mercedes Gorden was driving home from work on the Interstate 35 West bridge when it suddenly collapsed. ""I remember everything. I remember it being sunny and hot. I had my window down,"" Gorden said. ""The next thing I knew, the concrete started to wave in front of me."" It was a normal day. Or so she thought. She was driving home from work on the Interstate 35 West bridge that spans the Mississippi River when it started to buckle and collapse during the evening rush-hour traffic. ""The bridge pulled apart in front of me ... and I went sliding,"" Gorden said. Without warning, cars careened into the Mississippi River below and Gorden's Ford Escort plummeted about 60 feet down into the river bank. ""I said I will not die on that bridge. I am not going to die today,"" Gorden, 31, said. ""This is not the way I am going to go."" She was trapped for more than an hour and rescue workers had to cut her out of the car. All of the bones in her legs were shattered and her spine was fractured. Nine surgeries and countless hours of physical therapy later, she knows it could have been worse. Thirteen people died that day and 100 others were injured. One year after the tragedy, many Minnesotans and commuters around the country wonder if their bridges and highways are safe.  Watch: Are U.S. roads and bridges safe? » . The answer is: Maybe. Across the United States, there are about 600,000 bridges. The Federal Highway Administration reported in 2006 that one quarter of the nation's bridges were at risk. The American Society for Civil Engineers said in 2006 that it would cost nearly $10 billion every year for the next two decades to fix them. But the funds used to repair and maintain the country's bridges and highways are drying up. Some of the money comes from the Highway Trust Fund, which Americans pay for through taxes on gasoline. Faced with higher gas prices, more commuters are carpooling, taking mass transit or driving less, about 4 percent less in May alone compared with a year ago.  Interactive: Check troubled bridges in your state » . The federal Department of Transportation predicted taxes will fall far short of what's needed for improvement projects -- leaving many projects delayed or even canceled. Ryan Toohey, a lead strategist with America Moving Forward, a group that lobbies for private investment to fix the nation's infrastructure problems, said nearly every state is facing a budget crisis and doesn't have the money to solve problems. ""When I hear that many states have close to a majority of their bridges deemed obsolete or structurally deficient, that scares me and I think that finding ways to help remedy those problems that simultaneously relieve states of the burden financially is very, very important and should be a welcome trend in the United States,"" Toohey said. The Bush administration projected that at some point in the next fiscal year, after October 1, 2008, the highway account will hit zero, down from $8 billion at the start of the fiscal year. Payments for repairs can't be made if the money isn't there. U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said, ""Without a doubt, our federal approach to transportation is broken"" and ""it is time for a new, a different and a better approach."" Peters said one short-term solution may be for the Highway Trust Fund to borrow from the Mass Transit Fund. But she said it wouldn't be easy to get congressional approval. The House has passed a resolution to inject $8 billion into the Trust Fund, but even if the Senate passed it, President Bush has threatened to veto the measure. Some states, such as Minnesota, are trying to get creative in raising money for road projects. ""We are looking at mileage-based revenue structures where people could be taxed based on the miles they travel. We are looking at private sector investments,"" said Minnesota's Transportation Commissioner Tom Sorel. The Minnesota legislature has passed a package of tax increases to raise $6.6 billion to improve the states' roads and bridges. Even after the Minneapolis bridge collapse, not all the bridges in the state are structurally safe. In fact, on July 26, chunks of concrete weighing about 1,200 pounds fell from an overpass in St. Paul, just a few miles from the Minneapolis scene. CNN has learned that bridge was rated ""structurally deficient"" 23 years ago, in 1985, and the Minnesota Department of Transportation confirmed it was rated ""structurally deficient"" again in 2007, just days after the Minneapolis bridge collapsed. Still, the state said it was safe to drive on. Nobody was hurt in the St. Paul bridge incident, but critics like Rep. Jim Oberstar, a Democrat from Minnesota, are demanding action. ""You would have thought the state learned its lesson and done a better job of inspecting the bridges and overpasses, yet this was one they failed to accurately assess ... It was like a meteor falling to the ground,"" said Oberstar, who is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Sorel said bridges now are supposed to be shut immediately if there is any risk. His department has inspected 1 in 5 of the more than 20,000 bridges across the state and closed at least six. The state also said it has spent $390 million on repairing and replacing its bridges since 2003. Is that enough? Not for victims like Gorden, who drives by the site of the collapse every week on her way to physical therapy. She wonders how sales taxes can be found to subsidize a new baseball stadium in Minneapolis -- but not for bridges. ""I say how did we get money for stadiums? How did we get money for all these new stadiums we're building?"" Gorden said. ""What's more important: baseball or safe traveling? Should we all be afraid every time we cross a bridge now?""","Mercedes Gorden was driving across the I-35W bridge when it collapsed in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Ever since a devastating earthquake struck Haiti on January 12 followed by others in Chile, Baja California and Indonesia, many people have asked the question, ""Are earthquakes getting worse?"" The answer is a firm and unequivocal ""No."" I know it's hard to believe given the devastation these earthquakes have caused and the intense level of media attention they have received. However, it turns out that large earthquake frequency has not changed at all over the last 20 years. But don't take my word for it. Go to the United States Geological Survey website and see for yourself. As of April 25, 2010 is on pace to have approximately 18 earthquakes larger than a magnitude 7 on the Richter Scale. That sure sounds like a lot, but it's only one more than last year and very close to the 15.4 large earthquakes per year that Earth has averaged over the last 20 years. Of course, some years are more active than others, but that is to be expected. In fact, in 1995 there were 20 of these large earthquakes, but nobody talks about that year as being particularly lively. The fact that several of this year's large earthquakes occurred near populated areas only adds to the perception that the overall frequency or intensity of earthquakes has increased. Before the earthquake in Haiti, there hadn't been an earthquake of that size in over two months. This ebb and flow of earthquakes is completely natural. And what about volcanic eruptions? USGS records show they have also remained constant since the 1960s, with between 50 and 70 eruptions each year. Over the last few days, another misconception began to emerge when CNN published an opinion article by author Alan Weisman titled ""Is the Earth striking back?"" The piece outlined a theory that, as glaciers melt due to global warming, the Earth's crust will begin to stretch and rebound. It goes on to imply that this stretching could cause not only earthquakes, such as in Haiti and Chile, but also volcanic eruptions. The article even suggests this process is responsible for the recent eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland with its neighbor, Katla. ""threatening to detonate next."" Do these studies exist? Yes. Is this really what they say? No. First, some background. The source of this idea is a series of papers published by the Royal Society in England that looked at the potential effect of climate change on some types of natural disasters. This idea is generally based on the well-known phenomenon that, as Earth's glaciers continue to melt, the crust rebounds as it is relieved of the burden. In fact, this has been happening for thousands of years since the peak of the last ice age. Several of these papers did propose that climate change could affect certain types of earthquakes on the ocean floor or underneath melting glaciers, however, Haiti is neither on the bottom of the ocean nor under a glacier. As for the Chilean quake, it was caused by the incredible amount of pressure generated as two tectonic plates are forced together. The point is that not all earthquakes are caused by the same forces and earthquakes on the ocean floor or under glaciers could not be more different from earthquakes in Haiti or Chile. It's like saying cigarettes cause lung cancer, therefore they cause skin cancer as well. The bottom line is that Weisman's claims that earthquake frequency is increasing and that earthquakes in Haiti and Chile are caused by global warming are unsupported by the scientific articles he uses to form his conclusions. The effect of his article is to take several well-meaning, preliminary, cautious and limited scientific studies and create unnecessary fear and confusion in the general public. If the public concludes that earthquake frequency has increased, it will be wrong. If it concludes that volcano eruption frequency or intensity has increased, it will be wrong. If it believes that earthquakes in Haiti or Chile were caused by global warming, it will not only be wrong, but it will believe it because it was told it was the conclusion of geologists. It wasn't. Most scientific papers do not lend themselves to sound bites or headlines. That means the media needs to do a much better job understanding them. For their part, scientists need to be willing to confront these errors before they spread. Whatever effect climate change has on our planet in the future, inaccurate reporting of research leaves the public at a huge disadvantage and cannot be tolerated. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ian Saginor.","Ian Saginor says many people have asked if there's an increase in earthquakes .
He says quakes, volcanoes are occurring at average level .

"(CNN) -- As Gulf Coast residents wait for a huge oil slick to reach their shores, the spill and the massive response already have begun wreaking havoc on livelihoods in a region where jobs are largely dependent on two ocean intensive industries: seafood and tourism. Stephen Denmark, a city council member in Dauphin Island, Alabama, said Saturday that local scientists are predicting that the seafood crop could take a decade to recover from the oil slick. ""The last two years have been tough already,"" Denmark said, referring to the recession. ""This will be catastrophic to the mom-and-pop businesses, which is 90 percent of the business down here on the island."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Saturday that heavy oil is likely to begin hitting the state's coast by Sunday or Monday. U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen -- the Obama administration's national incident commander for the slick -- said Saturday that oil also is likely to reach shorelines in Mississippi and Alabama in coming days. But some Gulf Coast oyster beds and other seafood harvesting grounds are already awash in oil, according to Casi Callaway, executive director of the Alabama-based environmental group Mobile Baykeeper. ""It's already covering shrimp beds and shrimp grounds in the Gulf,"" she said. ""So it's here and it's now and it's happening."" Callaway said that the oil could ruin oyster beds for up to two decades. Forty percent of the fish harvested in the lower 48 states comes from the Gulf of Mexico. Vacationers, meanwhile, spend billions of dollars every year in the region. But this week, many Americans canceled plans to travel to the Gulf Coast over the summer. ""I'm pretty much on pause right now ... it's just a big waiting game,"" said David Boola, a fisherman who leads boat trips out of Venice, Louisiana. ""I'm extremely worried because I have customers that [have] already canceled trips,"" Boola said Saturday. ""I should be out taking people fishing today and I'm not. I'm not making money today. Or tomorrow. I'm worried about the 'now' factor, you know?"" Besides the oil, the deployment of hundreds of thousands of feet of floating booms along the Gulf Coast to protect sensitive land areas has kept many fishing boats tied up at the dock. In Florida's Panhandle, where Saturday was the deadline for tourists to cancel summer plans at many hotels, phones were ringing off the hook.

"(CNN)  -- The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld an incontestable verdict on the conduct of the major cigarette companies over four decades: They are racketeers who carried out a conspiracy to deceive the public and target children with their deadly and addictive products. The court on Monday declined to accept appeals from either side in the massive case that began when the Department of Justice filed suit against the tobacco companies in 1999. Although the Obama administration and public health groups failed to persuade the justices to reconsider earlier rulings that limited the financial penalties and remedial measures the trial court ordered, the Supreme Court left intact the trial court's damning judgment: The tobacco industry has illegally profited from selling products that cause disease and death. The Supreme Court's decision puts the responsibility squarely on elected officials to eliminate the tobacco industry's harmful influence and take effective action to protect the nation's health. Congress and the Obama administration should fund a national public education and stop-smoking campaign, and the Food and Drug Administration must effectively exercise its new authority to regulate tobacco products. State officials must redouble efforts to implement proven tobacco-control measures, including higher tobacco taxes, comprehensive smoke-free workplace laws and well-funded prevention programs. The case stemmed from U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler's landmark 2006 decision that found the cigarette makers guilty of violating civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Kessler found that they had acted illegally when they ""lied, misrepresented and deceived the American public, including smokers and the young people they avidly sought as 'replacement' smokers, about the devastating health effects of smoking and environmental tobacco smoke."" The companies, Kessler concluded, ""have marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted."" In short, they perpetrated the deadliest consumer fraud in history. And, Kessler found, they continue their deceptions to this day. The tobacco industry spends nearly $13 billion annually -- $35 million every single day -- to market its deadly and addictive products, often in ways that appeal to kids. As smoking rates have declined and restrictions on smoking have multiplied, the industry has introduced new smokeless tobacco products and significantly increased marketing for them. Some of these products look like candy, are flavored like candy and have colorful packaging like candy. They are easily concealed in settings such as classrooms. Even as the FDA begins to exercise its new authority over tobacco products, the industry concocts new schemes to thwart the regulations. Tobacco companies have sought to evade the new ban on deceptive ""light"" and ""low-tar"" labels by introducing lighter-colored packaging for light brands and switching to terms such as ""gold"" and ""silver"" to replace ""light"" and ""ultra-light."" The color-coded packs seek to perpetuate the falsehood that some cigarette brands are less harmful than others. Each time state and local governments consider smoke-free workplace laws, the tobacco industry recycles baseless arguments against these measures, which are proved to protect health. Every time states consider raising tobacco taxes -- a proven way to reduce smoking, especially among teenagers -- the industry seeks to manipulate public opinion with bogus claims and calculated alliances with less controversial political groups. For example, in Georgia this year, Philip Morris promoted a rally that ostensibly was organized by anti-tax organizations. Big Tobacco's role was exposed when the Atlanta Journal-Constitution discovered this fine print at the bottom of a rally invitation: ""Paid for by Altria Client Services on behalf of Philip Morris USA."" These continuing actions make it urgent for the trial court to impose the remedies first ordered in 2006. They include requiring the tobacco companies to make corrective statements about the health risks of smoking and secondhand smoke and their deceptive practices. These statements must appear in newspaper and television advertising, on the companies' Web sites and on cigarette packaging. The trial court also ordered the tobacco companies to report marketing data annually to the government, demanded public disclosure of more internal documents and prohibited the companies from committing acts of racketeering or making false, misleading or deceptive statements about cigarettes and their health risks. Tobacco use is the nation's leading cause of preventable death, claiming more than 400,000 lives and costing $96 billion in health-care expenditures each year. Elected leaders can no longer stand idly by while the tobacco companies continue to engage in unlawful activity and harm public health.

"Washington (CNN) -- The arrests of 11 people accused of being part of an espionage ring under deep cover for Russia shocked their neighbors in the suburbs. Presumably it was also news to President Obama, coming as it did right after Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's departure. What should not be a surprise to any of us, however, is that Russia continues to spy on the United States. Espionage is a fact of international life and always has been. The first spy manual, The Art of War, was written by Sun Tzu some 2,500 years ago. Espionage fills a vital niche; a successful operation can provide insight into intentions, plans, and human dynamics that cannot be gleaned from intercepted communications or pictures from space. It is safe to assume that since the end of World War II there has never been a day that the Soviet Union or Russia was not spying on the United States, or vice versa. Espionage will continue, even as the United States and Russia work out a new modus vivendi. Presidents Obama and Medvedev may have recently ""reset"" the U.S.-Russian relationship, but that does not mean U.S. and Russian interests or perspectives are necessarily aligned. There remain significant issues of disagreement over European security. The two countries have until recently been at loggerheads over Iran. After September 11, Russia reluctantly allowed the United States military to operate out of bases in Central Asia, which it views as its own backyard. The two countries belong to the G-8 and the G-20 -- venues not only for cooperation, but also for sparring. Russia also has great incentive to continue its historical efforts to ferret out America's economic secrets and steal its weapons technology. Frankly, in a world in which even allies spy on one another, the Russian intelligence service would be shockingly incompetent if it were not spying on us. Espionage operations tend to operate on long timelines, and the alleged Russian implanting of ""illegals"" in this country fits the pattern. Juan Jose Lazaro and Vicky Pelaez came to our shores more than 20 years ago; Richard and Cynthia Murphy reportedly came in the mid-1990s; Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley in 1999; Michael Zottoli in 2001. U.S.-Russian relations were very different when Moscow Center dispatched these officers. The Bosnian and Kosovo wars, NATO enlargement into Eastern Europe and Russian weapons sales to Iran were roiling the waters in the 1990s. Moscow seems to have calculated that with these agents in place, there was little reason to pull them out, even if relations with Washington were on the upswing. What is surprising about this case is how many illegals were apparently operating together and how little they accomplished or were likely to accomplish. During the Cold War, the heyday of this technique, the KGB typically dispatched such agents singly or as couples. They were usually compartmented from one another, not in networks of 10 or more, since all of them would be vulnerable if there was a single security slip-up. The Soviets also used illegals mainly for assignments too difficult for KGB officers working under ""official cover"" as diplomats or attachés. It's not clear what, if anything, these new accused illegals were able to do to steal sensitive information or even help other agents. Maybe the FBI will reveal more on that, but at the moment, this operation looks like a waste of effort on Moscow's part, indeed an embarrassment to its intelligence service. Will this spy flap seriously damage U.S.-Russian relations? The early signs are that it will not. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB officer, has said that he hopes the incident will not damage the improving relations between the two countries. The State Department said it intends to focus on other things. The United States, of course, cannot be expected to like the fact that Russia spies on us, and is briefly entitled to a modest amount of indignation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Earnest.","Peter Earnest says arrests this week of suspected agents in Russian spy ring no surprise .

"Washington (CNN) -- The once-ubiquitous Humvee may become a rare sight in some parts of Afghanistan following a decision by the senior U.S. commander in eastern Afghanistan to restrict the use of the vehicles in the field. Maj. Gen. John Campbell, commander of Joint Task Force-101, ordered this week that the use of Humvee vehicles outside a military base would have to specifically be approved by a colonel -- one of the most senior field grade positions in the military. Prior to this, the use of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV, or Humvee) had to be approved by a lower-ranking officer, according to Task Force spokesman Maj. Patrick Seiber. Seiber said the decision was not specifically in reaction to a number of deadly IED attacks on troops in recent weeks, but is part of trying to improve protection for the force.  The Humvee is heavily armored, but its flat bottom and low-to-the-ground profile has made it particularly vulnerable to attacks using improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.  In recent years, the military has fielded a new series of armored vehicles with V-shaped hulls to deflect the blast of roadside bombs, but even some of those have been destroyed in large-scale attacks. Campbell's decision comes amid the release of figures showing that June has been the deadliest month of the war for the coalition across Afghanistan, with 101 coalition troops killed and about 400 U.S. troops wounded. Casualties due to IED attacks continue to skyrocket.  The Pentagon reports that in May 2010, the latest data available, the number of coalition forces -- including Afghans -- that were killed or wounded by IED attacks was 284, more than double the 104 killed or wounded in the same month last year. The number of overall IED attacks reached 1,128, compared to 513 in May 2009. The Pentagon statistics on IEDs include Afghan troop casualties because those units are suffering very high attacks rates, according to the Pentagon.","Senior commander restricts use of Humvees in Afghanistan .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Larry King, the iconic TV interviewer, will step aside from hosting of his prime time CNN show later this year, he said Tuesday. King, 76, made the announcement with a short posting to his Twitter account, citing his desire to spend more time with his wife and young children. ""I want to share some personal news with you. 25 years ago, I sat across this table from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for the first broadcast of Larry King Live. Now, decades later, I talked to the guys here at CNN and I told them I would like to end Larry King Live, the nightly show, this fall and CNN has graciously accepted, giving me more time for my wife and I to get to the kids' little league games,"" King wrote. ""I'm incredibly proud that we recently made the Guinness Book of World Records for having the longest running show with the same host in the same time slot. With this chapter closing I'm looking forward to the future and what my next chapter will bring, but for now it's time to hang up my nightly suspenders."" ""He will end his run with Larry King Live on his own terms, sometime this fall,"" said Jon Klein, president of CNNUS. ""Larry is a beloved member of the CNN family and will continue to contribute to our air with periodic specials."" During his Tuesday night show, King told guest Bill Maher ""there's a freedom"" that came with his decision. ""I want to expand,"" King told the comedian. ""I want to do other things that I haven't been able to do."" The idea to step aside came to him after he completed his week-long 25th anniversary celebration, he said. ""I'm thinking to myself, I've done 50,000 interviews,"" he said. ""I'm never going to top this."" King said he would exit the host's chair ""maximum November."" But, he told Maher, ""Then I'll be doing specials. You'll see me in other places."" Asked whom he wants to replace him, King cited ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest. ""He's curious, he's interesting, he's likable,"" King said. ""If he has a great interest in politics, I would recommend him. But I'm sure there's a ton of people who could do it. Come on. It's Q and A."" ""It's not easy,"" Maher responded. ""That's the trick."" In a telephone call to the program, former first lady Nancy Reagan told King, ""I couldn't let you do this without my calling you. You didn't call me and ask my permission."" King said he had made no plans about his future, but added, ""I'm looking forward -- I feel open to so many things. Life will be better."" ABC News Anchor Diane Sawyer chimed in: ""I just want to say, Larry, what a monument of vitality you have built for all of us and I cannot wait to see your specials because everybody in the world wants to talk to you and to see you do them in a concentrated way -- when you choose to do them it's going to be a thrill."" King's decision followed months of media speculation about his future as his ratings declined. King was hosting a nationally syndicated overnight radio talk show when CNN founder Ted Turner persuaded him in 1985 to try his interviewing skills on cable TV. ""All I had to do was everything I'd been doing since I was a kid,"" he wrote in his best-selling 2009 autobiography, ""My Remarkable Journey."" His gentle but persistent interview style drew big-name guests, and ""Larry King Live"" became a place for major personalities to break news. Billionaire Ross Perot used the show to announce he was running for president in 1992. And the show was the setting for the historic NAFTA debate between then-Vice President Al Gore and Perot in 1993, a debate that for more than a decade was the highest-rated program in cable history. King, who was initially based in Washington, became a mandatory stop for politicians. Over his career, he conducted sit-down interviews with every U.S. president since Richard Nixon. His program was sometimes a place of real-time diplomacy. In 1995, he hosted a program on the Middle East Peace process with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. His suspenders, large glasses and vintage desk microphone are as recognizable as the countless celebrities lined up to have an intimate chat with King while the world listened in. And there have been a lot of guests, including Marlon Brando, Nelson Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev, Paul McCartney, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, L. Ron Hubbard, Madonna and Martin Luther King, Jr. After extensive coverage over many months of O.J. Simpson's trial for murder, Simpson himself called the program the night he was acquitted. King says that Nelson Mandela was the most extraordinary person he has met. In his autobiography, King confessed that he never plans a question, that he likes to be surprised by the answers. He says he asks his interview subjects to explain things. ""All I do is ask questions,"" he wrote. ""Short, simple questions."" Born in Brooklyn, Larry Zeiger moved to Miami, Florida, in 1957. He began his radio career that year with a new name, Larry King. His first television job was hosting a local interview show in Miami in 1960. While some critics have called King a throwback, he embraced the online social networking tool Twitter. He had 1,648,920 Twitter followers as of Tuesday. On Monday, King used Twitter to respond to a fan's question about the highlights of his career: . ""Winning 2 Peabody Awards & an Emmy. Perot-Gore Debate a show highlight,"" King tweeted. In addition to earning the Emmy and two Peabody Awards, he was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1992. King also has an extensive film resume, having played himself in 20 movies. King has suffered a decline in ratings. His show, which was once on top, sometimes has come in fourth among cable talk shows during the 9 p.m. hour. King faced highly publicized personal problems this year. He and his eighth wife, Shawn Southwick-King, filed for divorce in April, but reconciled weeks later. King has repeatedly talked about the importance of spending time with his children, including his two boys from his marriage with Southwick-King. ""I'd love to see Chance and Cannon talk about how their Dad took them to play when they were kids,"" he wrote in his autobiography. After suffering a heart attack in 1987, King underwent quintuple bypass heart surgery. A year later, he created the Larry King Cardiac Foundation, which he said was to help those ""not so lucky"" to have medical insurance. In 2009, the foundation paid for 287 life-saving surgeries. And through it all, the interviews continued. ""Only God failed to show up for a Larry King interview,"" said Tom Johnson, who was CNN's chairman for more than a decade, ending in 2001. ""Larry has been my close friend since I joined CNN in 1990,"" Johnson said. ""We never had a single disagreement in my 11 years as CEO, although he never thought much of my suggestions for more shows about North Korea."" Is there anyone he would like to interview that he hasn't so far? For years, he joked in his autobiography, he answered that question ""God."" ""And my first question would be, 'Do you have a son? Because there's a lot riding on the answer.'"" CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this story.","NEW: King likes Seacrest as a possible replacement .

"(CNN) -- Hoping to solve numerous cold cases, authorities on Thursday released more than a hundred photos of unidentified women and children found in a storage unit that belonged to a serial killer who appeared on ""The Dating Game."" Investigators are trying to determine if some of the people in the pictures were victims of Rodney Alcala, 66, who was convicted in February of murdering a child and four women between November 1977 and June 1979. A jury this week recommended a death sentence for Alcala, who appeared on the popular dating show in 1978 as Bachelor No. 1. ""We balanced the privacy concerns of those depicted in the decision to release these pictures,"" Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in a statement. ""Although we hope that the people depicted are not victims, we believe the release may help solve some cold cases and bring closure to victims' families."" See all the photos . A few pictures of men were also found among the portrait-style photos that were discovered in a storage unit that Alcala kept in Seattle, Washington, said Susan Kang Schroeder, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. The locker also contained earrings that belonged to 12-year-old Robin Samsoe, who Alcala abducted and killed in 1979, Schroeder said. The discovery of the earring in the locker has raised speculation that there may be other victims or that the photographs were trophies to Alcala, she said. ""The idea is to figure out if these are other victims that belong to other cold cases and if they are we can hopefully bring some closure to these victims' families,"" she said. ""We know that Mr. Alcala used his photography as a ruse to get close to his victims."" Authorities already believe that Alcala may be responsible for deaths in New York, Schroeder said. ""It's very possible,"" Schroeder said. ""Mr. Alcala is a predatory monster and we believe that he destroyed many lives everywhere he went."" According to the Orange County District Attorney, Alcala was convicted in 1972 of kidnapping and molesting a child in Los Angeles County in 1968. After serving a 34-month sentence, he was released. In November 1977, Alcala raped, sodomized and murdered Jill Barcomb, an 18-year-old New Yorker who had recently moved to California, the district attorney said. ""The defendant used a large rock to smash in the victim's face, causing blunt force trauma, and strangled her to death by tying her belt and pant leg around her neck. He then left the victim's body in a mountainous area in the foothills near Hollywood."" The body was discovered soon after, and biological evidence was collected, but DNA technology was not yet available to find her killer. The following month, Alcala raped, sodomized and murdered 27-year-old nurse Georgia Wixted, according to the district attorney. ""The defendant used the claw end of a hammer to beat the victim and smash in her head. He strangled her to death using a nylon stocking and left her body in her Malibu apartment,"" according to the district attorney's Web site. Again the body was discovered and biological evidence was collected, but no link was made to Alcala. All this occurred before Alcala charmed ""Dating Game"" contestant Cheryl Bradshaw in 1988. Though Bradshaw chose Alcala as her date, she reportedly refused to go out with him. Alcala may have appeared likable to viewers at home, but Bachelor No. 2, Jed Mills, said he was the complete opposite when they sat together in the green room before the show. Mills said he had an almost immediate aversion to Alcala. ""Something about him, I could not be near him,"" Mills recalled. ""He was very obnoxious and creepy -- he became very unlikable and rude and imposing as though he was trying to intimidate. I wound up not only not liking this guy ... not wanting to be near him ... he got creepier and more negative. He was a standout creepy guy in my life."" Mills said he still has a difficult time discussing Alcala. ""Just talking about it, I get a tightness in my stomach,"" he said, ""It kind of sinks in slowly. What this guy did, it's hard to express. He kind of haunts me a bit."" Two more slayings followed the year after Alcala appeared on the show. In June 1979, he raped and killed 21-year-old Jill Parenteau in her Burbank apartment, the district attorney said. ""The defendant strangled the victim to death using a cord or nylon. Alcala's blood was collected from the scene after he cut himself crawling through a window. Based on a semi-rare blood match, Alcala was linked to the murder,"" the district attorney's Web site said. Though he was charged with killing Parenteau, the case was dismissed after his first conviction in the Samsoe case. In that case, Alcala approached a 12-year-old at the beach in Huntington Beach and asked her to pose for pictures, after which she rode off on her bicycle toward a dance class, the district attorney said. She did not make it. ""The defendant kidnapped and murdered Samsoe and dumped her body near Sierra Madre in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains,"" the district attorney's Web site said. Alcala was convicted for Samsoe's murder in 1980 and sentenced to receive the death penalty, but the conviction was overturned by the California Supreme Court. A second trial in 1986 resulted in a death sentence, but it was overturned by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. As he awaited a third trial, Alcala's DNA was linked to the murder scenes of Barcomb, Wixted and Lamb. He was charged with the four Los Angeles murders, including Parenteau's. Anyone with information regarding the identities of the women and children in the photographs found in Alcala's storage locker is asked to contact Huntington Beach Police at 714-375-5066 or the Orange County District Attorney's Office at 714-347-8492.","Hundreds of portrait-style photos found in Rodney Alcala's storage unit .

"Washington (CNN) -- Religion is a growing factor in world affairs, but the U.S. government tends to view it through the lens of counterterrorism. That's the conclusion of a two-year study by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The success of American diplomacy in the next decade ""will be measured by its ability to connect with the hundreds of millions of people throughout the world whose identity is defined by religion,"" the report says. ""The challenge before us is to marginalize religious extremists, not religion,"" it concludes. The report, ""Engaging Religious Communities Abroad: A New Imperative for U.S. Foreign Policy,"" finds the key challenge for America internationally is to ""understand the role of religion in world affairs and to constructively engage with religious communities around the world."" The report, presented to the White House this week, was written by task force of 32 experts, including former government officials, religious leaders, heads of international organizations and scholars. Religious communities, they point out, are central players in major developments around the world: the war in Afghanistan, the promotion of human rights, environmental policy and the pursuit of peace. ""Well-organized and well-funded extremist groups also use religion,"" they say, ""to deepen existing cultural and political fault lines and justify militancy and terrorism."" ""Religion has played a negative role in U.S. foreign policy in the past, especially in relations with the Muslim world,"" notes Thomas Wright, executive director of studies for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the report's project director. The strategy of engaging religious communities is not trying to circumvent the First Amendment, observed Wright. ""The separation of church and state is vital and must be preserved in foreign as well as domestic policy,"" Wright said. But citing President Obama's Cairo speech to the Muslim world in June 2009, Wright said ""the United States has greatly improved its capacity to understand religious dynamics in world affairs."" The report notes the speech ""set the stage for a new departure in U.S. foreign policy toward Muslim communities"" but ""the scope must be much broader."" ""Engaging Islam is only one very crucial component of a larger challenge ... engaging the multitude of religious communities across the world as an integral part of our foreign policy.""

"(CNN) -- Young, athletic and troubled -- NFL player Chris Henry might have been a football cliché. After being arrested four times, suspended by the league three times and released once by the Cincinnati Bengals, the wide receiver appeared to be on a personal and professional comeback. But all that ended in December 2009. Henry died after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancée. His death was considered a tragic and bizarre end to a life plagued by behavioral problems. This week, findings from Henry's brain examination reverberated through the sports world, raising questions about head injuries and safety in high-contact sports. Doctors found evidence of brain damage, called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, that has been observed in retired players who've had many concussions. Unlike those older players, Henry was 26 when he died. CTE is also known as dementia pugilistica, because career boxers who've suffered repeated blows to the head have been known to develop the syndrome. Sudden stops and collisions can cause the brain to slosh inside the skull. Its effects are mainly neurobehavioral. These symptoms include poor decision-making, behavioral problems, failure at personal and business relationships, use of drugs and alcohol, depression and suicide. ""The effect on the brain appears to be damages to the emotional circuitry of the brain,"" said Dr. Julian Bailes, chairman of neurosurgery at West Virginia University. ""We think Chris exhibited some of the characteristics of the neurobehavioral syndrome of CTE,"" he said at a news conference Monday. ""We don't know if there is a cause and effect."" The neurologists at the Brain Injury Research Institute at West Virginia University did not draw any association between Henry's actions and the disease. ""His case highlights the fact there is documented damage in someone young and actively playing,"" said Bailes, a former doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bengals coach: Henry 'beacon of hope' before death . The syndrome is believed to be caused by large accumulations of tau proteins in the brain that kill cells in the regions responsible for mood, emotion and executive functioning. Tau proteins are also found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The findings regarding Henry's brain raised unsettling questions: Could CTE contribute to misbehavior of football players? If Henry, a seemingly healthy athlete in his mid-20s, had signs of CTE, could other young athletes have this syndrome, too? Dr. Jon Weingart, professor of neurological surgery and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, said extrapolating from one case, like Henry's, would be a ""big leap."" ""That would be misleading,"" he said. ""There's not enough data. ... To think that this is something brewing in many players -- there's no data to support that statement."" Weingart said the relationship between multiple traumas and head hits and CTE is not a proven cause and effect. At this point, it's a correlation. Sports Illustrated: Concussions and football: Is the game too dangerous for our kids? In 2009, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine reported that an 18-year-old multisport athlete who suffered multiple concussions also had CTE,  a finding that a neuropathologist described as ""shocking."" MRIs and CAT scans are unable to detect CTE. Detecting the syndrome requires brain samples, which cannot be given until a person is dead. The samples are colored with special microscopic stains. In Henry's brain, doctors found a tau protein accumulation, inflammatory changes and white matter changes that were significantly abnormal. The fibers in the brain had brown discoloration and showed significant damage. In previous findings of former NFL players, the brown tangles flecked throughout the brain tissue resembled what might be found in the brain of an 80-year-old with dementia. Dead athletes' brains show damage from concussions . Henry could've had a genetic predisposition for the type of brain injury, because a majority of the brains with CTE contained the gene called the apolipoprotein E3 allele. ""We may be seeing a genetic trend that Chris is in the 70 percent of those diagnosed with CTE, who have a special genetic sign,"" said Bailes, the West Virginia University neurosurgery chairman. ""Perhaps that may be a clue as to who's at risk for this to develop."" Genetic factors could make some people less able to tolerate subtle trauma to their brains. For example, some high school athletes get a concussion and struggle afterward, while others who experience the same degree of head bump recover without a hitch. ""There's some variability of how someone is able to handle and recover from trauma to the brain,"" Weingart said. Henry's case has ""sparked a lot of social debate and reflection and was scientifically valuable,"" Bailes said. ""We want to continue to study. We don't have all the answers. We're also looking, as soon as we can, to find treatment and prevention,"" he said. NFL medical heads and Goodell convene on brain injuries . The NFL has recently pledged to step up its efforts on head injuries and named new co-chairs and members to its medical committee. The league has also changed guidelines prohibiting a player suffering a concussion to practice or play.","NFL star Chris Henry was found to have a type of brain damage seen in older players .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- All 36 crew members of a Spanish fishing boat hijacked by Somali pirates more than a month ago have been freed along with their vessel, the Spanish prime minister said Tuesday. ""Our sailors of the Alakrana are free and will come home,"" Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero announced in a news conference. ""These tough weeks have ended in a very positive way."" Zapatero did not say how the ship was freed. Spanish media -- including CNN sister station CNN+, which cited a source it said was close to the negotiations -- reported that a ransom had been paid. The prime minister congratulated the armed forces, diplomats, intelligence services, and the government for their role in freeing the ship. He also thanked the political parties that entered into an agreement ahead of the Alakrana's release, but he did not give details. ""Alakrana now sails freely because many people have contributed, especially the wives and the families of the crew, who have had a very hard time, but have behaved very well,"" Zapatero said. ""I want to say thank you to them for complying faithfully with what I asked of them in our meeting. This has been decisive for us to be able to feel safe in this situation today."" The fishing boat is now ""sailing freely toward safe waters,"" Zapatero said, adding ""all crew members are safe and sound."" Pirates seized the Spanish fishing boat off Somalia 47 days ago. The crew included 16 members from Spain and 20 from Africa and Asia. A day after the hijacking, Spanish military monitoring the situation captured two pirate suspects as they left the fishing boat and later brought them to Madrid. The two were indicted Monday on 36 counts of kidnapping and armed robbery. They could face sentences of more than 200 years in prison each because of the multiple kidnapping counts. But the ship's owner, Echebastar Fleet, and relatives of the crew members had pleaded with the court and the Spanish government to return the two suspects to Somalia, as pirate representatives had demanded in conversations with Spanish media. It is thought to be the first time suspected Somali pirates had appeared before a Spanish judge and been indicted. Spanish media have reported that various other European countries have sent Somali pirate suspects -- which their respective armed forces captured -- to Kenya to face judicial proceedings, but did not bring them to Europe. Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia and are currently holding 12, including the Alakrana, Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon said recently. About a dozen other Spanish fishing boats had taken refuge in the Seychelles Islands but over the weekend, dozens of private Spanish security personnel arrived there and boarded the ships, with their weapons, to provide security, as other nations are doing for their fishing fleets in the troubled waters. Spain is part of a European Union task force against piracy in the Indian Ocean off Somalia. The Spanish parliament last January agreed to increase Spain's presence with up to 395 troops and assets, including a frigate and aircraft. Chacon told Parliament before the vote that the fight against piracy ""is of vital importance for the defense of the geostrategic and economic interests of Spain, and will provide security to our fishing fleet."" CNN's Al Goodman in Madrid, Spain, and Per Nyberg in London, England, contributed to this report.","All 36 crew members of a Spanish fishing boat hijacked by Somali pirates a month ago are freed .

"(CNN) -- A suspect in a series of bank robberies in which the thief pedaled off on a bicycle has been apprehended, California authorities said Thursday. Hubert Rotteveel, 47, of Dixon, California, was arrested Wednesday afternoon after two banks in the Woodland, California, area were robbed in just over an hour, Sgt. Anthony Cucchi of the Woodland Police Department said. The robber pedaled up to the River City Bank in Woodland shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday, police said. Wearing black clothing, sunglasses and a white bicycle helmet, he held tellers at gunpoint and demanded money before fleeing on a bike, authorities said. At approximately 3 p.m., the First Northern Bank in West Sacramento was robbed by a bike-riding bandit. ""As he's fleeing that bank on his bicycle,"" Cucchi said, ""he passes a police officer from West Sacramento and the dye pack (in the stolen money) in his bag explodes in front of the officer. ""He tries a quick getaway and the officer gets right on him and apprehends him,"" Cucchi said. Rotteveel was being held at the Yolo County jail, with bail set at $200,000, authorities said. Authorities believe the suspect may be linked to several armed bank robberies in northern California, including one in Santa Cruz on Monday afternoon.","Bike-riding bandit has hit several banks in northern California .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union have issued travel alerts for people heading to Arizona this Fourth of July holiday weekend -- the group's latest effort to condemn the state's new immigration law. Arizona's measure stipulates that police can ask the residency status of people being investigated for a crime. ""Although the law is not scheduled to go into effect until July 29, the ACLU is concerned that some law enforcement officers are already beginning to act on provisions of the law,"" the ACLU said on its website. ""We hope the alerts provide people with some measure of protection from illegal harassment from law enforcement and inform them of their rights should they encounter it."" The travel alerts -- issued by ACLU affiliates from as far away as Alaska and New York -- inform people of their rights when stopped by law enforcement in Arizona, the ACLU said. Critics say the new law will lead to racial profiling and prevent police from doing their jobs by undermining trust in the Latino community. City governments and organizations opposed to the law have targeted Arizona with protests and boycotts . But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and other state officials say the law is necessary because of the increasing number of people illegally entering the state from Mexico. In addition, Brewer has said the law does not target an individual's specific ethnicity. ""It wouldn't matter if you are Latino or Hispanic or Norwegian,"" she said last month. ""If you didn't have proof of citizenship and the police officer had reasonable suspicion, he would ask and verify your citizenship. I mean, that's the way that it is. That's what the federal law says. And that's what the law in Arizona says."" In late May, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 57 percent of those surveyed favored Arizona's new law, while 37 percent opposed it. The same poll also found that six in 10 respondents found that the federal government should focus on stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S., deporting those already here and supporting more border security.","ACLU: Travel alerts inform people of their rights when stopped by law enforcement .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of fatally shooting two Tampa, Florida, police officers is a suspect in another homicide and is sought for questioning in two others, Police Chief Jane Castor said Thursday. All the homicides have taken place since Dontae Morris was released from prison in April, Castor told reporters. ""We just want to make the public aware of who we're dealing with here in Dontae Morris,"" she said. ""... he's a cold-blooded killer."" Morris, 24, is accused of shooting Officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis during an early-morning traffic stop Tuesday near downtown Tampa. The officers, both 31, later died at a hospital. Morris is also suspected in the killing of a man at an apartment complex, Castor said. That homicide occurred May 18, according to the Tampa Tribune. ""We are continuing to track down some very, very positive leads,"" the chief said, and police remain confident Morris will be apprehended. She said she didn't believe the community was at risk, but said Morris could be moving about, and the situation could be ""unpredictable."" Meanwhile, Morris' picture was featured on FBI billboards in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, authorities said Thursday. Although it's not the first time authorities have featured fugitives' pictures on billboards, the posting of Morris' photograph marked the first time authorities could post such images themselves, through a partnership with outdoor advertising companies, said Chris Allen, spokesman for the FBI's Tampa bureau. ""Beforehand, it would have taken the better part of a day or two"" to get the photos up by contacting the companies, he said. While the initiative was on standby for the Times Square bombing attempt, it was not used, he said. The billboards went up in Florida shortly after the crime occurred Tuesday, he said. Authorities recently decided to feature the picture in Alabama and Georgia. Other states can be added, too, he said -- authorities simply create the alert on a computer and use a drop-down menu to select states. Asked whether officials plan to use the billboards in other states, Allen said it depends on where the investigation leads authorities. Morris' picture and information was also put on the website of the television program ""America's Most Wanted."" Meanwhile, Tampa police said Wednesday afternoon the reward for information leading to Morris' arrest has increased to $100,000 -- the biggest in the city's history. ""The intensity will keep up until we capture him,"" said Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio. Anyone helping or harboring Morris is ""making a huge mistake,"" she said. Asked about some citizen complaints about being inconvenienced by the ongoing search, Castor said, ""I am very sorry for anyone's inconvenience. We don't want to inconvenience anyone, but our ultimate goal is to keep the citizens of Tampa safe ... I believe that anger should be focused on Dontae Morris. He's the one that's causing all this."" Iorio said the evacuation of a building or the closure of a street is a ""small inconvenience"" given what authorities are trying to do. Asked about officers' anger toward Morris, Castor said police are ""reeling over the loss of two family members"" but are professionals who will take Morris into custody safely if at all possible. She reiterated, however, that the best course of action would be for Morris to give himself up. Authorities have arrested several of Morris' associates, she said. According to CNN affiliate Bay News 9, police are also searching for Morris' 21-year-old brother for questioning. Public services for the fallen officers will be held Friday evening at a church in Lutz, Florida, Bay News 9 reported. Funeral services are planned for Saturday. The officers were shot after Curtis pulled a vehicle over about 2:15 a.m. ET Tuesday, and the driver -- identified by police as Cortnee Brantly -- gave him identification and vehicle registration that did not match the vehicle, Castor said. Running a criminal history check, Curtis found that the passenger -- identified as Morris -- had an outstanding misdemeanor worthless-check warrant from Jacksonville, Florida. Curtis called for backup, and Kocab responded, police have said. As the two attempted to arrest the suspect, he pulled out a gun and shot them both, Castor has said. A gun was not found at the scene, she said, and police believe Morris still has it. Brantly was taken into custody Tuesday and authorities released her after seven hours of questioning, Castor said. Brantly provided police with information, she said, but ""I would not describe her as cooperative."" Although police had enough information to arrest Brantly, their focus is on apprehending Morris, the chief said. She defended the decision to release Brantly, saying ""there is still a very, very distinct possibility she will be charged down the road ... The community needs to trust in the ability of the TPD."" Kocab's wife is due to give birth next week, police said at the time of the shootings. Curtis leaves a wife and four sons, ages 9, 6, 5 and 8 months.","NEW: All 5 homicides took place since suspect's release from prison .

"(CNN) -- A judge in Tampa, Florida, on Monday sentenced Stephanie Ragusa, a former middle school math teacher, to 10 years in prison for having sex with two underage students in 2008. ""As parents, we place our trust in teachers to provide a safe environment in which our children can learn,"" Hillsborough County Circuit Judge Chet Tharpe said in handing down the sentence. ""You violated that trust in the worst imaginable way."" Tharpe also sentenced Ragusa to 15 years of sex offender probation following her prison time. Ragusa, 31, pleaded guilty in April to three counts of lewd and lascivious battery in a March 2008 case involving a 14-year-old boy, and two counts of having unlawful sex with a minor in an April 2008 case involving a 16-year-old student. Ragusa has been in jail since she was arrested in 2008 leaving one of the victims' homes. Monday's sentencing included testimony from the victims' families, who depicted Ragusa as a sexual predator who caused severe emotional distress for their sons. ""Miss Ragusa maliciously and intently preyed on my son and the other boys,"" said the mother of the 14-year-old victim. ""She had access to their charts as far as their emotional behaviors. ... I feel that she was very conniving ... in picking these boys out and preying on them and using that to manipulate them and seduce them."" Prosecutor Rita Peters also played a phone conversation between Ragusa and the younger victim that police recorded with the 14-year-old's consent. In the tape, Ragusa can be heard urging the teen to keep their encounters secret. ""It's ... one of those things you have to take to the grave,"" Ragusa says on the tape, explaining that sex crimes involving minors have no statute of limitations. In arguing for the maximum sentence, Peters portrayed Ragusa as a ""master manipulator."" ""She is the one that goes in and looks at their weaknesses,"" Peters said. ""She knows exactly what she has to do to get into their lives."" In a statement before her sentencing, an emotional Ragusa -- wearing an orange jumpsuit and shackled at her hands and ankles -- expressed remorse for her actions. ""I'm sincerely sorry for the pain and aggravation I have caused to the victims and their families,"" she said. Her attorney, Robert Herce, asked the judge to sentence her to probation with time served, saying she has spent more time behind bars than other people who have faced similar charges. A psychiatrist for the defense also testified that Ragusa has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. But Tharpe issued the maximum sentence and did not hold back in his final statement to Ragusa, calling her a ""danger to the children in our community."" ""You not only have disgraced yourself, your family, but also the teaching profession,"" Tharpe said. ""And one thing that I have gleaned out of this sentencing hearing this afternoon is you're a very selfish person."" He added that he remained unconvinced that Ragusa had accepted responsibility in the case. ""You stopped only because you got caught and put in jail,"" Tharpe said. As part of her probation, Ragusa must abide by a mandatory nightly curfew, enroll in an outpatient sex offender treatment program and will not be allowed contact with the victims. She also will not be allowed to live within 1,000 feet of a school, day care, playground, park or any other area where children congregate, nor will she be allowed unsupervised contact with children under age 18. The defense said after the hearing that it was disappointed with the sentence. ""I was not expecting that harsh of a sentence and I think this case did not warrant that,"" Herce said.","Stephanie Ragusa pleaded guilty in April in the case .

"(Wired) -- On its tenth anniversary in 2008, Google promised $10 million to the best five ideas for using technology to improve the world, through Project 10x100 -- a neat play on words (10 to the 100th power expresses the number ""googol,"" which is a one followed by one hundred zeroes). Google's intentions were good, of course -- $10 million spent the right way could have a real impact on these problems, which range from building better banking tools to a real-time, user-reported news service. However, the company's follow-through leaves much to be desired. Google announced this cash prize contest in September 2008 and closed public voting on 16 finalists chosen from over 150,000 ideas in October 2009. Over eight months later, the company has yet to announce the winners. Meanwhile, e-mails sent to Project 10 to the 100th's Gmail account are bouncing, indicating that Google has deleted the address. And the company's press department has yet to respond to our inquiries about the project. ""We'll announce the winning big ideas in the near future,"" reads a notice on the project's website, which lists ""©2009 Google"" at the bottom. According to Daniel Meyerowitz, who says his idea for mapping ongoing genocides and providing early warning of new ones is a finalist in the competition, Google has not said a peep about this competition in nine months -- despite having apologized for delays as early as March 2009. ""While genocide and other pressing problems relentlessly advance, it would seem that Project 10^100 does not,"" Meyerowitz told Wired.com. ""Years behind schedule. Nine months since announcing their most recent delay. How hard can it be to give away ten million bucks? Harder than Google can handle, apparently."" Google, which reported revenue of $6.77 billion for the first quarter of this year, could practically consider $10 million to be a rounding error, so money isn't the problem. And the company already did the hard work of combining the overt 150,000 submitted ideas, many of which were duplicates or complementary, into 16 ""theme"" ideas, on which the public has already voted. Assuming the project is still ongoing, Google will select an organization already involved with the issue to receive a share of the cash with the goal of solving the problem. So all that remains for the company to do at this point is to announce the five winning ideas and the organizations that will receive the money to implement them. ""An inspirational effort which began in the best Google tradition seems to be mired in the worst Google lapses,"" said Meyerowitz, who brought this situation to our attention. ""When can we expect the final projects to be funded? Or how about just a blog update?"" Google's not talking -- not yet, anyway. But apparently, it's the process of choosing the right organizations to address these issues that threatens to turn Google's 10th birthday celebration into a 12th birthday surprise.

"(CNN) -- The California Assembly on Thursday passed a bill appropriating $20 million to kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard to settle her claims against the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the chief clerk's office. The bill passed on a 30-1 vote in the Senate and a 62-0 vote in the Assembly, according to CNN affiliate KCRA. Corrections officials entered into the settlement with Dugard, the station said. Dugard vanished in 1991 at the age of 11. She was found in August 2009, living in a shed in the Antioch, California, backyard of Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender who had been on parole since January 1988. Investigators say Garrido fathered two children with Dugard during her captivity. He and his wife, Nancy, are charged with 29 felony counts in the case. Both have pleaded not guilty. In a report issued in November, the state inspector general's office found the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation failed to properly keep tabs on Garrido or properly supervise the officers assigned to his case. ""While it is true that Garrido's California parole was never officially violated, our review shows that Garrido committed numerous parole violations and that the department failed to properly supervise Garrido and missed numerous opportunities to discover his victims,"" the report said. Parole officers failed to investigate utility wires running from Garrido's house toward the shed where Dugard was held, to check out the presence of a 12-year-old girl during a visit or to act on information the report said ""clearly"" showed Garrido had violated the terms of his release, the report said. Dugard, who is now 30, her mother and her daughters had filed a claim saying state corrections officials failed to do their jobs, seeking psychological, physical and emotional damages, KCRA said. The settlement process was ""pretty much unprecedented,"" said Jeff Long, spokesman for Assemblyman Felipe Fuentes, who sponsored the bill. The language was inserted into a bill concerning claims against the state. Fuentes is chairman of the Assembly's Appropriations Committee, Long said. Every year as part of the budget process, the chair submits two bills for judgments against the state, Long said. It was decided that this would be the quickest way to get it through the Assembly, he said. Officials thought the state might have a case if it fought Dugard's claim, but it wasn't worth the case going to a jury, Long said. Because the constitutional deadline for an approved state budget has passed and California is in a new fiscal year without a budget, no appropriations can be made without Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's consent. Schwarzenegger has to request the bill be moved to his desk to sign it, Long said. Garrido was paroled in August 1988 after serving 11 years of a federal kidnapping sentence. He also served a five-year term in Nevada for rape charges. The November report from California Inspector-General David Shaw was limited to reviewing the actions of state parole officers in charge of monitoring Garrido from June 1999 until Dugard and her children were discovered. But Garrido was under the supervision of federal parole officers when authorities say he kidnapped Dugard in 1991, and they also ""failed to detect Garrido's criminal conduct and his victims,"" the report says. Garrido was only ""properly supervised"" for 12 out of the 123 months he was under California's supervision, ""a failure rate of about 90 percent,"" Shaw told reporters in November. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Rachel Brown contributed to this report.","Jaycee Dugard missing 18 years before she was found in sex offender's backyard .

"South Padre Island, Texas (CNN) -- Heavy rains pelting northeastern Mexico left at least one person dead and thousands more in shelters as Hurricane Alex moved inland, Mexican emergency officials said early Thursday. A contractor in Monterrey died when a wall fell on him as a result of the rain, Carlos Eduardo Aguilar of Nuevo Leon's Civil Protection agency said. CNN-affiliate Televisa reported that at least three other people died when a wall collapsed on them in Acapulco, on the country's Pacific coast. Alex made landfall along the northeast Mexican coastline late Wednesday as a Category 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of about 100 mph, the National Hurricane Center reported. Forecasters downgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane early Thursday morning and said it would continue to weaken as it moved inland. The center reported at 5 a.m. ET that Alex was weakening, but still a Category 1 hurricane, moving west at 12 mph with 80 mph maximum sustained winds. Residents on both sides of the border braced for additional flooding and tornadoes. Rivers and creeks were already well above their normal levels Wednesday. Rescuers saved a young man from rushing waters, Nuevo Leon state officials said. Officials closed schools across the state Thursday as they braced for floods. Heavy rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides, especially in areas with mountainous terrain, the National Hurricane Center said. Are you affected by Alex? Send photos, video . Power outages were reported throughout the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where shelters were housing more than 5,200 people Thursday morning, Salvador Treviño Salinas of the state's Civil Protection agency said. At least 1,500 people were in shelters in the city of Matamoros -- located across the border from Brownsville, Texas -- where flash floods inundated at least 48 neighborhoods after more than 14 inches of rain fell in 24 hours, he said. The storm also affected other Mexican states Wednesday. In Guadalajara, Jalisco, the water reached more than three feet in some streets, Televisa reported. Heavy rains from Alex were also expected to hit the Mexican states of Veracruz, Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas Thursday. In Brownsville, Texas, about 40 streets had flooded by early Thursday morning, Assistant City Manager Jeff Johnston said. Officials predict that the city could see up to 12 inches of rain from the storm, he said -- a significant amount, but less than originally feared. ""We're keeping a very close eye on the rain,"" he said. ""Brownsville is a very flat city...When we get a significat amount of rain in a short period of time, it's very difficult to move that water out of the city fast."" At least 1,000 people in southern Texas were taking shelter in evacuation centers as Alex's winds and heavy rain squalls bore down on the coastline, officials in Cameron and Hidalgo counties reported. Brownsville appeared to be taking the brunt of Alex's outer bands Wednesday after as many as six tornadoes were reported in the area and about 4,000 customers lost power, officials said. But by Thursday morning, all but 60 customers were back on the grid, Johnston said. In Harlingen, just 30 miles north of Brownsville, wind gusts of up to 65 mph were reported hours before the storm's expected landfall. No injuries were immediately reported from the twisters near Brownsville, but some damage was reported, including downed trees and power lines, weather and emergency management officials said. Carol Rumsey was riding the storm out in her Los Fresnos, Texas, home, not far from Brownsville and about a half hour from the coast. She told CNN Radio on Wednesday night that her house had an eerie feel as the storm approached. ""You board up your windows and it's like living in a dungeon,"" she said. ""You can't hear anything, you can't see anything."" She said she had considered evacuating as the region was being pummeled by heavy rain and occasional gusts of wind, but said ""this is the price you pay for living in paradise."" Meanwhile, authorities in South Padre Island closed the Queen Isabella Memorial Bridge -- which crosses to the popular vacation spot -- as a precaution ahead of the approaching Alex. Tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 205 miles from the center of the storm and hurricane force winds extend outward up to 35 miles, according to the hurricane center. Heavy rain and thunderstorms associated with the outer bands of Alex were affecting the entire Gulf Coast from Texas to Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Brownsville received more than 4 inches of rain by Wednesday afternoon, the weather service said. Harlingen Assistant Fire Chief Cirilo Rodriguez said his region was expecting 7-10 inches of rain. Coastal flood advisories have been issued for Louisiana and Mississippi. Minor coastal flooding is expected along the shore due to a prolonged strong southeasterly wind caused by the large counterclockwise circulation of the hurricane. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said Wednesday that the state was prepared for the storm. The State Operations Center was fully activated, he said, and Texas was working with federal and local authorities to track the hurricane and the BP Gulf oil disaster. President Barack Obama issued a federal emergency declaration for Texas ahead of Alex's expected arrival, the White House said Tuesday night. After the hurricane made landfall around 9 p.m. CT (10 p.m. ET), forecasters from the National Hurricane Center changed the hurricane warning to a tropical storm warning for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A tropical storm warning issued earlier remained in place along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Port O'Connor. A hurricane warning was in place for the coast of Mexico from the mouth of the Rio Grande to La Cruza, Mexico. The storm continued to move away from the massive BP oil catastrophe near the Louisiana coast in the northern Gulf of Mexico, but it already was complicating cleanup efforts. Residual effects from the storm will last for at least four days, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said, and could prohibit skimming and burning of oil in the Gulf at least until Saturday or Sunday. The storm created 12-foot waves Tuesday and oil-skimming ships were sent to shore from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. The rough seas may force crews to replace and reorganize booms meant to deter the oil from reaching shore, reported CNN's Ed Lavandera. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist said that even though Florida may dodge any problems with this storm, the Atlantic hurricane season is just beginning. ""In Florida, we've had a lot of hurricanes a number of years ago, but we handled them very well,"" he told CNN's Campbell Brown. ""The difference and the distinction that we face now is that we have a Gulf of Mexico that's full of oil. So our hope and our prayer is that we don't have a mixture of hurricanes with oil that could potentially damage the beautiful beaches of Florida. But if we do, we're prepared for it."" Pat Ahumada, the mayor of Brownsville, said the city was expecting to distribute 60,000 sandbags and provide shelter for roughly 2,000 families. Utility crews were on standby to handle outages. At the same time, the state government provided 90 buses in case an evacuation is needed. ""I expect about 10 percent of residents to evacuate voluntarily, which already started yesterday,"" Ahumada said Tuesday. ""I see a steady flow of people going out, but no bottlenecks -- which is good. ""We're not taking it lightly,"" he said. ""We're ready for a worst-case scenario.""

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Italy has the highest rate of bank robberies in Europe, an Italian study said this week. Of the 4,150 bank robberies that were reported in Europe in 2009, 1,744 -- or 42 percent -- were done in Italy, according to the study, which was carried out by the Italian bank watchdog Osservatorio and a trade union, CISL. Northern Italian cities, including Milan and Turin, saw the highest numbers of bank robberies, said the study, which was released Wednesday. One of the reasons Italy sees so many robberies is high cash liquidity, it said. The majority of robberies involve direct intimidation, including kidnapping the relatives of a bank employee, the study said. The result for staff is absenteeism, low productivity, difficulty concentrating, disturbed sleep, an anxious state of mind, complications in personal relationships, and irritability, it said. The amount of money lost from bank theft in Italy in 2009 was 36.8 million euros ($48 million), the Italian Association of Banks (ABI) calculated. ABI has carried out its own studies of the bank robbery phenomenon, the Italian daily La Stampa reported. It found that in two out of every three robberies, the thieves made off with about 15,000 euros ($18,600) and took less than three minutes. It also found thieves preferred to use small knives and paper cutters as weapons, and that most robberies happened on Mondays and Fridays. The Osservatorio-CISL study and the one by ABI said Italian banks spend more than 700 million euros ($870 million) every year on anti-theft equipment such as closed-circuit cameras and alarms.

"(CNN) -- Hours after the arrest of a suspect, thousands of friends, family and fellow officers gathered Saturday to pay tribute to two slain Florida policemen. An emotional funeral unfolded inside a Tampa church as suspect Dontae Morris, arrested on Friday, appeared in court for the first time. He was denied bond, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported, and is being held at the Hillsborough County Jail. Morris surrendered after a third party tipped off police, said Police Chief Jane Castor. Police also arrested 22-year-old Cortnee Brantly, the woman believed to have been driving the car at the time of the shooting, Castor said. The arrests came after a massive manhunt and were a relief, Castor said. They meant the department would be able to provide officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis with the honorable tribute they deserve, Castor said. ""This has brought us a sense of closure, and I pray the arrest brings a level of peace to the families of the officers,"" she said. At the funeral, Castor spoke of the ""inherently dangerous"" nature of law enforcement. ""There are some,"" she said, ""who soar in their profession and Officers David Curtis and Jeffrey Kocab operated in this realm."" Bagpipes played ""Amazing Grace"" as a procession of uniformed officers and family members filled Idlewild Baptist Church. A riderless horse stood as a powerful symbol of the fallen. The slain officers' widows sat solemnly in the front row. Curtis left behind his wife, Kelley, and four sons, the youngest only 8 months. Kocab's wife, Sara, is due to give birth in the next few days. Castor said the two women were supposed to have met for the first time at a party planned for Saturday night. Instead, she said, their lives became inextricably linked Tuesday by tragedy. The Idlewild pastor told the women that what ""we'd like to do for you, Sara, and you, Kelly, is to give you your men back."" ""We wanted to have a place where we could come under one roof as a city and a family and as friends to mourn, to grieve, to cry,"" he said. ""Maybe even to laugh, and to honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for us this day."" Morris is accused of shooting the two police officers during an early morning traffic stop near downtown Tampa on Tuesday. Both men died later at the hospital, according to police. Both were 31 years old. Castor said Brantly was arrested by Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies in Brandon and is facing federal charges of witnessing a felony, and not reporting it. Brantly was questioned by police for several hours immediately after the shooting Tuesday, but was not arrested at that time. Curtis pulled the vehicle over about 2:15 a.m. Tuesday and Brantly gave him identification and vehicle registration that did not match the vehicle, according to police. Running a criminal history check, Curtis found that Morris had an outstanding warrant for a worthless check out of Jacksonville. He called for backup, and Kocab responded. Police said as the two officers tried to arrest the suspect, he pulled out a gun and shot them. After the shooting, Castor called Morris ""a cold-blooded killer."" She reiterated that Friday night.

"(Mashable) -- Nokia has taken Apple to task for comments made by Steve Jobs about how users experiencing reception problems on their new iPhone 4 devices should ""avoid holding it that way"" (""that way"" meaning a grip that blocks the antenna). The maker of Symbian-based smartphones authored a post on its blog called ""How do you hold your Nokia?"" -- featuring step-by-step instructions on a variety of grips such as ""the cup,"" ""the balance"" and ""the four edge grip."" The company goes on to note, ""One of the main things we've found about the one billion plus Nokia devices that are in use today is that when making a phone call, people generally tend to hold their phone like a ... well, like a phone."" Obviously, this is all a jab at the iPhone (though Apple is never specifically mentioned) and its supposed reception issues, as Nokia concludes its post by writing: ""Of course, feel free to ignore all of the above because realistically, you're free to hold your Nokia device any way you like. And you won't suffer any signal loss. Cool huh?"" On a more serious note, however, you may recall that the two companies are currently embroiled in patent lawsuits and looking to keep the other's devices out of the U.S. That seems unlikely to happen any time soon, but for the moment, at least we have a fun aside in the battle between the two companies. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Teachers -- like me -- love ""teachable moments,"" so here's a big one from Monday's sweeping Supreme Court decision on gun rights and the states, McDonald v. Chicago. In it, the court not only validated individual gun rights, but applied them to every state and locality in the country. Americans know they have rights. Even some of my students who confess to near-total ignorance of American politics know they have free speech, the right to peaceably assemble, and the right to have a lawyer, should they run afoul of the law. But what none of my students know -- and what most Americans also don't know -- is that we can lay claim to these and other sacred Bill of Rights freedoms because of a different constitutional amendment, a cluster of 20th-century court cases, and something called ""incorporation."" Early in America's history, court rulings established that the Constitution's Bill of Rights applied only to actions by the federal government, not the states. So, for example, if local police tried to shutter a newspaper for publishing legitimate, if unpopular, news, the newspaper would have to turn to that state's constitution for protection or help, and not to the First Amendment's protection of a free press. And since every state constitution is different, the actual rights of citizens varied widely from state to state. Moreover, in the nation's first century, citizens rarely had direct dealings with a national government of limited size and reach. All this changed when the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution after the Civil War. Several decades later, the court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment's provision saying that states may not deprive persons of ""life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"" could now be used to apply or ""incorporate"" key provisions of the Bill of Rights to the states. Note, however, that this process occurred selectively, provision by provision, and over seven decades. The first Bill of Rights protection to be applied to the states was in 1897, when the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that private property was not to be taken for public use ""without just compensation"" was incorporated. Following that, the court incorporated free speech in 1925, press freedom in 1931, free exercise of religion in 1934, and so on until 1969, when it applied the protection against double jeopardy (being tried for the same crime twice) to the states. By design, this piecemeal process didn't include everything. (No one would argue that the Seventh Amendment's unincorporated right to common law suits ""where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars"" was the equivalent of free speech.) But most felt that incorporation was at an end, until two years ago. In its landmark 2008 decision, D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court struck down the District of Columbia's decades-old handgun ban as in violation of the Second Amendment's right to bear arms. This decision was momentous for two reasons. First, it was the first time in history that a gun law was struck down as a violation of the amendment. Second, the court contradicted past rulings that interpreted the amendment as pertaining only to citizen gun possession in connection with the ""well regulated militia"" mentioned in the first half of the amendment, and instead concluded that it protected an individual or personal right to own a handgun for protection in the home. Because D.C. is a federal enclave, the Second Amendment could be brought to bear without addressing the fact that it had never been applied to the states (the high court has repeatedly refused to hear Second Amendment-based challenges in the past). This brings us to McDonald, in which gun rights advocates challenged Chicago's local handgun ban as in violation of Heller -- but they also asked the court to now incorporate the Second Amendment. A five-member majority obliged. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito concluded that the individual right to bear arms, while subject to the limits outlined in Heller two years earlier that recognized most existing gun laws, was ""fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty"" -- the litmus test for judging whether a right was important enough to be applied to the 50 states. Readers eager to learn more about competing theories of incorporation are invited to plow through the five separate opinions that compose the case's 214 page decision. But whether one agrees with Justice Alito that the right to own handguns promotes ordered liberty because they are ""the most preferred firearm. . .for protection of one's home and family,"" or with Justice John Paul Stevens, who wrote in his dissent that guns in society ""destabilize ordered liberty"" by taking the lives of 30,000 Americans annually, Americans should at least know better today that the path to American rights runs through the Fourteenth Amendment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert J. Spitzer .","Spitzer: Court validated individual gun rights and applied them to every state, locality .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man wanted in connection with the shooting deaths of two Tampa police officers has been arrested, authorities said Friday night. Dontae Morris was turned in by a third party, Police Chief Jane Castor told reporters at a late night news conference. He is being held at the Hillsborough County Jail. ""I can't tell you how relieved the men and women of the Tampa police department are,"" Castor said. ""This has brought us a sense of closure, and I pray the arrest brings a level of peace to the families of the officers."" Morris is accused of shooting police officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis during an early morning traffic stop near downtown Tampa on Tuesday. Both men died later at the hospital, according to police. Castor also announced the arrest of 22-year-old Cortnee Brantly, the woman believed to have been driving the car at the time of the shooting. ""She was arrested by Hillsborough County sheriff deputies in Brandon,"" Castor said. ""She is facing federal charges of witnessing a felony and not reporting it."" Brantly was questioned by police for several hours immediately after the shooting Tuesday, but was not arrested at that time. Funeral services for the two officers are scheduled for Saturday. Castor said the arrests mean the department will be able to provide the officers with the honorable tribute they deserve. Both officers were age 31. Kocab's wife is due to give birth next week, authorities said. Curtis leaves behind a wife and four sons, including an 8-month-old. Curtis pulled the suspect vehicle over about 2:15 a.m. ET Tuesday and Brantly gave him identification and vehicle registration that did not match the vehicle, according to police. Running a criminal history check, Curtis found that Morris had an outstanding warrant for a worthless check out of Jacksonville. He called for backup, and Kocab responded. Police said as the two officers tried to arrest the suspect, he pulled out a gun and shot them. After the shooting, Castor called Morris ""a cold-blooded killer."" She reiterated that Friday night. ""I stand by my definition of a cold-blooded killer. Thank God he is behind bars right now.""

"(CNN) -- Chicago's longstanding ban on handguns, which the Supreme Court this week ruled as unconstitutional, was a complete failure. Two years ago, every student in my first-period English class on the West Side of Chicago claimed to have easy access to a handgun -- even the goody-two-shoes Honors student in the front row. When I doubted her, she looked at me as if I were a fool. ""I could get you one from my uncle tonight,"" she informed me with a quizzical look. ""He might ask me why I needed it, might not."" Guns were so abundant that there was only, maybe, one big fight a year among the males in our school building because it was understood that the simplest of physical confrontations too quickly could escalate into deadly shootings. ""You have to walk away from a lot,"" observed one former student of mine who has lost several friends and relatives to gun violence. ""For instance, dude deserves to be beat and I know I could beat his ass, but then what?  No one is just going to take an ass-beating, they're going to want to do something about it."" And he added, ""Then you got to worry about him and his guys jumping on you. Or more than likely, he's going to get a gun to show that he's not a punk. That's how a lot of these shootings happen, it's over nothing."" Violence was so omnipresent that when I returned to school a few days after being shot in the arm with a .22 (I'd rather not discuss), a staggering number of students lifted their shirts to show their bullet wounds. ""What you going to do?"" they seemed to say with a shrug, as if this were everyday life. In a city where an average of four people are shot every day, the random shooting death a few years ago of an amazing, beautiful person, Alto Brown, a friend of mine, was reduced to a single line in a three-paragraph newspaper story coldly tallying weekend homicides. ""Everything happens for a reason,"" the pastor said at his funeral. ""He's now in a better place."" As gangs and their illegal guns held whole communities hostage, it seemed as if the only people prevented from possessing firearms were citizens like Keith Thomas, who was raised on the West Side and now works as a mentor to at-risk youth for an alternatives schools program in Chicago . ""I don't think anybody in their right mind would argue that more guns are a good thing,"" said Thomas, who has the scar from a bullet wound on his right wrist. ""But I think the Supreme Court made the right decision. I think right now, at this point, the ban is not helping to serve any real purpose."" Thomas does not believe that the court's decision will result in significantly more or less violence, but he does hope that the ruling will force political leaders to seek community improvements beyond just strict gun control. ""It's not enough to just say we need more gun control.  That's not what's causing all these problems out here, the guns are the result,"" he explained.  ""If we want to stop violence, we need to make real changes. That's a lot harder and requires a lot more money than just saying no guns."" In too many low-income communities of Chicago, the schools are in shambles, quality after-school programs are scarce, well-paying jobs are almost nonexistent, and the family structure is in full crisis. It is an easy notion to disregard, but many of these children are struggling daily to thrive in an environment that fosters failure. ""We have to get them early, before they start getting lost,"" Thomas said of the youth he advises, get them redirected with organizations like his and other successful mentoring interventions like the Youth Advocates Programs. ""Once they start believing there's nothing else, that they have nothing to lose, they're the ones most likely to do the shooting."" After a recent weekend in which 10 people were killed and 60 wounded by gunfire, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley continued to argue the necessity of a citywide gun ban. ""Look at all the guns that shot people this weekend. Where did they come from? That is the issue."" But one must ask, truly, is it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Okun.","Former Chicago high school teacher says guns were abundant in his school .

"Charleston, West Virginia (CNN) -- He was raised an orphan of the West Virginia coal mines years before the Great Depression. On Friday -- as his body made a final return to the state he loved -- Sen. Robert C. Byrd was remembered as a political titan, champion of the poor, and defender of the Constitution. Political leaders from both parties and every corner of the country came together at the start of the Independence Day weekend to pay homage to America's longest serving member of Congress, who died Monday at the age of 92. President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were among the mourners who gathered at a memorial service in Charleston for the veteran legislator. Byrd was ""somebody who knew how to keep the faith with his state, with his family, with his country and his Constitution,"" Obama said, standing before a packed, sun-splashed state capitol. ""His life bent towards justice ... (and) immeasurably improved the lives of West Virginians."" He ""possessed that quintessential American quality,"" Obama said. ""And that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn ... and a capacity to be made more perfect."" Victoria Kennedy, the widow of Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, said her husband considered him ""a modern incarnation of ancient virtues. A Roman of West Virginia."" ""Someone will take Robert Byrd's seat,"" she said. ""But no one will ever take his place."" Byrd, who first entered Congress at the end of the Truman administration, was known as a master of the Senate's arcane rules and a staunch defender of congressional power. His speeches often were laced with poetry and references to the Greek and Roman classics. He typically punctuated his remarks by the brandishing of a well-worn pocket copy of the Constitution. Over the course of his long public career, Byrd came to be ""seen as the very embodiment of the Senate,"" Obama said. But ""his passion for the Senate's past ... was not an obsession with the trivial or the obscure."" It was born of a recognition of the fact that ""we are not a nation of men. We are a nation of laws."" Byrd also was known as the ""King of Pork,"" using powerful positions in Congress to steer federal spending to his home state -- one of the nation's poorest. Much of that funding famously went toward infrastructure improvements, most notably road and bridge construction. Clinton recalled an occasion when, soon after he became president, he told Byrd that ""if you pave every single inch of West Virginia, it's going to be much harder to mine coal."" Byrd, in response, said that ""the Constitution does not prohibit humble servants from delivering whatever they can to their constituents."" Byrd's remains lay in repose in the Senate chamber on Thursday -- a rare honor accorded to only two other senators since World War II. His casket was displayed on the same catafalque used for Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Thurgood Marshall, among others. ""The Senate was Robert C. Byrd's cathedral (and) West Virginia was his heaven,"" Biden said Friday. ""There's not a lot of hyperbole in that."" Obama has ordered flags on federal buildings to fly at half-staff through Tuesday, except on Independence Day. A proclamation issued by the president said the order was given ""as a mark of respect for (Byrd's) memory and long-standing service."" Byrd will be buried Tuesday after a funeral service in Arlington, Virginia. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd is honored at memorial service .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill that removes limits on financial damages that can be awarded for accidents off the U.S. coastline, such as the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers. The bill updates maritime laws that have been on the books since the mid-1800s and early 1920s. Those laws restricted the amount of money families could obtain to compensate for lost wages and funeral expenses. The bill passed by the House Thursday would allow compensation for non-monetary losses such as pain and suffering. A similar measure awaits action in the Senate. Also Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency issued a directive to BP on how the company should manage recovered oil, contaminated materials and waste recovered in cleanup operations from the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Among other requirements, the directive requires the oil giant to give the EPA and state agencies access to any waste storage site and to provide specific plans, waste reports and tracking systems for liquid and solid waste. ""While the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida are overseeing BP's waste management activities and conducting inspections, this action today is meant to compliment their activities by providing further oversight and imposing more specific requirements,"" the Coast Guard said Thursday. ""Under the directive, EPA, in addition to sampling already being done by BP, will begin sampling the waste to help verify that the waste is being properly managed."" Waste sampling to date has been done in compliance with EPA and state regulatory requirements, the Coast Guard said. The EPA on Thursday also released results from its first round of toxicity testing on eight oil dispersants, including Corexit 9500, which is being used in the Gulf. In May, the EPA had asked BP to stop using Corexit and to substitute other, less toxic alternatives on the market. BP declined to change dispersant, arguing that it was the best one for the job. The study showed that none of the eight dispersants tested displayed significant endocrine disrupting activity, the EPA said. Damage to the endocrine system is harmful to sea life, and can create reproductive problems. The agency conducted the testing to ensure that ""decisions about ongoing dispersant use in the Gulf of Mexico continue to be grounded in the best available science,"" the EPA said. Of the dispersants tested, Corexit 9500 and one called JD-2000 were generally less toxic to small fish, and JD-2000 and Saf-Ron Gold were least toxic to mysid shrimp, the EPA said. ""We want to ensure that every tool is available to mitigate the impact of the BP spill and protect our fragile wetlands,"" EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said. ""But we continue to direct BP to use dispersants responsibly and in as limited an amount as possible."" Meanwhile, rough seas in the wake of Hurricane Alex kept oil skimming boats out of the Gulf on Thursday and could keep many tied up through the weekend, the retired admiral in charge of the federal response to the Gulf oil disaster said. Thad Allen, briefing reporters in civilian garb after retiring from the Coast Guard on Wednesday, said seas over 5 feet hinder the effectiveness of most boats used to scoop oil. All but the largest vessels will likely be idled for another three days, he said. ""In general, we're waiting for the weather to abate so we can continue with recovery operations,"" he said. A ship billed as the world's largest skimming vessel has arrived in the Gulf of Mexico and was awaiting approval to begin cleaning, according to a spokesman for the Taiwanese company that owns it. The A Whale arrived in the Gulf on Wednesday and was anchored in Boothville, Louisiana, about an hour south of New Orleans. Frank Maisano, a spokesman for ship owner TMT shipping, said it is still awaiting approval to join the effort. Allen said the vessel -- estimated to be able to skim up to 21 million gallons a day -- is awaiting testing. That capacity is at least 250 times the amount that the modified fishing boats currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain, the company says. Built this year, the A Whale was initially designed to be one of the largest cargo vessels afloat. It was completed at a South Korean shipyard for transporting crude oil and iron ore. However, Maisano said in the statement, when the disaster unfolded, TMT modified the vessel to become the world's first large-scale skimmer. ""We're anxious to find out how effective it will be,"" Allen said. He cautioned that the area of the slick in which the ship will be most effective is a ""congested"" site above the ruptured BP well, which could make it harder to operate the 1,000-foot-plus vessel, but added, ""Anything that's effective we're looking forward to using."" Hurricane Alex hit the Mexican coast, more than 600 miles from the center of the Gulf disaster, on Wednesday night with 105 mph winds. It had diminished to a tropical storm by Thursday afternoon, but it continued to stir up seas of 6 to 8 feet around the site of the 10-week-old disaster and forced the postponement of a planned overflight of the area by Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft. And the system's prevailing winds have affected the direction of the oil slick, steering it away from the western Florida Panhandle toward the environmentally sensitive Mississippi and Chandeleur sounds off the coast of Mississippi and Louisiana, Zukunft said. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels (about 1.5 million gallons) and 60,000 barrels (about 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf every day since April 20, when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana. In other efforts, the U.S. Navy said Thursday it was sending a silver-colored blimp to aid in oil disaster efforts. The blimp, known as the MZ-3A, will fly slowly over the region in order to view the area where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore. It can also direct oil skimming operations. It was on the way to the Gulf region from Arizona on Thursday, the Navy said. In Gulf Shores, Alabama, meanwhile, the official tapped to oversee the payment of claims for damages from BP said he is working to speed up the process and get longer-term payments to those affected. Kenneth Feinberg, the attorney who handled a similar process after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, said after a meeting with Alabama Gov. Bob Riley that ""time is the enemy."" ""This is life for many people, in terms of their financial instability and the need for financial certainty,"" he said. ""We do not have a lot of time."" Feinberg said Riley has suggested that affected residents get lump-sum payments for up to six months' worth of lost income rather than month-to-month payments, and ""That is what we plan to do."" CNN's Ashley Hayes, Ashley Fantz, Vivian Kuo and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: EPA says dispersant BP uses is ""less toxic"" on small fish .

"(CNN) -- A first half goal from Milan Jovanovic gave Serbia a shock 1-0 win over 10-man Germany at the World Cup on Friday to throw Group D wide open. Germany suffered an early blow in Port Elizabeth when leading striker Miroslav Klose was sent off for his second yellow card, shortly before Jovanovic fired Serbia in front. Lukas Podolski then saw his second half penalty, given following a handball by Nemanja Vidic, blocked by Serbian goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic. The result was perennial challengers Germany's first defeat at the group stage of a World Cup tournament since 1986, when then-West Germany were beaten by Denmark. That year, the three-times world champions went on to reach the final. It also marked the latest setback for the tournament's traditional giants following Switzerland's win over Spain and Mexico's win over France. German coach Joachim Loew admitted it was a big setback for his team. ""We had a lot of problems, the double yellow card for Klose, they got the first goal, then we failed to score from the penalty spot -- all in all it was difficult to come to terms with all this, "" he told AFP. ""We're devastated of course but I'm still confident we will go through to the last 16. we have our fate in our own hands still and a good goal difference."" The result lifts Serbia's chances of qualifying from group D following their 1-0 defeat by Ghana in their opening game. They are now tied with Germany on three points following the Germans' 4-0 win over Australia. A win for Ghana over Australia on Saturday would put the west African side firmly on course for a place in the last 16 -- while a win for Australia would leave all four teams tied on three points . Match winner Jovanovic turned in Nikola Zigic's header from close range following good work down the right by the impressive Milos Krasic on 38 minutes. Two minutes earlier, Germany had been reduced to 10 men when Klose picked up his second yellow card of the game for a clumsy challenge on Dejan Stankovic. Klose, who is chasing Brazilian striker Ronaldo's record of 15 goals in World Cup tournaments, had earlier been booked for catching Branislav Ivanovic's ankles, and suspension will now rule him out of Germany's final group game against Ghana on June 23. But Klose appeared to be a victim of some fussy refereeing by Spanish official Alberto Undiano Mallenco, with seven other players also picking up bookings for minor offences. Germany came close to equalizing in the last minute of the half following a series of corners when Sami Khedira slammed a shot against the bar but Serbia's defenders scrambled away the rebound. Serbia, one of Europe's most impressive sides in World Cup qualifying, had seemed happy to concede possession and defend deep in the early stages with German midfielders Khedira and Mehsut Ozil struggling to find space in the center. Podolski flashed an early volley wide of the Serbian goal and Thomas Mueller combined neatly with Bastian Schweinsteiger on 30 minutes to play in Klose, but the German striker was called offside before putting the ball into the net. Serbia's main threat came from Krasic down the right, with Holger Badstuber and Philipp Lahm both picking up bookings for fouls on the CSKA Moscow midfielder. Aleksandar Kolarov went close from the second of those, clipping a freekick from the edge of the penalty area just wide of the post. Germany pressed hard for an equalizer early in the second half and looked to be back in the game when Serbian defender Nemanja Vidic was punished for a handball in the penalty area in a virtual repeat of the incident that saw his side concede a penalty in their opening defeat by Ghana. But Podolski's low shot was solidly blocked by goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic diving to his left. Podolski had already twice gone close, flashing a shot across the goal from Ozil's defense-splitting pass and then shooting into the side netting after being set up by the same player. Serbia almost increased their lead on 66 minutes when the ever dangerous Krasic cut in from the left to set up Jovanovic but the striker's low placed shot bounced to safety off the inside of the post. Zigic then glanced the top of the bar with a header, again from a cross from the right by Krasic.","Milan Jovanovic scores for Serbia from close range in first half .

"(CNN)  -- The Netherlands came from a goal down to beat 10-man Brazil 2-1 in their World Cup quarterfinal clash in Port Elizabeth on Friday. An early goal from Robinho had put Brazil in command, but in the second half the Dutch drew level when Wesley Sneijder's cross was deflected into his own net by Felipe Melo. Inter Milan's Sneijder then headed his team ahead in the 68th minute after Arjen Robben's corner had been cleverly flicked on by Dirk Kuyt. A miserable afternoon for Melo was completed when he was sent off for stamping on Robben. The Dutch will play either Uruguay or Ghana in the semifinals, but for Brazil and coach Dunga it is a bitter defeat. ""We are all responsible for this situation but I have the greatest responsibility,"" he told AFP. The inspirational Sneijder was surprised to score the winner with a rare headed goal. ""This was my first header here, I don't think it will happen again, but it was great,"" he told AFP. ""The ball slipped on my bald head and went into the net, a great feeling."" The 26-year-old added: ""If you can eliminate Brazil, one of the best teams in this championship the first feeling is relief, we always believed in it."" A Dutch victory had looked unlikely as the five-time World Cup champions took charge from the start. Melo found Robinho with a precise pass through a static Dutch defense and he made no mistake as he swept his shot past Maarten Stekelenburg in the 10th minute. Further chances fell to the Brazilians as Dani Alves set up defender Juan who blazed his volley over. The best move of the match involving Robinho and Lus Fabiano saw Kaka draw a brilliant save from Stekelenburg, while right back Maicon shot into the side netting on the run as half-time approached. There seemed no way back for the Dutch, but a 53rd minute aberration from Brazil keeper Julio Cesar turned the tide of the match. He totally missed Sneijder's left-footed cross from the right and the unfortunate Melo saw it brush his body before finding its way into the net. More poor defending allowed Sneijder to give the Dutch the lead and when Melo was deservedly shown red it was the end of the line for the South American champions. Only a strong run and shot by Kaka which was deflected away offered them much hope and they might have fallen further behind to Dutch counter attacks.","The Netherlands beat Brazil 2-1 in World Cup quarterfinal in Port Elizabeth .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Hours after he spoke to a judge for the first time about his daughter's killing, Stephany Flores' father told family and friends at a memorial service that he hoped others would learn from her death. Ricardo Flores said Wednesday he had sheltered his children too much from the evils of the world. ""Sometimes we're wrong, and I have been wrong a lot. Because I have permitted my kids to know the good, and not the bad. My kids have everything, but also we have to take away from them sometimes,"" he said. ""Don't commit the error that I made."" Authorities say 21-year-old Stephany Flores was killed a month ago. Dutch citizen Joran van der Sloot was charged with first-degree murder and robbery after authorities found Flores' body in a Lima, Peru, hotel room registered to him. Ricardo Flores, who helped search for his daughter when she didn't come home May 30 after a night out at a casino, gave a formal statement about the facts surrounding the case to a judge Wednesday. Later in the day, about 300 people gathered at a Lima temple for the memorial service. Peru's National Police Chorus sang ""Eternal Love"" while a slideshow of photographs flashed on a projector screen. Longtime friends remembered Stephany Flores as ""a great friend"" with a ""contagious smile."" Stephany Flores came from a privileged family, but was a humble person who was extremely giving, friends told CNN. She once wrote a list of 23 businesses that she wanted to do well in, and then checked them off one by one as she decided whether she was really interested in pursuing them. At the time of her death, Flores had told her friends she was the happiest she had ever been, they said. Van der Sloot was twice arrested in connection with the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, but he has not been charged in that case. Police said van der Sloot admitted that he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail in his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. Van der Sloot is being held at the Miguel Castro Castro Prison in a high-security area where only two of the 10 cells are occupied. He has no contact with the general prison population. Van der Sloot's attorney filed an appeal Wednesday to a ruling that upheld the admissibility of his client's confession and the legality of his detention.

"(CNN) -- A bill that requires cruise ships to tighten security measures and report alleged crimes is awaiting President Obama's approval. The Senate on Wednesday passed the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, after it received broad bipartisan support in the House with a vote of 416-4 last year. Peepholes on cabin doors, rails no lower than 42 inches and information packets on how to report crimes are some of the changes commercial cruise passengers can expect to see after the legislation takes effect. Ships built after the legislation's passage also must be equipped with security latched and time-sensitive key technology. The bill, authored by Rep. Doris Matsui, D-California, and Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, applies to all ships that dock in U.S. ports. Those ships will also be required to immediately report incidents to the FBI or the U.S. Coast Guard, whether the incident occurs on the high seas or at port. ""Current law doesn't pass the test of providing common-sense security measures to the traveling public or to help protect them from crimes committed aboard ships,"" Matsui said in a statement Wednesday. ""Moreover, current law does not provide the support victims and their families need in the event of a disaster. This legislation is critical to providing the security and safety measures that all Americans need and deserve."" The legislation originated with a letter from one of Matsui's constituents, who said she was raped during a Royal Caribbean cruise by a crew member in February 2006. Laurie Dishman, who has gone public with her story before Congress, claims representatives of the cruise line made her collect sheets and clothing from her room and put them in a plastic bag. They did nothing more to help her, she said, and the FBI later told her that it would not investigate further because without proper evidence, it was simply a ""he said/she said"" case, according to her testimonial on the internationalcruisevictims.org. Since then, a number of high-profile alleged assaults, disappearances and homicides have helped earn support for the legislation, Matsui spokeswoman Mara Lee said. Last year, a Los Angeles-area man was charged in July with murder in the death of his wife while on a cruise along the Mexican coast, and an Alabama woman celebrating her 50th birthday disappeared from a Carnival Holiday cruise ship. Among the provisions in the bill related to sexual assaults: Ships are required to carry rape kits and a supply of medications to prevent STDs, along with medical staff trained to deal with assaults. The legislation also requires cruise ships to provide passengers with free, confidential access to 24-hour sexual assault hot lines. Vessels also must keep a log of incidents and contact the nearest FBI field office ""as soon as possible"" after a homicide, kidnapping, assault or disappearance of a U.S. national is reported. ""Safety protections in this bill will significantly reduce passengers' risk of sexual assault and expand the rights of those sexually assaulted on board,"" said Scott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. ""By connecting cruise passengers with the support services available through the National Sexual Assault Hotline and Online Hotline, this legislation provides a vital lifeline for victims on cruise ships."" Matsui's office worked with the cruise ship industry in crafting the legislation, spokeswoman Lee said. ""Having a law that's not going to be carried through wouldn't make sense, so we've worked with them to make very common-sense requirements that they can put in place,"" she said. Many of the requirements have already been implemented by the cruise ship industry, which has been working for years to improve passenger safety, said Oivind Mathisen, editor and co-publisher of the trade publication Cruise Industry News. ""This basically means that procedures that they have been implementing for the last several years have been formalized,"" he said. ""The industry supports it because it's in its best interest that procedures are set down, so in case something happens, everybody knows what to do and there are no gray areas."" Mathisen said negative backlash against the industry generated by the disappearances of newlyweds and young revelers is undeserved at times, considering that anywhere from 12 million to 15 million people board commercial cruises each year. ""If you look at the total numbers, relatively few people are lost at sea. In the big picture, the numbers are small. But we understand that when you lose a loved one, there's not enough the industry can do to prevent it from happening again.""","Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act calls for peepholes on cabin doors, higher ship rails .

"(CNN) -- After a severe earthquake centered in Pakistan's Kashmir province killed more than 70,000 people in 2005, teams from a nonprofit architecture group based in London, England, helped the region start to rebuild. The group, Article 25, worked with local craftspeople to develop a design that could withstand earthquakes and trained them to build the structures. That experience may provide some lessons for the rebuilding of Haiti, where Article 25 is also planning to help with reconstruction, according to Robin Cross, an architect who is the organization's director of projects. As in Haiti, at least some of the death and injury in Pakistan stemmed from local building methods. ""The important point is that it isn't generally earthquakes that kill people,"" Cross said. ""It's generally buildings that kill people. Building design is a way to solve that problem."" In Pakistan, Article 25 worked with local craftspeople to determine the best way to build structures that could withstand quakes and then helped train people to build them. ""By the time we built 80 to 100 buildings and we pulled out, we were leaving not just buildings, but also a capacity to build,"" Cross said. ""Each building we built there was the site of a training exercise for a team of workers -- concrete workers, carpenters, roofers, plasterers,"" said Cross. ""They have obviously been able to take these skills away. In the long run the idea was that we would do ourselves out of a job."" Cross spoke to CNN on January 29. CNN: What is the role of architects in planning the rebuilding of Haiti, based on your experience in Pakistan? Robin Cross: At this point, the focus is rightly on relief, and the provision of water, food and medical care, the basic life support system. ... What we won't be doing is clogging up that quite strained delivery system with the bricks and mortar of longer-term reconstruction. But there is going to come a point very shortly when minds need to turn to longer-term construction planning, and that's where architects and engineers have a role to play. Our work in Pakistan began quite soon after the earthquake. But the important factor is that it's still ongoing, that we need to be there for the long run. ... What we were doing there was working with local NGOs [non-governmental organizations], particularly with Muslim Aid, to identify the most vulnerable members of the community who could most benefit from our architectural and design skills, and couldn't afford to buy in their own construction expertise, and would be most marginalized and vulnerable in the future. So we worked with Muslim Aid to develop a series of earthquake-resistant buildings which could then be delivered on a range of different sites. We put people in the field to provide quality assurance, to make sure that the buildings that were built would be earthquake-resistant. After a disaster there's an enormous demand for reconstruction, a demand for materials, designers, particularly builders -- so they will tend to be drawn very rapidly into high-value commercial work, which could leave less financially strong people without access to building skills. That could lead to them building in a poor and unsafe way, so you get into a very dangerous cycle of vulnerability. By building the capacity of local work teams to build, you enable people to build for themselves and break that cycle of vulnerability. CNN: What kind of buildings did you build? Cross: We were intent on providing an earthquake-resistant home design. ... The buildings are a lightweight frame construction, which means they are able to flex in the event of an earthquake. We adopted the dhaji dewari technique, an indigenous technique developed out of the materials in that landscape. We adapted it and improved its details to make it more earthquake-resistant. ... CNN: How much do these houses cost? Cross: Approximately £4,000 [about $6,300 at current rates] per house. That compares very well with the equivalent house in concrete block, which would normally be used. It isn't just safer than a concrete-block equivalent but it's also more economical and it's quicker to deliver. CNN: What's it made of? Cross: It's made of lightweight timber frame with many cross-facing elements, and the gaps between cross-facing elements are infilled with stones and mud and then rendered over with mud. What that generates is a design which flexes when the earthquake strikes, the energy of the earthquake is dissipated through the many framing elements of the building, and the energy is lost in the friction between the timber and the stone infill. ... A concrete-block building which isn't able to flex is more apt to collapse. ... The other thing that's worth mentioning is that the buildings have a lightweight roof. In the worst eventuality, if the roof collapses, if it's lightweight, it's much less likely to kill people. ... CNN: What similarities are there between the building styles in Pakistan and Haiti? Cross: I haven't yet been to Haiti, and we'll be undertaking our first visit as soon as conditions really allow that to happen, which I think will be in February or early March. But what I think we will find is that there will be an equivalent vernacular tradition in Haiti from which we can learn a lot. I'm sure the problem that we saw in Pakistan is shared in Haiti -- in that concrete buildings have been built poorly, without adequate technical supervision, and have proved very vulnerable to the earthquake. A good architect will never decide at a distance what the right technical approach would be, because it's always important to understand the location. ... So when we go to Haiti, the first thing we will do will be to carry out participation workshops with the local communities, to carry out a needs assessment but also a skills assessment ... so we design the right buildings, appropriate to the materials available and the skills that are present. CNN: It's still early, but how do you assess the need in Haiti compared to the need in Pakistan? Cross: All of the information we have at the moment suggests that the need is even greater in Haiti. In Pakistan, the earthquake did enormous damage, but there was still a strong national government, relatively strong local government and a strong military presence in the Pakistan army with which we could collaborate. In Haiti those institutions were already weak and in many cases have been destroyed by the earthquake. The partnerships which we would look to build with local governments may be much harder. ... There's likely to be an even greater role for strong strategic planning and long-term thinking from architects. ... I should say that you should never see Haiti as a blank slate. You look at the images, you think the damage is so great, it's a clean sweep -- but you should never see it as a blank canvas on which to impose a master plan from London or North America. There remains in Haiti a social infrastructure, an economic infrastructure, even in the slum areas there's an economically vibrant infrastructure. It's those threads of the community infrastructure that we need to find and build a new Haiti around. So all of our work starts with community participation and is part of empowering the local community and making sure that what we design is compatible with their objectives. ... One of the big problems immediately after this kind of disaster is the lack of long-term investment. The funding for short-term relief is good and is needed, but very often at the point of about a year, that funding just falls off a cliff. That's what I'm hoping will be improved on in the Haiti response.","Earthquake centered in Kashmir region of Pakistan killed more than 70,000 in 2005 .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Jurors wrapped up deliberations Friday and will continue next week in the racially charged murder trial of a white former police officer in Oakland, California, accused of killing an unarmed black man. Jurors deliberated for nearly three hours Friday afternoon without reaching a verdict in the case against Johannes Mehserle. Mehserle, a former Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer, is accused of shooting 22- year-old Oscar Grant dead on a California train platform on January 1, 2009. The jurors will resume their deliberations Tuesday morning; court is closed Monday due to the extended holiday weekend. Closing arguments concluded earlier in the day Friday. Mehserle could be found not guilty, guilty of murder, or guilty of a lesser offense like manslaughter. The shooting was captured on a bystander's cell-phone video camera. The video was widely circulated on the internet and on news broadcasts, and it  spurred several protests and riots in and around Oakland. The trial was moved from Alameda County to Los Angeles due to pre-trial publicity. Bay Area Rapid Transit police were called to Oakland's Fruitvale station on January 1 after passengers complained about fights on a train. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale. The video showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer kneeled on the unarmed man. Mehserle has said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun, CNN affiliate KTVU eported. Mehserle resigned his position a few days after the incident and was later arrested in Nevada. He was released on a $3 million bond. Meanwhile, police in Oakland are bracing for riots as a verdict nears in the racially charged trial. An Oakland police department website has messages from the police chief and the mayor of Oakland warning people to stay calm. ""We anticipate that regardless of the verdict reached by the jury, demonstrations could occur in downtown Oakland, and potentially throughout the city,"" one of the messages said. ""We will not tolerate destruction or violence. We live here, and we love Oakland. We understand that the community is grieving, and we are in this together. We will get through this together."" Grant's family filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against the officers involved in the incident. In January, the transit system agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle the suit. The money will provide financial support to Grant's young daughter.","NEW: Jury deliberations to continue Tuesday .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City already had the highest cigarette taxes in the nation, and a new state law that went in to effect Thursday pushed the price of smoking even higher. The state legislature on Monday approved a bill adding an additional state tax of $1.60 to every pack. The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. David Paterson, raised the state tax to a total of $4.35 per pack. New York City smokers pay an additional municipal tax of $1.50 per  pack,  so the new tax increase  means that smokers in the city will pay $5.85  per pack  in taxes. That drives the average local retail price up  to nearly $11 per  pack, according to some estimates. And it makes for  the highest state-local tax whammy on tobacco in the country,  according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Chicago is  the runner-up at $3.66 per pack in taxes, according to the organization. ""I am about to quit because it's getting ridiculous -- who can afford this?"" Coney Island resident Louis Torres, 24, said in response to Thursday's new per-pack price tag. And that's just the kind of response anti-tobacco groups are hoping for. But for some New Yorkers, the elevated prices are not as important. When asked whether he would continue to buy cigarettes Jason Mallor, 40, said, ""Probably. We're all puppets here."" He said he has been smoking for 20 years. Carrie Thompson, 28, reacted to the new price tag by saying, ""I should quit now ... I get that cigarettes are bad. I don't understand why they are so expensive here, we're in the most expensive city."" The tax hike is aimed at generating an additional $440 million in 2010-2011 tax revenue to support health care programs. David Sutton, a spokesman for Altria Group, parent company for tobacco company Philip Morris, said he was ""extremely disappointed"" with the increase that makes New York's cigarette tax ""far and away the highest in the nation."" ""This huge tax increase will make the present contraband cigarette crisis in New York State much worse,"" he said in a recent e-mail to CNNMoney.com. ""And it will likely not raise the revenue projected, as it will provide even greater incentives for consumers to purchase contraband cigarettes to avoid paying these extremely high taxes and will cause further loss of business to New York retailers selling state-taxed cigarettes."" -- CNN's Monika Plocienniczak contributed to this report.","New state law adds additional tax $1.60 per pack to existing state tax .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- More oil than what would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool slipped by the cap on BP's ruptured undersea well due to bad weather on Friday, said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft. The cap on the well in the Gulf of Mexico, bouncing in the rough conditions, captured 20,000 barrels (840,000 gallons) fewer than anticipated, Zukunft said. Bad weather has also prevented skimming or burning for the past two days, displaced boom and made it unsafe to fly, he said. Crews are standing by to resume skimming operations and survey inland waterways that may have seen impacts due to a storm surge. Shoreline cleanup operations continue with limited weather interruption. For the 12-hour period from noon Thursday until midnight, approximately 9,515 barrels of oil were collected and about 4,150 barrels of oil and 28.6 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared. Thursday's total oil recovered was approximately 25,150 barrels. High winds account for the cap's ""wobble,"" said Mark Proegler, a BP spokesman. He noted that forecasters expect rough seas to calm a bit this weekend. The oil is more likely to move east than west along the coastline and, if it rides on the Loop Current, could reach the southwestern Florida coast in a degraded form, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a report released Friday. The Loop Current flows northward between Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico, then U-turns and flows out between Cuba and Florida into the Atlantic Ocean. NOAA predicts that there's up to an 80 percent that the Florida Keys, Miami and Fort Lauderdale will be affected by the disaster, depending on the weather conditions, currents and recovery efforts. It would reach the shore in the form of tar balls or weathered patches -- not as a slick. The western side of Florida is highly unlikely to be hit, NOAA projected. Hurricane Alex whipped up strong winds and waves before it made landfall in northeastern Mexico late Wednesday night. With Alex fading, many in the Gulf states were hoping they could get back to cleaning up the massive oil spill. The dangerous storm had created choppy seas in the Gulf of Mexico and caused hundreds of oil skimmers to be docked. ""We had to stand down because of the storm activity. Now that oil has been spewed all over the Chandeleur Islands,"" Craig Taffaro, the president of St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana, said Thursday. ""We are going out again tomorrow to start cleaning it up. We have to go back out, basically start over."" Newly retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen announced Friday that since June, the skimming capability in the Gulf has increased more than fivefold -- from approximately 100 large skimmers to 550 skimming vessels of various sizes working to collect oil in all parts of the region as of today.To date, 28.2 million gallons of an oil-water mix has been skimmed from the Gulf's surface. Shoreline cleanup operations continued Friday with limited weather interruption. The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa P. Jackson, planned to tour parts of the Gulf Coast on Friday, a day after her agency gave BP a new directive on how to deal with the clean-up of the massive oil spill. Jackson will hold a town hall meeting in New Orleans and tour areas of Pensacola, Florida, on Friday, which is her sixth trip to the area since the April 20 oil disaster, the EPA said. On Thursday, the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard issued a directive to BP on how the company should manage recovered oil, contaminated materials and waste recovered in cleanup operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Among other requirements, the directive requires the oil giant to give the EPA and state agencies access to any waste storage site and to provide specific plans, waste reports and tracking systems for liquid and solid waste. ""While the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida are overseeing BP's waste management activities and conducting inspections, this action today is meant to complement their activities by providing further oversight and imposing more specific requirements,"" the Coast Guard said Thursday. ""Under the directive, EPA, in addition to sampling already being done by BP, will begin sampling the waste to help verify that the waste is being properly managed."" Waste sampling to date has been done in compliance with EPA and state regulatory requirements, the Coast Guard said. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels (about 1.5 million gallons) and 60,000 barrels (about 2.5 million gallons) of oil have been gushing into the Gulf every day since April 20, when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana.","NEW: Containment cap bounced, allowing 20,000 barrels to get by .

"New York (CNN) -- A bedbug outbreak at two trendy New York retail shops has sounded the alarm among city residents and businesses, prompting calls for the city to examine how it deals with the prickly pests. Hollister, a popular clothing store owned by Abercrombie & Fitch in the fashionable Soho neighborhood, remained closed Friday after a bedbug infestation was found earlier in the week, according to company spokeswoman Iska Hain. And an Abercrombie & Fitch store in South Street Seaport also has been closed by an infestation. Abercrombie and Fitch said Friday afternoon the problem in the SoHo Hollister store had been taken care of and the shop will reopen Saturday morning. ""The company has requested guidance from the mayor's office on how businesses in Manhattan should deal with this issue,"" the company said in a news release. ""In the meantime, the company's first priority continues to be its customers and associates."" The incidents mirror a sharp overall spike in bedbugs in recent years, yet efforts to combat the problem have mostly focused on residential buildings, leaving the issue of contamination in commercial spaces largely ignored. ""We've had them in banks, grocery stores, movie theaters, judge's chambers, schools, dentists' offices -- everywhere,"" said Jeff Eisenberg of PestAway, an exterminating company in Manhattan. The problem, according to Eisenberg, is that bedbugs carry a stigma, which causes many cases to go unreported. ""It's like a don't ask, don't tell policy,"" he said. ""People don't tell their employers that they have bedbugs in their house"" -- bedbugs that can hitch a ride to the workplace. According to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it issued 4,811 violation notices to residential landlords for bedbug infestations in 2009, compared with 82 in the 2003-2004 fiscal year. For the first half of 2010, 1,976 bedbug violation notices have already been written. However, such statistics represent only a fraction of bedbug cases in the city, as they come almost exclusively from buildings in the rental market. Owners of bedbug-infested residences are less likely to call 311, the city's non-emergency hotline, which then notifies the Housing Preservation Department. Further, landlords of commercial structures are currently not obligated to report bedbug infestation. State Assembly member Linda B. Rosenthal, who recently sponsored legislation to require landlords of apartment buildings to disclose information about an apartment's bedbug history to potential tenants, plans to address the matter of bedbugs in businesses, though she admits doing so will be tricky. ""People buy a shirt, leave it hanging in their apartment, a bug gets on it, and then they go to work."" Rosenthal told CNN. ""If you buy a piece of clothing you should assume it's bug free, but it's hard on the retailer to assure that it is, because how would they know."" Treating bedbugs can be extremely expensive, and no insurance policies cover them. ""It would be cost prohibitive on both sides,"" Rosenthal said. The rise in bedbug cases is not exclusive to New York. Last year, the federal Environmental Protection Agency sponsored a bedbug conference in Arlington, Virginia. Speaking to a crowd of 230 academics, agency employees and exterminators, Dale Kemery, an agency spokesman, said the incidence of infestation in the United States has tripled since 2005. Despite their name, bedbugs need not live in beds. They generally live within 10 to 20 feet of their hosts and avoid light, preferring the dark security of spaces behind headboards, under baseboards and behind hanging pictures.","Bedbug infestation shuts down 2 stores in upscale Manhattan areas .

"(CNN)  -- Cristie Kerr is the first player from the United States to top the women's world rankings after her runaway victory in the LPGA Championship at Locust Hill Country Club in New York. Kerr carded a six-under final round 66 for a 19-under 269 total, leaving her 12 shots clear of the best in women's golf. It was a record victory margin in the LPGA Championship, beating the 11-shot win for fellow American Betsy King in 1992. Kerr was claiming her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour and winning her second major after the 2007 U.S. Open. She led from start to finish as rounds of 68, 66 and 69 left her eight shots clear going into Sunday's final round. ""It's a dream performance,"" Kerr told the official LPGA Tour website. ""It's like you wake up or you dream -- I can't even speak right now. Winning by two or three is great, but winning by 12 shots is ridiculous. It's obscene."" Kerr made sure of her victory by following six straight pars with three birdies in four holes around the turn. South Korea's Kim Song-Hee finished second with Japan's Ai Miyazato tied for third with South Korea's Shin Jiyai. Miyazato still leads the official money list after winning four times this season, but Kerr has overtaken her at the top of the official world rankings. She went into the major in fifth spot. Miyazato, who needed to finish in second place to keep top spot was impressed with Kerr's performance. ""That's almost too good,"" Miyazato said. ""She's just amazing. I played really good, too, but she is just better than me."" The close race for world number one will continue at the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic in Ohio next weekend, but Kerr will skip the tournament to rest ahead of the U.S. Women's Open on July 8. Kerr is fully aware she will now come under pressure for the top ranking. ""I'm there now, but I have to prove that I deserve to be there,"" Kerr said. ""So there is still a lot of work ahead.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Hezbollah's spiritual leader, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, has been hospitalized in Lebanon and is in ""critical condition,"" a source in his office told CNN. The hospitalization comes after widespread rumors circulating in Beirut that Lebanon's top Shiite leader has been ill and may not live much longer. Fadlallah was born in 1935 in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, Iraq, and completed his Quranic studies there, according to his website. He has lived in Lebanon since the 1960s and became a spiritual leader of Hezbollah after it was founded in 1982 in response to an Israeli invasion. In recent years, however, Fadlallah had become distanced from Hezbollah's Iran-influenced leadership. His views on various topics, including the role of women, are laid out on his website and are considered liberal for a Shiite cleric. But he never swayed from his criticism of Israel. In a letter penned to President Barack Obama last year, Fadlallah said: . ""The size of support and cover-up provided by your country for the Zionist entity has become known. This entity was established on the land whose people were uprooted by the power of iron and fire. The subsequent American policies have contributed to the loss of the Palestinian cause, despite the ratification of many Security Council resolutions."" The United States considers Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran and Syria, a terrorist organization. The Shiite group is a major provider of social services in Lebanon but also operates a militant wing.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Three mortar rounds struck harmlessly inside Baghdad's Green Zone on Sunday night during a weekend visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. and Iraqi officials said. No damage or injuries were reported from the bombardment, which occurred about 10:30 p.m. Sunday (3:30 p.m. ET). The district, formally known as the International Zone, houses Iraqi government offices and the U.S. Embassy. But there were no injuries or damage reported from the shelling, Iraqi Interior Ministry and U.S. officials told CNN. The district was a frequent target of rocket and mortar attacks during the worst of the war that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003. A similar attack struck during a Biden visit in September. Biden landed in Iraq on Saturday to celebrate the U.S. Independence Day holiday with American troops, the White House said. He also met with Iraqi political leaders, including Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and with former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, whose political coalition narrowly won an election in March. Iraqi political factions are still negotiating who will lead the new government following that vote. Biden told them after their meeting that ""you must have all voices represented in this government for it to be successful,"" and noted later that a country's second election -- not its first -- is ""the most important election in a country's history."" ""Now there's a new parliament that's been seated, and when the new government is formed, it will mark something absolutely extraordinary -- a peaceful transition of power encompassing all the people of Iraq, maybe for the first time in their history,"" Biden said during remarks Sunday at Camp Victory, the U.S. base near Baghdad's airport. And Biden said the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq will continue as scheduled, with the pullout expected to be complete by the end of August. But he said 50,000 Americans will remain to train and support Iraqi forces, and the United States will remain engaged with Iraq ""diplomatically, politically, economically, culturally (and) scientifically.""

"(CNN) -- Two high-ranking public officials were shot and killed in Mexico late Wednesday, making for four such attacks in the past two weeks. Three of the deadly assaults happened this week. In Oaxaca state, Mayor Nicolas Garcia Ambrosio and Council Member Angel Perez Garcia were assassinated Wednesday evening in the city of Santo Domingo de Morelos, the government-run Notimex news agency reported. A few hours later, gunmen shot and killed the deputy attorney general for the Mexican state of Chihuahua and one of her two bodyguards, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez said on Thursday. La Linea, the armed wing of the Juarez Cartel, claimed responsibility for killing prosecutor Sandra Ivonne Salas Garcia, said Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz. Oaxaca is in southwestern Mexico and Chihuahua is in northern Mexico, on the border with Texas. Two other political assassinations occurred in recent days. Front-running Tamaulipas state gubernatorial candidate Rodolfo Torre Cantu and a state legislator were gunned down Monday morning near Ciudad Victoria. Tamaulipas, also a a border state, has seen some of the bloodiest violence in Mexico in recent months as the Zeta and Gulf cartels fight for supremacy. In Chihuahua, criminals shot and killed Guadalupe Mayor Jesus Manuel Lara Rodriguez on June 19 as his wife and child watched. He was a vocal opponent of the drug cartels. Some observers say there's little doubt the assassinations are linked to the run-up to elections Sunday for 12 state governorships and municipal and state posts. ""Yes, at least some of this clearly is related to the elections,"" said Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Mexico Institute. ""If you shoot somebody, it's because you don't want that person to arrive [in office]."" Samuel Logan, an expert on Latin American gangs and founding editor of the Southern Pulse intelligence report, said criminals are choosing which candidates they cannot tolerate. ""It's evidence of the reach that organized crime has in the political realm,"" Logan said. With so many offices at stake Sunday, ""you have so many possibilities for peddling influence,"" said Logan, who recently wrote a book on the Mara Salvatrucha gang of Central America and is working on a book about the Zetas, which has emerged as Mexico's most ruthless drug cartel. ""You have to settle the scores one way or another,"" he said. ""If you don't work for us, we're going to kill you."" John Mill Ackerman, an author and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Institute of Legal Research, said he sees two possible scenarios. ""What the cartels need is government protection,"" Ackerman said. ""They are ready to knock off anybody who refuses to reach an agreement with them or who agrees with the other group."" Ackerman said he has no way of knowing what happened in Tamaulipas. Selee said he believes the fighting may have taken a toll on the cartels. ""There are several drug-trafficking organizations that are on the ropes and they are striking back,"" Selee said. ""But without knowing the facts of these killings, it's hard to know."" Analysts and politicians say each case must be viewed independently. ""I don't know if you can connect all the dots to each other,"" Selee said. ""They are different criminal groups [who have committed the assassinations],"" said Reyes, the Juarez mayor. ""We can't say that they have reached an agreement in doing this."" Reyes knows better than most the dangers of serving as a public official in Mexico. In March, authorities discovered a decapitated pig's head wrapped in a blanket. In the macabre package, they found a death threat against Reyes. The next Juarez mayor, who will be elected Sunday, will take office October 9. It's a date that can't come quickly enough, Reyes said with a nervous-sounding laugh. Asked how he's dealing with the ever-present danger, he said, ""With much caution."" The mayor said he is ""taking all necessary precautions"" and has offered protection to all the candidates in the city. Chihuahua state and Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, have emerged as the major battleground among cartels seeking access to lucrative drug-running routes into the United States. The Mexican federal government said in April that 22,700 people have died in the country since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006. Calderon's offensive was a major departure from the way Mexico dealt with drug cartels. ""There's no more wink wink, nod nod. Sell your drugs but make sure there's no blood on the streets,"" Logan said. Nowhere in Mexico are the streets bloodier than in Ciudad Juarez, where there have been more than 4,300 slayings in less than four years. Juarez is the largest city in Chihuahua state, where the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels have been killing each other at a record pace. The city of Guadalupe, where the mayor was killed earlier this month, is in Chihuahua. The deputy attorney general killed Wednesday night also worked in Chihuahua. In February, gunmen ambushed the mayor of the Mexican municipality of Guadalupe y Calvo in southern Chihuahua state. Killed were Mayor Ramon Mendivil Sotelo and one of his bodyguards. Even the police in Chihuahua don't feel safe. Juarez Police Chief Robert Orduna resigned in February 2009 after receiving death threats. For an increasing number of officials in recent days, those threats have become reality. ""We are seeing for the first time a major uptick in the past few months against elected officials and candidates,"" Selee said. ""It's related to the intensifying conflicts among the cartels."" Analysts agree that the violence will continue. And it doesn't much matter who is doing it, some say. ""I don't really care who claims responsibility for it,"" Logan said. ""The bottom line is that this guy was killed.""","There have been four deadly attacks against public officials in two weeks .

"(CNN) -- As many as 200,000 state workers in California could see their pay scale slashed to minimum wage, if orders from the governor's office are followed. In a letter to the state controller Thursday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration ordered the department to reduce the payment of state workers to the hourly rate of $7.25 unless a budget is reached soon. ""These are preparations for the prospect of not having a budget passed this month,"" said Lynelle Jolley with the California Department of Personnel Administration. Without a budget, the July payroll, sent to go out the end of the month, would be cut, she said. ""This is not a scare tactic,"" she said. ""This is based on a very real legal requirement."" The legal requirement was ordered in 2003, when the California Supreme Court ruled that the state controller had no legal authority to pay wages in the absence of a budget. ""His role is to process the payroll that we give him,"" Jolley said. But the state controller disagreed. ""I will not be following the governor's orders,"" John Chiang told CNN Radio, calling the governor's actions dangerous. ""I don't understand why we would continue to impose greater hardships upon the good workers here in California and delay the economic recovery that needs to take place as soon as possible. ""It's my responsibility to protect the state's pocketbook,"" Chiang said, ""and even though the governor is trying to fix a budget, he understands that he had that opportunity, he still has that opportunity, and he should not put people in harm's way."" Chiang said he is willing to work with the governor to come up with a better solution. The wage cut directive would not affect state employees who already have a contract, Jolley said. ""Thirty-seven thousand employees are under a contract that protects them, and the state is currently in negotiations with its largest state employee union, the Service Employees International Union,"" she said. That union has as many as 95,000 workers, she said. If the governor's order is followed, the pay cut would take effect this month, according to Jolley. The workers will get their missed wages once a budget is enacted, she said. CNN's Patty Lane contributed to this report .","As many as 200,000 state workers face pay cuts .

"(CNN) -- As Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama battle over who has the best approach to national security, a new CNN poll finds Americans' concerns about terrorism have hit an all-time low for the post-September 11 era. A poll finds fewer Americans fear an imminent terror attack than at any time since September 11, 2001. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday, 35 percent of Americans believe a terrorist attack somewhere in the United States is likely over the next several weeks. The figure is the lowest in a CNN poll since the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Between 2002 and 2006, summertime polls typically showed that a majority of Americans believed that a terrorist attack was likely. Last summer, that figure dropped to 41 percent. This summer, it dropped another 6 percentage points. The latest CNN poll also indicates that the war in Iraq remains deeply unpopular. Three in 10 voters favor the war, while 68 percent oppose it. Similarly, a third of voters would like to see the next president keep the same number of troops in Iraq that are stationed there now.  See how the poll numbers stack up » . For McCain, who is seeking to highlight his national security credentials and has staunchly defended the U.S. presence in Iraq, the latest poll results may not be viewed in a positive light. ""Sen. McCain's greatest strength is in foreign policy, particularly his reputation as the candidate best able to fight the war on terror,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. ""As the threat of a terrorist attack continues to recede in the mind of the American voter, the state of the economy and other domestic issues are likely to become even more important. That would be good news for Sen. Obama, since the Democrats currently beat or tie the Republicans on every issue except terrorism."" Another potential problem for McCain may be found in President Bush's latest job approval ratings. According to the survey, 30 percent of Americans approve of how Bush is handling his job, while 68 percent disapprove of Bush's job performance. These numbers are roughly consistent with the president's approval ratings over most of the last two years. They also reinforce the need for the presumptive Republican nominee to create an impression of distance and distinction between himself and Bush. Democrats, on the other hand, are eager to tie McCain to the unpopular outgoing president and portray his possible election as the equivalent of a third Bush term. The poll, conducted Thursday through Sunday by phone, surveyed 1,026 adult Americans and carries a sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.","CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey finds fewer Americans think attack imminent .

"(CNN) -- Natalie Montanaro, 52, a research assistant from the College of Charleston, South Carolina, volunteered for the U.S. Peace Corps and moved to Romania in May 2009. Now, more than a year later, Montanaro lives in the small rural community of Brusturoasa, a collection of five villages in the north-east of the country with a population of around 3,000. Steeped in tradition and religion, life in rural Romania is a far cry from Charleston, as Montanaro explained to CNN: . ""It's very old world. There are many animals -- chickens, horses and cows. You have to watch out what you're crossing in front of on the street, especially the cows!"" Read about Montanaro's travels on iReport . Montanaro works at the village's three schools, teaching English to students from kindergarten to grade eight. On top of lessons she gives afternoon conversation classes and teaches the students computer skills after school. But the project closest to Montanaro's heart is the international cooking day she hosts once a month for the 12 to 15-year-old students. ""They learn about different ways of preparing meals, healthy choices, food safety, kitchen methods, terms, tools, and other things like cooperation, timing, dinner conversation and how to set an entertaining table,"" she said. With no supermarket in the village Montanaro has transformed her garden into a thriving vegetable patch. She explained to CNN: ""I've planted a garden with spinach, artichokes, red lettuce, rosemary, leeks, peppers and basil, to name just a few. ""We will use these along with other garden staples like potatoes, carrots, onions, tomatoes, eggplant and cucumbers to make more dishes this summer that they haven't had a chance to taste yet,"" she said. For Montanaro, becoming a Peace Corps volunteer has been a life long ambition and one she has not regretted. ""For me, my service has been a blessing. I have been able to fulfil a promise, realize many dreams, live among kind people, learn from others about new traditions, share culture and time with people who are now my friends,"" she told CNN. ""The children are wonderfully expressive, thoughtful, intelligent, and spirited and the beauty that I've seen here during my days as a Peace Corps volunteer makes everything worthwhile.""","Natalie Montanaro volunteers for the U.S. Peace Corp in the rural community of Brusturoasa .

"Alexandria, Virginia -- Two suspects charged with having served as deep-cover Russian agents living in the United States have told investigators they are Russian citizens and have been living under false identities, according to a court document released Friday. A letter from prosecutors opposing bail for the suspects said that the man known as Michael Zottoli is really a Russian named Mikhail Kutzik. The government also said the woman known as Patricia Mills is a Russian citizen named Natalia Pereverzeva. Prosecutors said that the couple waived their rights to remain silent and made the admissions soon after being arrested at their Arlington, Virginia residence over the weekend. The two were living as a married couple and have two small children. The government document also said searches of the couple's home and two safe-deposit boxes they rented revealed that they contained cash, passports and other identity documents bearing their false identities. Investigators said they found $80,000 in one of the safe-deposit boxes. It was divided into eight unmarked envelopes, each of which contained $10,000 in what appeared to be new $100 bills, they said. The document said another safe-deposit box rented by the two held $20,000 along with passports and other documents bearing their fake identities. Prosecutors said a laptop found in the couple's home had been brought from Russia to the United States by a co-conspirator and given to Zottoli, as court papers referred to him, in March. The revelations are contained in a letter from federal prosecutors opposing bail for the couple and for another suspect named Mikhail Semenko. The pair and Semenko remain in custody in Northern Virginia. They waived their rights to ask for bail in hearings at U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia on Friday afternoon. Zottoli and Mills, as court papers called her, appeared in court wearing dark-green jail jumpsuits emblazoned with ""prisoner"" on the back of each. They did not speak to each other in court. They spoke only to give their assent when the judge asked if they realized they were waiving their rights to ask for bail. Prosecutors had hoped to get the suspects moved quickly to New York to stand trial with seven others arrested in the case. But attorneys for the three requested a preliminary hearing a judge scheduled for July 7. Semenko appeared at a separate hearing afterward. He too was dressed in a green jail jumpsuit. He spoke quietly with a slight Russian accent when asked if he understood he was relinquishing his right to ask for bail. Magistrate Judge Theresa Buchanan ordered that the three continue to be held in jail and cited the government's contention they are dangers to the community and a flight risk. Following the court proceedings, CNN asked Semenko's attorney Daniel Lopez why he wanted a preliminary hearing for his client. ""He's entitled to a preliminary hearing,"" replied Lopez. The defense attorney indicated the government would be expected to reveal more of its case against his client at the preliminary hearing on Wednesday.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba has created a ""climate of fear"" among political activists and journalists working on the island nation, according to a report released Wednesday by the human rights group Amnesty International. ""The laws are so vague that almost any act of dissent can be deemed criminal in some way, making it very difficult for activists to speak out against the government,"" Kerrie Howard, the group's deputy Americas director, said in a statement. The London-based organization reported that the country's court system and penal codes are used to stifle dissent and urged the government to release what it identified as 53 ""prisoners of conscience."" The Cuban government was not immediately available for comment but has traditionally viewed dissidents as mercenaries in the pay of foreign governments. Cuba points to a series of clandestine actions by the United States that it says were designed to topple the country's leadership and overthrow a government installed by former Cuban president Fidel Castro in 1959. The Amnesty report described the resulting 48 year-old U.S. trade embargo against the communist government as a ""lame excuse"" that Cuban leaders use to justify violating human rights. Amnesty acknowledged that its reporting is based on ""independent sources."" It has no first-hand research on the island since being banned by the Cuban government in 1990. The country's human rights record came under intense scrutiny earlier this year after jailed Cuban dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo died following a prolonged hunger strike. Zapata's death sparked international condemnation from Europe and Washington and drew a rare statement of regret from Cuban President Raul Castro. But a recent series of transfers of prisoners to jails closer to their homes, and the release of two political dissidents, have raised questions about whether Cuba is slowly changing policy toward its political prisoners. Last week's release of jailed activist Darsi Ferrer follows a meeting between President Castro and Vatican Foreign Minister Dominique Mamberti, whose visit came amid signs of growing influence by Cuba's Roman Catholic Church. In May, Cuba's Roman Catholic cardinal, Jaime Ortega, described a rare four-hour meeting with President Castro as a ""magnificent start"" to talks centered around the potential release of some of the island's jailed dissidents. Church officials and human rights groups continue to express their desire for more prisoner releases.","Amnesty says Cuban government has created ""climate of fear""

"(CNN) -- Two men have been arrested in California in connection with a string of brazen attacks in the past six months thought to be targeting law enforcement. Nicholas Smit, 40, is being held on allegations of making a booby trap, assault with intent to murder a police officer and possession of a firearm while on bail, Hemet Police Chief Richard Dana said Saturday. Also arrested was Steve Hansen, 36, for possession of a firearm while on parole. Authorities are investigating whether he may be involved in seven attacks believed to have targeted members of the Hemet Police Department since December. No one has been injured in the attacks. The arrests came after police served search warrants on the men's homes in Hemet and Homeland on Friday night, Dana said. At least two more suspects are being sought, and a $200,000 reward for information in the case is up for grabs as the investigation continues, he added. The police chief would not comment directly on a possible motive but said one of the suspects made comments during his arrest suggesting that ""he doesn't like us very much,"" Dana said. The arrests come less than a week after a suspected arson damaged a police evidence lab, the latest attack aimed at the department, according to authorities. The booby trap-style attacks have drawn the attention of state and federal law enforcement agencies, which have contributed manpower to the investigation and money to the $200,000 reward. ""Clearly, an attack on one community is an attack on all communities. By the same token, an attack on a police officer puts all of the public at risk, no matter where they live,"" said Riverside County Sheriff Stanley Sniff Jr., whose department is participating in the investigation. Authorities have not been able to directly connect the attacks to a particular gang or organized crime, Dana said, even though most of the attacks have targeted members of an organized crime task force. Hemet is one of eight local, state and federal agencies that make up the Riverside County Gang Task Force, which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs. The attacks began in December, when, police say, a natural gas line was rerouted into the task force's headquarters, risking an explosion. On February 23, a task force member at the Hemet headquarters opened a security gate outside the building, which launched a homemade zip gun attached to the gate. The weapon fired, missing the officer's head by inches. Subsequent incidents included four city vehicles being set ablaze in the City Hall parking lot and a suspected arson at a police shooting range. ""My personal opinion is that the same people are connected with all of them, but the investigation is not over,"" Dana said.","Man arrested on allegations of making booby trap, assault with intent to murder officer .

"Pocantico Hills, New York (CNN) -- Oil-tainted seas, oxygen-deprived zones, overfishing, mercury poisoning ... these days, the search for safe and ethical seafood is enough to unnerve any pescetarian. For chefs, it doesn't just mean crossing another fish off our menus. The question has become how do we keep fish on the food chain? I found one answer last year, at a fish farm called Veta la Palma. Veta la Palma is in southwestern Spain, at the tip of the Guadalquivir River. Until the 1980s, the land was in the hands of the Argentineans. They once raised cattle in what were essentially wetlands, and they did it by draining the land. They built a series of canals and siphoned the water off the land and into the river. But they couldn't make it work. Economically and ecologically, it was a disaster. In draining the land, they killed 90 percent of the bird population. And so in 1982, a company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. What did they do? They reversed the direction of water flow in the canals; they literally flipped the switch. Instead of using the channels to pump water out, they pulled water in, flooding the canals and creating a 27,000-acre fish farm of sea bass, mullet, eels, shrimp and sole. In doing so, the company reversed the process of ecological destruction . The farm is incredible, with hundreds of miles of flooded canals and thick marshland, teeming with life. I stood there not so long ago with Miguel Medialdea, Veta la Palma's head biologist. According to Medialdea, it's such a rich environment that the fish eat what they'd be eating in the wild. Because the system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing. But Veta la Palma is not just a fish farm; it's also a bird sanctuary. Today there are 600,000 birds on the farm from 250 species. It's become one of the most important private estates for bird life in Europe. You might think a thriving bird population is the last thing you'd want on a fish farm (Veta la Palma loses 20 percent of fish eggs and baby fish to the birds), but for Medialdea, it's a point of pride and a testament to the company's success. ""We farm extensively, not intensively,"" he told me. ""It's an ecological network. So the healthier the birds, the better the system."" But the truest measure of their success is much simpler: flavor. Veta la Palma's fish was the most delicious I'd ever tasted, starting with the skin. I don't like fish skin -- not seared or crispy. I almost never cook with it. Yet when I tasted it at Veta la Palma, it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean, like taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned it to Medialdea, and he nodded. ""The skin acts like a sponge,"" he explained. ""It's the last defense before entering the body, and it evolved to soak up impurities. But there are almost no impurities in our water."" And that's an understatement. The water flows into the canals from the Guadalquivir River, carrying all the things rivers tend to carry these days -- chemical contaminants and pesticide runoff -- and when it flows back out, it's cleaner than when it started. The system is so healthy it purifies the water. The purification is not just for the fish, but for us as well. That river water eventually dumps into the Atlantic. Sure, it's a drop in the bucket, but I'll take it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Barber.","With compromised, overfished seas, Dan Barber puzzled over how to keep fish on food chain .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The daughter of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been axed by a BBC television show after she made an offensive ""off-air"" remark, the corporation has confirmed. Margaret Thatcher (left) and her daughter Carol Thatcher in   Southampton, England in June 2008 . According to reports in the British media, Carol Thatcher referred to a tennis player as a ""golliwog"" back stage during the filming of The One Show last Thursday. The remark was made about a male tennis player taking part in the Australian Open tournament in Melbourne. The term is an offensive word for black people used in several countries. She was immediately challenged about her gaffe but dismissed it as a ""joke."" The BBC said it considered ""any language of a racist nature wholly unacceptable,"" before adding that it had hoped Thatcher, 55, would issue an unconditional apology but she had declined to do so. The remark is thought to have upset a number of people on the show, with one BBC spokesman quoted by The Times newspaper as saying: ""We will no longer be working with Carol Thatcher on The One Show."" However, the corporation said on its Web site that she would not be banned from the BBC as a whole. Thatcher's agent is now demanding an apology from the BBC, the corporation reported Wednesday. Meanwhile, Thatcher's spokesman told The Times Wednesday that she made the remark in a conversation with the show's presenter Adrian Chiles back stage. ""Carol never intended any racist comment,"" he said. ""She made a light aside about this tennis player and his similarity to the golliwog on the jam pot when she was growing up. There's no way, obviously, that she would condone any racist comment -- we would refute that entirely. It would not be in her nature to do anything like that. ""It is disgusting that we've had a leak of private conversations in the green room -- the BBC has more leaks than Thames Water."" The Golliwog first appeared as a character in an 1895 book, ""The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls,"" described by author Florence Kate Upton as ""a horrid sight, the blackest gnome."" Based on a black minstrel doll Upton played with as a child, the character inspired early 20th-Century dolls by several manufacturers and was used as the trademark of James Robertson & Sons, a British jam and preserve maker, in the early 1900s. The term ""wog"" became a widely used racial slur for dark-skinned people that grew in popularity among some Britons during World War II. As late as the 1960s, soldiers in Great Britain's Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders military regiment wore a brooch of one of the Robertson characters for each Arab they killed, according to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan. The term ""golliwog"" is used as racial slur in Germany, England, Ireland, Greece and Australia, according to the museum's Web site.

"Orange Beach, Alabama (CNN) -- On Thursday evening, a boat returned to its dock without its captain -- his vibrant personality and smile gone. On the dock was a wreath memorializing the Gulf fisherman known as ""Rookie."" His family and friends say ""Rookie,"" whose real name was Allen Kruse, was stressed beyond belief by the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf. On Thursday, a coroner ruled his sudden, tragic death a suicide. Kruse, 55, a charter boat captain who had been hired by BP to help clean Gulf waterways and render them safe, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Wednesday on board one of his own vessels. ""Most definitely a suicide,"" said Rod Steade Sr., deputy coroner for Baldwin County, Alabama. ""No question about it."" Kruse shot himself with his own gun, kept on board his boat, which was also named ""Rookie."" He sent two of his deckhands on an errand before killing himself. He did not leave a note, and none of his friends suspected he would do something so extreme. ""He must have had his demons,"" said Captain Bryan Watts. For 14 days, Kruse had been using his boats to haul protective boom off of Alabama's shores, instead of captaining them on the hunt for snapper and amberjack. A charter boat fishing captain for 26 years, he -- like countless other Gulf fishermen -- found his passion and his career threatened by the undersea oil gusher. ""The day that oil entered the Gulf, my phone quit ringing,"" he said last month in a television interview. Kruse told his family that he believed the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had effectively killed his livelihood as well as the ocean. ""He just thought it was over,"" said brother Marc Kruse. ""He said, 'the Gulf's dead.' ... There was no hope that the fishing was ever going to come back ... not in his lifetime."" Marc Kruse and another brother, Frank Kruse, told CNN they believe Allen Kruse would still be alive today if he had believed he was making an impact against the oil that was threatening the waters he loved. ""If he thought they were doing something that was working, that was effective, they were making a difference, yes, but every day there was a different meeting with a different plan,"" said Frank Kruse, referring to BP's program to enlist out-of-work fishermen. Allen Kruse didn't have much choice but to join the program, his brother said -- he used to make between $5,000 and $6,000 a day chartering his two boats, income that had ceased. So, he signed his boats up for the BP program, known as ""Vessels of Opportunity."" He worked for two weeks straight, his family says, but hadn't been paid. Allen Kruse called the program ""madness,"" they said, and told relatives it was a sham. His brothers said he told them that cleanup boats were put in the water close to shore, so people would think they were making a difference. ""It's just a dog and pony show,"" said Marc Kruse. ""Send them out. Ride around. Let everybody see them. Bring them back in."" A BP spokesman did not return CNN's calls for comment. The company has repeatedly said it's doing everything it can to fund and facilitate cleanup efforts, and cap the ruptured deepwater well. Government estimates say up to 60,000 barrels oil could be gushing daily. Anxieties and frustrations are increasing among Gulf residents over the ongoing oil disaster, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The department says it's concerned about an increase in depression and the potential for more suicides. ""We're all going through a lot of stress,"" said Tom Ard, president of the Orange Beach Fishing Association and a close friend of Allen Kruse. ""Just stress, starting a new job with BP. It's something we've never done before, being in the oil business, so we've got a lot on our plate. We've all been stressed out,"" he said. And others might buckle under the strain: ""We worry about that every day,"" said Captain Ben Fairey, one of Allen Kruse's friends. ""There's a lot of people on the edge. We feel hopeless. We feel helpless. We don't feel like there's an advocate out there,"" said Tony Kennon, mayor of Orange Beach, a close-knit fishing community. ""We're bringing in and asking all the preachers and all the churches to step up and help. We have a weekly meeting at lunch on Wednesdays where we invite the entire community in for support. BP is there to ask questions. Folks vent,"" he said. ""But the big thing is we have to love each other. We've got to be there for each other. We can't let go. We can't give up."" Still, Allen Kruse's death could be about more than oil. Fairey said the past few years haven't been easy for anyone in Orange Beach. ""This has been a long-term situation,"" Fairey said. ""This started in 2004, with a direct hit from Hurricane Ivan, then the next year was Katrina, then skyrocketing fuel prices, fishing regulations, then an oil spill. This has been six years that this area has really suffered a lot of stress."" Still, nothing has hit as hard as the oil spill, which has robbed fisherman of their ability to make a living -- and now, of their friend.

"(CNN) -- The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has already claimed many victims -- from pelicans to oyster beds and precious marshland. But there may be one more: a species only just recently discovered. Scientifically known as halieutichthys aculeatus, it is not a thing of beauty. But it lives an anonymous sort of existence on the seabed of the Gulf, some 1,500 feet below the waves and -- like all marine life in the gulf -- plays its role in the food chain. Its more digestible name is the Louisiana pancake batfish. And if oil stays deep under water, the gulf could lose it before it's even officially recognized as a species. While scientists are uncertain what the long-range effects of the massive spill will be on the gulf's delicate balance of life and death and its complex food chain, the little-known Louisiana pancake batfish is a case in point of one species whose very existence is in that balance. Dr. Prosanta Chakrabarty, an ichthyologist -- otherwise known as a fish biologist -- and assistant professor at Louisiana State University, found himself face-to-face with the little fish during a deep-sea trawl in the gulf with the university last fall. ""We were lucky to get four or five specimen,"" Chakrabarty said. ""The variation we found was enough for me to be convinced that there was something new."" With a flat, round body resembling a pancake, as its name suggests, this species of batfish doesn't really look like a fish. ""If you make an oval between your thumb and forefinger, they're about that big. Their mouths and bulbous eyes are right in the front of their heads. You can't even see their faces if you look from above,"" Chakrabarty said. Not only does it look odd; it also moves in mysterious ways. The Louisiana pancake batfish uses its foot-like fins, complete with an elbow, to push off the sea floor. Flapping its tail, it swiftly hops across the sand. ""They're not like a flounder; they are much more mobile, more like a pancake with feet. They're bizarre for what they look like and how they behave,"" Chakrabarty said. Pancake batfish spend most of their days resting on the sandy bottom of the gulf. Chakrabarty says it's impossible to tell how many of them are in existence. ""During my trawl with LSU, we caught probably 100,000 fish and three of them were pancake batfish. It's a hard thing to guess from that what their population is, but since they're rare in museums, they're probably rare in the wild,"" Chakrabarty said. And although it's not known exactly where they link into the food chain, he said tuna and marlin from the gulf have been found with Louisiana pancake batfish in their stomachs. Even a possibility that one small species could disappear because of waters fouled by oil has scientists pondering what such an event would mean long-term for the gulf, and even beyond the gulf's waters. ""All of life on earth is a big book. All the extinct things are pages that are torn out of that book that muddle our history,"" Chakrabarty said. He said what is most upsetting to him is that after 200 years of scientific study in the gulf, he estimates 98 percent of its marine life remains unknown. And with the United States' worst-ever environmental disaster still ongoing, could become unknown forever. ""We know about commercial fish and shrimp. But there are 1,500 meters of question mark between the well head and the surface about the animal life and we really know very, very little. ""We're making a trade-off between two habitats and putting the more fragile one at risk. If we lose the [pancake batfish], we're losing a big part of evolutionary history,"" Chakrabarty said. Because it lives in the deep, the pancake batfish is not threatened by tar balls or the surface sheen of oil -- but by undersea oil plumes identified by researchers from the University of South Florida. On June 8, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that tests done by the University's researchers proved the existence of subsurface oil clusters. BP continues to dispute the extent of the plumes. But Chakrabarty says this subspecies of batfish could be wiped out even if it doesn't directly encounter oil. It lives on small invertebrates that are the foundation for the entire marine food chain in the gulf. And now it may be at risk of either losing its only source of food or ingesting an oil-coated dinner. Chakrabarty says that one ray of hope for the newly discovered species are the oil-consuming bacteria that thrive on crude oil. They use enzymes to metabolize the oil into two products; new microorganisms and carbon dioxide. Essentially, it is as if they are sucking the oil out of the water. Dr. Samantha Joye, a professor at the University of Georgia, recently returned from an expedition in the gulf to research the undersea plumes. While she acknowledged that the bacteria are certainly a good option for extracting oil from the water, she said they might not get the chance to do so. ""At present, oxygen concentrations exceed 2 mg/L (two milligrams per liter) but if concentrations drop below that, it would spell problems for any oxygen-requiring organisms,"" Joye wrote in a blog. And the oil-munching bacteria require oxygen to metabolize the oil. The bacteria also exist in much higher quantities at the surface of the gulf where there is sunlight and warmth. Where this pancake batfish lives, at the very bottom, there are neither. ""Less than one percent of the microbial community in the gulf lives in the deep sea,"" Chakrabarty says. ""It is so cold down there, one to two degrees Celsius, that they will move much more slowly to break down those micro-droplets of oil."" He is currently working on the original description of the Louisiana pancake batfish for the Journal of Fish Biology and says it should be published by August. By the time it reaches an audience, though, the entry may not describe a species that is, but a species that was.","Louisiana pancake batfish lives 1,500 feet below surface .

"(CNN) -- Germany laid down their World Cup title credentials with a ruthless 4-0 thrashing of 10-man Australia in Durban on Sunday. Australian attacker Tim Cahill was sent off for a dangerous tackle early in the second period when the score was 2-0. The result put Joachim Low's injury-hit team top of Group D on goal difference from Ghana, who earlier beat Serbia 1-0. A late penalty by Asamoah Gyan gave Ghana a deserved victory in the opening Group D match played in Pretoria. Germany 4-0 Australia . Forwards Lukas Podolski, Miroslav Klose, Thomas Muller and Cacau all scored for the three-time champions in the most one-sided match of the tournament so far. Who's creating a World Cup Twitter Buzz? ""Everything worked well and it is important that things went well in the first game,"" Klose told AFP. ""We have earned some respect. You could see that we had fun playing football out there."" The Germans have reached at least the quarterfinal of each of the last seven World Cups and appear destined for another successful tournament after a scintillating display. After Richard Garcia had given Germany an early scare, Joachim Low's side almost went ahead when Klose was sent racing through on goal, but he fired his shot straight at Australia goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Moments later, Muller found space inside the box and pulled the ball back for Podolski, who fired a first-time shot through the palms of Schwarzer and into the roof of the net. Garcia and Jason Culina both had half chances for the Australians before Klose almost gave Germany a 2-0 lead. Playmaker Mesut Ozil, one of the game's outstanding players, fed the ball to Podolski, whose low cross was fired wastefully wide by the unmarked Klose. But Klose did not have to wait long for his 11th goal in World Cup finals. Lahm whipped in a fine cross from the right and the Bayern Munich striker darted in ahead of Schwarzer before planting his header into the top corner. Australia made a bright start to the second period and were denied a penalty when the ball appeared to strike the hand of Germany defender Per Mertesacker. Moments later Brett Holman worked some space for himself but dragged his left-footed shot wide. After 55 minutes, Australia were reduced to 10 men when Cahill clattered into Bastian Schweinsteiger and was shown a straight red card by Mexican referee Marco Rodriguez. That decision effectively ended the game as a contest and it was no surprise when Germany extended their lead, as Muller swivelled inside the area and planted a low shot off the inside of a post. Brazilian-born substitute Cacau was the next to get on the scoresheet, turning in a low cross from Ozil. Low's men cruised their way through the rest of the match to record their sixth straight victory in the opening game of a World Cup. Ghana 1-0 Serbia . Striker Gyan, who plays for French club Rennes, emphatically converted the winner from the spot past Vladimir Stojkovic in the 84th minute to the obvious delight of the partisan crowd. The victory was the first by an African team at this year's World Cup. Ghana were awarded their penalty after Serbia substitute Zdravko Kuzmanovic needlessly hand-balled a cross which looked to be drifting harmlessly out of his team's penalty area. Amid delirious celebrations of the African supporters in the Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Serbia struggled to find an equalizer and it was Ghana, the four-time African champions, who should have made it 2-0 before the final whistle. Ghana -- popularly known as the Black Stars -- started the match at a high tempo and created chances throughout the match, never allowing the Serbian defense to settle. This attacking pattern was set early on when Rosenborg midfielder Anthony Annan volleyed the ball wide after two minutes and Ghana's captain John Mensah headed a free kick wide of the far post in the 19th minute. Ghana continued to press forward in the second half and came closest to scoring when Gyan rose high above the Serbian defense meeting a long throw from John Pantsil, only to head the ball just wide of Stojkovic's left post. Serbia created fewer chances than their opponents but probably had the better opportunities to score. CNN's World Sport blog . The giant Serbia striker Nikola Zigic should have given his country the lead in the 58th minute when he met Dejan Stankovic's cross at the far post but his control let him down and the ball dribbled away to safety. And later, when Serbia had been reduced to 10 men after Aleksandar Lukovic received his second yellow card in the 73rd minute, Serbia squandered a fantastic opportunity to break the deadlock. Striker, Danko Lazovic broke away from Fulham's John Pantsil on the left goal-line and managed to cut the ball back into the middle of the area which Milos Krasic then struck fiercely at goalkeeper Richard Kingson, who parried the ball to safety. The resulting corner saw Manchester United's Nemanja Vidic narrowly head over the crossbar. Serbia meet Germany next Friday in Port Elizabeth, while Ghana play Australia in Rustenburg on Saturday.","Germany thrash Australia 4-0 in their opening game of the 2010 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Russia began to cut off natural gas supplies to Belarus on Monday as talks over unpaid debts continued, Russian state media reported. President Dmitry Medvedev gave the order for Russian energy giant Gazprom to start restricting gas supplies, company CEO Alexei Miller said, according to official Russian news agency RIA-Novosti. Miller said the cut, which began Monday, will be ""gradual, daily and proportional to the volume of debt."" Belarus has refused to pay Russian gas rates of $169 per 1,000 cubic meters for the first quarter of the year and $185 for the second quarter, RIA-Novosti reported.  The former Soviet republic has instead been paying $150 since Jan. 1, ringing up a large debt in the process. Russia's action could hurt customers farther down the pipeline. Belarus has said it will be technologically unable to ensure complete natural gas transit to Europe, if Russia cuts gas supplies to Belarus by 85 percent, state media reported. In the past, other countries including Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Romania, Greece and Turkey have complained that their gas supplies have been affected as Russia trimmed output to upstream customers like Belarus and Ukraine. Gazprom is the world's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas -- and Russia's most powerful company. It controls 20 percent of the world's natural gas reserves and operates the world's largest gas distribution network covering an area from Europe to the Far East, according to its website. Gazprom exports energy to 32 countries and provides around 25 percent of the European Union's gas supplies. Formed in 1989 to replace the Soviet Ministry of the Gas Industry, Gazprom is closely tied to the Russian government, which owns a controlling 50 percent stake in the company.  Medvedev is a former Gazprom chairman. In recent years, an increasingly confident Moscow has used Gazprom to assert its authority over Russia's former sphere of influence by offering heavily subsidized gas to ex-Soviet countries. But that policy has led to disputes as Gazprom has then sought to raise prices. Gazprom has switched off gas supplies to another former republic -- Ukraine -- several times in recent years in a row over payments and Kiev's rejection of proposals to hike rates.  Those disputes ended earlier this year when Russia agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to Ukraine, in exchange for permission to extend Russia's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Ukraine, for 25 years.","NEW:  Belarus says it can't guarantee natural gas transit to Europe .

"Rio Largo, Brazil (CNN) -- In response to severe flooding in northeastern Brazil that has left 46 people dead, the government on Thursday announced the release of 500 million reais (U.S. $277 million) to help victims, national civil defense officials said. The money comes on top of a previous 50 million reais (U.S. $27.7 million) destined for the two hardest-hit states, Pernambuco and Alagoas. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday also signed an interim measure of 1 billion reais (U.S. $555 million) to purchase construction material and equipment for businesses affected by the floods. Aid has also been pledged by the Organization of American States and the United States, which offered $50,000. The death toll from the flooding grew to 46 Thursday, and more than 150,000 people have been left homeless or displaced, according to the government-run Agencia Brasil news service. More than 600 people are still missing, the news service said, citing the nation's civil defense agency. More than 80,000 residents have been left homeless or displaced in Pernambuco state and about 74,000 have met a similar fate in Alagoas state, the news agency said. In Alagoas, more than 11,000 homes have been destroyed and another 7,000 damaged, Agencia Brasil said. Nearly 11,500 houses and 79 bridges have been damaged or destroyed in neighboring Pernambuco, the news outlet said. Twenty-nine people have lost their lives in Alagoas and more than 600 are missing, Agencia Brasil said. In Pernambuco, 17 people have died. Fifty-four cities have been affected in Pernambuco and a state of public calamity has been declared in 30. In the Alagoas city of Rio Largo, some survivors searched for the missing Wednesday. Among those who have not been found were Weltgom Melo's parents, who were dragged away by a heavy current while shopping for food. ""I only ask God for help in finding them,"" Melo told CNN. ""It's difficult. All I can do is wait for the Civil Defense and firefighters to do their job and help me find the bodies."" Cicero Aciolo lives next to the Mundau River, which cuts through Rio Largo. He had to run for his life when the water started rising quickly. ""We ran next door and we saw how the water was beginning to rise and we had to climb over walls to save our lives,"" he said. Another survivor said she barely had time to escape. ""Ten minutes,"" Marcia de Araujo said. ""Ten minutes! Ten minutes! Just enough time to leave home and reach the neighbor's house. That's how strong the flooding was."" The rain that started late last week has stopped and the enormous task of reconstruction is beginning.

"Toronto, Ontario (CNN) -- The spotlight is on security -- as well as economic recovery plans -- as leaders from the world's biggest economies gather in Toronto for a pair of summits this weekend. Leaders have begun arriving for the G-8 summit, which begins Friday, followed by the G-20 summit this weekend. Security, already a major concern, was thrown into greater focus Thursday when a man with five cans of gas and an array of weapons in his car was arrested near the G-20 site, officials said. Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Sgt. Marc LaPorte said the 53-year-old driver had pellet guns, a crossbow, gas tanks and chemical products in his car, and couldn't explain why those items were there. He was identified by police as Gary McCullough of Whitby, Ontario. Police said McCullough was charged with one count of possessing dangerous weapons -- an offense with a maximum sentence of 10 years. He's expected to appear in court Friday. Despite the incident's proximity to the site of the G-20 summit, there are no specific signs it's linked to the meeting, said Constable Samantha Nulle of Peel Regional Police. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, local police departments and the Canadian Military have formed an Integrated Security Unit (ISU) to deal with G-20 security, like they did earlier this year for the Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver. About 20,000 ISU personnel and security guards are providing security, with the help of fencing and cameras. G-20 countries account for 80 percent of world trade and two-thirds of the world's population. The G-8 is made up of the United States, Canada, Russia, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. When talks get under way, leaders will be hashing out economic recovery plans and some differences on how to proceed. Among the issues: how drastically to cut budget deficits, possibly risking recession, and global financial reform. The United States has been urging other countries not to pull back on stimulus plans too quickly. Britain, in contrast, has recently joined other European countries in announcing drastic budget cuts. The sessions will offer a first appearance on the world stage for British Prime Minister David Cameron and Japanese Prime  Minister Naoto Kan. Both leaders arrived in Toronto on Thursday. Other leaders are arriving Friday. In Thursday's weapons incident, Nulle said an officer pulled over a suspicious vehicle and discovered dangerous materials in the car. Police immediately sealed off the surrounding area, Nulle said. Police told CNN that another person with weapons and explosives had been taken to court Wednesday, but privacy laws prevented them from sharing more details.

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers Tuesday recovered the body of a child from debris left by a landslide in China's southwestern Guizhou province, state-run media reported. The child's body was the first to be recovered after a rain-triggered landslide buried 107 people from 38 families Monday afternoon. The child, yet to be identified, was found at 5:50 p.m. under rubble in Gangwu township, a rescue headquarters spokesman told the Xinhua news agency. Chances of survival for the others was ""slim,"" rescue workers said. A survivor described the mudslide's speed, which left little time to escape. ""I called the others to flee. But it was too late. I saw some people behind me being buried,"" villager Cen Chaoyang told Xinhua in a telephone interview. Rescuers had to run three miles to reach the site, which is not accessible by vehicle. Rain and landslides continue to plague the region, Xinhua said. The tourism industry has already been affected by the severe weather. Officials have closed 35 of the top scenic spots in the region, Xinhua reported.","NEW: 107 people buried have slim chance of survival .

"(CNN) -- The family of a Peruvian woman slain in Lima last month said it hopes the eventual trial of Joran Van der Sloot can ease its pain and that of another family thousands of miles away. Van der Sloot, who is being held in Peru in connection with the slaying of 21-year-old Stephany Flores, is also the lead suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba. ""I think the pain they are feeling, it's very hard,"" Stephany's brother Enrique Flores told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" from Lima. ""We saw the body of our sister. They don't have the body of their daughter."" Van der Sloot, a 22-year-old Dutch citizen, was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance but released for lack of evidence. Her body has never been found. Van der Sloot has stated to Peruvian police that he wants to talk to Aruban officials about the Holloway case, Aruban Attorney General Robert F. Pietersz said Wednesday. ""I am not worried. I trust the justice in Peru. So, we are just waiting for the judgment,"" said Stephany's sister-in-law Carolina Jorge. ""We are praying that this case (will bring closure) ... for us and ... for Natalee's family, too."" Dave Holloway, Natalee's father, met with Aruban authorities on the Caribbean island Tuesday and told CNN he believes progress is being made in the investigation. He declined to elaborate further. Aruba also will have to wait to see what information may be contained in a laptop computer Peruvian authorities confiscated when they arrested van der Sloot, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said. The FBI will obtain that information from Peru and then share it with Aruban investigators, Blanken said. Authorities in Aruba say they do not know whether the computer contains any information that may help in the Holloway case. Van der Sloot has told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. He said he was in Peru for a poker tournament and met Flores while gambling. Police have said they think Van der Sloot killed Flores to steal money she won. No trial start date has been set in the case, but a hearing is scheduled for next week, when Van der Sloot will give his first statements before a judge. Her brother told King that he's already heard enough. ""He keeps telling so many lies and each time he is changing his version,"" Flores said. ""He just killed her. ... He took money from her. He took ... her car. ... I mean, he sounds like a serial killer.""","Joran Van der Sloot is in jail awaiting trial for the slaying of Stephany Flores .

"(CNN) -- More than 160 protesters were arrested Sunday during a violent opposition strike in Bangladesh, police said. Among those held were at least five leaders of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Officers said they provoked the strikers to damage public property. Security forces used tear gas and batons in some areas to break up unruly demonstrations, Police Commissioner A.K.M Shahidul Hoque told CNN by phone from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. About 18 officers were injured when protesters pelted them with stones, he said. But Hoque claimed the 12-hour shutdown had little impact on attendance in government offices. In addition, rail, river and air traffic was normal, although private long-route transport mostly stayed off the road, he said. In Dhaka, between 1,000 and 1,500 activists held demonstrations in small groups, Hoque said. The largest protest in the city numbered about 300 strikers, he added. Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, additional home secretary for Bangladesh, told CNN that road traffic in the city of Dhaka was relatively less. ""Traffic on the road was not like other days,"" he remarked. Protests were also reported from some other divisional headquarters of the country outside Dhaka, he said. The opposition BNP called Sunday's general strike, the first in Bangladesh in over three years, to protest against the governance of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  The BNP accuses her government of failure in dealing with corruption and of suppressing opposition voices. BNP leader Fakarul Islam Alamgir alleged security forces were aggressive on Sunday in dealing with demonstrators. Chowdhury denied the charges, saying police were duty-bound to maintain public order. In the meantime, the BNP's Alamgir said his party would hold a public meeting Monday in Dhaka as a mark of protest. Hasina's Awami League party-led alliance swept Bangladesh elections in December 2008 in a landslide. She took the oath of office in January 2009.","5 leaders of opposition party among those held .

"(CNN) -- At least 20 people have died and 55 others have been wounded in continuing fighting in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, an ambulance director said Thursday. Somali forces have been battling insurgent fighters from al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda proxy in Mogadishu and the rest of the country. The militants are waging a war against the government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, known as sharia. The fighting has displaced an estimated 1.4 million Somalis within the country, and more than 580,000 live as refugees in neighboring countries, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in May. Mogadishu is bulging at the seams with more than 350,000 internally displaced people -- many of whom are living in overcrowded conditions and on the street under plastic sheets and makeshift dwellings. ""These are the most vulnerable and utterly dependent on scarce aid the humanitarian agencies manage to deliver and meager remittances from relatives living abroad,"" the U.N. agency said last month. ""Hundreds of children are forced to beg in the streets of the capital and many women beg in the main markets."" The Horn of Africa nation has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country. The U.N.-backed interim government fights the rebels with the help of African Union peacekeepers. Recent fighting and displacement has been aggravating an already grave demographic reality: About 43 percent of the Somali population ""lives below the extreme poverty line and one in seven Somali children die before the age of 5,"" the refugee agency said.","Somali forces fighting al Qaeda proxy trying to impose strict Islamic law .

"(CNN) -- Five Somali men were convicted of plotting a hijack at sea and sentenced to five years in prison in the Netherlands, in the first trial of pirates in Europe, a prosecution spokesman said Thursday. The court rejected their claim that they were innocent fishermen, said Wim de Bruin, a spokesman for Netherlands National Prosecutor's Office, noting that no fishing gear was found in their boat. The five were captured by the Danish navy in January 2009 in the Gulf of Aden, off Somalia, after a cargo ship with Dutch Antilles flag was attacked. ""The ship of the pirates was destroyed by the Danish navy, and the pirates were captured and handed to the Dutch authorities,"" de Bruin said. The men are Ahmed Yusuf Farah, 25, Jama Mohamed Samatar, 45, Abdirisaq Abdulahi Hirsi, 33, Sayid Ali Garaar, 39, and Osman Musse Farah, 32, he said. They have two weeks to file an appeal, he said, adding that he did not know if they planned to fight their conviction. They had faced a maximum sentence of 9 to 12 years, he added. The trial of the five opened in Rotterdam District Court on May 25. Another suspected Somali pirate is awaiting sentencing in the United States, where he pleaded guilty in May to hijacking and kidnapping. Prosecutors say Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse led an attack on a U.S.-flagged vessel, the Maersk Alabama, off the coast of Africa last year. He pleaded guilty May 19 in a New York federal court to felony counts of hijacking maritime vessels, kidnapping and hostage-taking for his role in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean on April 8, 2009. Muse faces a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars when he is sentenced October 19. The pirates who were tried in the Netherlands spent four weeks aboard the Danish navy ship after their capture before being taken to the Netherlands, spokesman de Bruin said. They were held in pre-trial custody while the court interviewed witnesses from the Danish navy and seamen on the Dutch Antilles cargo ship that was under attack, he said. Five Dutch defense lawyers represented the suspects, he said. The trial is the first of its kind in Europe, he said. Germany will soon try 10 suspected pirates who were captured in the Gulf of Aden earlier this year. They were arrested after their attempt to board a German cargo vessel, but the Danish navy ended the hijacking and handed them over to the Dutch authorities, Bruin said. They have since been held in the Netherlands, and Germany requested their extradition about two months ago. CNN's Eileen Hsieh contributed to this report.","NEW: Pirates have two weeks to appeal .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In December 2000, Jose Guevara, a former Venezuelan intelligence agent, was introduced by his second cousin to an international fugitive, the target of an international manhunt. Then, spurred in part by the allure of a $5 million reward, Guevara helped authorities capture the fugitive, former Peruvian spy master Vladimiro Montesinos. Montesinos' capture was considered a success -- he had been convicted of an illegal arms trade, embezzlement and abuse of power, among others -- and arguably could not have been accomplished without Guevara's help. Now, nearly 10 years later, Guevara has not seen a penny of the reward money, and is increasingly unlikely to ever reap his reward. A U.S. appeals court last week ruled that a lawsuit brought by Guevara against Peru is invalid, dashing his attempt to recoup the money. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday overturned a district court ruling that found Peru should cough up the cash. The U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction over the case because Peru has sovereign immunity, the three-judge panel found, noting that the facts of the case ""read like the latest spy thriller."" It all began in the second half of 2000, as the government of then-Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori began to crumble. The autocratic leader had seen some cracks in his armor, but his government fell apart after videos of Montesinos, his powerful spy chief, were leaked, showing him bribing an opposition congressman. Other incriminating videos also emerged. ""Montesinos, seeing the writing on the wall, fled the country, first into Venezuela, then, it seemed, into thin air,"" the judges wrote. In April 2001, Peru's interim president issued an emergency decree that provided a $5 million reward for information leading to Montesinos' capture. It was to be paid 24 hours after the arrest. But before there was a reward, Guevara had a different relationship with Montesinos, as his protector in Venezuela. Initially, Guevera's cousin introduced a man with bandages on his face as ""Manuel Rodrigruez,"" and asked Guevara to give him a place to stay. According to the court document, it was shortly thereafter that Guevara understood that his guest was Montesinos, who had undergone facial cosmetic surgery in an attempt to evade arrest. Guevara agreed to take the guest in, as well as to provide security for him, the judges' ruling states. ""For his part, Montesinos used Guevara as an intermediary to run personal errands and to arrange for the deposit of funds into Montesinos' accounts in U.S. banks,"" the document says. One of his missions was to Miami to meet with banker Luis Alfredo Percovich, who handled a Montesinos account at Pacific Industrial Bank. Montesinos had requested a large transfer to another bank, which Percovich declined. According to court documents, Montesinos responded by e-mail, threatening physical harm. He then sent Guevara with instructions to the banker. They met at a Miami hotel, where Guevara handed over a letter demanding that Percovich hand over $700,000 in cash from Montesinos' account and transfer $3 million to another bank. As he was leaving the hotel, Guevara was detained by FBI agents. Percovich had tipped off the feds. The FBI gave Guevara a choice: ""If he gave the FBI Montesinos' address and telephone number in Caracas, he would be released, the charges against him dropped, and he would recieve the $5 million reward,"" the document states. With both the carrot and stick in front of him, Guevara agreed to cooperate, and Montesinos was captured the following day. But Peru never paid him the reward that it indicated to the FBI it would. So Guevara sued in the United States, and came close to winning his claim. Somewhere in there Percovich tried unsuccessfully to insert himself in the suit. After all, he argued in court, if he hadn't called the FBI, they wouldn't have gotten to Montesinos, and he wanted his share of the reward money. The district court ruled that Peru had broken it's part of the bargain and, even if Guevara wasn't wearing a white hat during this episode, was owed the $5 million plus interest. By a thin 2-1 ruling in the Court of Appeals, Peru regained the upper hand.","A U.S. appeals court ruled that Peru is immune from lawsuits filed in the United States .

The primary problem with the article is that it fails to ask its title question to the right group of people. What makes a man a father is the fact that he has children. Had the writer of the piece, Pamela Paul, asked her question of children, she would have gotten a much different answer. Instead, Paul reaches her conclusion that fathers are not necessary by pointing to some researchers who think there are limitations in the available social science research on families. Specifically, Paul references research that questions the data on the importance of father involvement because it compares mother-father families to single mother families. Even though research shows that mother-father families produce better outcomes for children, Paul writes that it's unclear whether its the father himself who makes a unique difference, and not just the additional financial and emotional resources a second parent can bring. In this case, it is some writers, not kids, who say the darndest things. The problem with Paul's observation is that in the real world, the actual option most people get is between a single mother family and a mother-father family. The research is not limited by offering those two scenarios as the basis for its findings -- it is addressing the reality on the ground. Despite advances in science, the overwhelming majority of children still come into the world as a result of a man and a woman having sex with each other. So, the question is not, ""Are fathers necessary?"" It is ""Are fathers going to be involved and what does that involvement look like?"" The answer to the second question is what makes social scientists so concerned about the benefits of father involvement and the costs of father absence. The reality we are facing as a nation is that one out of every three children lives in a father-absent home and four in 10 are born to unmarried mothers. So, let's ""ask"" the children if they think fathers are necessary. My organization just gave its Military Fatherhood Award to Master Sgt. Rick Marston of the U.S. Air Force. At the ceremony, as he accepted his award on stage, I noticed his 10-year-old son, Jake, was so overcome with emotion that tears streamed down his face. It was Jake who motivated his mom to nominate his dad for the award. When asked how he feels when his dad is deployed overseas, Jake said he is overwhelmed from the pressure of thinking he needs to step into his father's shoes while he is away. His inability to do so causes him a lot of pain. If we ask Jake if fathers are necessary, would he say no? Sgt. Marston and millions of fathers in this country mean the world to their children. I believe that each child has a hole in his soul in the shape of his dad, and when fathers are unable or unwilling to fill that hole, it leaves a wound that is not easily healed. I know -- I grew up without my dad. That is why the article in The Atlantic is so troubling. Good fathers are not just necessary, they are essential and irreplaceable to the children who desperately love and need them. You see, in the real world, we do not have the luxury of finessing research data to reach irrelevant conclusions about families. Here in the real world, we have fathers asking, ""What is expected of me?"" If our society is not prepared to say, without question or hesitation, that we expect them to provide for, love, and guide their children, then we have indeed lost our way. And there is no question about that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Warren.","Roland Warren says Atlantic magazine article questions whether fathers are essential .

"(CNN) -- As Americans gear up for the Fourth of July weekend, coastal areas affected by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are working hard to keep beach-bound travelers informed. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . A health advisory was issued Thursday for all beaches in Escambia County, including Pensacola Beach, Perdido Key and parts of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau's website. Extensive oil sheen, tar balls and mousse prompted the advisory urging visitors to avoid contact with oil on shore and in the water. The water along the Santa Rosa Sound on the north side of Santa Rosa Island remains open for swimming. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The Okaloosa County Health Department  withdrew a health advisory issued June 24 for Destin beaches. ""The oil impacts on our beaches are intermittent and can change within hours or within a day due to the dynamic nature of the currents and changing wind directions,"" the department said in a news release rescinding the advisory. The department urges visitors to avoid entering the water when oil is present. Large amounts of oil washing ashore prompted the Walton County Health Department to issue a health advisory Wednesday for beaches in Topsail Hill State Park, according to the area's Tourist Development Council. All of the county's beaches remain open, the council's website said. Meanwhile, small, scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches and water are open, the area's visitors bureau website said. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Oil has not been reported onshore in the state beyond northwest Florida, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Alabama . Stronger winds and surf from Tropical Storm Alex have increased oiling on Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""While the storm does not directly affect our area, it is having an impact on the amount of oil reaching our shores and limiting the ability for cleanup,"" the bureau's website said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Waters off beaches flying double red flags are officially closed. Last week, the department also issued a no-swimming advisory for Dauphin Island and the Mississippi Sound. Mississippi . South Mississippi beaches experienced significant oiling on Sunday and Monday, according to the Mississippi Gulf Coast visitors bureau. Advisories have been issued for two areas along the beaches in Jackson and Harrison counties. The beaches are not closed, but state officials ""advise people to be aware of their surroundings while recreating."" Visitors should avoid contact with oil. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill, and a public health advisory is in effect parkwide. ""If you see or smell oil in the water or on the beach, avoid contact with water and report it to the nearest lifeguard or park ranger,"" the park service's website said. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","Health advisory issued for Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches in Florida .

"(CNN) -- When Katy Wilson was born with Down syndrome, doctors told her mother that the infant likely would never walk or talk. Katy Wilson says she wants her athletic successes to surprise people and give them hope. She sure showed them. Wilson, now 29, has won two international gold medals in the Special Olympics for her gymnastic abilities. She turns cartwheels for her floor routine and does acrobatics on the balance beam. She also goes on public speaking tours. ""Most of all, I love doing speeches because I want them [the audience] to be surprised just how good my speeches are,"" she said by phone. Wilson's story -- and countless other stereotype-bending stories like it -- is possible in part because of the dogged vision of Eunice Kennedy Shriver and the Special Olympics organization she founded more than four decades ago. Shriver, who died Tuesday, started the organization as a sports camp for special-needs kids and adults in her backyard in Maryland in 1962. The camp, in part, was inspired by the life of Shriver's sister, Rosemary Kennedy, who had an intellectual disability. The Special Olympics has grown from that small camp into a global organization that helps 3 million athletes with Down syndrome, autism and other intellectual disabilities compete for medals in an array of sports. Her legacy will live in the stories of hope and against-the-odds success she made possible through the Special Olympics.  See photos of Eunice Kennedy Shriver » . ""She helped forever alter how people with intellectual disabilities are viewed and treated and respected,"" said Amie Dugan, a spokeswoman for the Special Olympics. ""This is a population that 40 years ago they were beyond marginalized. They were disenfranchised from society. ""It was considered the status quo ... to put them in an institution and never think about that again. And she changed all of that. She brought them out into the light."" An estimated 200 million people in the world live with intellectual disabilities. That population was largely unseen and voiceless in 1968 when Shriver stepped to the microphone to announce the start of the first Special Olympic Games at Chicago's Soldier Field. ""In ancient Rome, the gladiators went into the arena with these words on their lips,"" she told the 1,000 athletes in the stadium. ""'Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'"" In 2007, the most recent Special Olympics World Summer Games were held in Shanghai, China. More than 7,000 athletes competed. The sports competitions are held in the winter and summer on four-year intervals, just like the Olympic Games; people from countries as far-flung as Tunisia, Rwanda and Sri Lanka participate in events that include skiing, volleyball and track and field. Before the program, people with intellectual disabilities were only told what they could not accomplish, said David Tolleson, executive director of the National Down Syndrome Congress. ""Special Olympics emphasizes what folks can do, and it does it in a manner that's fun and exciting and it offers a sense of community both within the family of those with developmental disabilities as well as with the greater community at large -- the volunteers who come in and have some of their misconceptions or preconceptions cast aside when they realize how much people with developmental disabilities truly are capable of,"" he said. The program continues to expand its global reach, but in many places, people with intellectual disabilities lack basic human rights, said Dugan. Thomas Webb, a Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation fellow who studies public policy and intellectual disability, said it's still a challenge in the United States to integrate people with disabilities into mainstream society. No one knows all of the solutions, but Shriver and the Special Olympics have had ""significant impact"" on peoples' lives, he said. Coming from the athletic Kennedy family, Shriver realized the wide-ranging benefits of sports, said Dugan. ""It's just a fun way to bring people with intellectual disabilities and their non-disabled peers together,"" she said, ""because everyone enjoys competition and fun and exercise and getting out there."" The fun translates into experience that helps Special Olympians build communities of friends and succeed in the workplace, advocates and athletes said. Melissa Stokes, 26, started playing sports with the Special Olympics when she was 8. She now is a volunteer Special Olympics ski coach in the Denver area and works as an assistant at the Special Olympics of Colorado office. ""We're like a little family,"" she said of her ski team. She added: ""Because we have special needs doesn't mean we can't do stuff. We can still accomplish a lot."" More than half of Special Olympians in the U.S. are employed, according to the organization, compared with an estimated 10 percent of the intellectually disabled population at large. Jeanne Wilson, the mother of the gymnast with Down syndrome , started tearing up when she recounted the moment she saw her daughter -- whose future once looked so uncertain -- standing atop an awards podium with a gold medal draped around her neck. ""It was just amazing because that really gave her confidence. And I don't think people realize how much it means to a young person who you might have thought did not have a future or might not ever have a chance to walk,"" she said. ""To see her doing a routine on balance beam or a floor routine is pretty amazing."" Katy Wilson, who lives in Gainesville, Georgia, continues to train as a gymnast. She also goes bowling with a group of Special Olympians most Fridays. They call themselves the Alley Kats, and Wilson describes the bowlers as some of her best friends. ""I love bowling because it is so much fun being out there being able to have friends,"" she said. ""It's exciting to do bowling because I get a lot of scores."" When she's not in training, Wilson works at a steakhouse as a hostess. ""I get their coffee, I get their bread, I get their drinks, I do the silverware, I sweep up, I do the hostess,"" she said. ""Oh, I love the job because everybody's so nice to me, especially the managers, they give me hope and they're so excited to have me there and I'm so happy to be there with them."" As a global ambassador for the Special Olympics, Wilson tours the country telling people about her life story. She says she hopes it reminds them that everyone can succeed with a positive attitude. She grew up watching her sister do cartwheels as a cheerleader. She modeled her life in her sister's image, but she forged a life that's all her own.","Eunice Kennedy Shriver started Special Olympics in her backyard in 1962 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the United States will give $60 million to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for help to Palestinian refugees on Friday, a move designed to improve the lives of 4.7 million people. The aid comes as the United States and the international community struggle to provide increased aid to Palestinians living in Gaza. In May, in a deadly clash aboard a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza, Israeli forces killed nine activists. Israel subsequently has said it will ease restrictions on aid going into Gaza but will not end its naval blockade. The United States already is the largest single source of support for refugees and refugees and victims of conflict internationally, Clinton said, providing $1.7 billion last year, including $640 million for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or the UNHCR. Clinton made the comments at a World Refugee Day event, co-hosted by the Department of State and the UNHCR. It included live interactive video feeds with High Commissioner Antonio Guterres and an Iraqi refugee family in Syria; UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie; and a UNHCR official and a Congolese man displaced because to activities of the Lord's Resistance Army in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ""We are all vulnerable no matter how comfortable our lives may appear to be,"" Clinton said. ""But we too, around the world, those of us who enjoy the benefits of the life that we have built or inherited, we too are vulnerable to war and conflict, droughts and floods, environmental disasters as we've seen even in our own country."" Clinton said that many of the refugee problems cannot be solved simply with humanitarian aid. ""It's a question of better governance, more accountable governance, of political and diplomatic efforts, of reconciliation and peace, of the growth of democracies and economies."" she said. Angelina Jolie, with 34 refugee families from Colombia living on the border with Ecuador, said they were ""terrified"" and that almost everyone in the families had someone who had been murdered. ""They are so grateful just to be safe,"" she said.","Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made comments at World Refugee Day .

"(CNN) -- British athletics star Paula Radcliffe has confirmed that she will have a second child this year, but still plans to run at her home Olympics in London in 2012. The women's marathon world record-holder, who will miss this month's London race for the fifth year in a row, expects to give birth in September. ""We're very pleased,"" the 36-year-old told the UK Press Association on Friday. ""We are very lucky that everything so far has worked out as we had hoped. ""As always, when nature is involved it's very hard to plan, but the idea was that we could get pregnant this year and have 2011 to comfortably come back to racing. Radcliffe tells CNN about her plans for 2012 . ""I plan to run through as before but to come back a bit slower than last time, when I was back a bit too quickly."" Radcliffe had her first child, daughter Isla, with husband Gary Lough in January 2007, but has since struggled to regain the heights of earlier in her career. She set the marathon record in London in 2003 and was world champion in 2005, but finished only 23rd at the 2008 Beijing Olympics after suffering injuries in the preceding months. A fractured toe ruined her buildup to last year's world championships in Berlin and she subsequently made herself unavailable for selection, then a knee injury saw her finish only fourth at the 2009 New York Marathon where she been seeking a third consecutive victory. Radcliffe has not competed since then, but PA reported that she is still training full-time and recently trained with top American runners in the United States.","Women's marathon record-holder Paula Radcliffe to have a second child this year .

"(CNN) -- German Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich and Luca Toni have agreed to cancel the Italian striker's contract. Toni spent the second half of last season on loan at Italian side AS Roma after being deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern by coach Louis van Gaal. The 33-year-old is reportedly a target for Genoa and has agreed to a termination of his contract in order to become a free agent. Toni joined Bayern in 2007 and scored 24 goals in his first campaign at the club to become the Bundesliga's top scorer, as Bayern won both the league and the cup. He scored a further 14 goals the following season but suffered with an Achilles Heel injury, which recurred at the start of the 2009/10 season. Toni reportedly fell out of favor with Van Gaal and was allowed to leave for Roma in January this year. He scored five goals in 15 appearances but Roma did not seek to tie him down permanently. ""I would like to warmly thank Luca Toni for his efforts and his goals, especially in our double-winning 2007/8 season,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on the club's official Web site. ""I'd like to take this opportunity to wish Luca Toni all the best for the future at his new club.""","Bayern Munich and Luca Toni agree to cancel striker's contract .

"(CNN) -- Swiss star Fabian Cancellara rode clear of the leading group to win the Paris Roubaix cycling classic on Sunday and complete a rare double having claimed the Tour of Flanders earlier this spring. The 'Hell of the North' is traditionally an event for the strongmen of the sport who have to negotiate 27 sections of cobblestones and the reigning Olympic time trial champion perfectly fits the bill. He made his move on the 10th from last section of pave at Mons-en-Pevele, about 45km from the finish in the velodrome at Roubaix, quickly chasing down a small breakaway group before opening up a winning gap. Defending champion Tom Boonen of Belgium and the other leading contenders fatally hesitated in their efforts to chase down Saxo Bank's Cancellara and their race was over. Cancellera crossed the line alone for his second Paris-Roubaix win and only the 10th man to complete the double with Flanders. Norwegian Thor Hushovd beat Spaniard Juan Antonio Flecha for the runners-up spot in a sprint finish, the pair having finally given chase to Cancellara but too little too late. Last week Cancellara became the first Swiss since Heiri Suter in 1923 to win at Flanders. Cancellara was winning his fourth major one-day classic with Milan-San Remo in 2006, two at Paris-Roubaix (2006 and 2010) and this year's Tour of Flanders. I knew that with my form and the way the last weeks were going I would be difficult to catch once I took a 10 meter lead, that they would be scared,"" Cancellara told AFP at the finish of the 259km race.","Fabian Cancellara wins cycling's Hell of the North with solo breakaway ride .
