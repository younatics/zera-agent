"Prince Charles has expressed serious concern about the impact of ‘rushed’ Government plans to change ancient laws governing the Royal line of succession. Friends told the Daily Mail that he believes altering the rules that give male heirs priority and bar members of the Royal Family from marrying Roman Catholics could have ‘unintended consequences’ that have not been properly considered. He is understood to have raised a series of critical questions in a private meeting with one of Whitehall’s most senior mandarins last month. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles has voiced serious concern about 'rushed' plans to change ancient laws governing the royal line of succession . The Prince of Wales backs the . principle of changing the law to ensure the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge's first child becomes Queen if it is a girl, a move which has . been discussed for several years, as long as it commands popular . support. But according to a well-placed . source, he believes the potential consequences for the delicate . relationship between the state and the Church of England, as well as for . the rules governing other hereditary titles, have not been thought . through. In a meeting with Richard Heaton, . permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, the Prince is said to have . raised concerns about what will happen if his grandchild is allowed to . marry a Roman Catholic, as the Government proposes. Church leaders have previously . expressed concern that if a future heir to the throne married a Roman . Catholic, their children would be required by canon law to be brought up . in that faith. Ultimately, that could lead to the . constitutional nightmare of an heir to the throne, due to become the . Supreme Governor of the Church of England, being a Catholic and . therefore barred from being crowned. According to the source, the Prince . was told the situation could be resolved by negotiations with the . Vatican if it arose - a response he is said to have found . ‘unsatisfactory and unconvincing’. He also raised questions about the . potential impact of changing the rules of Royal succession for other . titles that are currently passed down the male line. Already, several . senior figures have raised the prospect of changing peerage law so that . female heirs can succeed to the hereditary peerage. Some daughters of the gentry are . calling for equal rights to inherit titles, arguing that the new law . will leave them ‘two steps behind’ the Royals. Such a move would cause . turmoil in some of the country’s most aristocratic families. The disclosure of the Prince’s reservations is a serious blow to the Government’s plans to change Royal succession law. Though the issue was first raised by . Tony Blair more than a decade ago, David Cameron struck an agreement . with the 15 other countries where the Queen is head of state that the . rules must be overhauled. Mr Cameron told other Commonwealth . leaders that in an age of ‘gender equality’, the 1701 Act of Settlement, . which also bars members of the Royal Family from marrying Roman . Catholics, is out of date and discriminatory. The issue was given fresh significance by the announcement of the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy . VIDEO  Charles looks ahead to grandchild and speaks of pride of Harry battling the 'nasties' There had been growing fears in Royal . and Whitehall circles of controversy if the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge have a daughter who would be overtaken in line for the throne . by any future male siblings. In Japan, the Chrysanthemum Throne . was rocked by a public backlash over succession laws favouring men when . Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako had a girl, Aiko, . Princess Toshi, who is their only child. The issue was given fresh urgency by the announcement of the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy last month. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who . is responsible for the issue at the Cabinet Office, immediately . announced that the Government intended to rush through legislation using . procedures usually reserved for anti-terror laws. The change will need to be legislated . for in all 16 Commonwealth realms - the UK, Australia, New Zealand, . Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, . Belize, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, . St Vincent and the Grenadines and Papua New Guinea. The changes mean that for all . descendants of the Prince of Wales, a younger son will no longer take . precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession. David Cameron told other Commonwealth leaders that in an age of 'gender equality', the 1701 Act of Settlement, which also bars members of the Royal Family from marrying Catholics, is out of date and discriminatory . Members of the Royal Family who marry . a Roman Catholic will also in future be able to succeed to the Crown, . and an ancient rule that means all descendants of George II are supposed . to gain the consent of the Monarch to marry will also be scrapped and . now apply only to the first six people in the line of succession. The 1701 Act of Settlement means that . only the Protestant heirs of Sophia, granddaughter of James I, can . become King or Queen. It also gives precedence to male heirs. The Act was drawn up in an era of . religious strife to ensure the Protestant succession.  But it has . increasingly been condemned as discriminatory against both Catholics and . women in the modern world. Autumn Kelly, wife of the Queen’s grandson . Peter Phillips, renounced her Catholic faith so her husband could retain . his place as 11th in line to the throne after their wedding in 2008. Other Royals, including Prince . Michael of Kent, the Queen’s first cousin, have given up their claim to . the throne in order to marry Catholics. Roman Catholics are divided on the . reform, with some hoping it will ultimately lead to the total repeal of . the Act of Settlement, which bars Catholics from the throne. But former Tory minister Ann . Widdecombe, a Catholic, has previously expressed concern, saying: ‘If we . get rid of the provision that the heir to the throne and the Monarch . can’t marry a Catholic, we will undermine the link between the Monarchy . and the Church of England which will threaten the establishment of the . Church, taking with it our last figleaf that we are a Christian . country.’ Concerns about the rule of male . succession were raised with the birth of the Viscount Severn to the Earl . and Countess of Wessex. He was installed in the Royal line of . succession ahead of his sister, Lady Louise Windsor, who is four years . older than him. Buckingham Palace was said to have agreed that the time . had come to launch a concerted effort to change the law, even though . that will mean legislation having to be overhauled or introduced in . countries across the world. A senior Government source said: ‘The . idea that the Government would move one inch on this without the Palace . being on board is ridiculous.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman added: ‘We would never comment on exchanges between the Government and the Prince of Wales.’ A spokesman for the Prince of Wales . said: 'Any change in the law is a matter for the Government. If and when . the Prince of Wales meets with senior civil servants it is always . documented properly in the Court Circular. Issues discussed in those . meetings are private.' The publication of the Succession to . the Crown Bill last month revealed the complexity of the changes that . will be required to ensure that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s . child, due later this year, will be Monarch regardless of sex. As well as the Act of Settlement, . several other Bills, including the Treason Act 1351, which was written . in Norman French and is one of the oldest laws on the statute book, will . have to be amended to ensure that causing the death of a first-born . daughter of the Monarch, as well as a son, will be considered treason.

"Claims of innocence: Ex-Marine Jorge Torrez, 26, pleaded not guilty Thursday to stabbing to death two girls as they were playing in a forest preserve in Illinois in 2005 . A former Marine already sentenced to death in the killing of a sailor in Virginia pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the 2005 murders of two young Illinois girls who were playing in a forest preserve. The plea by Jorge Torrez, 26, comes days after he was returned from Virginia by the Lake County State's Attorney, who has vowed to try him even though he received the death penalty in Virginia. Authorities contend that 8-year-old Laura Hobbs and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias were playing in the forest preserve in Zion, where they lived, on Mother's Day of 2005 when Torrez, at the time a 16-year-old friend of Tobias' older brother, allegedly stabbed them to death. The girls' killings generated national media attention, both because of the brutality of the crime and because Laura Hobbs' father, Jerry Hobbs, was charged in the slayings after giving what he said was a false confession following a 24-hour interrogation session. Mr Hobbs spent five years in jail before DNA evidence from his daughter's body linked Torrez to the crime. Earlier this year, Torrez, a native of Zion, was convicted in federal court in the slaying of a female sailor at a barracks in northern Virginia. Tragic friends: Krystal Tobias, 9, and Laura Hobbs, 8, were stabbed to death on Mother's Day. Torrez knew the girls because he was a friend of Krystal's older brother . Exonorated: Laura Hobbs' father, Jerry (left) spent five years in jail before evidence from his daughter's body linked Torrez to the crime . During the sentencing phase of the trial, prosecutors told jurors that Torrez had killed the two girls. They showed jurors photos of one of the girl's bodies that had stab wounds and told them that Torrez had confessed to a fellow inmate that he stabbed the girls. Another victim: Torrez was sentenced to death in Virginia for the murder of 20-year-old Navy Petty Officer Amanda Snell . Illinois does not have a death penalty, but even before Torrez was convicted in Virginia, Lake County State's Attorney Mike Nerheim said he intended to bring Torrez back to the state to stand trial  and that the girl's families supported his decision and even sent one of his prosecutors to observe part of Torrez' trial in Virginia. 'This is important to the victims' families, to the entire community,' said Nerheim, who was not state's attorney when Jerry Hobbs was arrested. 'There are few things that can be worse than two little girls murdered on Mother's Day and I do think this will be part of the healing process and bring closure.' Torrez was sentenced to death in Virginia for the murder of Navy Petty Officer Amanda Snell, 20, a Las Vegas native, at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington, in a barracks where the two lived a few doors down from each other. The 26-year-old ex-Marine also had been sentenced to five life sentenced, plus 168 years, in connection to 2010 attacks on three women in Virginia, one of whom was raped and left for dead. Torrez is currently being held withouht bond. His trial is expected to get under way January 26, Daily Herald reported. If convicted, the Virginia death row inmate could face up to 100 years in prison in Illinois.","Jorge Torrez, 26, is accused of stabbing to death Krystal Tobias, 9, and Laura Hobbs, 8, in an Illinois forest preserve on Mother's Day in 2005 .

"A schoolboy who suffered bullying over his protruding ears has gone back to school with a smile on his face after an operation by a top plastic surgeon. Ashley Watson, seven, was on the receiving end of cruel taunts from other youngsters after he was born without cartilage in part of his ears. His parents said he took to constantly wearing a hood and did not want to go out to play in case he was mocked. But after a kind-hearted surgeon heard of his plight and offered to operate for free, Ashley's family say he has returned to school with a new-found confidence. Before: Ashley Watson suffered cruel taunts from other children after he was born without cartilage in his ears . After: When the NHS removed funding for an operation to alter the schoolboy's ears, a generous surgeon offered to do the procedure for free . The youngster, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, was left heartbroken earlier this year when funding was withdrawn for an operation to alter the shape of his ears. But after his plight was reported in his local newspaper, plastic surgeon Dr Paul Baguley offered to operate for free at York's Nuffield Hospital. Dr Baguley told the Daily Express: 'I knew for four or five hours of my life, I could change his life for 80 years.' Following the operation, Ashley's parents Craig and Nicola have seen a huge change in his confidence and say he returned to school this week with much higher self-esteem. Training manager Craig, 33, told the Evening Gazette earlier this year: 'He is brilliant after the operation. He's really happy now. He wanted this in the first place and it was him fighting for it. We are just unbelievably proud of him.' The NHS says about one in 100 people suffer from protruding ears, which cause particular difficulties for children as they are one of the first parts of the body to develop to full adult size. As well as embarrassment, they can cause problems with wearing certain types of head gear, such as motorbike helmets and hard-hats. Financial support for treating protruding ears varies considerably between different NHS trusts. Many trusts don't offer corrective procedures for purely cosmetic reasons, with others requesting psychological reports before agreeing to fund treatment. Happy: Ashley's parents say he has returned to school a much more confident boy after the procedure .","Youngster used to wear hood and refused to play outside after bullying .

"An innocent man who spent years on death row after being tricked into confessing to a double murder says he finds it hard to forgive the people who put him in prison. Alstory Simon, 64, admitted to the killings in 1999 as a result of an investigation by an anti-death penalty group which has since been accused of using threats and false promises to force the drug addict into his confession. The investigation by the Medill Innocence Project helped free death row inmate Anthony Porter just days before his execution, a case that was cited when the state announced a moratorium on capital punishment in 2003 and its abolition in 2011. That also spared Simon the death penalty, but he went on to serve 15 years in the Jacksonville Correction Center before being released after the Cook County Attorney's Office re-examined his conviction. Scroll down for video . Free: Alstory Simon confessed to a double murder in 1999, mainly because of an investigation from a team of students at Northwestern University. He was released from Jacksonville Correctional Facility last week . As he adjusts to life as a free man, Simon has spoken of his anger at the tactics used by the Medill Innocence Project. Speaking to Fox News, he said: 'It was very hard to get along with knowing that fact - that I was locked up in prison for something I knew I didn’t do. 'It can make you kind of mean, but as time went by I overcame it.' The Medill Innocence Project, led by former Northwestern University Journalism Professor David Protess, confronted Simon at his home claiming that the mother of one of the two victims of the 1982 shooting had placed him at the scene. Days later, private investigator Paul Ciclino and another man returned with flashing guns and police badges and urged him to confess if he wanted to avoid the death penalty. He denied any involved but the group persisted, promising him a light sentence and royalties from a book they were writing on the crime. They also showed him video of his ex-wife and another man who later turned out to be actor claiming they witnessed Simon commit the murder. 'They did everything that’s forbidden by the law enforcement community,' Simon said. 'These people went to great lengths to do what they did to me, and I never did anything to anyone.' Simon's attorney Terry Ekl claims the team, led by Professor David Protess (pictured) framed his client so death row inmate Anthony Porter could become a 'poster boy' for the bid to end executions in Illinois . Earlier this month, it was reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that Simon's attorney Terry Ekl claimed the team of journalists and their professor at the Innocence Project framed his client so Porter could become a 'poster boy' in the bid to end executions in the state. Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez added that the 'tactics and antics' of the investigator, Paul Ciclino in conjunction with Protess could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness at the time. However it would be impossible to file charges because the statute of limitations has run out. Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry. 'I'm not angry at the system. I'm angry at the people who did what they did to me,' he said, crying as he told reporters that his mother had died while he was behind bars. Simon was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison - he served 15. 'Poster boy': Porter (pictured right after his release with Protess) was sentenced to death after initially being convicted in the shooting of two people in Chicago . But the Cook County State's Attorney's Office began re-examining his conviction last year after his attorney presented evidence that he had been threatened with the death penalty and coerced into confessing with promises that he would get an early release and share in the profits from book and movie deals. Alvarez said he was tricked by a private investigator who stormed into his home and showed him a videotape of a man who said he had seen Simon pull the trigger. The man turned out to be an actor. 'In the best interest of justice, we could reach no other conclusion but that the investigation of this case has been so deeply corroded and corrupted that we can no longer maintain the legitimacy of this conviction,' Alvarez said. The Porter case helped lead former Gov. George Ryan to declare a moratorium on executions in 2003, and he cleared death row by commuting the death sentences of more than 150 inmates to life in prison. Gov. Pat Quinn abolished the death penalty in 2011. Alvarez did not say whether she believed Simon is, in fact, innocent, but she said there were so many problems with the case. Methods: Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez added that the 'tactics and antics' of Protess (pictured hugging Porter) could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice . Frustration: Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry at 'the people who did this to me' One of them was what she called a coerced confession and the deaths of a number of key figures, making it impossible to determine exactly what happened on the morning of Aug. 15, 1982, when two people were shot to death as they sat in a park on Chicago's South Side. She also said there remains powerful evidence that Porter was the gunman, including several witnesses who still maintain their original statements. 'As I stand here today, I can't definitely tell you it was Porter who did this or Simon who did this,' she said. Protess, who retired from Northwestern in 2011 amid questions about his investigative methods, has not responded to phone calls for comment, but has previously defended his methods and results. Ciolino, who like Protess has denied acting improperly, released a statement that emphasized that Simon confessed multiple times, including to a TV reporter and his own lawyer. 'You explain that,' Ciolino said. Nonetheless, he added, no one should be in prison if the state did not meet its burden of proof. Advancing claims: Porter spent 16 years on death row prior to his release.

"Researchers have claimed that Shakespeare's portrayal of King Richard III as a psychopath was unfounded - but admit he was a control freak. A team at the University of Leicester, which recently discovered the remains of the King under a car park, are now attempting to analyse the king's personality. They found that, while there was no . evidence for Shakespeare’s depiction of Richard III as a psychopath, he . may have had 'intolerance to uncertainty syndrome' – which may have . manifested in control freak tendencies. The hunchback king: The skeleton or Richard III, unearthed in a . dig last September, showing evidence of the curvature of the spine . and battle injuries suffered by the last . Plantagenet king . They say their analysis aims to . humanise Richard and 'to flesh out the bones and get to the character . of the man who became one of the most controversial kings in English . history.' Professor Mark Lansdale, Head of the University’s School of Psychology, and forensic psychologist Dr Julian Boon carried out the study based on the consensus among historians. Firstly, they examined one of the most persistent and critical depictions of Richard’s personality – the suggestion that he was a murdering psychopath. Kevin Spacey appears as Richard III in Old Vic Theatre in London. Researchers now say Shakespeare's portrayal of him was unfair . 'This reputation, portrayed most famously in Shakespeare’s play, does not seem to have any basis in the facts we have about his life,' they said. They found he showed little signs of the traits psychologists would use to identify psychopaths today – including narcissism, deviousness, callousness, recklessness and lack of empathy in close relationships. However, the academics speculate that Richard may have exhibited a common psychological syndrome know as an intolerance to uncertainty. Professor Mark Lansdale said: 'This syndrome is associated with a need to seek security following an insecure childhood, as Richard had. In varying degrees, it is associated with a number of positive aspects of personality including a strong sense of right and wrong, piety, loyalty to trusted colleagues, and a belief in legal processes - all exhibited by Richard. 'On the negative side it is also associated with fatalism, a tendency to disproportionate responses when loyalty is betrayed and a general sense of 'control freakery' that can, in extreme cases, emerge as very authoritarian or possibly priggish. 'We believe this is an interesting perspective on Richard's character.' In addition, the pair examined how his . disability, evident in the curvature of the spine of the King’s remains . may have had an impact on his character - and specifically on the way he . interacted with people who he did not know well. The . remains of Richard III came within a matter of inches of being lost . forever when a 19th century toilet was built above the skeleton, a lead . archaeologist revealed today. Richard . Buckley, who led the project to exhume the deposed king, said his final . resting place came close to being 'completely destroyed' when the . outhouse was built on top of the site. Luckily, . the grave was only slightly disturbed by the building's primitive . foundations, which missed the deceased monarch's body by a few inches . when they were installed. Because . his remains were buried just 27in under the flag stones of Greyfriars . monastery in Leicester, they were disturbed on a number of occasions as . by builders developing the area. The . 527-year-old skeleton - buried with its hands crossed in a shallow . grave - was missing its feet, which experts believe were smashed off . when the foundations were built. The . site was later turned into a council car park for social workers until a . team searching for the king's body excavated the area last September. A . three-week dig by experts from the University of Leicester unearthed . the skeleton which was confirmed 'beyond reasonable doubt' today to be . that of the last Plantagenet king. But . Mr Buckley said that the king's remains were . almost flushed down the pan when the outhouse was constructed in the . 1800s. He said: 'The remains were very vulnerable because they were only under relatively modern debris. A less experienced team could easily have damaged the skeleton whilst using a mechanical digger to open the trench.' One woman's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of Richard III. Screenwriter . Philippa Langley, pictured right, said she felt a chill on a hot . summer's day as she walked through the area where it was thought he was . buried. The . remarkable discovery of the remains, which, consistent with historical . accounts of Richard, have both a curved spine back and wounded skull, . was made last September. Miss . Langley was strolling across the car park used by Leicester social . services while researching a play about the king when she felt a chill . in August 2009. 'It . was a hot summer and I had goosebumps so badly and I was freezing cold. I walked past a particular spot and absolutely knew I was walking on . his grave,' she told the Sunday Times. 'I am a rational human being but the feeling I got was the same feeling I have had before when a truth is given to me.' Miss . Langley initially funded the excavation of what is now a Leicester City . Council car park because she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains . were those of Richard. Miss . Langley, who is a member of the Richard III Society, is working on a . documentary charting the excavation for Channel 4 titled Richard III: . The King in the Car Park, which has been made alongside the university . academics and will be screened tonight. She . said the her play has been turned into a script for television and . film, which is now 'getting serious interest from Los Angeles and in the . UK'. In medieval times, deformation was often taken as a visible indication of a twisted soul. As a result, it is possible that this would have made him cautious in all his interactions with others. Professor Lansdale added: 'Overall, we recognise the difficulty of drawing conclusions about people who lived 500 years ago and about whom relatively little is reliably recorded; especially when psychology is a science that is so reliant upon observation. 'However, noting that this is the problem historians work with as a matter of routine, we argue that a psychological approach provides a distinct and novel perspective: one which offers a different way of thinking about the human being behind the bones.'","Psychologists claim King displayed signs of 'control freakery'
Claim his behaviour was seen as 'as very authoritarian or possibly priggish'"
"The British bank accused of hiding £160billion of transfers that helped finance terror groups and Iran's nuclear programme saw its share price plummet by 16 per cent yesterday - wiping £6billion from the stock's value. Standard Chartered, which is accused of conspiring with Tehran for almost ten years, had already taken a hammering in Hong Kong, where the shares ended 14.9 per cent down. At one point, its shares were down by a quarter before rallying. Prices had already dropped six per cent yesterday after the accusations were made . just before the close of the London market, but had bounced back 8 per cent to 1327p by lunchtime today. Standard Chartered: The bank is accused of hiding £160billion which helped fund terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas as well as Iran's nuclear programme . The UK bank has also hit back verbally by insisting 99.9 . per cent of the alleged transactions complied with regulations and that . any breaches were 'small clerical errors'. Chairman Sir John Peace cut short his Florida holiday last night to fly to New York for talks with the bank's lawyers before a hearing with U.S. regulators on August 15. Speaking to the Financial Times, he said: 'If Standard Chartered was permanently hurt by these accusations that would be very wrong. We intend to contest (them).' It is understood that the bank's top executives are lobbying the UK government in a bid to win support against the claims. City of London bankers are also forming ranks behind the bank in an effort to defend what they see as an attack by U.S. authorities on the British sector. 'If we don't stand up to it, it could be catastrophic for London's financial standing,' one senior City figure told the FT. 'There has to be some stage where Number 10 or the Treasury says something in defence of the banks.' Peter Sands, Standard Chartered Chief Executive, said 'culture and values are our first and last lines of defence' Regulators in New York have accused the bank of being a . ‘rogue institution’ that broke sanctions imposed on Iran and put profits . ahead of global security and the law. It . worked with three Iranian banks suspected of being used by Tehran to . finance its weapons programmes, according to an explosive report. US . authorities suspect the Iranian banks also funded terrorist and . militant groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic . Jihad. The New York State . Department of Financial Services accused Standard Chartered of doing . business with Burma, Libya and Sudan, which are also under sanctions. It said the London-based bank, which has 87,000 global staff with 2,000 . of them in London, had shown ‘obvious contempt’ for US financial . regulations. The case echoes that of . HSBC, which faces up to £600million in fines for laundering billions of . pounds for Mexican drug lords and rogue states. The world of banking has already been . rocked by the ‘Libor’ rate rigging scandal that landed Barclays with a . £290million fine last month. At . least 15 financial institutions, including Royal Bank of Scotland and . Lloyds, are being investigated over concerns that rogue traders . manipulated crucial interest rates which are used to set mortgages and . are linked to trillions of pounds of investments. In . a devastating conclusion to its report, the New York watchdog wrote . that Standard Chartered was ‘motivated by greed’ and had acted ‘without . any regard for legal, reputational, and national security consequences’. ‘SCB designed and implemented an elaborate scheme by which to use its New York branch as a front for prohibited dealings with Iran – dealings that indisputably helped sustain a global threat to peace and stability,’ the New York regulators alleged. The bank has been accused of operating as a 'rogue institution' by the New York State Department of Financial Services which spend nine months investigating their trade . The watchdog, which reviewed more than . 30,000 pages of documents during its nine-month investigation, said . Standard Chartered covered its tracks by removing information from wire . transfer messages used by US authorities to identify sanctioned . countries – a process known as ‘wire stripping’. The . regulator said in ‘its evident zeal to make hundreds of millions of . dollars at almost any cost’ the bank falsified business records, failed . to keep accurate books, obstructed authorities and committed ‘wilful and . egregious violations of law’. Sixty thousand financial transactions were cited as suspicious. It . even cited a response from a senior London-based Standard Chartered . executive to a New York official saying: ‘You f***ing Americans. Who are . you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we’re not going to deal . with Iranians?’ The Americans have threatened to . revoke the licence of Standard Chartered in the US, which makes most of . its money in Asia and sponsors Liverpool Football Club. For . nearly a decade until 2010 the lender ‘engaged in deceptive and . fraudulent misconduct’ to move money through its New York branch on . behalf of Iranian clients. US sanctions against Tehran date back to 1979 but were heightened following the start of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980. In . 2002, the country was described by former US president George W Bush as . part of his ‘axis of evil’. Standard Chartered was one of the few banks . to emerge from the financial crisis intact. Standard Chartered: The bank has 1,700 branches in more than 70 countries . When . announcing record profits of £2.3billion last week, its British chief . executive Peter Sands – touted as a potential successor to Bank of . England governor Sir Mervyn King – said its ‘culture and values are our . first and last line of defence’. Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said the allegations – if true – would be a serious blow to the bank’s reputation. ‘Coming so soon after similar failings . at HSBC, questions need to be asked about whether UK regulators are . ensuring that the compliance regimes and anti-corruption standards . pursued by our financial services sector when operating abroad are . sufficiently up to the mark,’ he added. ‘It . is highly likely that the banking inquiry currently under way in . Parliament will want to consider lessons to be learned from potential . failings such as this.’ Last . night the banking group said in a statement that it had shut down its . Iran operation in 2007 and had no ‘physical presence’ there. ‘As . reported previously, the group is conducting a review of its historical . US sanctions compliance and is discussing that review with US . enforcement agencies and regulators,’ it said. ‘The group cannot predict when this review and these discussions will be completed or what the outcome will be.’ Standard . Chartered was aided in its deception by its consultant Deloitte, one of . the City’s Big Four accountants, the US watchdog claimed. It said the accountancy firm ‘intentionally omitted critical information’ in its report to regulators. This . morning, David Green, former head of international policy for the . Financial Services Authority, said the bank was not 'evil' but was no . angel either. 'My gut . reaction is they fall in the middle here. No bank of the international . standing of Standard Chartered would want to get into trouble,' he said. 'They . seem to have carried out a lot of due diligence on thousands of . transactions. Would they knowingly help fund nuclear weapons?'","Standard Chartered is accused of conspiring with Iran for a decade .

"Saudi Arabia has placed 30,000 soldiers on its northern border after 2,500 Iraqi soldiers reportedly quit their posts, leaving the country open to the threat of a lightning advance by ISIS militants. King Abdullah ordered all necessary measures to protect the kingdom against potential 'terrorist threats' as the possibility of ISIS taking yet more territory in the Middle East appeared to increase. Saudi Arabia - which is the world's top oil exporter - shares a 500-mile border with Iraq, where Sunni insurgents have seized numerous towns and cities in a campaign to establish an Islamic state which has been condemned as too brutal even by Al-Qaeda. Iraq's government later denied that its forces had abandoned their posts, claiming the border is operating as usual - despite the emergence of footage purporting to show border guards explaining they left on the orders from the administration of Iraq's Shi'ite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Scroll down for video . Threat: ISIS has taken a large amount of territory in Iraq and Syria, as this map shows. Militants are already highly active in southern Iraq - particularly around the border with Jordan - so moving to overrun the border with Saudi Arabia is not an unrealistic tactic, especially if it is currently unmanned . Concern: Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah ordered all necessary measures to protect the kingdom against potential 'terrorist threats' as the possibility of ISIS taking territory in the country appeared to increase . Abandoned: 2,500 Iraqi soldiers are believed to have quit their posts on the Saudi border yesterday, leaving the world's biggest oil producer open to the threat of a lightning advance by ISIS militants (pictured) Flee: Dubai-based news organisation al-Arabiya published a video (pictured) purporting to show some 2,500 Iraqi soldiers in the desert area east of the Iraqi city of Karbala after pulling back from the Saudi border . Freedom: Turkish lorry drivers kidnapped by ISIS were freed by the Islamist militants today. The group were abducted from a power plant in the Gyarah region of Iraq on June 10 . It is not yet known why the group of Turkish lorry drivers were released by ISIS, who held them for almost a month after taking control of the city of Mosul in northern Iraq . Dubai-based news organisation al-Arabiya said that Saudi troops fanned into the border region after Iraqi . government forces apparently abandoned positions, leaving the Saudi . frontiers unprotected. ISIS gained huge tracts of land and effectively erased the border between Syria and Iraq in a similar Iraqi withdrawal last month, prompting fears that parts of Saudi Arabia could now fall to the militants. The . satellite channel said it had obtained a video showing some 2,500 Iraqi . soldiers in the desert area east of the Iraqi city of Karbala after . pulling back from the Saudi border. An . officer in the video aired by al-Arabiya said that the soldiers had . been ordered to quit their posts without explanation on the orders of the Iraqi government. The authenticity . of the recording could not immediately be verified, and the claims were later denied by Iraq's interior minister Brigadier General Saad Maan, who told the BBC that the border was operating as normal. On Tuesday, the leader of ISIS called on Muslims to come to the territory his group has seized to help . build an Islamic state, declaring: 'The earth is Allah's.' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who now refers to himself as Caliph Ibrahim following ISIS' claim it had established a caliphate in the Middle East, said in a 19-minute audiotape: 'Muslims, rush to your state. Yes, it is your . state.' Panic: Citizens fleeing ISIS militants in the northern Iraqi cities of Mosul and Tal Afar try to enter a temporary displacement camp yesterday. The group were blocked from doing so by Kurdish soldiers . Displaced: Hundreds of people around Iraq have fled their homes in the wake of huge advances by ISIS, whose campaign to establish a caliphate in the Middle East has been condemned as too extreme even by Al-Qaeda . New era: News that ISIS had declared its territory a caliphate was described by one expert, Charles Lister, as 'the most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11 . In the audio, posted on militant websites which have been used by the group before, the leader makes a special call to those with practical skills - such as scholars, judges, doctors, engineers and people with military and administrative expertise - to come 'answer the dire need of the Muslims for them'. Urging Muslims around the world to travel to the Middle East to join the Islamic state, al-Baghdadi goes on to say: 'Rush, because Syria is not for the Syrians and Iraq is not for the Iraqis'. He also calls on jihadists to increase fighting in the holy month of Ramadan, which began on Sunday. He said: 'In this virtuous month or in any other month, there is no deed better than jihad in the path of Allah, so take advantage of this opportunity and walk the path of you righteous predecessors. 'So to arms, to arms, soldiers of the Islamic, fight, fight.' The tape was released online two days after the organisation unilaterally declared the establishment of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the land it controls, changing its name to the Islamic State. It also proclaimed al-Baghdadi the caliph - the head of state in a caliphate - and demanded that all Muslims around the world pledge allegiance to him. Leader: ISIS have declared the group's chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured left and right), the head of the new caliphate under the name Caliph Ibrahim and called on all Muslims around the world to swear loyalty to him . Missile: Photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the Syrian city of Raqqa - the proclaimed capital of the new Sunni Muslim caliphate . Caliphate plans: A map purportedly showing the areas ISIS plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online. As well as the Middle East, North Africa and large areas of Asia, it also reveals ISIS' ambition to extend into Europe. Spain, which was Muslim-ruled until the late 15th Century, would form part of the caliphate, as would the Balkan states and eastern Europe, up to and including Austria . The voice resembled that on other . audiotapes said to be by al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi militant who has rarely . been photographed or appeared in public. News that ISIS had declared their territory a caliphate was described by Middle East expert Charles Lister as the 'most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11'. Upon declaring a caliphate, the Sunni militants demanded allegiance from Muslims around the world. With brutal efficiency, ISIS has carved out a large chunk of territory that has effectively erased the border between Iraq and Syria and laid the foundations of its proto-state. Now that it feels it has secure the territory under its control, the group announced it would be changing its name from the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (also known as the Levant), to just the Islamic State, in order to appear less regional. 'The legality of all emirates, groups, states and organizations becomes null by the expansion of the caliph's authority and the arrival of its troops to their areas,' spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani said. 'Listen to your caliph and obey him. Support your state, which grows every day,' he added in an audio statement posted online. Al-Adnani loosely defined the state territory as running from northern Syria to the Iraqi province of Diyala - a vast stretch of land straddling the border that is already largely under ISIS control. However a map released later the same day purported to show ISIS' ambitious five-year expansion plan - which detailed a desire to control all of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as India and parts of China in the East, and Spain and eastern Europe in the West.","King Abdullah orders all necessary measures to stop an invasion by ISIS .

"Brits drink too much, have bad eating habits, are ignorant, intolerant and too nationalistic, a survey of foreigners has found. People overseas are none too keen on UK weather or food either, however it is a relief that they think people from the United Kingdom are still very polite. The poll carried out for the British Council found politeness and good manners are the best characteristics of British people, who are also seen as educated and skilled. Boozy: Foreigners see Brits as hard-drinking, ignorant and intolerant, a British Council survey has found . Its report, As Others See Us, was based on responses by more than 5,000 people aged 18 to 34 in Brazil, China, Germany, India and the U.S. Asked for their views on people in the UK, those surveyed put drinking too much as the worst characteristic, followed by bad eating habits, ignorance of other cultures, too nationalistic and intolerance toward people from other countries. On the plus side, 46 per cent put politeness and good manners as the best characteristic, while 37 per cent reckoned Britons are educated and skilled, 31 per cent saw them as friendly, 27 per cent said they respected the rule of law and 25 per cent said they had a good sense of humour. When asked to name a person they were interested in and associate with UK arts and culture, young people overseas most commonly came up William Shakespeare, followed by the Queen and David Beckham. Former England international David Beckham is one of Britain's most recognisable figures to foreigners . Head of state: Along with Beckham, the Queen is seen as the face of Britain, according to foreigners surveyed by the British Council . The name that came up most commonly when young foreigners were asked to name a person they were interested in and associate with UK arts and culture was William Shakespeare . Here are the negative characteristics foreigners associate with Brits: . Drink too much alcohol (27% thought so) Bad eating habits (23%) Too nationalistic (22%) Ignorant of other cultures (22%) Intolerant towards people from other countries (20%) Rude (17%) Unfriendly (13%) Complain too much (13%) Too pessimistic (11%) Lazy (10%) Other names familiar to foreigners were Adele, the Beatles, Paul McCartney and Elton John, while JK Rowling, Banksy, Tracy Emin and Winston Churchill. Culture and history were seen as the UK's most attractive features, with weather and food its least. A wider survey that included young adults in Britain as well as the other five countries showed that, in terms of overall 'attractiveness', the UK was ranked second only to the USA, sharing joint second place with Australia. With respondents not permitted to rate their own country, France was in fourth place and Italy fifth. British Council strategy director John Worne said: 'This research confirms culture and education are among the UK's biggest assets in attracting people from important countries to the UK's future. 'But, while there's a lot to be proud of, some stereotypes still colour the way that we're viewed overseas.' In the report's foreword, chairman Vikki Heywood said: 'As a nation, our influence today and in the future can be well served by aspiring to be one of the most attractive countries globally - sharing the best of our culture and values with people around the world and learning from the values and cultures of others. 'I am delighted to introduce this new research that gives us an indication of how we are viewed in the world and provides many lessons to support our aspirations for increased global influence.'","People overseas are none too keen on UK weather or food either .

"Count Dracula’s Transylvanian castle has been put on the market by its Romanian archduke owner - with a reported asking price of at least £47million. Hilltop fortress Bran Castle is the eastern European country’s biggest tourist attraction and attracts 560,000 visitors annually. Mark Meyer, of Herzfeld and Rubin, a New York law firm handling the sale, said: ‘If someone comes in with a reasonable offer, we will look at who they are, what they are proposing, and will seriously entertain the idea.’ Bran Castle in Bran, Romania has been put on the market with a £47m price tag. Bran Castle attracts more than half a million vampire fans to the eastern European country each year . Archduke Dominic von Habsburg and his family care very much for the castle, and it's in far better shape now than it was when run by the government . Members of the Habsburg family, Elizabeth, Dominic and Mary Magdalena in the courtyard of Bran Castle . Previous owners of the castle, which dates back to 1211, range from Saxons to Hungarians and Teutonic knights. Bloodsucking vampire Count Dracula may be fictional but he is said to have been based on the sadistic Vlad the Impaler, prince of Wallachia in the 15th century. Actor Christopher Lee, right, is often regarded as the best on-screen Dracula . Bram Stoker is believed to have based his description of Dracula’s castle as ‘. . . on the very edge of a terrific precipice . . . with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm [with] silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests’ on that of Bran. In the days of Romania’s Habsburg royal family, Bran Castle was given to Queen Marie, the last Queen consort of Romania and granddaughter of Queen Victoria. When she died of cirrhosis, on July 18, 1938, she bequeathed the castle to her daughter Princess Ileana. But after the Communists came to power in 1948, the family was given 24 hours to leave the country. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Bran Castle was restored to them - and Ileana’s son Dominic and daughters Maria Magdalena and Elizabeth have been running it ever since. All three children are now in their 70s and want a new owner to continue their ambitious vision for the site’s future. They are understood to have offered the Romanian government the chance to buy it for £47million but are seeking alternative offers. Mr Meyer said: ‘Archduke Dominic and his family care very much for the castle, and it’s in far better shape now than it was when run by the government. Bran Castle attracts over half a million visitors every year and is on sale for offers in the region of £47m . ‘The aim, though, is to take the whole thing a stage further and make Bran the kind of place people will stay for two or three days.’ He said that there is land for a small hotel, adding: ‘We’re also installing a glass elevator that will lead to a tunnel in the mountain, with a light show featuring Dracula and the whole history of the place.’ In 1920, the castle became a royal residence within the Kingdom of Romania. It was the favourite home and retreat of Queen Marie of Romania .

"Vice President Joe Biden has spent more than a million dollars of taxpayers' money taking weekend and day trips to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, according a new book. Dubbed the 'Wilmington Shuttle' by Secret Service agents and Air Force on the Vice President's service, a new book by New York Times bestselling author Ron Kessler alleges that Biden once made a same-day trip to and from Wilmington so he could play golf with the president. The recorded cost of that trip alone was $12,406, Kessler writes in a chapter of his not-yet-released book The First Family Detail. 'Wilmington Shuttle': A new book claims Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here in April, uses Air Force Two and Marine Two like a taxi service and wastes thousands of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary trips to and from his home in Wilmington, Delaware . The book, The First Family Detail, comes out on August 5 . In The . First Family Detail, Kessler, an award winning investigative journalist, . dishes on several of Biden's dirty little secrets, including his . affinity for skinny dipping and for taking private trips on his taxpayer funded helicopter and plane 'as if taking a taxi.' Kessler claims a Secret Service agent told him that every Friday Biden takes the Marine Two helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where he boards Air Force Two and flies home to Delaware. He then retraces his steps and goes back to Washington, D.C. at the end of the weekend. 'The cost of the flights is doubled because after dropping him off in Delaware or picking him up at Andrews, the Air Force has to fly the plane empty,' Kessler explains. Biden frequently makes same-day trips on the plane as well, a Secret Service agent reportedly told Kessler. ' ""The Air Force Two guys pull their hair out over this,"" ' Kessler quotes the agent as having said. One such same-day trip allegedly took place on Friday, February 8, 2013. Biden's official public schedule has him receiving the presidential daily briefing  with President Barack Obama at 10:30 a.m.and having lunch with Obama at 1 p.m. There's nothing else on his schedule after that and no news reports documenting any public appearances from that day, suggesting that Biden may very well have been in Wilmington at some point. Because Biden has to be on the flight for the Air Force to pay for it, he will sometimes make the trip from Washington to Wilmington just to pick up his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, and take her back to D.C. with him, a Secret Service agent told Kessler. Biden also schedules one-off events in Arizona so he can take taxpayer funded trips to The Grand Canyon State to play golf with his family, the agent claimed. Kessler says the Secret Service agent told him Biden's most eyebrow raising waste of government resources is when he travels to Wilmington then jets back to Andrews the next morning to play a five-hour golf with Obama. ' ""Every three of four weeks when it's warm, Biden gets up there on Saturday and then will fly back on Air Force Two,"" Kessler claims the agent told him. ' ""While Air Force Two is sitting on the tarmac at Andrews, he goes and plays golf with the president at Andrew Air Force Base, gets back on the plane, and flies back to Delaware. ' ""Let me tell you something, that is egregious,"" ' he said. Kessler alleges that he filed a Freedom of Information Act request in 2013 to get exact numbers on the dates of Biden's trips, how many times the Air Force flew the plane empty to come pick Biden up or drop him off and the costs of travel. However, Biden's deputy counsel, Jessica R. Hertz, instructed the Air Force not to hand over the information to him, Kessler claims. ' ""They are covering up,"" ' Kessler says an Air Force officer told him. ' ""We spent a lot of time compiling the records, but Biden's office said logs for each flight would have to be consulted. This is a smokescreen to delay providing any records as long as possible."" ' Kessler called the vice president's office's actions 'unprecedented' and contradictory to the president's order that his administration should 'apply a presumption of openness' in fulfilling such requests. 'Much like President Nixon's cover-ups, it is an effort to direct government officials to hide personal abuse,' he writes in The First Family Detail. Kessler says he eventually received the information he was seeking from the Air Force and found out that Biden's trips to and from Delaware from the start of his first term as vice president through March of 2013 cost $979,680. And that amount is only for the fuel and maintenance of Air Force Two. It does not include the cost of fuel for Marine Two or the salaries of the helicopters crew. Over the same time period, Kessler says the Air Force told him Biden flew back and forth from Wilmington to D.C. 225 times. Those trips actually required a total of 400 flights, though, because of what Kessler calls 'deadhead' trips - return flights when Biden was not on the plane. The investigative journalist also found out that the total Air Force Two costs from Biden's personal trips in fiscal year 2012 were $288,080, and that an April 21, 2012, trip back to Andrews to play golf with Obama cost  the aforementioned $12,406. Kessler's assertion is backed by similar reporting from long-time White House reporter Keith Koffler last year. Koffler estimated on his White House Dossier blog that Biden's weekend trips were running taxpayers $13,200 just for the Air Force Two flight costs. In his report on Biden's non-stop travel to Wilmington, Koffler also questions the need for Biden to visit his home there so often. Noting that Biden has family in Delaware and is a regular at an exclusive golf course in the area, Koffler points out that 'in an era of soaring debt' Biden was choosing 'to spend . thousands of taxpayers dollars to accomodate a personal predilection.' 'Millions of American work in cities that they don’t call home, but . few can afford the expense of returning to their ancestral grounds . regularly,' Koffler wrote. 'And none can rest their heads on pillows at the beautiful vice president’s mansion at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington.' Kessler says the irony of Biden's outrageous spending is that the president a put him in charge of the administration's Campaign to Cut waste in 2011 and claimed Biden would 'hunt down and eliminate misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the federal government.' Biden then told supporters of the administration in an email that he was the 'new sheriff in town,' Kessler noted. In The First Family Detail author Ronald Kessler claims that Biden regularly travels to to Wilmington on Friday, returns to the D.C. area to play golf with President Barack Obama on Saturday, then flies back to Wilmington for the remainder of the weekend. The president and vice president are pictured here at the Fort Belvoir Golf Club on Father's Day in 2009 . While Kessler and the Secret Service agent he spoke with characterized Biden's gas guzzling golf trips with the president as occurring frequently, a report from The Hill last month said the vice president had not played together for nearly a year. The last time Obama was known to have gotten together with Biden out on the green was in August of 2013, The Hill stated. Furthermore, Biden has said multiple times throughout his vice presidency that he would prefer to take the cheaper, Amtrak train service between Wilmington and D.C. like he did when he was a Senator, but the Secret Service won't let him because it 'gives too many opportunities for people to interact with me in a way they wouldn't like to see.' It was only after last year's budget cutting sequester that Biden was able to convince the Secret Service to allow him to take the train again. 'I was able to . say, ""Look guys, I've got to take the train now -- it's cheaper than . flying."" So I get to take the train again,' Biden said at a National Association of Attorney's General event in February of 2013. Still, Kessler says, the onus is on Biden for taking so many trips on the taxpayer's dime knowing just how much they were costing. 'While Secret . Service agents say flying is the most secure way for Biden to make the . trips, the question is why the sheriff who is supposed to cut out . government waste thinks it is appropriate to take such frequent trips . for personal reasons,' Kessler writes in The First Family Detail. Likewise, the Secret Service . agents and Air Force officers assigned to Biden's detail 'express . outrage at what they consider an abuse,' he said.","Biden reportedly travels to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, every weekend, according to Ron Kessler's new book, The First Family Detail .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge bid farewell to New Zealand this morning as they boarded a flight bound for Australia. The couple waved and smiled at the crowds gathered to see them off at Wellington Airport, with William holding an alert and lively Prince George in his arms. After 10 days in New Zealand, the family will arrive at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport in the afternoon to embark on a second, ten day tour of Australia. Scroll down for video . Say goodbye, George! The Cambridges waved goodbye at New Zealand's Wellington Airport today as they boarded a flight bound for Sydney . Proud: Prince William held his son, Prince George in his arms, the little boy looking around curiously from the safety of his father's arms . Wide awake: Prince George was alert and curious as he was held by his father as they made as the family prepared to leave New Zealand . The couple were still dressed in the outfits they wore for their morning of engagements in Wellington: the Duke a blue suit, which complemented his wife's navy Rebecca Taylor outfit. George was also coordinated with his parents in dark shirts, socks and shoes, a white woolen jumper keeping out the cold. William held his bouncing baby boy outwards so that that he could take in the scene. Meeting the price: Airport personnel greeted the Cambridges and shook the hand of the eight-month-old . Curious: Baby George took in his surroundings as he was carried to the plane in the arms of William . Last look: The Royal couple bid farewell as they prepare to fly to Australia . George, eight months, appeared lively and interested as he boarded the plane to the cheers of well-wishers. His appearance is the fourth time he has been seen in public - once when he left hospital, on arrival in Wellington last week and again on his first public engagement at a Plunket parents and babies group in Government House. He is also due to be seen when the family arrive in Sydney shortly after 2.30pm today and again when the family visit Taronga Zoo. Are you alright down there? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got some canine cuddles from two 12-day-old German Shepard puppies as they visited the Royal New Zealand Police College in the small city of Porirua, just outside of Wellington . Furry friends: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge listened intently as police dog handlers talked about the tiny recruits . Say hello to my little friend! The couple looked to enjoy their furry meet and greet . Earlier in the day the couple visited the Royal New Zealand Police College. Kate, wearing a navy blue suit by New Zealand designer Rebecca Taylor, grinned from ear to ear when introduced to a couple of 12-day old puppies from the Dog Training Centre. She immediately picked up her puppy for a cuddle and stroked it. She said: 'It wants to hide under my jacket. I think it can smell George.' She then asked Police Commissioner Mike Bush, 'What do you feed them?' and 'Can they see yet?' It was a typically wet Wellington day as the couple visited the college, where they were greeted by claps and cheers from the crowd, before being given a tour and meeting some furry police recruits . The Duchess of Cambridge tenderly pats a much bigger police dog at the Royal New Zealand Police College . A present for George: When the Duchess was given a soft plush toy intended for George from a young girl, Kate replied 'He'll love it' The German shepherd puppies were born on April 4 and were the first litter of DTC bitch Gucci and stud dog Borg, via artificial insemination. After holding the puppies, the Royal couple met three lots of foster families and the police dogs they're helping to train up, who were all lapping water up off the parade ground. The first was three-year-old Yana. Kate asked foster mum Sharon Nicholas the dog's age and said, 'She's sweet.' The duchess asked, 'How has she coped?' and, 'How did you get involved?' She asked Melony Weallens about her foster dog Winta, 'Who's this then?' and, 'What age did you get her? Is she your only dog? She's so sweet. Do they need a lot of exercise?'. Melony said of her daughter Cadence, 16, 'She's taken Winta for more walks since she heard she was going to meet the royals.' Getting wet: A police offer got caught in the downpour as the Royal couple lay a wreath in honour of officers killed on duty . Staying dry: The Cambridges are sheltered by an umbrella as they lay the wreath . The Royal couple took a moment to pay their respects . The final foster family was John and Sarah Bole with daughters Morgan, 14, Madison, 10, and Monet, 8, with dog Gessy, four months. Kate asked, 'How old is Gessy? Was she tiny when you got her?' The girls gave Kate a stuffed-toy police dog for George. Kate said, 'Aww, that's so sweet. He'll love it. Does it have a name? Maybe we should call it Gessy. Sorry we couldn't bring George. He was asleep. He's a very podgy baby.' William added: 'This will come with us to Australia.' The college's Kapa Haka (Maori cultural) group also gave an impromptu performance of Singing in the Rain - a tribute to the appalling weather - which had the royals couple in stitches. They then segued into a traditional Maori tune with a poi dancer performing. Shortly before morning tea, Wills and Kate were presented with police one-piece for George that read 'junior recruit'. Wills said ""Fantastic. Brilliant. He'll love that. Thank you. Will it fit him? He's grown!' Kate agreed, adding: 'He's grown lots!' All smiles: Despite the unfortunate weather the Cambridges smiled broadly as they were greeted by crowds at the police college outside Wellington . Sight for sore eyes: Despite the rain the waiting crowds clapped, cheered and took photos as the couple arrived . They later met a little girl with an inoperable brain tumour, Iris Pouau, from Porirua, who had turned seven yesterday. She wore hundreds of beads representing the number of times shed had surgical procedures and presented Kate with a bouquet of purple irises. She also held a toy dog that police had given her yesterday for her birthday. Kate: 'It's very nice to meet you. How old are you?' Looking at the toy dog, she added 'He's very cute. Have you seen the puppies outside? You've been a very, very good girl.' The Duchess also talked to Iris' mum Darlene Tuiono, 43. Asked when the kids 'break up for their Easter holiday'. Darlene mentioned it was Iris' birthday yesterday. Kate replied:  'Oh, she didn't tell me that! Iris, did you have a good day? Happy birthday! ' William added: 'You're very pretty today. It was lovely to meet you.' Wet dog: William gave a police dog who'd got caught in the downpour a gentle scratch . Afterwards William and Kate conducted a walkabout in Wellington, enjoying the largest turn-out of their trip so far. A huge crowd bid a very vocal fond farewell to the Duke and Duchess at Civic Square. The couple shook hands and spoke with hundreds of people, especially small children, senior citizens and the disabled, before and after signing the city's visitors' book. George's first proposal offer: A small child is dressed in a one-piece printed with the words 'Marry me George' as the Royals are farewelled from New Zealand . William accepted a rather squashed block of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate, saying: 'We'll like that!' Rachel Scott, 46, from Derbyshire, now Wellington, showed the prince a picture of him doing work experience at Chatsworth House in the UK eight years ago with her father, John Reilly. She said: 'He used to see William every day for two weeks and the prince would ask him every morning, 'Where should I park?' My dad would say, 'Because it's you, you can park anywhere but the disabled spot. You don't look very disabled.' 'William would park his car and then pretend to hobble across the car park. 'William was just seeing Kate at the time and my dad would ask, 'So William, have you got any crumpet at the moment?' He'd reply, 'I couldn't possibly comment.' Getting sleepy: The German Shepard appeared to tire of his royal cuddle, as Kate asked dog handlers what the puppies are fed and if they can see yet .","The Cambridges waved goodbye at Wellington Airport as they boarded flight bound for Australia today .

"Scientists are constantly on the lookout for links between data to try and prove certain theories - but just because two sets of statistics match up, it doesn't necessarily mean they're are closely tied. To prove a direct correlation does not always mean causation, a Harvard student has plotted various spurious links between randomly selected statistics. These include a correlation between sour . cream and motorbike accidents, Nicolas Cage films and swimming pool deaths, and divorce rates and margarine. To prove that correlation does not always mean causation, a Harvard student has plotted various spurious links between randomly selected sets of data from the U.S Census. These include a correlation between sour cream and motorbike accidents, pictured . According to the data plotted from the U.S Census, Tyler Vigen's Spurious Correlations site found a link between: . The consumption of sour cream, and the number of motorcycle riders killed in accidents. The number of people who tripped over their own two feet and died, with civil engineering doctorates awarded in the U.S. How much beef is bought in the U.S, compared to the number of deaths caused by lightning. The number of films Nicolas Cage has starred in, versus the number of people who died falling into a swimming pool. The amount of cheese purchased, and the revenue generated by golf courses. Tyler Vigen is studying for a juris doctorate at Harvard School of Law. Using data from the U.S Census and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention research, Vigen was able to plot correlations between different subjects. Each Spurious Correlation consists of a graph that plots the development of both chosen statistics. Depending on the data, the date range can run from 1999 up to 2012. Below each graph is a chart that shows the numerical statistics, as well as their source, plus the correlation. The closer a correlation is to the number one, the more closely linked the two sets of data are. ‘Anyone can plainly tell that there’s not a connection between margarine and marriage,’ explained Vigen. This graph plots the correlation between people who died by falling out of wheelchairs between 1999 and 2005, and the rising costs of a 16oz bag of potato chips in the U.S during the same period. The data was taken from the U.S Census and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention research . ‘We saw data, we formed a hypothesis and then we rejected that hypothesis, based on our personal experience with the world. The graphs claim there to be a correlation between the films Nicolas Cage, pictured, has been in and deaths, driving accidents and divorce rates . That’s a big deal - and it’s a part that computers can’t do. Research is about discovery, but only humans can actually make discoveries.’ The purpose of the Spurious Correlations site, according to Vigen, is not to say data is ambiguous and can be interpreted however people want, 'instead it reveals it’s up to us as rational thinkers to work out if there’s actually a connection between the variables - or if it’s a coincidence.' ‘Finding causal mechanisms is the key goal in a lot of scientific research because when we find causal mechanisms, we learn that much more about the world around us. ‘Sometimes, we see connections that we can’t explain and it inspires us to search for a potential cause.’ A good example of correlations leading to conclusions is the connection between smoking and lung cancer. In the early 1900s, incidents of lung cancer were on the rise but no-one really knew why. In 1929, German physician Fritz Lickint published a paper in which he showed that lung cancer patients were particularly likely to have been smokers. That paper led to a body of research in which scientists learnt about the dangers of smoking - but it may never have happened if someone hadn’t spotted the links. 'Correlations between two variables could be merely coincidence, or they could be the result of an underlying causal link – and every time we see a correlation, we have the marvellous opportunity to try and figure out which one it is,' concluded Vigen. The purpose of the site, according to Vigen, is not to say data is ambiguous, 'instead it reveals it's up to us as rational thinkers to work out if there's actually a connection between the variables - or if it's a coincidence.' This graph shows a link between Nicolas Cage films and people who died falling into a swimming pool . Between 2000 and 2009, there was a link between how many people ate eggs in the U.S and the number of drivers killed in non-collision transport accidents. The closer a correlation is to the number one, the more closely linked the two sets of data are. This correlation is 0.88 .","The Spurious Correlations site was created by Harvard student Tyler Vigen .

"As William, Kate, and George land in Sydney today, they will arrive to a country ready to open them with open arms. Support for a republic in Australia has dropped to its lowest level in three decades, with more than half of Australians in favour of keeping the royal family as heads of state. According to a Fairfax-Nielsen poll, 51 percent of Australians believed the switch to a republic was unnecessary and only 42 percent were in favour of a republic. Scroll down for video . The Republican Slayer: Prince George and his famous parents are responsible for the upswing in support among Australians for the monarchy . This is down from 58 percent in favour of a republic in 1999, when a referendum on the issue was held, and represents the lowest ebb in pro-republican sentiment in the country in 35 years. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and their son Prince George, are thought to be responsible for the resurgence of support for the monarchy. Prince George was dubbed 'Prince George the Republican Slayer' on Australian breakfast television on Wednesday. The survey found support for the royals was at its highest among Australians aged 18-24, 60 percent of whom thought Australia should keep its royal head of state, and only 28 percent supporting a transition to a republican system of government. However, a majority of Australian voters support Australia becoming a monarchy eventually. According to the poll, only 35 percent believed Australia should 'never' become a republic. Most Australians believe the nation should become a republic either 'as soon as possible'(28 percent) or 'after Queen Elizabeth's reign ends' (31 percent). A new poll shows that support among Australians for a republic is at its lowest level in 35 years . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured here arriving in Wellington, will arrive in Sydney on Wednesday afternoon for a ten-day tour of the country . However David Morris, national director of the Australian Republican Movement, remains hopeful that one day the Australian head of state will be an Australian. 'We shouldn’t jump to conclusions based on one poll that’s held in the middle of a media frenzy about a huge celebrity royal visit,' he said. 'The British royals will always be welcome in Australia… We look forward to when an Australian head of state visits Britain and receives the same welcome that the British royal family always receives; when an Australian head of state is received as an equal and not as a colonial subject.' He added that support for the monarchy was due to the celebrity status of Will and Kate, as well as the fact there has been no broad political debate on the issue in over a decade. He also blamed the current spike in pro-royal sentiment on having a prime minister who ‘is trying to take us back to the colonial era.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was an ardent defender of the monarchy in the lead up to the 1999 referendum, announced last month that he would be reinstating the titles of knights and dames for 'pre-eminent Australians'. However, only 35 percent of Australians are in favour of bringing back the titles, according to another Fairfax Media poll. Prince George, who will one day be New Zealand's head of state, participated in a playgroup with some of his future subjects in Wellington on March 9 .","New poll says 51 per cent of Australians do not want to become a republic .

"Ten years after banning the use of firing squads in state executions, Utah lawmakers on Wednesday endorsed a proposal to allow the practice again to avoid problems with lethal-injection drugs. The proposal from Republican Rep. Paul Ray of Clearfield would call for a firing squad if the state cannot obtain the lethal injection drugs 30 days before the scheduled execution. Utah dropped firing squads out of concern about the media attention, but Ray said it's the most humane way to execute someone because the inmate dies instantly. Scroll down for video . Returning? The firing squad execution chamber at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah. Lawmakers on Wednesday endorsed a proposal to resurrect the practice to head off problems with lethal injection drugs . 'We have to have an option,' Ray told reporters on Wednesday. 'If we go hanging, if we go to the guillotine, or we go to the firing squad, electric chair, you're still going to have the same circus atmosphere behind it. So is it really going to matter?' After a 20-minute discussion, an interim panel of Utah lawmakers approved the idea on a 9-2 vote Wednesday. The proposal still needs to go through the full legislative process once lawmakers convene for their annual session in January. Rep. Mark Wheatley, a Democrat from Murray, voted against the measure because he said Utah doesn't have a problem that needs to be fixed. Santaquin Republican Rep. Marc Roberts, who cast the other opposing vote, said he didn't think the proposal was needed and is unsure of his own view on capital punishment. Under current Utah law, death by firing squad is only an option for criminals sentenced to death before 2004. It was last used in 2010. Ray said his proposal gives Utah flexibility if it's unable to obtain the drugs needed in a lethal injection. Shortage: The proposal on Wednesday called for a firing squad if the state cannot obtain lethal injection drugs 30 days before the scheduled execution . For years, states used a three-drug combination to execute inmates, but European drugmakers have refused to sell them to prisons and corrections departments out of opposition to the death penalty. That move has led states to use different types, combinations and doses of lethal drugs, but those methods have been challenged in court. Because of the challenges with the drugs and prolonged executions earlier this year in Oklahoma and Arizona, lawmakers in Utah and elsewhere are looking for alternatives. Lawmakers in Wyoming have endorsed a proposal similar to Ray's, and they plan to take it up when their session begins in 2015. In Oklahoma, one lawmaker has proposed using nitrogen gas to asphyxiate inmates. Critics have said the method is not without risks and will renew the intense media attention Utah had wanted to avoid. Despite being restrained, an inmate could still move or the shooters could miss the heart, causing a slower, painful death, according to the Washington, D.C.,-based Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment. One such case appears to have happened in Utah's territorial days back in 1879. According to newspaper accounts, a firing squad missed Wallace Wilkerson's heart and it took him 27 minutes to die. Controversial decision: Rep. Paul Ray, of Clearfield, addressed the committee hearing on Wednesday at the Utah State Capitol, in Salt Lake City. He called for a firing squad if the state cannot obtain lethal injection drugs . Utah stopped allowing inmates to choose a firing-squad execution in 2004, citing the excessive media attention it gave prisoners. Those sentenced to death before the law changed still have the option of choosing it. It was last used in 2010 when Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by five police officers with .30-caliber Winchester rifles. Gardner was given a death sentence for fatally shooting a Salt Lake City attorney in 1985 while trying to escape from a courthouse. Gardner was the third person to die by firing squad after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Several other inmates on Utah's death row have opted to die by gunfire, but they are all several years away from exhausting the appeals of their death sentences, according to the state attorney general's office.","The proposal would call for a firing squad if the state cannot obtain the lethal injection drugs 30 days before the scheduled execution .

"Residents of Orange County now have a new option when filling up their cars -  fuels created from human waste. An experimental project from the University of California hopes to prove that human waste can have its uses as a fuel. It is even working with car maker Hyundai, which is set to begin leasing cars that can use the new fuel - for free. Powered by POO: Hyundai plans to begin leasing a fuel-cell version of its Tucson crossover, which can travel about 480 kilometers on a tank of hydrogen. First, sewage is separated into water and biosolids. The waste water is cleaned, filtered and treated for reuse, while solid waste is piped into airless tanks filled with microbes. A byproduct of their digestion is a gas that’s 60 percent methane and about 40 percent carbon dioxide, which is burned at the plant for power generation. However, some is filtered and piped into a unique, stationary 'tri-generation' fuel-cell device, designed by the Irvine team, that produces electricity, heat and hydrogen. The hydrogen gas is then piped several hundred feet to the public pump where fuel-cell autos are refueled daily. Inventor Jack Brouwer developed the system wit  fellow scientists from UC Irvine’s National Fuel Cell Research Center. They developed a sytem that feeds the solid waste to microbes. The gas they give off is then burnt for power, while some is kept back and used to fuel hydrogen powered cars. However, one downside has been that the Orange County Sanitation District’s Fountain Valley waste facility does have a certain unique aroma. 'It smells like money,' Brouwer optimistically told Bloomberg. The team built the Fountain Valley project with about $10 million in funding from sources including California government bodies and a U.S. Department of Energy grant, and it makes enough hydrogen to supply about 200 fuel-cell vehicles each day. Brouwer's customers are soon set to increase. Hyundai plans to begin leasing a fuel-cell version of its Tucson crossover, which can travel about 480 kilometers on a tank of hydrogen. The lease price will be $2,999 down and $499 a month, Hyundai said - which includes free fuel from nearly a dozen hydrogen pumps around the state. Hyundai is also partnering with Enterprise Rent-A-Car to make the Tucson Fuel Cell available to consumers in the Los Angeles/Orange County region. Toyota, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and GM are also beginning to sell hydrogen cars in the region. Power to the people: Researchers say human waste is a viable source of power for hydrogen cars . The fuel-cell powered Tucson can drive for 50 miles per kilogram of hydrogen, and its two tanks hold about 5.64 kilograms (12.4 pounds). Costs of compressed gas in California range from about $5 to $10 per kilogram, depending on the facility, and it takes around three minutes to fill the tank. Hyundai says it hopes the technology will become popular - and will take on the electric car as the eco-vehicle of choice. 'Hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles represent the next generation of zero-emission vehicle technology, so we’re thrilled to be a leader in offering the mass-produced, federally certified Tucson Fuel Cell to retail customers,' said John Krafcik of Hyundai Motor America. 'The superior range and fast-fill refueling speed of our Tucson Fuel Cell vehicle contrast with the lower range and slow-charge characteristics of competing battery electric vehicles. 'We think fuel cell technology will increase the adoption rate of zero-emission vehicles, and we’ll all share the environmental benefits.'","Fuel cell cars can be refilled from stations powered by human waste .

"When Anne Morshead, a couples counsellor for Relate, met her partner Liam she wasn't aware of his dependency on alcohol. 'Over the next five years I changed into someone I didn't recognise,' she writes in her new book, in which she tells the story of their relationship in Ireland. 'Someone my friends started not to recognise. 'I became physically ill, certainly emotionally distraught and I am forced to admit now what my mental capabilities were suspect as well on many occasion.' Initially, Anne thought she could change Liam. That she could fix him. She felt his recovery depended entirely on her being there - and not only because Liam was an alcoholic, but because he was also going blind. In Blind Drunk Anne tells the story of how they met, fell in love, tumbled into the destructive co-dependency of addict and carer, and eventually saved themselves and their relationship by having time apart. Anne, left, likens living with a blind alcoholic to being the 'carer of a delinquent teenage rebel' Writing about when she and Liam first met (in a pub), Anne wonders if it was his 'helplessness' that drew her in and attracted her to him. She says: 'Had Liam just been drunk I wonder whether we would have got entangled, but since he was blind and drunk, disadvantaged in life, presently fearful and very anxious [...] I felt for him thinking I could ease his emotional pain.' Similarly, Anne's strong personality was a draw to Liam, who had endured an abusive relationship at the hands of his alcoholic father. She writes: 'He had tried to cling to his mother and she probably did her best to protect him, especially as he was visually impaired. 'As a result, my guess is that he was attracted to me as a solid, older woman who had surprisingly stayed and listened to him.' Anne expects that Liam used alcohol to drown the sorrows of a traumatic childhood and a degenerative eye condition . But Liam's blindness made their relationship trickier, with Anne often excusing his behaviour to herself and to friends, or thinking he was acting in certain ways because he couldn't see, not because he was inebriated. 'Suddenly his mood would change,' she says. 'Not to mention the staggering, knocking into furniture and falling down, but after all, I told myself, he was blind. 'His eyesight was a big stumbling block for me! Sometimes it seemed I had become the carer of a delinquent teenage rebel.' As Liam became emotionally absent and began lying to her and hiding alcohol, Anne became angry and aggressive. Life, she says, was 'unmanageable'. iam's blindness made their relationship trickier, with Anne often excusing his behaviour to herself and to friends, or thinking he was acting in certain ways because he couldn't see, not because he was inebriated . Things came to a head on 7 July 2005, the morning of the 7/7 bombings, when Anne told Liam she wouldn't see him again until he stopped drinking. At this point Blind Drunk becomes a guide to being the partner to an alcoholic. Anne says an alcoholic must want to recover themselves, and that your insistence that they do so is simply not enough. She advocates 'detachment': distancing yourself from your dependent and focusing instead on improving your own life. 'By detaching and leaving him to it I showed I cared. It sounds perverse but by staying, coping and being a martyr in effect, I was exercising pity and indicating Liam was a failure and had no hope of going it alone or recovering.' And it worked. Liam benefited from their detachment, recovered, and the couple are still together. 'When they make it sobriety really is reincarnation in the same lifetime,' Anne says. Alcohol is a drug that is extremely addictive . What to remember: . Your family member or friend is not a bad person . They crave a drug that is addictive .

"Peter Ryley was given too many sedatives at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham which led to him falling and dying . A Grandfather with dementia suffered a fatal fall in hospital after being given a cocktail of drugs to ‘keep him quiet’. Peter Ryley, 76, smashed his head on the floor and suffered a brain haemorrhage after excessive amounts of  sedatives left him ‘practically delirious’. Nurses found him, unconscious and bleeding, 40 minutes after he was given three doses of powerful drugs in just five minutes. The married father of four, who had been admitted to hospital with bowel problems, died five days after the fall. The NHS trust in question has apologised and admitted full responsibility for Mr Ryley’s death, after his family instructed lawyers to investigate whether more could have been done to prevent the tragedy. Staff had failed to act after a risk assessment recommended steps to prevent the retired steel worker from seriously injuring himself on the ward. The Mail has long called for an improvement in care of dementia sufferers as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Yesterday Mr Ryley’s family told of their anger and devastation at how he was stripped of his dignity, and given a chemical cosh by those who should have been caring for him. Son Andrew, 44, said: ‘Dad’s dementia meant he did need a lot of care – but rather than reassuring him and trying to keep him occupied, it came to light at the inquest that the medical staff just kept increasing his sedation levels. ‘In the end he was practically delirious from all the drugs he had been given, but no steps were taken by the nurses to prevent him from being a danger to himself. ‘We’ve been left devastated by the way Dad was treated. He should have been shown some dignity and respect in his final days, but sadly the main goal of the nurses and doctors was to keep him quiet. The hospital have apologised, but the apology felt empty.’ Chief executive of the hospital Peter Homa said: 'I wish to reiterate the Trust's sincere apologies to his family for the fatal head injury Mr Ryley sustained after falling in our care' Research by the British Journal of General Practice has shown that one in four dementia sufferers are treated with 'last resort' antipsychotic drugs.Antipsychotics are tranquillisers that are designed to treat hallucinations in patients with mental illnesses. But researchers have found that in most cases they are just given to sedate elderly patients to stop them from wandering off. The drugs – dubbed a ‘chemical cosh’ – have been found to double the risk of death and actually worsen patients’ symptoms leaving them unable to walk or speak coherently. In 2011, the Department of Health warned the drugs were leading to 1,800 needless deaths a year. Around 770,000 Britons are thought to have some form of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. But it is not known how many are being given antipsychotics or how long they have been on them. Research has also shown that dementia patients in care homes in some parts of England are six times more likely to be prescribed the drugs than in other areas. Mr Ryley, of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, was . given a sedative soon after being admitted to Queen’s Medical Centre in . Nottingham on January 3, 2011. The doses continued throughout the . following days, despite a doctor expressing concerns that he should not . receive any more drugs. Three days later, a falls risk-assessment identified him as a high-risk . patient. As a result,  a care plan recommended additional night staff to . help care for him, and for a nurse to be visible at all times. It also . suggested lowering his bed. None of these steps were taken, and on January 17 Mr Ryley suffered the . fall which later killed him. X-rays show he suffered a severe brain . haemorrhage. He had been married to Patricia, 72, for 40 years, and had ten . grandchildren. Andrew Ryley said: ‘It soon became clear that staff were . so overstretched they didn’t have the necessary resources to care for . him. ‘The hospital report says he was given Diazepam. Five minutes later he . was given 1milligram of Lorazepam and 50mg of Tramadol. Just 40 minutes . later he was found on the floor by nurses.’ A post-mortem examination . found that Mr Ryley’s system contained high levels of the three . aforementioned drugs, as well as another sedative, Zopiclone. An inquest last September found Mr Ryley died as a result of the head . injury sustained in the fall. In a narrative verdict, the coroner noted a . ‘continuing use of excess sedation’ and an ‘ongoing omission to fully . comply with fall-prevention policies’. Peter Homa, chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS . Trust, said: ‘I wish to reiterate the trust’s sincere apologies to Mr . Ryley’s family for the fatal head injury he sustained after falling in . our care.’ The trust – one of six branded ‘high risk’ for patient care by the Care . Quality Commission last week – is addressing several failings that were . identified in an internal investigation. These steps include new . guidelines for sedating agitated patients, and providing more dementia . support on every ward.","Grandfather-of-four Peter Ryley was admitted to Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham with bowel problems in January 2011 .

"The Prince of Wales has spoken of his heartbreak at the 'soul destroying tragedy' facing Christians in the Middle East.

The Prince finished his address by expressing his sympathies to the congregation for the ongoing attacks, saying: 'They seem so hopelessly inadequate but please, please just know truly heart felt they are.' Royal guest: The Prince of Wales visited the Diocese of the Armenian Church in the United Kingtom at the St Yeghiche Armenian Church in London . Prince Charles called atrocities committed against Christians in the Middle East, and in particular in Syria, a 'soul destroying tragedy' United: Avak Asadourian, the Armenian Archbishop of Iraq and The Prince of Wales listen at the St Yeghiche Armenian Church . During the service, Avak Asadourian, the Archbishop of Iraq, spoke of the problems facing Armenian Christians in the region from his own experiences. 'Due to assaults Iraqi Christians are leaving the country of their forefathers. In 1980 there were 1.5 million, this is now down to 400,000 due to the encroachment of Isis,' he said. 'If political measures are not adopted very soon, then in the Middle East Christian manifestations will cease to exist in its own birthplace,' he said. While at the church, Charles also spoke with Bishop Vahan Hovhanessian, Primate of the Armenian Church in the UK, and doctor Armen Sarkissian, the Armenian ambassador. Charles has existing ties with the Armenian community and has shown an interest in encouraging inter-faith dialogue over the years. He visited Armenia in May 2013 and spoke with some of the country's leading Christian figures. In December last year Charles expressed concern about the challenges facing Christians in some Middle-Eastern nations in a visit to the Coptic Orthodox Church Centre in Stevenage and the Syrian Orthodox Church in Acton.","The Prince of Wales visited Armenian Church in London today .

Over the past four years White and Davis have traded equal blows with Virtue and Moir. The Canadians won the gold meal at Vancouver, while Davis and White have won the world title in odd years: 2011 and 2013. Virtue and Moir won the world title in 2010 and 2012. However, the Americans have dominated the sport of ice dance for the past two years and have not lost since the 2012 world championships.

The Michigan pair went into today's free dance medal round with a slight, 2.56 point lead over the Canadians. Both couples share the same coach, Marina Zoueva. This is the 15th gold in Olympic skating for the United States - but it is the first in dance. Davis and White have been competing on the ice since they were 10 and have effectively grown up together. Their free dance was described by USA Today as 'lovely and light with the elegance and emotion that is their trademark.' 'That in itself justified 17 years of hard work,' White said of their performance. 'The closest we came to breaking up, I can't pinpoint one because there hasn't been one,' Davis, 27, said. 'Certainly there have been struggles. It hasn't been easy to get where we are. ... It's a partnership which I couldn't have asked for more.

But it's easier when we see them and know how hard these guys work.' The two started skating together in 1997 in Michigan, and on the biggest day of their career, they performed just as they had visualized it. The music swelling over the final minute of the program, their feet were in nonstop motion, yet every step was intricately choreographed. Their lifts were a blur as White spun across the ice with Davis held aloft, their movements and expressions still fierce despite the draining demands of the performance. They now have one medal of each color after winning bronze in the new team event in Sochi, the first American figure skaters to own three. The pair beat their rivals and training mates Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, the Canadians who hoped to repeat their 2010 Olympic victory but earned silver . Virtue and Moir had become the first North American ice dance gold medalists at their home Olympics in Vancouver. Their free dance to Russian classical music told the story of their own partnership, which also stretches back to 1997. In a performance at times tender and at others triumphant, Moir kissed her hand at the start and again throughout the program. 'I think there is relief,' Moir said. 'It has been a journey to get here since 2010, a lot of sleepless nights to get to the Olympic Games. If I could only have been that 22-year-old at Vancouver. 'The reason we stayed in is we wanted a different journey. Now, the pressures of this game are just melting away.'

France's Nathalie Pechalat and Fabian Bourzat were fourth, 6.26 points out of bronze. The other U.S. teams, Madison Chock and Evan Bates and siblings Maia and Alex Shibutani, finished eighth and ninth. Russia has won 18 of 33 medals in ice dance's Olympic history, but now North Americans own two straight golds. Virtue and Moir have said they'll likely retire. For Davis and White, talk of the future can wait until this historic victory starts feeling real. 'We wanted to fight for the best performance we could give and we did that. You dream of this for so long, work so hard, and they worked hard, too,' White said, referring to Virtue and Moir.

"Mother-of-three has spent more than £250,00 on 100 procedures over 20 years . Sarah gave daughter Poppy cosmetic surgery vouchers for her EIGHTH birthday this year . Also came under fire for administering Botox to her 15-year old daughter . Thrown off U.S. chat show this summer . Is now writing a book about plastic surgery and filming at clinics throughout Russia . Cosmetic surgery addict Sarah Burge is often in the news for her outrageous parenting behaviour. The mother-of three hit the headlines in February this year when she admitted to buying plastic surgery vouchers as a present for her daughter Poppy's eighth birthday, and then again in June when she visited America in an attempt to launch Poppy on to the beauty pageant scene. The U.S. trip backfired when 51-year-old Sarah was thrown off a chat show by disgusted host Anderson Cooper, but it seemed the ex-nurse didn't learn much and today she was back on the small screen boasting about the Christmas gifts she is planning for her daughters Poppy, 8, Hannah, 18, and Charlotte, 27. Human Barbie Sarah Burge has revealed that she will spend £18,000 on her daughters' Christmas presents . Sarah, who runs her own cosmetic surgery clinic in St Neots, Cambridgshire and has had more than 100 cosmetic procedures costing over £250,000, appeared on This Morning to defend her outrageous gifting and revealed that she is planning to spend almost £20,000 on presents this year including designer clothes and bag, jewellery, ponies and - of course - plastic surgery vouchers. Married Sarah will spend even more turning her house in to a Winter Wonderland to dazzle her two children. 51-year-old Sarah appeared on This Morning with psychologist Liz Fraser (left) to defend spoiling her children with gifts of ponies, designer bags and plastic surgery vouchers . She said: 'A lot of people do get in debt at Christmas but I can afford it. 'I have just coma back from Russia and bought some really expensive gifts including plastic surgery vouchers. 'It is the one time we can splash out. It will be like Santa's grotto in my house. 'They will be getting ponies, surgery vouchers, designer clothes, handbags, jewellery. 'The economic climate is affecting me too though, I have definitely had to cut back on what I spend.' When This Morning hosts Ruth and Ealmon asked if spending so much money is just going to spoil her children, Sarah replied: ''They are not spoiled. I have it under control. 'Hopefully they will be able to maintain this lifestyle. 'Maybe I am setting them up for a fall in the future, but until then .. let's make the most of it! 'I work very hard for this money. 'We are all very happy, we have a nice lifestyle and do things that other people only dream about.' Sarah says that she has been affected by the tough economic climate too, and has had to cut back on spending this year . Unsurprisingly psychologist Liz Fraser, also appearing on the show, disagreed with Sarah's present-giving ethos. She said: 'Everyone has their own budget, but we are in a culture where we give so much at Christmas and that equates having things with happiness. 'It is our role as parents to teach children about the society we are living in, and now we are having a tough time. 'A recent Girl Guides survey questioned girls aged 10-17 about their happiness levels and the results were astonishingly low. 'One of the things that continually came up is the pressure that young children feel to have things and to own things.' In 2010 Sarah caused controversy for giving her teenage daughter Botox .

"'The One-77' sterling silver bottle cooler . What on earth is a carbon fibre and sterling silver The One-77 bottle cooler, I hear you cry? It's a wine bucket to you and me - a £17,750 one! So what exactly justifies such a large price tag for something a lot of us have made redundant in favour of a fridge? The lining is reminiscent of a car tyre (a nod to the Aston Martin brand), and it's made by hand at silversmiths Grant Macdonald as part of a silverwear collection, Silver by Aston Martin. It is just one of  77 made. Bearing all of this in mind, £17,750 is still a hefty amount to spend on a decent car, let alone a wine bucket. Though we have a sneaking suspicion that this may be different in the world of Aston Martin. After all this isn't the first bumper price household object that has received the Aston Martin treatment. Last year the motoring manufacture launched a whole range of products to be sold in London's famous department store, Harrods. Products included the £2,000 Aston Martin pram in partnership between the luxury Silver Cross, another British brand which first began designing carriages for babies in 1877. Aston Martin touches included the Alcantara lined seat pad - a high quality and expensive suede manufactured in Italy - to the super soft leather-trimmed handle and bumper bar. The Aston Martin pram is sold for £2,000 with only 800 models made . The design of the aluminium alloy wheels . is based on the Aston Martin One-77, which retails for £1.2 million. And . once again you were buying exclusivity with only 800 being sold in . Harrods. So what's next? An Aston Martin foot spa? An Aston Martin dish washer? The possibilities are endless especially if you consider the fact that products such as the as the Aston Martin espresso cup and the Aston Martin Picnic Hamper are some of the current design options at Silver by Aston Martin. The Aston Martin seven piece dining set by Grant Macdonald retails at £5,440 . Grant Macdonald, co-creator of Silver by Aston Martin, told Director Magazine that out of all the pieces he'd helped to create the bottle cooler was the one he was most proud of. 'The ice bucket I created for them is one of my favourite designs. I wanted to make a shape nobody else had ever seen and incorporate carbon fibre, which is a material used in Aston Martin cars. The bucket takes 60 hours of silversmithing to create and 10 hours to polish. Some of the cheaper pieces include the £140 Espresso Cups by Grant Macdonald for Aston Martin . 'I think the Aston Martin brand will give us a great future. It's their 100th anniversary next year so I'm sure we'll be involved in lots of exciting projects.' If your price range doesn't quite stretch to the wine cooler the Aston Martin Carbon Dining China Side plate is the cheapest in the collection coming in at a snip of £60. However, if you're feeling a little more extravagant you could go for the wine cooler's 24 carat gold plated sister at a cool £22,750.","Aston Martin Bottle cooler selling for £17,750 in the famous department store, Harrods .

"The privatisation of the Royal Mail will be ‘bad for customers and bad for Britain’ and it ‘will not work’, union bosses warned today. In a call to arms, they are plotting ‘any campaign required to oppose the privatisation’, such as strike action. The Government is the only shareholder in Royal Mail, but a flotation on the stock market is expected, possibly this autumn. Contentious: Ministers have set a deadline of next April for Royal Mail sale and want staff to own at least 10 per cent of the business . Even Margaret Thatcher opposed the privatisation, saying she was ‘not prepared to have the Queen’s head privatised.’ In a speech in Bournemouth on Monday, Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers’ Union, said: ‘Privatisation of Royal Mail will not work. Speaking at the union’s annual conference, he added: ‘Ask the people of Argentina, who had their postal service privatised, who were advised by Royal Mail. It was a flop. The Argentine government had to re-nationalise.’ On the warpath: TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady warned of strike action . Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, warned the privatisation of Royal Mail will be ‘a disaster’. She warned previous sell-offs in the rail and utility sectors have led to higher train fares, rocketing energy bills and gold-plated pay packages for the bosses. Since privatisation plans were unveiled, the price of a first-class stamp has jumped from 46p to 60p, some parcel prices have jumped by more than 100 per cent and a £9.5billion pension black hole has been dumped on the taxpayer. Miss O’Grady said: ‘We will not stand by and see services cut and workers walked over. ‘Just so there’s no confusion, let me be clear. The TUC will back the CWU all the way [to oppose privatisation in all possible ways].’ Miss O’Grady said the Government could not ‘fool’ the public into believing that selling off the Royal Mail was in the public interest. She said: ‘The public know better. Prices would rocket, small businesses suffer, rural communities abandoned. ‘The evidence is clear - privatisation is bad for workers, bad for customers and bad for Britain.’ It comes as the TUC will meet tomorrow [wed24] to discuss plans, proposed by Unite, Britain’s biggest union, for the first general strike for more than 80 years. Postal workers will also debate at the CWU conference today whether or not to boycott the handling of any mail which has not used Royal Mail. Around one in two letters delivered through your letterbox have been handled by one of Royal Mail’s rivals. Royal Mail is only responsible for the ‘final mile’ of the delivery. Warning: Union bosses said that prices would rocket and rural communities would be abandoned . Companies such as BT, Thames Water, E.On, Sky, Barclays, Npower, O2 and Talk Talk currently use the postal giant’s rivals to handle all or some of their mail. A third round of strikes will take place among up to 4,000 staff at Post Offices on Monday over plans to close or franchise 76 of its large Crown post offices. A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: ‘The Government has made it clear it does not have the capital itself to invest in Royal Mail. ‘It wants that capital to come from the private sector.’ A Department for Business spokesman said: ‘Regardless of ownership, Royal Mail will provide the universal postal service with six-day per week delivery and collection at uniform and affordable prices.'","Unions are plotting  ‘any campaign required to oppose the privatisation’

"Thousands of tech, finance, and manufacturing companies have secret agreements with U.S. security agencies to swap sensitive data in return for classified intelligence, sources have claimed. U.S. intelligence organizations, including the NSA, CIA and FBI and branches of the U.S. military, call the firms 'trusted partners', sources told Bloomberg. The sources either worked for the government or for the companies. A former NSA employee said the programs are far greater than what was uncovered by whistleblower Edward Snowden, who lifted the lid on government surveillance programs before fleeing to Hong Kong last month. More revelations: Sources have claimed that government agencies, including the NSA, FBI and CIA, have secret partnerships with large businesses to hand over sensitive information . The relationship between the companies, which include Microsoft and McAfee, and intelligence agencies is legal, and because the firms provide information voluntarily, there is no need for court orders to insist they hand over the information, a source said. The companies are happy to participate . in the agreements because they believe they are helping . to protect the nation or are advancing their own interests by . receiving classified information in return, sources said. They added that the public would be shocked at how much help the government seeks from the companies. Bloomberg explained that Microsoft hands over information on bugs in its software before it publicly reveals a way to fix the problem. The delay means that the U.S. government can exploit  vulnerabilities in Microsoft's system in programs that were sold abroad, including to foreign governments, the sources said. Explosive: The sources said programs extend far beyond the reach of what was revealed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured), who leaked information about surveillance programs . While Microsoft is reportedly not told how the information is used, spokesman Frank Shaw . confirmed data was handed over to give the government 'an early start' on risk assessment and mitigation. Security software company McAfee also cooperates with the NSA, CIA, and FBI, the report explained, and shares data about malicious internet traffic, including foreign spy operations. 'We do not share any type of personal information with our government agency partners,' McAfee chief technology officer, Michael Fey, said. 'McAfee's function is to provide security technology, education, and threat intelligence to governments [including] emerging new threats, cyber-attack patterns and hacker group activity.' The agreements deal with such sensitive information that they are usually made strictly between companies' chief executive officers and chiefs of the U.S. agencies, the report said. Partner: Sources said that Microsoft will tell the government about bugs in its software before it tells the public so that the agencies can use the information to infiltrate foreign governments' systems . Only a few people in the company may know of them. Some U.S. telecommunications . companies also provide agencies with access to facilities and data . abroad that would require a judge's order if it were done in the U.S., . one source added. And in return for their help, companies are lavished with gratitude. 'If I were the director and had a relationship with a company who was doing things that were not just directed by law, but were also valuable to the defense of the Republic, I would go out of my way to thank them and give them a sense as to why this is necessary and useful,' said Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and the CIA. The sources said that in return for the companies' help, some are also given warnings about threats that could affect their business, such as serious Internet attacks and who is responsible. Insistent: Earlier this week, Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, defended the programs as 'critical' to national security. Sources said companies also believe they are helping the nation . The report is just the latest revelation in the NSA leaks scandal, which hit headlines after Edward Snowden released information about Prism, an NSA surveillance system that gathers phone call and email information from telecommunication and internet companies. Since his reveal, Snowden has fled to Hong Kong, but his exact whereabouts are unknown. He emerged briefly in an interview with the South China Morning Post to claim that the U.S. has also been hacking Chinese computers for as long as four years.","U.S intelligence organizations including the NSA, CIA and FBI 'have secret agreements with companies including Microsoft and McAfee'

"Boxing legend Mike Tyson has caused some raised eyebrows following a bizarre rambling television appearance. Tyson hit the stage at this year's Soul Train Awards, currently airing on BET, to promote his new Adult Swim show cartoon, the Mike Tyson Mysteries, but the lack of a script seemed to throw him off kilter. In the one-minute clip he is seen attempting to plug his new show, forgetting where to stand, asking if he'd 'done it right' and shouting out Floyd Mayweather before walking off stage. Scroll down for video . Boxing legend Mike Tyson (pictured) caused some raised eyebrows following a bizarre television appearance . Twitter users took to the social media site as the show aired last night to express their bafflement following Tyson's appearance, which appeared to be completely unscripted. Even more bizarrely the show was pre-recorded on November 7, but producers decided to keep the toe-curling segment in its entirety when it went out last night. Tyson walked out on stage wearing a black leather jacket and said: 'Hey hey! You see that? Mike Tyson Mysteries, 10.30 Monday night. 'Watch it or else. Nah,I'm just kidding. Watch it anyway though.' The crowd applauded throughout and laughed when he walked across the stage said: 'Missed my spot. I'm meant to be right here.' He appeared to lose his train of thought and said: 'Um. Alright, okay. 'Hey champ, how you doing? Floyd Mayweather everybody, best fighter in the world. He then said: 'Did I do it right? Oh, excuse me,' before walking off stage.

"They say power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. But now it seems there could be a scientific reason why the trappings of success and elevated position can make people more likely to be dishonest, according to a new study. Researchers found that expansive physical settings, such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work, or a large driver’s seat in a car, can cause people to feel more powerful. This may, in turn, elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating, or even traffic offences, they claim. Researchers found that expansive physical settings, such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work, can cause people to feel more powerful . The new research, published in the journal Psychological Science, discovered that the physical environment may affect the likelihood of dishonesty. Study leader Doctor Andy Yap, who spearheaded the research while at Columbia Business School in the United States. He said: 'In everyday working and living environments, our body postures are incidentally expanded and contracted by our surroundings - by the seats in our cars, the furniture in and around workspaces, even the hallways in our offices - and these environments directly influence the propensity of dishonest behaviour in our everyday lives.' Trappings of success, such as having a big car, may, in turn, elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating, or even traffic offences, researchers claim . Building on previous research . demonstrating that expansive postures can lead to a state of power, and . that power can lead to dishonest behaviour, the new study suggests that . expanded, non-verbal postures forced on people by their environments . could influence decisions and behaviours in ways that render people less . honest. People who are considered unattractive are more likely to be belittled and bullied in the workplace, according to new research. The study by Michigan State University found that unattractive workers were treated more harshly than their attractive colleagues when it came to promotions and which tasks they were given to do. And that being 'ugly' played more of a role in how someone is treated than their age, gender or how long they had worked there. Previous research has found that attractive students tend to be more popular in school. However, this study, led by associate professor of management at the University Brent Scott, is the first to find a direct correlation between attractiveness and bullying in the workplace. The research included findings from four studies conducted in the field and the laboratory. In one study, the researchers manipulated the expansiveness of workspaces in the lab and tested whether 'incidentally' expanded bodies - shaped organically by one’s environment - led to more dishonesty on a test. Another experiment examined whether participants in a more expansive driver’s seat would be more likely to 'hit and run' when incentivised to go fast in a video game driving simulation. To extend results to a real-world context, a field study tested the ecological validity of the effect by examining whether car drivers’ seat size predicted the violation of parking laws in New York City. The field study revealed that cars with more expansive driver’s seats were more likely to be illegally parked on New York City streets. Dr Yap, who is now a visiting professor at MIT Sloan School of Management in the US, said the research indicates that while people may pay very little attention to ordinary and seemingly innocuous shifts in bodily posture, these subtle postural shifts can have tremendous impact on our thoughts, feelings and behaviour.","Study says it elicits dishonest behaviour, such as stealing and cheating .

"President Obama sat down to talks with Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko in the White House Thursday, making a pledge to continue mobilizing the international community to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. Obama, however, stopped short of offering his Eastern European counterpart lethal military aid he had been asking for.

Obama praised Poroshenko's leadership, describing it as 'critical, at a very, very important time in Ukraine's history.' ‘Unfortunately, what we have also seen is Russian aggression, first in Crimea and most recently in portions of eastern Ukraine,’ he added. Mr Obama also hit out at Russia for violating Ukraine's sovereignty and accused Vladimir Putin's government of trying to undermine Poroshenko's reforms, reported AFP via Yahoo News.

"Motor racing supremo Bernie Ecclestone appeared in court yesterday on bribery charges which could see him jailed. The 83-year-old billionaire admits paying £27million to a German banker who was handling the sale of part of the Formula One business. He denies it was a bribe to ensure the stake went to his preferred buyer, claiming he was blackmailed and paid up to avoid false claims being made about his tax affairs. Scroll down for video . Bernie Ecclestone has arrived at a Munich courtroom today for the start of a five-month trial that could see him jailed for ten years . The result of the bribery case will also shape the future of Formula One, the billion-dollar sport Ecclestone has controlled like a puppeteer for close on 40 years . ‘The . sun is shining, I am confident,’ said the 5ft 2in Ecclestone as he . arrived at the court in Munich for the case, which could end his control . over the sport he has run for almost four decades. There was . laughter as Judge Peter Noll – who has previously said he viewed . Ecclestone with suspicion – asked him to clarify his marital status. ‘It . says in the indictment that you are divorced,’ said the judge. ‘I . thought you were married.’ Ecclestone, who was divorced by his 6ft 2in . second wife Slavica – mother of his daughters Tamara and Petra – in 2009 . and married a Brazilian nearly 50 years his junior in 2012, replied: . ‘Both are right. I like to remember the divorce part.’ The . prosecution case is detailed in a 256-page document which one newspaper . described as ‘painting a picture of a man desperate to protect his . sporting empire at all costs’. Ecclestone . said at the beginning of a four-hour personal statement read out in . German by his lawyers that he was 'grateful' to be able to give his side . of the story - though he told judges that he would answer questions . from the Munich state court through his lawyers, rather than personally. The . 83-year-old is charged with bribery and incitement to breach of trust, . and could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Flanked by his lawyers and with an interpreter at his side, he confirmed the pronunciation of his name and his date of birth to judge Peter Noll . Ecclestone stands next to his lawyers Sven Thomas (right) and Norbert Scharf (third right) as he waits for the opening of his trial . Ecclestone, a former used-car salesman who became a billionaire by building the sport into a global money spinner over the past four decades, denies wrongdoing and says he will fight to clear his name . In . today's statement, Ecclestone reiterated evidence he gave at . Gribkowsky's trial that he gave the banker the money because he was . 'blackmailed' and worried Gribkowsky would falsely accuse of him of . being in charge of a trust fund set up for the Formula One boss's former . wife and their children - possibly incurring a huge British tax bill. Ecclestone said that 'from today's point of view, it was not a rational decision' to pay Gribkowsky. 'I . saw my life's work in danger' if Gribkowsky went to the British tax . authorities, he said, adding that he would not have been able to pay the . resulting bill. Ecclestone, . a former used-car salesman who became a billionaire by building the . sport into a global money spinner over the past four decades, denies . wrongdoing and says he will fight to clear his name. CVC . remains the largest shareholder in Formula One, a business that . generates annual revenues of over $1.5 billion from its series of grand . prix races held around the world. CVC co-chairman Donald Mackenzie has said he would fire Ecclestone if he was found guilty of wrongdoing. At the heart of the 256-page indictment against Ecclestone is the accusation that he paid a bribe of £27million to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to maintain his control over Formula One . Prosecutors say that Gribkowsky, therefore, steered the sale of the sport to CVC, a private equity firm that had agreed to retain Ecclestone as F1's chief executive when they bought a majority shareholding in 2006 . He is accused of giving a $45m (£27.5m; 33m euros) bribe to a German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to secure the sale of a stake in the F1 business to a company he favoured. The allegation is that by securing the sale of the stake to a company Mr Ecclestone favoured, he would remain in charge of Formula 1 and its commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals. Mr Ecclestone admits paying Gerhard Gribkowsky, who is serving a jail sentence for receiving the payment, but has denied any wrongdoing. He says it was a 'shake down' as the banker had been threatening to reveal false details of his tax affairs. Despite . his age, Ecclestone attends almost every grand prix race and remains . central to the sport's commercial success. He has always dismissed talk . of retirement and there is no obvious replacement when he does finally . quit or is forced out. Uncertainty . over Ecclestone's future makes it hard to revisit stalled efforts to . launch an initial public offering of Formula One after a planned listing . in Singapore was abandoned because of turbulent markets two years ago. CVC paid about $830 million for a 47-percent stake in Formula One held by German bank BayernLB from 2002-06. Prosecutors . say that Ecclestone bribed Gribkowsky, chief risk officer at BayernLB, . to ensure that CVC took control of the sport rather than any rival . bidder. Gribkowsky, . who is expected to give evidence in this trial, was jailed for more . than eight years in Munich in 2012 for tax evasion and corruption in . relation to the payments. Ecclestone . has said he paid Gribkowsky $10 million but says this was designed to . silence him because the German banker was threatening to make false . claims about his tax affairs. Ecclestone denies the payments were linked to the CVC deal. Peter Noll, the judge who sentenced Gribkowsky, is also presiding over this case. The case is due to last until September 16, though the court will only sit one or two days a week. This will allow Ecclestone to continue to run the sport, albeit with help from close colleagues, especially his legal adviser and confidante Sacha Woodward-Hill. Third wife: Bernie Ecclestone, 82, with his new wife Fabiana Flosi, 35 . Slavica Ecclestone topped the Sunday Times' Rich List in the richest divorcees category after her split with Bernie in 2009 . The Formula 1 tycoon is worth an estimated £3billion, but he admitted in an interivew last year that his fame and fortune have not bought him joy. 'I . am not sure what happiness is. What do those feelings mean? I have . experienced satisfaction when I have planned something and it has come . off. But happiness? I am not so sure,' he said in a Times2 interview. The billionaire gave his daughter Tamara, 28, away last year when she married in South of France. But he told the newspaper that he did not even celebrate her nuptials. 'I didn't go to the celebrations the next day. I went home. I was there for a job and was happy to do that. I didn't want to hang around. The whole thing was a huge affair, too much really. But I didn't pay for it. My ex-wife did.' In 2009 Bernie and his wife of 23 years Slavica split up. Slavica, 55, topped the Sunday Times’ Rich List in the ‘richest divorcees’ category after she was awarded an . estimated £740million in 2009 in the divorce - it ended on the grounds . of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’. In . 2012 Ecclestone remarried Brazilian marketing director Fabiana Flosi, . 35, at Le Lion, his £23million chalet in the exclusive resort of Gstaad. The wedding was the third trip down the aisle for the octogenarian, who vowed to ‘remain single for the rest of his life.' In . the interview Ecclestone touched on the prospect of facing up 10 years . in prison - he has been charged with bribery by German prosecutors. 'If I get sent to jail I will have to deal with it. But I don't think I will like it very much,' he told the newspaper. The trial, . heard on one or two days a week so Ecclestone can carry out his F1 . duties, will continue on May 2.

"A Spanish mayor has been hailed an austerity-era Robin Hood after directing trolley dash raids on local supermarkets - then handing food out to poor families. Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo, mayor of the small Andalusian town of Marinaleda, has become a cult hero for master-minding the thefts. The two raids took place last week, with seven labour unionists arrested for piling food into the trolleys then leaving without paying. Scroll down for video . Marinaleda Mayor Juan Manuel Sanchez Gordillo, 59, gestures as he speaks during a popular assembly in Marinaleda, southern Spain . Mr Sanchez Gordillo (centre), 59, organised trolley-dash raids at local supermarkets and handed the food out to poor families . Mr Gordillo, 59, shouted encouragement from outside using a megaphone and was surrounded by supporters. He said the stolen food, mainly staples like pasta and oil, was distributed to families hit hardest by the economic crisis. “There are people who don’t have enough to eat. In the 21st century, this is an absolute disgrace,” he said, . He has political immunity as an elected member of Andalusia’s regional parliament, but says he would be happy to renounce it and be arrested himself. Mayor for the past 30 years, Mr Gordillo says he wants to draw attention to the human face of Spain’s economic crisis. Poverty levels throughout the country have risen by more than 15 percent since 2007, a quarter of workers are jobless and tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes. Marinaleda - population 2,645 - is located in Andalusia where one in three people is unemployed . Marinaleda's cooperative farmers use a tractor to prepare the irrigation system for growing artichokes . In his home region of Andalusia, one in three people is unemployed . But the conservative government says an official has no business flouting the law. “You can’t be Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham,” said Alfonso Alonso, spokesman for the ruling People’s Party (PP). “This man is just searching for publicity at the cost of everyone else.” Media coverage of the supermarket stunt has made Mr Gordillo a national celebrity, with ordinary people thanking him for his stand against the government. He will remain in the spotlight today (THUR), when he sets of on a three-week anti-austerity march to Madrid, enduring blistering summer heat. Along the way he will try to persuade other local leaders to refuse to comply with government reforms. The EU has demanded that Spain shrink its budget deficits to prevent the eurozone debt crisis from spreading. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has ordered spending cuts and tax hikes, but with poverty rising protests have gained momentum. VIDEO: Shop raid!

Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura urged people to stay calm, saying the military is preparing 'just in case'. A statement from the Defence Ministry said Japan would send destroyers equipped with Aegis missile defence systems to the Pacific and East China Sea and deploy mobile Patriot missile launchers to islands in Okinawa. An interceptor missile unit is also likely to be deployed in Tokyo, although the capital is far from the expected flight path. North Korea has said the aim of the launch is to send a satellite into orbit.

"The biathalete currently training to compete in the Sochi Winter Olympics thanks to her twin's selfless act giving up her own place on the American team spoke with Today this morning, pledging to do her best for her sister. Twin sisters Lanny and Tracy Barnes have been competing in the biathalon - the sport that combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting - for the last 15 years. Lanny Barnes appeared via live video from Italy where she was training Thursday while her sister Tracy was in the studio, already back in the U.S. She told Matt Lauer that she usually knows what her sister is thinking, but was completely shocked when Tracy told her she was passing up her spot on the team so that she could compete instead. Scroll down for video . Selfless: Lanny Barnes (center) is currently training in Italy to compete in the Sochi Winter Olympics after her twin sister Tracy (right) gave up her own spot on the team . 'I want to do my best for Tracy, and I always do better under pressure, so I'm definitely going to push as hard as I can and just fight that much harder for her,' Lanny said. Lanny initially didn't make the team after falling ill during trials and was the first person cut from the team. Sister Tracy says she started planning to give up her spot on the team as soon as she figured out her twin was sick. 'I was real disappointed when I heard that she was getting sick,' Tracy said. 'In this sport, you have to be 100 percent to perform at the level that we need to perform at. I kind of knew that things weren’t going to go well for her. It was completely disappointing.' Blindsided: Lanny (left) says she usually knows what her sister (right) is thinking, but was completely shocked when she gave up her spot on the team so that Lanny could compete in the Olympics instead . Tracy decided to go through with her plan when the cuts were announced because she knew that Lanny deserved her position after performing so well throughout the year. 'She's having a great year, and I think when you care enough about someone you're willing to make that kind of sacrifice,’' Tracy said. So on their ritual post-competition hike, Tracy broke the news to Lanny that she wouldn't take the spot on the team, and that Lanny would be going in her place as the person who placed just below her. Of course, Lanny put up a fight. Stand by your sister: Tracy (right) and Lanny (left) Barnes were able to shared in their Olympic dream in 2006 when they both made the team to compete in Turin, Italy . 'I was like, ""Tracy, there’s no way. This is your spot. You earned this,""' Lanny recalled. 'She was very adamant about me going and she said, ""No, I want you to go."" It was a very emotional moment for both of us.' 'It just was one of those moments that I think changed my life forever,' Lanny added. As top competitors in the same sport, the Colorado-based twins have always worried about one person making the team and the other being cut. Both were able to share their Olympic dream by making the team to compete in the 2006 games in Turin, Italy. In a beautiful statement that explains her decision, Tracy Barnes said her twin sister Lanny deserved a second chance after failing to make the Winter Olympics team. Tracy said her sibling was having a 'stellar season' before falling ill and that she is honored to be able to help her . But for the following 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, just Lanny made the cut. As Lanny's twin as well as best friend, Tracy may have seen that her sister had more passion to compete than her. The twins' mother, Deb Barnes, told The Durango Herald that Tracy's motivation to go to the Olympics had waned in the last year. She is married to Durango Nordic race team coach Gary Colliander, and her mother said they haven't been able to spend much time together because of her heavy travel schedule. 'Tracy is just ready for other things,' Deb Barnes told the newspaper. Tracy Barnes competes in the Womens Biathlon 15km Individual Final at the Turin Winter Olympic Games in 2006.

"Ukraine's 'Human Barbie' has heeded a call from Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to fill Crimea's near-empty beaches. Model Valeria Lukyanova, 28, from Ukraine, proudly posed in the Black Sea peninsula which has been boycotted by millions of tourists since the Kremlin's annexation of the region from Ukraine. 'Here I am in Yalta - hooray,' she boasted to her social media followers. The show of support for Russia comes as the Kiev government claimed police have found a mass grave containing 52 corpses in a Ukrainian city formerly occupied by pro-Russian rebels. Scroll down for videos . Valeria Lukyanova, 28, from Ukraine, has heeded a call from Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to fill Crimea's near-empty beaches as she proudly posed in the Black Sea peninsula . The world famous 'Human Barbie' lives in strife-torn Ukraine - in Odessa - but has recently shown her strong support for Russia . Her picture in the resort of Yalta will warm the heart of Putin, who is trying strong arm tactics to get Russian tourists to Crimea to save its flagging tourist industry . The find is in addition to the earlier discovery of 14 bodies, claimed Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko. 'Police have interrogated a man who was burying the bodies on the order of terrorists,' he said. 'He pointed at a mass grave where 52 bodies were buried, but this is not all. Many bodies were buried here and there. We are working at locating all the bodies.' 'Human Barbie' Lukyanova lives in strife-torn Ukraine - in Odessa - but has recently shown her strong support for Russia. For example, she told GQ magazine: 'I tend to cut off anything I don't need. The next step is to cut off Ukraine entirely, because all I get here is s***. Why waste myself on this?' Her picture in the resort of Yalta will warm the heart of Putin, who is trying strong arm tactics to get Russian tourists to Crimea to save its flagging tourist industry. Lukyanova, whose grandfather was from Siberia in Russia, was visiting her mother Irina Pashkeeva, 47, who lives in Crimea . State bodies are even under orders to send their employees on subsidised breaks to the peninsula. But unlike Lukyanova, millions of Ukrainians are giving Crimea a miss this year following Putin's audacious March occupation. Lukyanova prides herself on her similarity to the Mattel doll, helped by her attachment to 'Breatharianism', which means surviving on 'cosmic micro-food', otherwise known as air and light. 'In recent weeks I have not been hungry at all. I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on air and light alone,' she said earlier this year. She complained about the huge queues at border checkpoints from mainland Ukraine into Crimea, an ex-Soviet holiday paradise which has seen a cut in its annual six million tourists this summer following the Kremlin takeover. Last week the local capital Simferopol's airport welcomed its one millionth arrival of the season, but she arrived by road, across an unofficial border where poor relations between Ukraine and Russia lead to interminable delays. Police have found a mass grave containing 52 corpses in a Ukrainian city formerly occupied by pro-Russian rebels, the Kiev government has claimed . 'We went to the Crimea and the queue at customs was unreal. In four hours we moved 100 metres and there was an endless line in front,' she complained. Lukyanova, whose grandfather was from Siberia in Russia, was visiting her mother Irina Pashkeeva, 47, who lives in Crimea. Irina is a strong advocate of other regions in southern and eastern Ukraine joining Russia. Her social media site contains this appeal to pro-Russians: 'Do not give up! fight! Our grandfathers fought with bare hands against the fascists! Do not disgrace the honour of the Great Warrior! Be aware that Russia is always with you!' It reads: 'It's now or never! The Junta in Kiev has declared a war on us. There are armed mercenaries throughout southeastern Ukraine.' Lukyanova's mother also supports a controversial group called 'Ukraine Doesn't Exist Any More'. Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said some 300 people are missing in Donetsk region, including the 'victims' of pro-Russian 'terrorists' and fighters from Russia who came to Ukraine as mercenaries . Russia is waging a campaign to persuade its people to holiday in Crimea after annexing the territory in spring. Putin has been accused of turning into a travel agency with menaces by preventing many officials in security agencies and the police from going abroad for holidays. Many have been told to travel to the Crimea instead. Tourist chiefs have recently claimed many more Russians are coming to the peninsula's Black Sea beaches after a lacklustre start to the season. Meanwhile, police have found a mass grave containing 52 corpses in a Ukrainian city formerly occupied by pro-Russian rebels, the Kiev government has claimed. The find is in addition to the earlier discovery of 14 bodies, claimed Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko. Some 300 people are missing in Donetsk region, including the 'victims' of pro-Russian 'terrorists' and fighters from Russia who came to Ukraine as mercenaries, Gerashchenko said. He claimed that the burials were undertaken in Slavyansk on the orders of controversial rebel commander Igor Strelkov, aka Igor Girkin, who wanted a monument to the defenders of Novorossiya, the area of eastern Ukraine that rebels claim should be part of Russia. Soldiers of the Ukrainian battalion 'Aydar' cover coffins of colleagues and friends with the Ukraine flag during a funeral ceremony yesterday in Starobelsk, in the Lugansk area . A Ukrainian soldier pays his last respects to fallen colleagues during yesterday's funeral ceremony in Starob . 'A different monument will be erected there - to the victims of Putin's terrorism and of those terrorists he brought here,' said Gerashchenko. The identities of the latest victims are not known, but among the mass grave of 14, found earlier, were worshippers at a local protestant church, he said. One was a priest and his two sons who had helped people flee the city when it was under the grip of rebels. Another was a father of eight, named Vladimir Velichko. A third victim was named as Viktor Brodarsky, a father of three. 'We are ready to arrange for DNA samples for residents of the Russian Federation who know that their relatives travelled to the so-called Novorossiya and did not come back,' he said. They would be able in this way 'to find out whether their relatives could be buried in graves around Slavyansk and other Ukrainian cities'. The EU is to approve new sanctions against Russia today over the Ukraine crisis. People gather outside a damaged  block of flats following what locals say was recent shelling by Ukrainian forces in central Donetsk . This comes amid fears that human remains still at the MH17 crash site in Donetsk region may never be collected amid nearby fighting between rebels and the Ukrainian army. 'It's absolutely unconscionable that they remain out there,' said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Some remains may never be recovered, admit Dutch investigators. 'I believe the chances are not very good that we will get it all,' said Dutch police chief Gerard Bouman. Strelkov today claimed a 'rapid increase' in the number of Ukrainian army soldiers who are surrendering. 'I order all commanders and fighters of the Donetsk People's Republic's militia forces not to open fire on groups or solitary servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who raise a white flag or make their intent to surrender known in a different way,' he said. Local officials have today said intense fighting between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine killed at least 19 civilians. Ukrainian forces have been pushing rebel units back towards their two main urban strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk and have sought to encircle them in several places, including in the wider area where MH17 crashed on July 17. Residents of the village of Rakoshyno, some 30km from the western Ukrainian city of Uzhgorod,  hold placards as they block the international highway which connects Kiev and Chop, western Ukraine . Residents of the village of Rakoshyno hold a placard reading 'We are against mobilization!!!' as they block the international highway which connects Kiev and Chop . Officials said 14 people, including five children, were killed in fighting on Monday evening in the town of Horlivka, one of several spots that saw fierce battles between the rival forces in the last few days. In the city of Luhansk, officials said five civilians were killed when shelling hit a retirement home. 'The enemy is throwing everything it has into the battle to complete encirclement of the DNR,' rebel commander Igor Strelkov told journalists in Donetsk on Monday evening, referring to the self-proclaimed 'Donetsk People's Republic'. 'We were astonished by how much amour they threw into this battle,' said Strelkov, a Russian national, sporting a camouflage T-shirt and trousers. A rebel source in Donetsk said reinforcements including military equipment and fighters had crossed the nearby border with Russia into Ukraine. Reuters was not able to confirm that independently.

"Parents should be careful what they tell their children because lying to them can directly influence how honest they are, according to a study. In fact, the more the children are lied to, the greater the chance of them also cheating and lying. The results of the study suggest children are more inclined to lie if they discover adults have not been telling the truth - but the researchers aren't entirely sure why this is. Parents shouldn't lie to their children (illustration shown) as this will encourage them to, in turn, lie more themselves, according to researchers. The study was carried out by the University of California in San Diego although an exact reason for the result isn't known . The study at the University of California tested 186 children aged three to seven in a temptation-resistance game. Many adults will admit to telling white lies to children to make their lives a little easier. But research has found children can spot this tactic, and can even tell when their parents or teachers are deliberately withholding information from them. Once spotted, a study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found children will then try to fill in the gaps in the information themselves. Determining who to trust is an important skill to learn at an early age because so much of our knowledge about the world comes from other people, explained Hyowon Gweon, lead author of the paper  which is published in the journal Cognition. ‘When someone provides us information, we not only learn about what is being taught, we also learn something about that person. If the information is accurate and complete, then you might also trust that person in the future,’ she said. Approximately half of the children were lied to by a researcher, who said there was a huge bowl of sweets in the next room, but quickly confessed this was just a ruse to get the child to come and play a game. The others were simply invited to play, with no mention of sweets. The game asked children to identify character toys they couldn’t see, by their sounds. Sounds and toys were relatively easy to pair, although one sound was deliberately tricky: Beethoven’s Fur Elise. When the classical music was played, the researcher was called out of the room to supposedly take a phone call, leaving the children alone in the room for 90 seconds and tempting them to take a peek at the mysterious toy making that sound. The children were explicitly asked not to peek. On returning, the researcher also explicitly asked the children to tell the truth. The five-, six- and seven-year-olds who had been lied to were both more likely to cheat, and then more likely to lie about having done so. Leslie Carver, associate professor of . psychology and human development in the University of California’s San . Diego Division of Social Sciences said: 'As far as we know, this is the . first experiment confirming what we might have suspected - lying by an . adult affects a child’s honesty.' About 60 per cent of the school-aged children who had not been lied to in the study peeked at the tricky temptation toy, and about 60 per cent of the peekers lied about it later. Among those that had been lied to, those figures rose to nearly 80 per cent peeking and nearly 90 per cent of the peekers lying. In the study, children were asked to identify well-known character toys (stock image pictured) they couldn't see, using their associated sounds. One of the toys was intentionally difficult to identify and the researchers found the children were more likely to cheat, and then say they hadn't cheated, if they'd been lied to earlier . However the study, published in the journal Developmental Science, doesn’t know why. 'It could be the five- to seven-year-old children were simply imitating the behaviour modeled by the adult, or it could be they were making judgments about the importance of honesty to this adult,' said Professor Carver. 'Or, it could be more nuanced. Perhaps the children did not feel the need to uphold their commitment to tell the truth to someone who they perceived as a liar.' But it didn’t seem to make any difference to the pre-schoolers - they peeked and lied at about the same rates. This may be because three- and four-year-olds don’t have very sophisticated abilities yet, said the research team. Professor Carver added: 'Even if it’s expedient for an adult to lie, to get cooperation through deception, for example, or to get children to control their emotions, it’s probably a bad idea in the long run. 'The actions of parents suggest that they do not believe that the lies they tell their children will impact the child’s own honesty. 'The current study casts doubt on that belief. Even a little white lie might have consequences.'","Children who are lied to are more likely to lie themselves, research claims .

"Detectives investigating the disappearance of Tia Sharp have made two further arrests. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed that Tia's grandmother, 46-year-old Christine Sharp, was arrested on suspicion of . murder yesterday, she has been taken to a south London police station where she . remains in custody. Paul Meehan, a 39-year-old neighbour of Christine Sharp, was also arrested yesterday, on suspicion of . assisting an offender. He also remains in custody in a south London police station. Scroll down for video . Captured on camera: Stuart Hazell is seen in a shop shortly before his arrest yesterday . CCTV: Stuart Hazell buys cigarettes from a shop in Mitcham . After he visited this shop Mr Hazell was arrested in a park in Merton by police on suspicion of murder . Police were accused of incredible blunders last night after the body of Tia Sharp was found hidden at her grandmother’s home. They even allowed ‘step-grandfather’ Stuart Hazell to go missing for several hours before he was arrested . following a tip-off from a member of the public. He . was being detained last night on suspicion of murder. Neighbours were . left questioning why it took more than 100 officers seven days to locate . Tia, 12, when her body had been in the house all along. And last night police refused to . discuss where in the property the discovery was made even though they . used ladders to access the loft. Three searches had already been carried . out and detectives are investigating whether the 12-year-old’s body was . moved between the roof spaces of neighbouring properties. A body has been found but police have refused to confirm if it is schoolgirl Tia Sharp . Hazell was arrested by officers on Cannon Hill Common in Morden, South-West London, at 8.25pm. Sources said he was the subject of a ‘controlled arrest’ after a member of the public had alerted them. The arrest brought a relatively swift end to a manhunt into which the Met had poured vast resources. Witnesses claimed Hazell appeared to be drunk and was calling out ‘Have you seen Tia?’ before he was held. Chloe Bird, 11, said Hazell was in a mini market on Cannon Hill Lane, beside a hairdressers, buying a small bottle of vodka. She said: 'He was crying and looked drunk. He just kept saying 'have you seen her - I want her back, I miss her so much'.' Chloe . recognised Hazell from the news. After the encounter at around 5.30pm . she ran home and told her stepfather Nick Keeley, 40, who called the . police. Bryoni Goodwin said Hazell walked into the salon where she worked smelling of alcohol saying a little girl was lost. The hairdresser described the suspect, who was wearing a baseball hat, a white vest and a red jacket, as ‘all over the place’. She said Hazell entered the Sculpture . hair salon on Cannon Hill Lane at around 5.30pm, a short distance from . the park where he was later arrested. After walking into the salon he entered a neighbouring shop in which he was seen on CCTV buying a bottle of vodka and a lighter. ‘He came into the salon and my boss dealt with him. He said “Have you seen Tia?’’,’ said Miss Goodwin, 18. Picture shows Stuart Hazell accompanying police from Christine Sharp's home in New Addington. Surrey . Emotional: Stuart Hazell, 37, claimed he 'loved Tia to bits' Grief: Tributes and candles are laid near the home of Christine Sharp as 'inconsolable' neighbours suspect that the body found in the home is that of Tia . Tia has been missing . since last Friday and police have found a corpse but will not . confirm if it is her . ‘He told us that he was her granddad . and I did recognise him from the TV but at that stage I didn’t realise . he was wanted. He said she was used to walking in the area as she went . to school around here and that he was looking for her. ‘He had tears in his eyes the whole . time but we thought that was normal. We told him we hadn’t seen her and . then he walked out with tears in  his eyes.’ Staff in the salon realised Hazell was . wanted in connection with the incident only after a customer checked . the news on her phone. The owner of the salon then phoned the police who, Miss Goodwin said, arrived five minutes later. Neighbours expressed disbelief that . the 37-year-old was able to disappear in the middle of Britain’s highest . profile missing person inquiry. There are fears that the week’s delay . in discovering Tia could mean vital evidence inside her grandmother . Christine’s home has been lost. Dozens of people, including relatives, . friends, media and police, entered the small terrace council home . during the search for the missing girl. The tragic discovery of her body . ended hopes that the schoolgirl could still be found alive one week . after she disappeared from New Addington, near Croydon in South London. Police were alerted to the possible . presence of a body when sniffer dogs trained to detect decomposition . returned to her grandmother’s home early yesterday. A forensic team was sent in as a . cordon was erected around the shabby property, followed by large . screens. Officers will now undertake a painstaking examination of the . house before removing the body for a post-mortem examination. Combing for clues: Christine Sharp's house is searched by forensic officers after a body was discovered . Grim discovery: Christine Sharp, who has Tia's name tattooed on her foot, leaves her home where a body was discovered today . Mourning: Floral tributes and candles have been laid by neighbours in the belief that the body found is Tia's . A pathologist will be asked to determine how and when Tia died and whether she was physically or sexually assaulted. It is understood that the roof spaces . of the row of 1960s properties are only partially separated by dividing . brick walls. Senior officers launched a huge manhunt when they realised . Hazell was unaccounted for. The jobless painter and decorator was last seen on Thursday evening after he fiercely denied harming Tia. Senior officers held a series of . emergency meetings as dozens of angry neighbours gathered around the . house when news of the discovery spread. Residents, including many who joined searches of streets and woodland, warned of a potential riot over police mistakes. The eight day search.jpg . Ginny Oteng, 46, said: ‘I was praying . their little girl would be found alive and well. I had suspicions but it . is still such a shock.’ A former senior police officer also . expressed his shock at the way the inquiry, a murder investigation in . everything but name, was conducted. Colin Sutton, who caught Milly . Dowler’s killer Levi Bellfield, said he was ‘surprised’ at how long the . police operation had taken. ‘The first rule of a missing child . inquiry is to search the home. I am desperately sad for the family and . desperately angry  the house wasn’t cleared earlier,’ he said. Criminologist Professor David Wilson said he could not understand why the house was not treated as a crime scene from day one. Former Met detective Kevin Hurley said . he was concerned police were scared of ‘robustly’ investigating crimes . and should be allowed to act on instinct without fear of repercussions. Police revealed they had searched Mrs Sharp’s home three times in the . past seven days, including a detailed search of Tia’s bedroom. Commander Neil Basu, of the . Metropolitan Police, said last night he wanted to  ‘clarify some of the . speculation’ over how police missed the body,  suggesting it had been . moved. Only the day before Tia’s body was found, Stuart Hazell gave a TV interview insisting he was innocent. He broke down on Thursday afternoon as he complained people were ‘pointing fingers’ at him and claimed he ‘loved her to bits’. He said: ‘Did I do anything to Tia? No, I bloody didn’t. I’d never think of it, I loved her to bits like she is my own daughter. She wanted it, she got it. She has got a loving home. I know deep down she walked down that path. What happened after that I don’t know.’ Hazell, who was interviewed by detectives as a witness for two hours on Wednesday, pleaded: ‘Tia come home babe, come home – come back and eat your dinner. I want things back to normal.’ Combing for clues: Police seal off the estate surrounding the home of Christine Sharp as they bring in sniffer dogs to the address . Tia Sharp's home is in New Addington and Stuart Hazell was arrested in Merton . Hazell gave what he claimed was a step-by-step account of his movements in the hours before Tia left. He described how after meeting Tia in Croydon on Thursday afternoon they travelled home by tram and spent the evening playing computer games together, while Mrs Sharp was working overnight as a carer. The following morning he claimed he made coffee and did some chores and told Tia to put her phone on charge which is why she did not have it on her when she went out. 'She was telling me what she was doing but I wasn’t really logging it into my head,’ he told ITV News. According to Hazell, he was vacuuming at 12.10pm when Tia said goodbye to him. ‘I said, “Make sure you’re back at six”, she went “yeah yeah yeah” and that was it and the door closed and she walks out.’ He said that Tia did not have a front door key or Oyster travel card and had instead gone into town using £10 he had given her for household chores and gardening. Hazell, 37, added: ‘It’s not about me it’s about Tia – we have got to get her home. ‘She’s got no problems at all, she’s a happy go-lucky golden angel. ‘She’s perfect, there’s no arguments, nothing we can think of.’ VIDEO: CCTV of Stuart Hazell in an off-license before being arrested...

"Hundreds of private emails detailing Michael Jackson’s dramatic deterioration in his final days will play a key role in a £26.5billion ($41billion) wrongful death trial beginning today in Los Angeles. The messages sent by executives at AEG, the US entertainment giant behind the star’s doomed comeback tour, reveal the 50-year-old singer’s turmoil as he struggled with his health and inner demons to prepare for the lucrative concerts. Opening statements begin this morning in the case being brought by Jackson's mother and his three children, who claim AEG was liable in the June 25, 2009 tragedy. Doomed: The emails between executives from entertainment giant AEG are believed to reveal Michael Jackson's declining health ahead of his doomed This Is It comeback tour . Suit: Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson is one of the family members who have brought the suit against AEG . Children: Damages are also being sought on behalf of the star's children Prince (left) Blanket (middle) and Paris (right) The trial, expected to last up to three months, could include testimony from Jackson’s two older children, Prince Michael, 16, and Paris, 14, as well as celebrity witnesses including Diana Ross, Prince and the singer’s two ex-wives, Lisa Marie Presley and Debbie Rowe. The suit, demanding a staggering £26.5 billion in damages, accuses AEG’ s concert promotions arm of hiring and controlling Dr Conrad Murray, who administered the fatal dose of propofol to the pop singer shortly before he was scheduled to appear in the ‘This Is It’ O2 Arena shows. ‘AEG had legal duties to Michael Jackson to treat him safely and to not put him in harm’s way. But AEG, despite its knowledge of Michael Jackson’s physical condition, breached those duties by putting its desire for massive profits from the tour over the health and safety of Michael Jackson,’ the complaint alleges. Evidence: The star's former wives Lisa Marie Presley (left) and Debbie Rowe could be asked to give testimony during the trial . Jailed: Dr Conrad Murray wwas jailed for four years for causing involuntary manslaughter for his role in Michael Jackson's death . Mr Jackson’s personal doctor is serving a four-year prison sentence after being found guilty of manslaughter in 2011. According to a senior AEG lawyer, the company is likely to bring up Jackson’s drug shopping as well as his acquittal on child molestation charges as part of their case that the promoter had no liability in the tragedy. The Jackson family's lawyers are likely to zero in on the emails they claim show how aware the company’s senior executives were of the singer's fragile state. Stars: Singer Diana Ross is one of a number of celebrities who could be asked to give evidence during the court case . When Randy Phillips, a promoter at AEG, . went to Jackson’s London hotel suite the day before the singer announced . his comeback concerts he found him so drunk that he had to dress him. ‘MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent. I [am] trying to sober him up,’ Phillips wrote to the company’s president Tim Leiweke. In the US where Mr Leiweke had just woken up, he replied: ‘Are you kidding me?’ ‘I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking. He is an emotionally paralysed mess riddled with self loathing and doubt now that it is show time,' Mr Phillips responded. By June that year the alarm bells were ringing and a production manager wrote that Jackson was a ‘basket case.’ The show’s director, Kenny Ortega, who had known Jackson for two decades, called for him to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. He also said the star would have to lip synch some of his songs because he was racked by ‘paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behaviour’. After Jackson's, Mr Phillips wrote in August 2009: ‘Michael’s death is a terrible tragedy, but life must go on. AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd.’ AEG would go on to earn about £160 million from the documentary film ‘This Is It’, which featured rehearsal footage. Lawyers representing the company will claim that Murray was hired by Jackson and not by the promoter. The civil trial jury took more than three weeks to select. The Jacksons are seeking a judgment against AEG equal to the money he would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime had he not died in 2009, plus exorbitant damages.","Messages sent by executives at US entertainment giant AEG .

"Apple boss Tim Cook defended the iPhone giant today after it was revealed that the world’s most valuable company pays little or no tax on tens of billions of dollars stashed in offshore subsidiaries. The company CEO faced a grilling from lawmakers in what was tagged as ‘Apple bashing day’ on Capitol Hill. Insisting that Apple was an all-American company, Mr Cook brushed off criticism from a Senate panel, saying: ‘We estimate that the App Store has developed over 300,000 jobs in the U.S. None of that activity was there five years ago.’ He said the ‘design and development’ of Apple products remains focused on the United States and blasted America’s tax laws for not keeping pace with ‘the digital age.’ Scroll down for video . Defending Apple: Apple CEO Tim Cook testified on Capitol Hill in Washington, before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent subcommittee over the company's taxes . Demanding answers: Chairman Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., holds up his own Apple iPhone, on Capitol Hill in Washington, as he presses the Apple boss for answers on tax avoidance . He was called to account in Washington after a 40-page report issued by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations threw a spotlight on Apple’s tax strategies. The probe discovered that Apple employs a group of affiliate companies outside America to avoid paying tax. One Apple satellite in Ireland earned $22 billion in 2011 – but reportedly paid just $10 million in taxes. Apple’s arrangement has allowed it to pay just 1.9 per cent tax on its $37 billion in overseas profits in 2012, despite the fact that the average tax rate for countries in its main markets was 24 per cent last year, says the report. ‘Apple wasn’t satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,’ said subcommittee member Senator Carl Levin. ‘Apple sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.’ On the stand: Senator Carl Levin gave Apple CEO Tim Cook (center) a grilling and said Apple sought 'the Holy Grail of tax avoidance' Interrogation: Apple head of tax operations Phillip Bullock, Apple CEO Timothy Cook and Apple Senior Vice President and CFO Peter Oppenheimer prepare to testify before the Senate Homeland Security . Former presidential candidate John McCain said that while Apple claims to be the biggest U.S. corporate taxpayer, it is also ‘among America’s largest tax avoiders.’ But Republican Senator Rand Paul insisted his fellow lawmakers should stop talking about ‘evil Apple.’ ‘I’m very frustrated by these proceedings. They’re just doing what every company does. Bring me a company that tries to maximize their tax burden,’ he added. Tax professor Richard Harvey told the panel he almost ‘fell off my chair’ when he heard Apple claim it didn’t use tax gimmicks. ‘This is going to be an Apple-bashing day,’ he added. Apple uses five companies located in Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, says the report. The companies are located at the same address in Cork and they share members of their boards of directors. While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country. That means the other three aren’t legally required to pay taxes in Ireland because they aren’t managed or controlled in that country, in Apple’s view. Sworn in to testify: Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies over the offshore profit shifting and the U.S. tax code, on Capitol Hill . Media attention: Apple CEO Tim Cook arrives on Capitol Hill, in Washington, and is swarmed by photographers and journalists . Apple says it complies with the law and pays ‘an extraordinary amount’ of tax. ‘Apple does not use tax gimmicks,’ the company said in a statement. ‘And Apple pays all its required taxes, both in this country and abroad,’ it added. The spotlight on Apple’s tax strategy comes at a time of growing concern in London and Washington over the amount of revenue lost because of money stashed offshore. Search giant Google, online retailer Amazon.com and coffee chain Starbucks have all come under criticism for arranging their affairs in a way that leaves them liable to low rates of tax on billions of pounds of overseas sales. Microsoft has used ‘aggressive’ transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in Puerto Rico, Ireland and Singapore, in part to avoid taxes. HP has used complex offshore loan transactions worth billions while using the money to run its US operations, according to the panel. The subcommittee’s report estimates that Apple avoided at least $3.5 billion in US taxes in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by using the tactic. The Cupertino, California-based company paid $2.4 billion in taxes in 2011 and $6 billion in 2012. US firms invested $30 billion in Ireland last year, more than in China and the rest of emerging Asia combined, according to the American Chamber of Commerce. Getting a grilling: Tim Cook got aggressive as he testified over Apple's tax ethics and offshore subsidiaries . Meanwhile, Irish deputy prime . minister Eamon Gilmore yesterday said it was not to blame for Apple . Inc's low global tax payments and said they had no special rate with the . company. The Irish government, which has seen . the luring of U.S. multinationals with low taxes as a key part of its . economic policy since the 1960s, said its system was transparent and . other countries were responsible if the tax rate paid by Apple was too . low. He told national broadcaster RTE: . 'They are issues that arise from the taxation systems in other . jurisdictions, and that is an issue that has to be addressed first of . all in those jurisdictions.' The . Senate subcommittee identified three subsidiaries that have no tax . residency either in Ireland, where they are incorporated, or in the . United States, where those companies are managed. The . main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores . throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last . five years, the report said. The report said: 'Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple'. Senate investigation found Apple uses affiliate companies in Ireland (pictured) to avoid billions in U.S. income tax . Horses graze over the road from the Ireland Apple headquarters on the edge of Cork . The report says Apple capitalizes on a difference between U.S. and Irish rules regarding tax residency. In Ireland, a company must be . managed and controlled in the country to be a tax resident. Under U.S. law, a company is a tax resident of the country in which it was . established. Therefore, the Apple companies are not tax residents of Ireland nor of the U.S., since they were not incorporated in the U.S. The strategies Apple uses are legal, and many other multinational corporations use similar tax techniques to avoid paying U.S. income taxes on profits they reap overseas. However, the tactics have raised questions about loopholes in the U.S. tax code, lawmakers say. The spotlight on Apple's tax strategy comes at a time of fevered debate in Washington over whether and how to raise revenues to help reduce the federal deficit. Many Democrats complain that the government is missing out on collecting billions because companies are stashing profits abroad and avoiding taxes. Republicans want to cut the corporate . tax rate of 35 per cent and ease the tax burden on money that U.S. companies make abroad. They say the move would encourage companies to . invest at home. Apple's main headquarters are in  California (pictured) but they have no apparent tax residency, the report said . As previously reported by The . Associated Press, the overlooked asset that Apple has been building up . could boost Apple's profits by as much as $10.5billion. However, Apple . has been lobbying to change U.S. law so it can erase its tax liabilities . in a less conspicuous fashion. In its second quarter ended March 31, . Apple posted its first profit decline in ten years. Net income was . $9.5billion, or $10.09 a share, down 18 per cent from $11.6billion, or . $12.30 a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue increased 11 per . cent, to $43.6billion. Apple said in April that it will distribute $100 billion in cash to its shareholders by the end of 2015. The company is expanding its share . buyback program to $60billion, the largest buyback authorization in . history, and is raising its quarterly dividend by 15 per cent, to $3.05 a . share. In Monday's regular trading session, Apple's stock rose $9.67, or 2.23 per cent, to close at $442.93. President . Barack Obama has proposed using the tax code to encourage companies to . move jobs back to the U.S. and discourage them from shifting jobs . abroad. Amazon is one of the multinationals that have been criticized over its tax affairs . Apple is the latest multinational to be hit by tax avoidance accusations. Investigations are currently underway in both the U.S. and UK into corporations who have a turnover of billions but pay a fraction of that in taxes. In the UK, Google was accused of doing evil' by a Parliamentary committee after MPs claimed the internet giant by using 'devious, calculated and unethical' trucks to minimize its liabilities. It paid just $11 million in corporation tax last year despite having a UK turnover of $4.5 billion. Elsewhere, Amazon could be investigated by the UK Public Accounts Committee after paying just $3.7 million in corporation tax on UK sales of $485 million last year. But the Seattle-based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount, claiming the UK sales were actually more than $6 billion. Starbucks was one of the first companies to be accused of tax avoidance when the row erupted last year. It has since agreed to pay $30 million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009. France has also said it will fight tax avoidance and President Francois Hollande has called for the 'eradication' of tax havens. He told French banks last month that they must declare any foreign subsidiaries each year as he presented a draft law drawn up in response to the country's recent tax scandal.","Senate subcommittee says Apple skipped $9billion in federal taxes in 2012 .

"Andre Agassi smashed his prized Wimbledon cup and every tennis trophy he had in a jealous rage after watching his then girlfriend Brooke Shields film a scene for Friends. The 'Blue Lagoon' beauty was in the middle of filming one of the most popular episodes of the show when Mr Agassi stormed off the set. He had been watching on the sound stage as guest star Shields licked the fingers of Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc, and threw her head back with maniacal laughter. Scroll down for video . Andre Agassi (left) smashed his prized Wimbledon cup and every tennis trophy he had in a jealous rage over his then girlfriend Brooke Shields (right) He had been watching on the sound stage as guest star Shields licked the fingers of Joey, played by Matt Leblanc, and threw her head back with maniacal laughter . But the tennis champion told his then girlfriend she had 'made him look a fool' in the scene with actor Matt Leblanc. Ms Shields wrote that her beau got in his car in Los Angeles and drove all the way home to Las Vegas. 'Upon arrival he systematically smashed and destroyed every single trophy he had won, including Wimbledon and the US Open, never mind all the others, ' she added, according to Globe magazine in the US. In her memoir, 'There Was A Little Girl: The Real Story of Mother and Me,' Shields says it took her three years to have all the trophies replaced after the 1995 incident. The tennis champion told his then girlfriend she had 'made him look a fool' in the scene with Leblanc . Agassi, now 44, won the Wimbledon singles title in 1992 and went on to claim four Australian titles, two US Opens and the French Open in a glittering 20-year career. Despite the flashpoint, the former child star and the tennis champion wed in April 1997. It would be another two years before they divorced just shy of their second wedding anniversary but Shields wrote that it didn't take her long to wish she'd never gone through with the ceremony. The day after the wedding in Big Sur, California, she realised she had made a 'mistake.' 'I could not form a sentence. I kept shaking my head as if I had duct tape across my mouth. It hit me all of a sudden - I knew I had made a mistake. I did not want to be married…I wanted to be a bride but I shouldn't have been married yet,' she wrote. The couple were busy working apart for much of their marriage and Shields said the relationship was 'just existing.' Later, she wrote that Agassi had broken down and told her 'that for the whole first part of our relationship he had been addicted to crystal meth. 'I was shocked but immediately got hurt and insulted that he had not come to me at the time.' Despite the argument, the former child star and the tennis champion married in April 1997 - the day after, she says, she realised she had made a 'mistake' She added: 'I feared our life together was not based in absolute truth.' A candid autobiography written by Agassi also suggests the lavish wedding to the actress was a mistake. From the four helicopters full of paparazzi circling overhead to the groom wearing  elevator shoes to avoid being dwarfed by his towering bride, the celebration is rendered in 'Open' as a bleak farce. 'I have a thought no man should have on his wedding day: I wish I were leaving too. I wish I had a decoy groom to take my place,' he revealed in his autobiography. Soon after his divorce in 1999, Mr Agassi began wooing Steffi Graf, another former tennis prodigy, who, Agassi says, loathed the game as much as he did but surpassed him in disciplined, competitive fury. Speaking 14 years after the break-up, Shields revealed that the tennis star had told her it was fortunate they did not have children. She said: 'I am divorced. And mine was very quick and relatively easy but it's a very interesting thing because he - quote, unquote - did say to me, 'Be happy that we don't have children or I would not have made this easy for you.'' She added with a laugh, 'And therein lies why I'm not there anymore.' The former 'Suddenly Susan' sitcom star briefly dated John Travolta, Liam Neeson, JFK Jr. and was close friends with Michael Jackson. Shields also wrote about her platonic fling with gay Wham! singer George Michael, saying her mother Teri helped set them up on a date. After a romantic hotel dinner in Chicago she said the star walked her to her room. 'He left without even trying to kiss me. I was so touched by what a real gentleman he was (I wanted to yell, 'Wait, please don't go go!' After going on a couple more dates and shopping trips, Ms Shields wrote that she was 'devastated' when Mr Michael dumped her, saying, 'I think we need to take a break. I need to concentrate on my career.' She added she cried herself to sleep 'for weeks.' Shields, now 49 , remarried in 2001 to TV writer Chris Henchy and they have two daughters, Rowan 10, and Grier, seven. In the memoir, published on November 18, she also discusses her mother's lifelong battle with drinking and the public misconception that she forced her daughter into projects she didn't want to do. The actress was at her mother's side when she died in October 2012 after a decline into dementia.","Andre Agassi smashed Wimbledon and US open trophies in a jealous rage .

"The US is relaxing its rules to allow air passengers to listen to music, play video games and watch films on their phones and tablets during takeoffs and landings. The change allowing the use of electronic devices from gate-to-gate will not, however, extend to making mobile phone calls during flights. Connections to the internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will also still be banned below 10,000 feet and heavier devices like laptops will have to be stowed. In flight: The US is relaxing its rules to allow air passengers to listen to music, play video games and watch films on their phones and tablets during takeoffs and landings . Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode. The US Federal Aviation Authority confirmed the move last night, although it will be up to individual airlines to decide how soon to meet the new criteria. The change will mean that on transatlantic flights British passengers will be able to use their gadgets as they land on American soil. However, when they take off from Britain they will not be able to do so. Under rules drawn up by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority, electronic devices cannot be used during taxi, takeoff and landing on all fights entering or leaving British airspace. Safety: Connections to the internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will also still be banned below 10,000 feet . However the rules could also change in Britain and across the world if the American research is shown to be credible. An American travel industry group welcomed the changes yesterday, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology. ‘We’re pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association. Air safety officials backed the changes after agreeing that the electronic gadgets do not interfere with navigation systems and that data used to draw up the ban - typically imposed in aircraft across the world -  was from back in the 1960s when such devices were very different. Phones are excluded in the rule change because they were not involved in the FAA research, although safety officials are now expected to look at this issue separately. The original rules in the US were written in 1966 when it was thought that electromagnetic interference from computers and other devices could cause problems with navigation systems on board the plane. Nowadays passenger jets are ‘much more tolerant’ to such interference and the gadgets themselves are much safer. The report says that this is because they use less power, transmit weaker signals and ‘stay within a tighter range of frequencies’. One key factor behind the US decision has been the sheer number of air passengers ignoring the rules. One survey found that, by accident or on purpose, one third of passengers had left their gadgets on when they should be turned off. The CAA in the UK is said to be ‘monitoring’ the situation.","Changes will not extend to making mobile phone calls during flights .

"A £25billion rival to the Panama Canal could be built across Nicaragua – funded entirely by the Chinese. The hugely ambitious engineering project would give China control of a vital waterway to challenge the one completed by the US in Panama nearly 100 years ago. Legislation paving the way for a new canal was given the go-ahead by Nicaraguan politicians on Monday night and is expected to be approved by the National Assembly tomorrow. A concession to build a canal across Nicaragua linking the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, likely to go through the waters of Lake Nicaragua, are expected to be awarded to a Chinese company . Five of the six proposed routes for the new canal pass through the giant Lake Nicaragua . The canal would cross the Central . American country – one of the poorest in the region – from the Caribbean . coast in the east to the Pacific coast in the west. It would thus compete directly with . the 48-mile Panama Canal  further south which gives ships a fast route . between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. About 130 miles of waterway would . have to be dug, and 40,000 construction jobs could be created over the . 11 years estimated for completion, according to the project’s . supporters. When finished, they believe it could . capture 4.5 per cent of world maritime freight traffic and double . Nicaragua’s per capita gross domestic product. A China-based consortium would . finance the construction in return for a majority share in earnings from . the potentially lucrative new shipping route. Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua’s socialist president, is backing the waterway enthusiastically. But many outside observers and Ortega . opponents point out that nearly every key detail remains a mystery, . from the exact sources of the funding to Nicaragua’s share of the . profits and the precise route. Critics have also been asking whether . Central America needs two canals, even in an age of growing world . trade. Panama’s is already being expanded to take bigger ships. Feasibility studies have indicated . six potential routes across Nicaragua, many connecting with Lake . Nicaragua in the west, but the legislation does not indicate which one . would be dug. The government plans to grant the . Chinese HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co Ltd a concession . for an initial 50 years, with the possibility of extending it another . 50. Construction of a Nicaraguan canal . would mark the end of a saga dating back to the 19th century when US . shipping and railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt won the right to . build a waterway across the country but gave up amid political turmoil. Rival: A Panamax container ship moves through the Panama Canal on its way to the Atlantic Ocean . Other US interests then studied . building a canal in Nicaragua before settling on Panama where an attempt . by the French to build a canal had ended in failure. The US took over . and completed the job in 1914. The canal was owned by the US until 1999 when it was handed over to the Panamanian government. A second waterway linking the Atlantic with the Pacific has long been in the planning, however. The steady increase in shipping since the opening of the Panama Canal means there is plenty of financial incentive. And with the emergence of China as a . resource-hungry economic superpower, the route is now  more likely than . ever to become  a reality. The construction of canal locks and gates for the Panama Canal. Panama, in 1913 . French workers using a U.S.-made Sleven dredging machine to dig near Empire, Panama, during the early construction of the Panama Canal . Jaime Incer, an environmentalist and . adviser to the presidency on environmental issues, said authorities . should be defining a specific route for the canal before approving a . concession. 'There are at . least six proposed routes and five of them include Lake Nicaragua, but . there is nothing definite, that's all part of the unknown,' he said. Deputy . Foreign Minister Manuel Coronel, who is chairman of the country's Grand . Canal Authority, said Monday that he had no doubt the Chinese company . would carry out the project. When the 48-mile long Panama Canal was finally finished in 1914 it was described as the 'eighth wonder of the world' and observers said it would have an impact akin to 'shifting the nations on a map'. The international waterway allowed ships to pass between the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, . saving about 8,000 miles from a journey around the southern . tip of South America, Cape Horn. The canal makes the trip from the east coast to the west coast of the U.S. much shorter than the route taken around the tip of South America prior to 1914. Though traffic continues to increase through the canal, many oil supertankers and military battleships and aircraft carriers can not fit through the canal. There's even a class of ships known as Panamax, those built to the maximum capacity of the Panama canal and its locks. It takes approximately fifteen hours to traverse the canal through its three sets of locks (about half the time is spent waiting due to traffic). Ships passing through the canal from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean actually move from the northwest to the southeast, due to the east-west orientation of the Isthmus of Panama. 'It's . a very serious company, very responsible and recognized,' Coronel said. 'To doubt (the company) is to oppose the project for political rather . than realistic issues.' The . Hong Kong-registered company has said that it is willing to fully study . the technological, economic, environmental and social impact of the . project. 'This is a great . project that has the potential to transform international trade and . bring significant economic and social benefits to Nicaragua, their . neighbors and Latin America,' company spokesman Ronald Maclean-Abaroa . said Monday on the group's website. Under the deal, the Chinese company would pay Nicaragua $10million annually during the first decade, then pay it a share of canal revenues - an amount that would begin at 1 per cent and rise to an unspecified percentage over the life of the concession. After completing the concession, the Chinese company would have to turn over to Nicaragua all buildings and other canal infrastructure. Jose Aguerri, who heads an association of Nicaraguan chambers of commerce, said the lack of details released about the project would slow investment. 'Until you define the path that the canal will have, it will be difficult to attract investment to the area because there is no legal certainty,' Aguirre said after meeting with committee members. Another Hong Kong-based company has been operating port facilities on both ends of the Panama Canal. The Nicaraguan canal's construction would mark the end of a long push that began at least as far back as the 19th century when U.S. industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt won the right to build a waterway across the country but gave up amid political turmoil. Other U.S. interests then studied building a canal in Nicaragua before settling on Panama as the crossing point. Panama is nearing the end of a seven-year, $5.2billion expansion project to allow bigger ships to use its waterway. That project is scheduled to be finished next year.","Proposal fast-tracked through the ruling party-controlled congress .

"Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask for her name to be removed from stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane if the club offer convicted rapist Ched Evans a contract. Olympic champion Ennis-Hill is the latest in a string of patrons to threaten withdrawing their support of the club after Evans was invited back to train with former team-mates after being released from prison. Mrs Ennis-Hill, who won heptathlon gold at London 2012, said reinstating the footballer would contradict her view that role models ought to set a good example for young fans in a statement this evening. Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask for her name to be removed if Ched Evans is offered a deal at Sheffield United . Ennis-Hill won heptathlon gold at the London Olympics two years ago . Star: Sheffield athlete Ennis-Hill has her name on a stand at Bramall Lane . 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Her comments come after the resignations of patrons Charlie Webster, Lindsay Graham and sixties pop star Dave Berry, amid fears Evans will be resigned by the football club. The League One side confirmed on Tuesday evening that it had agreed to allow Evans to take part in training with their players, but the 25-year-old has failed to appear ever since. Making a stand: TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train . MailOnline understands the convicted rapist was due to start training in Sheffield  but he never arrived and on Thursday was out shopping 50 miles away in Cheshire. The return of Evans to his old team has sparked a massive backlash. Two of Sheffield United’s top sponsors also threatened to tear up their contracts if he was permanently signed to the team. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg - a Sheffield MP - said Evans should consider moving abroad to play football because  United should not take him back. Mr Clegg said footballers were not ‘just any old employee, they’re also role models’. Miss Webster, 32, said she herself had been a victim of sexual abuse, adding: ‘I resign as patron of Sheffield United and Sheffield United Community Foundation, which is all about inspiring the next generation through sport. ‘No convicted rapist, as in Ched Evans, should go back to the club that I am patron of. ‘He’s not just going into a job. . . he’s influencing the next generation of young men who are currently still making their decisions on how to treat women and what sexual mutual consent is.’ Ched Evans and his fiancée, Natasha Massey, were seen emerging in exercise clothes near their Cheshire home on Thursday as it was revealed the convicted rapist did not rejoin former team-mates at United . Evans and Massey became engaged following the footballer's release from prison where he served half of a sentence over the rape of a teenager in Wales. Their outing came as patrons of the club resigned . Evans failed to appear at Sheffield United's training grounds despite being told he could return to train with former team-mates, instead emerging in exercise clothing in Cheshire with his partner Natasha Massey . Out and about: Evans was out in Cheshire close to the family home of partner Natasha, right yesterday, who was wearing her engagement ring . On Wednesday morning she posted on Twitter: ‘Overwhelmed by the level of your support. I am so heartened to see that the vast majority are standing with me & saying that this isn’t okay.’ It is unclear whether Evans, 25, will play for the club again, but he will train at its grounds. He was released last month, still protesting his innocence, after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in Rhyl, North Wales. Last night campaign group the End Violence Against Women Coalition said it was ‘appalled’. Nick Clegg told LBC: 'If it was me, I wouldn't take him on. This is an incredibly serious offence, a very serious offence for which he has been convicted and that's what sets this apart. 'He maybe could play for a club abroad for a while before coming back.' Some 155,000 people have added their names to a petition demanding United, nicknamed the Blades, refuse to sign him. The team’s shirt sponsor, John Holland car sales, warned it would consider tearing up its contract if the Blades re-sign Evans as it ‘condemns rape and violence of any kind against women’. DBL Logistics, whose name is on the back of the club’s shirts, also threatened to withdraw its support. Couple: Evans, with his fiancee Natasha Massey, who he proposed to after he was released from prison last month, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl . Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, wrote in an open letter to club chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps: ‘It’s because I care so much about our club that I am writing to urge you to reconsider your decision... The way this issue has been handled by the club is dragging our name through the mud and dividing fans.’ The footballer raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted him saying: ‘I’ve got a bird.’ Evans, who has played 13 times for Wales, admitted having sex but denied rape. The woman said she had no memory of the incident and prosecutors said she was too drunk to consent. The family of Evans’s fiancee, Natasha Massey, 25, have helped to fund a highly controversial website claiming he is innocent. Evans, a former Manchester City player, moved to third-tier Sheffield in 2009 before being convicted in April 2012. On Tuesday, Sheffield United issued a statement saying there was ‘no place for mob justice’ in the situation. It read: ‘The board has decided to respond favourably to the PFA’s request and to allow Mr Evans to train at the club’s facilities. ‘While some have speculated about whether the club will or should invite Mr Evans to return to SUFC as a registered footballer, the club is not prepared at this time to decide that issue.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jessica-Ennis Hill said re-signing Evans would 'contradict' her beliefs .

"This is the moment a jaguar was captured diving from the top of a river bank in an attempt to catch a giant river otter. After spotting a family of otters travelling noisily downstream, the sharp-eyed predator is seen stealthily making its way across the top of an 26ft river bank. Noticing the youngest and smallest of the group trailing behind, the fearless feline decided to make the most of its vantage point by launching into the water head first. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a jaguar was captured diving from the top of a river bank in an attempt to catch a river otter . But it seems that this is one big cat that might still needs a few diving lessons as the lucky otter managed to slip beneath the brown mirky water of the Cuiaba River in Brazil. Captured by Irish photographer, David Jenkins, 41, the mammals can be heard calling loudly to their youngest member of the family. Mr Jenkins said: 'The jaguar was resting when it heard the noisy otters making their way down river, it watched them pass by below until he selected his target which was one of the younger otters at the back. 'They were moving close to the river bank as they travelled and the big cat obviously saw a good opportunity and went for it.

The images were taken David Jenkins who spotted the jaguar on the bank of the Cuiaba River in Brazil . The jaguar takes a leap of faith into the water to ambush the youngest otter managed to make a quick escape . 'It really was an incredible leap, I'd say the riverbank was around 8 metres high and it just launched at the otter head first. 'The jaguars are very confident in the water and often ambush prey jumping from the riverbanks. 'All the otter family survived this time, once they saw the predator they didn't hang around, the current in the water was very strong so they were able to make a very quick escape downriver. The jaguar hits the water but the otter manages to slip beneath the water just in time . 'In the video you can hear them making loud noises, they came back to make sure none of their group was taken and to give an alarm that they have seen the predator, the otters are tough animals and can measure almost two metres long. 'I think maybe the jaguar was frustrated but only briefly, I guess he knew he had just missed a good opportunity to make a kill. 'You need to be extremely lucky to be in the right place at the right time to see it, but a large part of being able to photograph incredible action such as this one is due to great safari guides as well as a lot of patience.

"An 18-year-old mentally ill boy who was killed by police was 'shot to death like dog', a close family friend said today. Keith Vidal was already restrained by two police officers when a third officer shot him in the chest on Sunday after allegedly saying 'I don't have time for this'. The officer was preparing to fire a second shot when he was grabbed by the victim's step father. Vidal, who was having a schizophrenic episode, did not pose a threat to any of the officers - who had been called to help by his family, friends said. Justice: Keith Vidal (pictured with his mother, Mary) was already restrained by two police officers when a third officer shot him in the chest on Sunday after allegedly saying 'I don't have time for this' Anthony Owens, a close family friend, insisted the teenager posed no threat to the officers and has demanded an investigation uncover the truth. 'Do not let this be swept under the good ole boy run,' Owens wrote on a blog post for CNN. 'Do not let this man get away with murder. Next time it could be closer to home. Keith was shot like a dog on the floor of his home.' North Carolina authorities have vowed to carry out a full investigation into the shooting that has left the family of the teen grief stricken and desperately searching for answers. District Attorney Jon David has called for an independent investigation into the fatal shooting of Vidal at his home in Boiling Springs Lake on Sunday. 'The public deserves to have a process put in place that will lead to the most just resolution,' said David. David said he will not show any deference to law enforcement officials, promising to 'go wherever the truth leads in this case'. Police had been called to the North Carolina home by the teen's parents after he apparently became agitated and grabbed a screwdriver. Mentally ill: Keith Vidal suffered from schizophrenia and was having an episode when his family called 911 . Gunned down: Family friend Anthony Owens claimed the officer said ""concern for officers' safety"" was the reason he shot Keith. Yet the family claim two other officers had already successfully subdued the 90lb boy . Mary Vidal and her husband Mark Wilsey made the 911 call so they could get help in getting Vidal to an emergency room for treatment. Two police officers from Boiling Springs Police Department responded to the call and were talking with the teen, apparently defusing the situation. Vidal, who was 5ft 3in and weighed 90lbs, was seemingly listening when a third officer from Southport Police Department entered the home. According to accounts from family members, the officer who had been on the scene for just over a minute, ordered the other two deputies to use their Taser guns to subdue the teen. Owens said Vidal collapsed to the floor after being hit by the 50,000 volt stun gun prongs and was being restrained while with his step-father making a grab for the screwdriver. He said the officer fired into the melee of bodies, hitting Vidal in the chest. Owens said: 'Keith was murdered in the hallway of his home by a Southport Police Officer in Boiling Springs Lakes. 'The officer said ""concern for officers' safety"" was the reason he shot Keith. Yet his concern for officer safety was null and void when he fired his weapon into a mass of bodies on the floor at close range.. 'He could have just as easily killed one of his own. 'If it weren't for Keith's father grabbing the officer, he would have shot him again.. Keith was a big person in a small body. About 5'3 to 5'5 and 90 to 100lbs Keith was small for his age. Trained officers should know the difference between a 6'5 335 lbs monster and a 5'3 100lb kid.' Devastated: Keith Vidal's grieving family gathered Monday for a press conference outside the office of the District Attorney . Police have not named the officer responsible for shooting citing an ongoing investigation but said Detective Byron Vassey, 44, has been placed on administrative leave. Vassey, who is married and lives in Southport, has been with the force since 2004 and according to a police spokesman it is the first time he has been taken off duty. Owens said in his blog post that Vidal used medication to control his schizophrenia and had never harmed anyone before. He said Vidal was a talented drummer and had posted numerous videos to YouTube. He also loved to play on his X-Box. 'There aren't any words that can express how deeply hurt I am that this happened,' he wrote. 'Today the world lost an awesome person. Keith was like a little brother to me. I sat many times with him and listened to him play drums, or sat in a hot condo stand with him waiting for a pig to mosey out to eat some corn... or just watching his drumming videos saying ""man this kids talented"". 'Keith was a very passionate kid and loved music and basketball more than anything on this earth...he had many friends and will be dearly missed. He loved his family and they in return loved him.' Describing the horror that unfolded in the Vidal home, Owens said he had spoken at length to the teen's parents. Greatly missed: Many friends and family took to .

Vidal's father contacted the Boiling Springs Lakes Police Department around 1 pm Sunday to try to get help putting Vidal in the car, so he could be taken to a mental evaluation. 'Vidal was abrasive and did not want to go and picked up a small electronics screwdriver. Two officers responded to the scene and started negotiating with Vidal.

'At that very moment an officer from another town entered the residence and instructed the officers to stop talking and Tase Vidal.

"Steve Jobs’s stunning resignation as Apple CEO has prompted a huge outpouring of support and sympathy for the man who ended a 14-year reign at the technology giant he co-founded in a garage. Mr Jobs had overseen a 9,000-percent share gain since 1997. The price dropped seven per cent in overnight trading before recovering slightly this morning, although it was still down. The 56-year-old was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and has been on medical leave from the firm based in California since January, with health being the main reason for his resignation. Innovator: Jobs holds the iPad during the launch of Apple's new tablet computing device in San Francisco in January 2010. It instantly became the latest must-have gadget . Industry analysts have today been lining up to pay tribute to the iconic face of Apple, who has turned the technology start-up into one of the world's most powerful and recognised brands. Health problems: Steve Jobs, pictured in February 2011, has been battling pancreatic cancer . ‘I think his brilliance has been . well-documented, but what gets forgotten is the bravery with which he's . confronted his illness,’ Sony CEO Howard Stringer said of the man worth . $8.3billion. ‘For him to achieve this much success under these circumstances doubles his legacy.' Google’s Eric Schmidt described his . friend and rival as ‘one of the greatest American leaders in history' and someone who ‘uniquely combined an artist's touch and an engineer's . vision’. Fellow technology CEO Jeff Weiner, of LinkedIn, labelled him ‘the Michelangelo of the digital age’. ‘He is also the most insightful . business speaker I've ever heard,’ Mr Weiner added. ‘He speaks the way . he designs products - not a single wasted word.' Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said Mr Jobs needs some 'Steve time' because of the high pressure and demands of his job. 'He really has had to sacrifice a lot to run Apple,' Mr Wozniak told BYTE. 'I mean, just your time, everybody wants you day and night - that's what I mean by sacrifices.' The general feeling across the industry is that Apple’s share price may dip short-term but the company will come back even stronger because of its unique and successful product base. Mr Jobs has spent much time putting together a long-term strategy and looking at handing over the reins to COO Tim Cook because he has been suffering from a serious illness for some time now. He was declared a ‘perfectionist who obsesses over every detail’ by the BBC’s Rory Cellan-Jones and the Wall Street Journal’s Jennifer Valentino-DeVries said his company presents ‘an air of magic’. 'He led a company that transformed a vast array of businesses - personal computing, portable and online music, smarter mobile telephony and post-PC computing,’ said Kristie Lu Stout of CNN. Mr Jobs said in his resignation letter: 'I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know.' Guest list: Mr Jobs takes his place as guest of honour beside President . Obama in February 2011. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is on the President's right. Other . guests included Google and Twitter CEOs Eric Schmidt . He named Mr Cook as his successor and said he looks forward to watching the company which he nourished and made into one of the world's most powerful and recognised brands. Mr Jobs will remain in position as board chairman and is simply relinquishing his seat as CEO. Apple board member Art Levinson said: 'Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and valuable technology company. 'Steve has made countless contributions to Apple's success, and he has attracted and inspired Apple's immensely creative employees and world class executive team. 'In his new role as Chairman of the Board, Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration.' The icon, who has been on medical leave since January, only briefly emerged in March to unveil the iPad 2 and later attended a dinner hosted by President Barack Obama for technology leaders. Mr Jobs, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and underwent surgery, began to grow noticeably gaunt in 2009 and pulled out of appearances, prompting fears that he was seriously ill. But he denied these rumours, saying it was simply a 'hormone imbalance that was robbing his body of the proteins it needs'. Then in January 2009 he promised: 'I will be the first one to step up and tell our Board of Directors if I can no longer continue to fulfil my duties as Apple's CEO.' He received a liver transplant that same year. Mr Jobs is soon expected to reveal more details about the transplant and his battle with cancer. Though his resignation letter was short and to the point, it was obviously full of emotion as he thanked 'the best friends he made for life' at the billion dollar company. He is seen as the heart and soul of Apple, with analysts and investors repeatedly expressing concern over how the company, based in Cupertino, California, would handle his departure. BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis said: 'I will say to investors - don't panic and remain calm, it's the right thing to do. Steve will be chairman and Cook is CEO. 'But Tim has been de facto chief executive for some time and the company has been hugely successful. The vision and the roadmap is intact.' Mr Cook ran Apple when Mr Jobs went on medical leave and has essentially been running day-to-day operations since early this year, with the company racking up record revenue and profit. TIM COOK IN PROFILE . Tim Cook already has extensive experience running the company having all but taken over from Mr Jobs while he was on medical leave. He has served as Apple's chief operating officer for seven years. Long . considered a front-runner to replace Mr Jobs, Mr Cook joined Apple in 1998 as . a senior vice president of worldwide operations and was promoted to . chief operating officer in 2004. Before . joining Apple, Mr Cook briefly served as an executive at Compaq and spent . 12 years at IBM, where he ran manufacturing and operations for the . company's PC business. He . is credited with completely restructuring Apple's manufacturing . operations, insisting that Apple shut down its overseas factories and . farm out the work to third-party manufacturers. As a result, the company . reduced inventory and improved margins on its entire product lineup. He . has served as Mr Jobs's right-hand man at shareholder events and has . completely handled earnings calls with analysts for last few years. While . Mr Jobs was on medical leave from January to June 2009, Apple delivered . two back-to-back blow-out quarters, as well as an updated iPhone OS, and . new iPhone 3GS hardware. For . his performance, Apple's board rewarded Mr Cook with a $5million bonus as . well as 75,000 restricted stock units as a thank-you for 'his . outstanding performance'. He was previously responsible for . Apple's worldwide sales and operations, including management of the . supply chain, sales activities and service and support in all markets . and countries, reported ABC. He has been at the company since 1998 . and was recently given a $5million bonus as well as 75,000 restricted . stock units as a thank you for his 'outstanding performance'. To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community: . I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer . meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to . let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come. I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board . sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee. As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple. I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of . it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a . new role. I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I . thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you. Steve . Apple became the most valuable company in the U.S. this month and is now worth $338billion. It was confirmed in February that Jobs . was receiving treatment for cancer after the 56-year-old's gaunt . appearance fuelled rumours that he might resign any day. Pancreatic cancers are generally some of the most lethal of all tumours, and the most common type often kills within six months. Mr Jobs has battled a less common . variety that grows far more slowly and develops in the hormone-secreting . section of the pancreas, reported USA Today. Although diagnosed in 2003, his illness was not disclosed until the following year, after he had undergone surgery. The fiercely private CEO has said . relatively little about his health problems, although he did acknowledge . his bout with cancer during a commencement speech at Stanford . University. 'No one wants to die,’ he said. ‘And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.' In June, Jobs got a standing ovation . at a software developers' conference in San Francisco to introduce an . operating system called Lion and a wireless service called iCloud. Old and new: A young Steve Jobs holds the Apple II computer in 1977, left, and in 1998 he unveils the Apple Mac . Tim Cook, the new CEO of Apple, has been standing in for Steve Jobs since he went on sick leave . From the conference people tweeted that he looked 'gaunt', 'exasperated' and 'very ill'. He stayed on stage for only three . minutes before handing it over to Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice . president for worldwide marketing. He demonstrated how photos taken with an iPhone were visible on a user's iPad moments later. The iPhone 5 is due to hit the shops . in September with almost 40 per cent of Apple customers saying they . would buy it even before they had set eyes on it.","Business leaders and technology fans react to Steve Jobs stepping down .

"Reports of genital theft are a relatively common occurrence across West and Central Africa, scholars say. Academics observing reports of penis snatching on the continent have previously deemed it an urban phenomenon - a manifestation of the anxieties that arise when a village becomes a city and rural people find themselves living among crowds of unfamiliar people. So a U.S. anthropologist was 'intrigued' when she arrived in the tiny hamlet of Tiringoulou in the Central African Republic, to find two villagers claiming to have been the victims of genital theft. Remote: The U.S. academic found two men who claimed to have been victims of genital theft in Tiringoulou, in the Central African Republic . Previous instances have been reported in crowded centres like Lagos, Nigeria, or Douala, in Cameroon. Louisa . Lombard, a postdoctoral fellow in geography at the University of . California, Berkeley, said villagers in Tiringoulou told her of a . traveller, upon arriving on a Sudanese merchant truck, removed two men's . penises with a handshake. The academic was told the stranger had targeted a tea seller in the market and a second man, she wrote in a report on alternet.org. 'After handing over his money, he [the stranger] . clasped the vendor’s hand. The tea seller felt an electric tingling . course through his body and immediately sensed that his penis had shrunk . to a size smaller than that of a baby’s. His yells quickly drew a . crowd. 'Somehow in the fray a second man fell victim as well,' she wrote. Several eyewitnesses assured her the 'appendages did indeed shrink dramatically'. Urban phenomenon: Previous reports of penis-snatching have occurred in heavily populated parts of Africa like Lagos, Nigeria (pictured) Ms Lombard described victims 'on both sides' of the phenomenon, which she wrote was linked to a 'general resurgence of witchcraft' in Africa. Having visited one of the so-called 'victims' and finding that he 'clearly seemed to be suffering' as he lay listless in the shade at his home, the academic was later told that the alleged penis-snatcher had been executed by gunshot by members of the armed rebel group that governs Tiringoulou. The rebels' version of events was that the thief had 'mysteriously vanished from his holding cell', she wrote. Ms Lombard said she was told the stolen organs were sold to occult healers. Having asked the town doctor what could be done to help the victims, she was told: 'Western medicine is no match for this magic. It is a mysterious thing.'","Reports of genital theft are common across West and Central Africa .

"Spanish naval officers are facing jail for allegedly shipping more than 127kg cocaine from Colombia to New York on a training ship. Three sailors were arrested in July following a US operation but the stash - hidden among candles in a storeroom - was not uncovered until today. Investigations started in May this year after New York police seized 20kg of cocaine from two Colombians in the city. Under interrogation, they revealed it had been shipped by the Juan Sebastian Elcano, which serves as a floating embassy for Spain. Scroll down for video . Drug stash: Officials in Cadiz, Spain, have uncovered 127kg of cocaine aboard the Juan Sebastian Elcano, a Spanish Armada training ship, after dealers in New York admitted their drugs were transported by the ship . The crew was paid to transport the drug after being ambushed by the a gang of drug traffickers when they docked in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, during a six-month tour, reports claim. Each sailor was allegedly issued with a portion of the drug to hide before setting off for the United States. A major international operation was launched between the Spanish Civil Guard and US Homeland Security Investigations when 20kg of the stash was seized in New York in mid-May. When it docked in Bueu, Pontevedra, north west Spain, on July 12, militia stormed the ship, arresting three sailors - one Ecuadorian and two Spaniards. Operation: The Civil Guard found the stash among candles in a store room three weeks after the ship docked .

"Fossils of three squirrel-like species from the time of the dinosaurs suggest mammals have been around on Earth for more than 200 million years. The discovery in Liaoning Province, China, pushes back the date that mammals roamed the planet by around 40 million years, researchers claim. The creatures, which are around the size of a mouse, also provide more clues about how the first mammals began diversifying. The discovery of three new squirrel-like rodents from the time of the dinosaurs suggests that mammals have been around on Earth for more than 200 million years. Pictured is a reconstruction of the new mammal species, Xianshou songae. This mouse-sized animal was a tree dweller in the Jurassic forests . Scientists believe they later evolved into egg-laying monotremes such as the platypus, marsupials like the opossum, and placentals which include humans and whales. The six well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called Haramiyida which until recently were only known from teeth. 'For decades scientists have been debating whether the extinct group, called Haramiyida, belongs within or outside of Mammalia,' said Dr Jin Meng, at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. 'Previously everything we knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth. But the new specimens we discovered are extremely well preserved. The well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called Haramiyida which until recently were only known from teeth. Pictured is the fossil of Senshou lui, which represents a new species of euharamiyidan mammal. It is a nearly complete skeleton that indicates a slender body with a tail . 'And based on these fossils we now have a good idea of what these animals really looked like which confirms they are indeed mammals.' The six well-preserved fossil skulls and skeletons belong to an extinct group called Haramiyida. Haramiyidans represent one of the earliest known mammals and range from the Late Triassic to the Mid Jurassic. Previously everything scientists knew about these animals was based on fragmented jaws and isolated teeth. But the new specimens discovered are extremely well preserved. From their structure scientists have learned Euharamiyida, which were part of the Haramiyda were good climbers and probably spent more time in trees than squirrels. The members of Euharamiyida likely ate insects, nuts, and fruit with their 'strange' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns. Despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian. The animals have been named Shenshou lui, Xianshou linglong, and Xianshou songae and lived about 160 million years ago during the Jurassic period. The study, published in the journal Nature, suggests they evolved from a common ancestor during the Late Triassic around 208 million years ago. They have placed in a new group - or clade - called Euharamiyida and probably looked similar to small squirrels. They weighed between 1 and 10oz (28g and 280g) and had tails and feet suggesting they were tree dwellers. 'They were good climbers and probably spent more time than squirrels in trees,' said Dr Meng. 'Their hands and feet were adapted for holding branches - but not good for running on the ground.' The members of Euharamiyida likely ate insects, nuts, and fruit with their 'strange' teeth which have many cusps - or raised points - on the crowns. Mammals are believed to evolve from a common ancestor that had three cusps - human molars can have up to five. But the newly discovered species had two parallel rows of cusps on each molar with up to seven cusps on each side. How this complex tooth pattern evolved in relation to those of other mammals has puzzled scientists for decades. But despite the unusual teeth the overall physical characteristics seen in the new haramiyidan fossils is mammalian. This reconstruction shows arboreal mammals in a Jurassic forest. The three animals on the left side represent the three new species of euharamiyidan mammals . For example the specimens show evidence of a typical mammalian middle ear - the area just inside the eardrum that turns vibrations in the air into ripples in the ear's fluids. The middle ears of mammals are unique in that they have three bones - as evidenced in the new fossils. Based on the age of the Euharamiyida, species the divergence of mammals from reptiles had to have happened much earlier than some research has estimated. Instead of originating in the middle Jurassic between 176 and 161 million years ago mammals likely first appeared in the late Triassic between 235 and 201 million years ago - a finding corresponding with some studies using DNA data. Dr Ming said: 'What we're showing here is very convincing that these animals are mammals and we need to turn back the clock for mammal divergence. 'But even more importantly these new fossils present a new suite of characters that might help us tell many more stories about ancient mammals.' The fossils were found in the Tiaojishan Formation, Daxishan site of Linglongta in Liaoning Province, China .","Fossils of 3 species were uncovered in Liaoning Province, China .

"The housewife and whistle blower at the center of the David Petraeus sex scandal and another involving General John Allen may have been hoping for some financial gain by lifting the lid on the affair, after it emerged today she and her husband are broke. Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, 37, and her cancer surgeon husband Scott owe millions to banks after the collapse of their real estate holdings in 2010. The Kelleys are currently the targets of . at least four indebtedness lawsuits and two foreclosures in . Hillsborough County, according to court records. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Jill Kelley, the Florida housewife at the centre of the David Petraeus sex scandal has spoken for the first time and said she is an 'innocent victim' Luxurious: Residents walk past the house belonging to Jill Kelley on Bayshore Boulevard in Tampa which is believed to be in foreclosure . Gossip Extra reported today that the Kelleys are fighting to keep their properties. Jill has been called the 'other woman' in the Petraeus sex scandal, which was exposed after she took . threatening emails to the FBI sent from biographer and . alleged mistress Paula Broadwell warning her to stay away from the CIA chief. Now that the state of their finances . has been exposed, speculation is rife Jill broke the scandal so she . could make money from it. Jill Kelley with her husband Dr Scott Kelley, who are said to be in financial trouble . She has now also been dragged into a second scandal after General John R. Allen, commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, has been accused of sending thousands of 'inappropriate' emails to her. Allen is under investigation by the FBI after the agency discovered between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communication between him and the 37-year-old housewife. If he is found to have engaged in an extramarital affair - a crime in the military - he faces being court martialed, bringing a spectacular fall from grace and the end to a glittering army career that has spanned nearly 40 years. Central Bank . have a suit against the Kelleys and Kelly Land Holdings, centered on a three-story . office building downtown Tampa. Court records . show they owed the bank nearly $2.2 million, including attorney fees. In 2011, a judge ordered the property to be put up for sale. Regions Bank, meanwhile, is trying to . foreclose on the couple's historic $1.3million waterfront house, . claiming they defaulted on a $271,000-credit line with their five . bedroom house as collateral, according to Gossip Extra. It is currently worth $840,000 and though it is one of the most spectacular on Bayshore Boulevard from the outside, the 1923 built home is in need of repair. Paintwork on the home is peeling and behind the home the driveway leading to a triple garage is cracked and covered with weeds. The front lawn, where Kelley would host . catered parties attended by the military, remains immaculate but out of . sight in an alleyway running at the rear of the property rubbish is . piled high against a wall. Lawyers hired by the socialite couple would not comment on the state of their finances. Jealous: Broadwell sent Jill Kelley, far right, threatening emails warning her to stay away from Petraeus. Pictured with Kelley is her husband, Scott, and Holly Petraeus . Details: The FBI will not elaborate on the . nature of the relationship between Allen, the senior allied commander in . Afghanistan, and Florida housewife Jill Kelley, except to say that it . is 'potentially inappropriate' Jill Kelley insisted yesterday she has never been romantically involved with Petraeus but is the 'innocent victim' in the scandal. The socialite is better known in Tampa for throwing charity . parties on the front lawn of her house. In fact, Petraeus and his wife Holly marked his first celebration of the Gasparilla pirate parade on . the Kelleys' lawn. The two couples became friends after . Petraeus took over the military’s Central Command at Tampa’s McDill Air . Force Base in 2008 where Jill  was a volunteer social liaison. Jill Kelley spoke with her lawyer brother as her name first became linked to the resignation of Petraeus. David . Khawam told the Washington Post his sister telephoned him on Sunday and . told him to switch on the TV because her name was all over news . broadcasts. Khawam said his sister told him she was totally innocent and was not the 'other woman' in Petraeus' life. He is quoted as saying his sister said: 'I've done nothing wrong. I am the victim here. But it still feels awful.' Friends . of Kelley, a vivacious Lebanese-born mother-of-three, known for her . love of expensive designer dresses, have told MailOnline that she is . devoted to her family and scoffed at suggestions she was romantically . involved with Petraeus. Affair: David Petraeus is pictured with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and alleged mistress . 'This other woman obviously read all the signs wrong,' said a friend who knows Kelley from their children’s private school. 'Jill is very attractive and can be touchy-feely. That’s just the way she is and there is nothing else.' Kelley, . a well-known figure on the social scene in her hometown of Tampa, . Florida, has hired the same crisis management firm Monica Lewinsky did . after the Clinton scandal and a top lawyer used by John Edwards since . being linked to the scandal. This has led to speculation that further damaging details could be revealed in the fall out from Petraeus’ resignation. Sources have revealed the emails she received from Broadwell were 'kind of cat-fight stuff'. Kelley . went to the FBI with the emails - and triggered the investigation that . led to the downfall of Petraeus and his shock resignation as CIA chief. The . source told The Daily Beast the emails were: 'More like, ""Who do you . think you are? … You parade around the base … You need to take it down a . notch"".' The Wall Street Journal reported that in one of the emails, Broadwell asked Kelley if her husband was aware of her actions. Another accused Kelley of touching Petraeus provocatively under a table. The source also said Kelley would often accompany Petraeus' wife Holly on shopping trips to the International Mall in Tampa. Kelley, whose husband is a top cancer surgeon, has dodged questions from the media. Before leaving her home she called police to the $1.3 million mansion to ask media to respect her privacy. She left the home in a silver Mercedes with the registration plate 'Honorary Consul' - a nod to her work as an unpaid liaison officer for the military headquarters at MacDill Airforce Base. It was during Petraeus' two years in Tampa at the CENTCOM headquarters that he became friends with Kelley and her husband Scott. The friendship continued after the general left Tampa with the Kelley’s visiting the Petaeus’s home in Washington DC.","Tampa socialite Jill Kelley and her husband are the target of at least four indebtedness lawsuits and two foreclosures .

"Philadelphia police have launched an internal investigation after a teenager allegedly suffered a ruptured testicle during a pat-down. Darrin Manning, 16, was with a group of teammates on their way to an after-school basketball game at 15th and Girard Streets when he was stopped by police officers. Manning says he was handcuffed and patted down by a female police officer, who grabbed and pulled his genitals. He underwent emergency surgery the following day. Injured: The day after his arrest, Darrin Manning had emergency surgery on his genitals stemming from what he says was an assault by a female officer . Manning, a straight-A student at . Mathematics, Civics & Sciences Charter School, says that he was . stopped for no reason. 'I didn't deserve to be wrongly stopped. They didn't - they didn't tell me what I did,' Manning told Fox 29. While he was handcuffed, Manning says, one of the officers assaulted him. 'She patted me down again, and then I felt her reach, and she grabbed my butt. And then she grabbed and squeezed again and pulled down. And that's when I heard something pop, like I felt it pop,' Manning said. He spent eight hours in jail after the alleged attack, but police say he never reported any injuries. The next night, Manning spent the night at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where he underwent emergency surgery on his genitals, hospital records show. Doctors say he may never be able to father children. Serious injury: A week after his operated Manning was still in pain and unable to walk . School sports: Manning was in his uniform on his way to play a basketball game with fellow students from Mathematics, Civics and Charter School when the alleged assault happened at 15th and Girard Streets . According to Philly.com, the police report states that Manning and his friends began running away from an approaching cop. But then Manning stopped: 'I didn't do anything wrong,' he said. Officer Thomas Purcell accosted the teen. The report says Manning struck the officer three times and ripped off his radio. Purcell called for assistance. Manning says he was handcuffed, roughed up and then patted down by a female officer who he says caused his injury. 'I blame myself,' Coney told Philly.com, crying. 'I taught my son to respect cops, not to fear them. Maybe if he was afraid, he would have run like the other boys and he would have been OK.' A witness told Philly.com that she watched the confrontation, intrigued because of the excessive force. 'There were all these cops and cops cars, and one kid,' she said. Horrified: Ikea Coney, Manning's mother, says doctors told her to press charges against whoever had injured her son . Manning is facing charges of aggravated assault and resisting arrest. He and his mother, Ikea Coney, have retained the services of an attorney. 'He's in shock,' attorney Lewis Small said. 'It's such a tragedy to happen to, you know, a young man like this who's going to be scarred, whether it's physically scarred, which is a possibility, but certainly mentally scarred his entire life.' Coney says doctors told her that her son may never be able to have a family of his own. 'The doctor told me, ""You need to press charges,"" and that just alarmed me,' Coney told Fox 29. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said yesterday that Manning and his mother haven't filed a complaint nor spoken with the Internal Affairs division about the incident. Exemplary student: Manning is a straight-A student who has never been in trouble at school, says the Mathematics, Civics and Charter School school founder Veronica Joyner . 'We want to know what happened,' Ramsey said today.  'This is a young man with no history in terms of negative contact with the law.  My understanding is he is a good student.  I don’t know what took place, and I’m not in a position to say at this point in time because I don’t have all the facts.' According to CBS Philadelphia, Ramsey showed reporters video of the incident, but the coverage was unclear because the camera was set to pan across the intersection every 10 seconds. Ramsey has pulled one female officer from the street until Internal Affairs completes its investigation.  According to CBS, it doesn't look like she was even involved in the struggle with they boy from footage the camera caught, but was keeping passersby from getting too close to the tussle. Police can't comment on the case because it's now an internal investigation. Supporters of Darrin Manning are planning a rally on January 23 to protest against excessive use of force and to demand the female officer who allegedly assaulted the teen be fired.","Darrin Manning, 16, says he was stopped by police for no reason then subjected to a violent pat-down .

"Dale Cregan, pictured, is wanted in relation to the murder of Mark Short - police are urging him to hand himself in after a man was killed at a house in Clayton, Manchester . A one-eyed man is at the centre of a manhunt after a grieving father was brutally executed just weeks after his son was shot dead. Last night police issued a photograph of Dale Cregan, 29, who is wanted for questioning in connection with both murders. David Short, 47, was gunned down at his terraced home in Clayton, Manchester, after branding as 'cowards' the killers of his 23-year-old son Mark. There was an explosion at the house caused by a grenade and within minutes there was another grenade attack and shots reportedly fired at a property in Droylsden, east of the city. Today a 31-year-old man was in custody after being arrested on suspicion of Mark's murder and three counts of attempt murder. He was held at Wythenshawe Hospital on Wednesday. The shooting and grenade attacks happened as two men appeared in court charged with Mark's murder. He was blasted to death 10 weeks ago while playing pool with his friends in a crowded pub. Yesterday his father was shot dead by two masked men just yards from where children were playing in a park. The gunmen were seen running from the house after neighbours heard shots. One said: ‘There were between five and eight shots fired – the last couple were really loud. I looked out of my window and saw two men running off  - all masked up.' Extra police, including armed response officers, were sent to both areas. Emergency services, including an Army bomb disposal unit were deployed to two addresses near Manchester after shootings were reported this morning . A white transit van, which is believed to have been involved in both attacks was seized at the scene of the second blast in Luke Road. A silver Ford Fiesta was later seized on Lord Lane in Failsworth. Both vehicles were checked by Army bomb disposal experts to ensure they were safe for police to recover them. Yesterday's killing came as Luke . Livesey, 27, and Damien Gorman, 38, appeared via video link at . Manchester Crown Court charged with the murder of Mark, an amateur boxer. The . father of one, was blasted in the neck and died almost instantly after a . gunman burst into the busy Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden. David - known as 'Pops' - and Mark's mother Michelle had publicly condemned their son’s killers as 'cowards' and and told how memories of him 'would live in their hearts forever'. Dave Short, 47, was gunned down at his home in Clayton, Manchester this morning. Minutes later a second shooting took place at an address in Droylsden, pictured, involving a grenade . Mark Short, pictured, was shot dead in the Cotton Tree Inn pub in Droylsden, Manchester, in May. His father, Dave, was killed today as two men faced a judge for Mark's killing . Their neighbours said a large silver car . had been spotted parked near the family house on Thursday morning . with four men inside amid fears they were 'scouting' out the property. One neighbour said: 'I was in bed and . woke up to the sound of gun shots. I could just tell from the sound of . them that they were gun shots. 'It’s . normally okay round here so it a real shock. We’re . being told that there’s now a gas leak and everyone has been evacuated . from their homes. I think when they opened fire they must had hit a gas . pipe or something.' Another neighbour added: 'I was going for a paper when I heard five or six loud bangs. Someone said to me, ""They’re not fireworks""'. Assistant Chief Constable Garry . Shewan, said: 'Tragically, a man has lost his life and our thoughts are . with his family and friends at this time. 'These . incidents will understandably cause a lot of anxiety and upset and our . primary focus is to ensure the safety of those in the local communities . and the wider public. 'I . want to reassure everyone that extra officers are being deployed in the . area, including specialist firearms officers and at this time we do not . believe there to be a threat to the wider public. 'We . will have a notable presence in the coming hours and days should anyone . wish to come and talk to us, either to share any concerns or provide . any information about what has happened. 'As this has only just happened it would not be right to go into any further detail about what occurred as we simply don’t know. Dave Short's son, Mark, was shot dead by a hitman in May this year. Forensic officers were at the scene of the killing today, in Clayton, pictured . 'What . we do know is that we have a wealth of experience across the board, . from local neighbourhood officers to those in specialist roles such as . firearms and investigations, and we will be doing everything we can to . get to the bottom of what happened and why.' It . is believed Mark Short's hitman had intended to 'kneecap' him in a . 'punishment attack' but allegedly accidentally killed him instead . because as he fired Mark crouched down at the table and was hit in the . neck. Two other pub customers, aged 25 and . 26, suffered gunshot wounds to their leg and a 29-year-old man suffered a . gunshot wound to his lower back following the attack at 11.50pm on May . 23. Nearby houses have also been evacuated due to a gas leak apparently caused by the shots . Extras police, including armed officers, have been deployed to both addresses following the double attacks this morning . CCTV footage showed the . suspects pulling up outside the Cotton Tree, one man getting out of a . blue Ford Focus car and going inside. It showed the same man walking out about 15 seconds later getting into the car and speeding off . down Market Street, towards Audenshaw. The gun involved was thought to be a semi-automatic 9mm pistol and there were 20 people at the bar. Livesey, . from Hattersley, and Gorman, from Glossop, were also charged with . three attempted murders as well as Mark’s murder. In a statement at the time of his death Mark’s grieving family said: 'Mark was taken away from us by cowards. 'People . who knew Mark, knew him as a young man with a big heart. He would not . think twice about helping his family and friends when they were in need. Police have cordoned off houses at the scenes of both shootings, and some homes have been evacuated due to a gas leak . 'He was no angel and it is not a secret he had been in trouble with the police, but that was all in the past. He was a loving son, brother, father and boyfriend to Naomi. 'Mark was only 23-years-old and looking forward to a future with his son, Mark Junior. This has now all been taken away from him. He will be deeply missed by all of his family and friends the only ones that knew him the most. 'His memory will be love in our hearts forever.' Mark was reported to a be friend of another amateur boxer Johnny Joyce, 21, who bit off the ear of Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty during a family feud. In February 2009, Mark was jailed after he broke a shopkeeper’s jaw while on bail for stealing a car from a 60-year-old man. He got a minimum of two years after admitting robbery and assault causing grievous bodily harm. But in June last year Appeal Court judges replaced the indefinite sentence with an extended jail term of five years and two years on licence.

"They spend barely any money on bills and produce their own honey. It's certainly the Good Life for Yvonne and Steven Lucas, who spend just £4 a month on their electricity and heating bill by living ‘The Good Life’. Yvonne, 48, and Steven, 53, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, have slashed their energy bills by installing solar panels, growing their own fruit and vegetables and collecting rainwater to flush their toilets. The couple have developed their suburban property so as to become as self-sufficient as possible . They have ranks of solar panels in back and front gardens reducing their bills to £50 a year . The prudent pair model themselves on the characters from cult 1970s comedy TV show The Good Life, starring Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal, by creating a simple and self-sufficient lifestyle. Since installing a water meter, they have seen the bills for their three-bedroom detached bungalow drop from £200 a year to under £30 for six months. They also own six-acre woodland in Surrey as well as their own bee hives to produce honey and chickens to lay fresh eggs. Thrifty Steven brought his first set of solar panels in 1992 and has stepped up his cost-saving green campaign since being made redundant in 2010. The former electronics engineer said: 'We visited the Centre for Technology in Wales in 1992 and brought our first couple of solar panels. From that it has just evolved. They grow a huge variety of vegetables, harvest multiple fruits from their home orchard and keep chickens as well as bees . Steven turns the handle of a Crossley PH1060 paraffin hopper used for topping up the batteries used for storing solar energy in the back garden of the home . 'We have always grown organically but we knew we wanted to do more for the environment and over the years have brought more and more.' Yvonne and Steven, who have two sons James, 22, and Jonathon, 19, installed solar panels in their 40ft garden to generate hot water, which they use in their home. Knitting teacher Yvonne added: 'We don’t feed our solar panels into the national grid as we store the energy in a two kilowatt battery system. 'If our neighbours didn’t have any power we would still be able to turn out lights on, have access to the washing machine and everything else. 'Our rain harvesting system also collects around collect around 1,000 gallons which we to flush our toilets and for day-to-day living. 'All our chutneys, jams, cordial and wine are home-made, as well as keeping bees for honey. Thrifty Steven brought his first set of solar panels in 1992 and has stepped up his cost-saving green campaign since being made redundant in 2010 . 'We’ve always been interested in gardening and recycling and having a more environmentally friendly life style. 'Gradually we did more and more upgrading, reusing and recycling items which has saved us a lot of money.' Vegetarians Yvonne and Steven use three allotments, two greenhouses and their garden to grow more than 15 fruit trees, a wide variety of vegetables and herbs, flowers and several ponds. Six years ago they also brought the woodland to use the timber to fuel their wood burner and carry our repairs at their eco-friendly property. Steven added: 'We only probably spend five hours a week working on the land because we try and keep on top of it. 'We also use the woodland to camp down there once a month to collect and chop wood and enjoy the bird life. 'We have even managed to see badgers down there one evening - until a woodpecker disturbed them. 'It’s great being able to enjoy the great outdoors.' Yvonne said: 'Our friends joke we are like The Good Life television show - we just don’t have a pig in our garden! 'Everybody can do their bit by recycling more and turning things off when they are not in use. 'You can’t get away from plastic products but you can make sure everything possible gets recycled, sometimes we only put our bins out once a month. 'Even composting green waste helps.'","Yvonne and Steven Lucas have bee hives for honey and chickens for eggs .

"As sparring partners go, a Hollywood actress and an evolutionary biologist would not appear to be a natural fit. However, Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie, 39, and controversial scientist Professor Richard Dawkins, 73, have found themselves inadvertently at loggerheads over whether children should be allowed to read fairytales. Miss Jolie, who plays an evil fairy godmother in her latest film Maleficent – a spin on the classic story of Sleeping Beauty – said fairytales play an important role in how she raises her six children, using ‘a little magic’ to impart important moral lessons. Angelina Jolie, left, says fairytales are important to teach moral lessons. However, Professor Richard Dawkins, right, warned they could damage children . In a new interview, she said: ‘There are morals in these stories and you want a little magic – it’s important to have something that we’re a little bit in awe of. ‘The other day, one of the kids lost a tooth and I talked about the tooth fairy. Half of them are old enough to think: “What are you talking about,” yet they’re still not sure there isn’t something. ‘And I’m not lying to them. I say, “I really can’t tell you. I don’t really know. Mothers are sworn to secrecy.” ‘Kids grow up fast enough these days, so let’s allow them to have a little bit of childhood for as long as they can.’ Richard Dawkins acknowledged that the appeal of fairytales lay in their magic but believes they may be causing more harm than we think. He also questioned whether we should let children believe in Father Christmas at all . Do you think teaching children myths like Santa Claus and fairy tales is damaging?

The comments put her at odds with Professor Dawkins, famous for his vocal opposition to religion, who this week branded fairytales ‘pernicious’ and warned they could damage children. Talking at the Cheltenham Science Festival recently, the father-of-one, said: ‘Is it a good thing to go along with the fantasies of childhood, magical as they are? Or should we be fostering a spirit of scepticism? I think it’s rather pernicious to inculcate into a child a view of the world which includes supernaturalism – we get enough of that anyway.’ He faced a backlash after the appearance, even being branded a ‘soulless bore’ by former Labour MP Tom Watson. Miss Jolie plays an evil fairy godmother in her latest film Maleficent, a spin on the classic story of Sleeping Beauty . Professor Dawkins has since tempered his views, saying: ‘I did not and will not condemn fairytales. My whole life has been given over to simulating the imagination, and in childhood years, fairy stories can do that.’ However, he reasserted his opinion on Thursday that there is an ‘interesting question’ surrounding the effect a ‘diet of supernatural magic spells’ might have on the development on children. In contrast, Miss Jolie, who has three adopted and three biological children with partner Brad Pitt, 50 – Maddox, 12, from Cambodia, Pax, 10, from Vietnam, Zahara, 9, from Ethiopia, Shiloh, 7 and twins Knox and Vivienne, 5 – said she has loved fairytales all her life and that it was this fascination that drew her to the role in Maleficent. Richard Dawkins has claimed that forcing a religion on children without questioning its merits is as bad as 'child abuse'. The leading atheist said he was against the 'indoctrination of religion' and teaching it as fact. Dawkins' best-selling book The God Delusion argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society. In the earlier interview, he claimed he had been told by a woman that while being abused by a priest was a ‘yucky’ experience, being told as a child that a Protestant friend who died would ‘roast in Hell’ was more distressing. In remarks to Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera, he said: ‘Horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the long-term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up Catholic in the first place. In the interview with Psychologies magazine she said: ‘I was fascinated by [Maleficent] as a child. I thought she was the scariest and the most interesting of all the Disney characters. But I wanted to know more about her. Who is that gorgeous, elegant creature? So I loved the idea of playing a Disney villain. It sounded so much fun. ‘I was afraid of her. But I loved her too because she was this elegant, sexy, evil creature. I was drawn to her. ‘I got really emotional because the script is very powerful. The kids loved it. ‘We tried to make this sophisticated enough that adults will read things into it that kids won’t. Parents watching the movie will identify with Maleficent in a different way, which I think is fine. ‘Little kids on set cried when they saw me. People would bring their children on to the set and one kid said “Mommy, tell that mean witch to stop talking to me!” ‘We have a choice about how we take what happens to us in our life and whether or not we allow it to turn us. We can become consumed by hate and darkness, or we’re able to regain our humanity somehow, or come to terms with things and learn something about ourselves.’","Actress says fairytales play important role in how she raises her six children .

"A painting by a talented British artist with Down's Syndrome has been given the royal seal of approval. Tazia Fawley, 43, from Highbridge, Somerset, donated the brightly-coloured work to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as a personal gift to mark the arrival of their son, Prince George. She spent six months working on the painting which features hot air balloons over Bristol’s Clifton Suspension Bridge and children's favourite Rupert the Bear. Gift: Tazia Fawley holding a copy on the painting she has given to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for Prince George's nursery . Tazia's painting: Called Rupert Flies Over the Clifton Suspension Bridge, it is an acrylic on wood painting worth around £2,000 . It was first spotted by the Heart and Sold charity which supports and showcases artists with Down’s Syndrome and they offered it to St James's Palace. To Tazia's joy, the royal couple said they were delighted to accept the 3ft x 1ft painting and sent her their best wishes. Tazia, who has been painting for 14 years, said the acrylic on wood painting was worth around £2,000 - but she was happy to donate it free. She said: 'The painting is of the Bristol Balloon Festival and it's one of my favourite pieces of work. 'I gave it to Kate and Wills as a present, because they seem like good people and they wanted to bring some colour into their son's nursery. 'I'm so excited to know that my painting will be seen by the most famous baby in the world.' Suzie Moffat from Heart and Sold said: 'I contacted the palace before the Prince was born to see if they would like Tazia's art for the baby's nursery. Inspiring: Tazia lives with her mother Glyda, who hopes that her daughter's paintings will help change attitudes about what people with Down's Syndrome can achieve . Cornish Sea Scape: Tazia loves painting landscapes and capturing the vibrant colours . 'I was thrilled when the Palace replied saying that they'd love the artwork so we sent it over to them. 'They were extremely positive towards the artwork and were very supportive of the charity which was brilliant. Kate and Wills even sent us a thank you note. 'It's such a lovely piece, and Tazia is such a great artist.' The letter sent to proud Tazia says: 'The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge request to send best wishes to Suzie Moffat and Tazia Fawley for their generous gift.' Tazia lives with her mother, Gylda, in Somerset and works from a studio in their back garden. She added: 'I mostly paint landscapes and seascapes because I find painting people a bit difficult. Animals and buildings are also hard. I struggle a bit with those too. 'But I love painting landscapes. The colours you can use are just phenomenal. Tazia says: 'I don't see myself as a Down's Syndrome artist, I see myself as an artist who just happens to have Down's' 'I don't really have any favourite artists, I just like painting what I like painting, and that's about it. 'I'm not trying to copy anyone else, I paint because I love it and it makes me very happy.' Tazia's mother Gylda, 74, who is a sculptor, said: 'If a person with a child with Down's sees her work, they can take a big positive from it. 'It can give them a much more positive outlook because their child may be able to do the same thing. 'When Taz was born, doctors dealt with children with Down's by telling parents what their limitations were. Talented: Tazia has been painting for 14 years and works out of a garden studio at her home in Somerset . Grateful: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sent a note thanking Tazia for the painting, which was a gift to celebrate the arrival of Prince George . 'It was always what they can't do, rather than now, where doctors tell parents what their child can do. 'Hopefully Taz's work can change a few attitudes about what a dedicated person with Down's can do.' Tazia often listens to pop music when she paints, because she says it helps her come up with brighter colour combinations. She said: 'When I was painting the prince's painting, I was listening to a lot of Abba, Kylie and even Queen. Happy music makes happy paintings. I try to be quite positive and happy all the time, and not moody. 'I don't see myself as a Down's Syndrome artist, I see myself as an artist who just happens to have Down's.' Floods at Athelney: Tazia loves to paint landscapes because of the range of colours that can be used . Snow in Canada: Tazia says that painting makes her happy and she often listens to music as she works . Tazia's . first gallery show will take place at the Princess Theatre in .

"Doctors witnessed the bravery of marine Kyle Carpenter with his stunning recovery from his injuries for diving on a grenade to save a comrade in Afghanistan in November 2010. President Barack Obama will award Marine Corporal Kyle Carpenter, 24, the Medal of Honor today for selflessly jumping on a grenade to save Lance Corporal Nicholas Eufrazio while they stood guard on a rooftop in Helmand province, Afghanistan, in November 2010. But it was his stoic recovery from injuries which saw his lungs and heart stop several times, bones broken from head to toe, the loss of an eye and most of his teeth which moved doctors from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Scroll down for video . Hero: Corporal Carpenter is to receive the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a grenade to save a friend . Brave: Corporal Carpenter, from South Carolina, had been in Afghanistan for 5 months before the explosion . In a moving video tribute posted before he received the highest U.S military honor, Debra L. Malone said he never once complained as he battled for his life and always giving 110 per cent during recovery. After the blast, he needed more than 30 operations, and was fitted with a glass eye. 'I honestly believe Kyle made an effort to protect his family and his fellow marines. I don't think he wanted to see his fellow marines see him suffer,’ Dr Malone said. 'He knew that his fellow marines would be at some point going off to war and they might be faced with the same type of challenge. 'You would never know what he's been through. All his injuries have become a part of him, and he's proud of his injuries.’ Doctor Lauren T. Greer said: ‘No one survives a grenade blast, especially when you jump on top of it. But he always looked happy to be alive. ‘It’s extraordinary that he’s able to walk and use his legs as well as he can.’ Vincent Auth said he was 'very polite, very grateful, and very appreciative' of everything that was being done by the doctors. he was just a great kid to work on. 'His mother had mentioned he had the most beautiful smile, and I asked her to bring pictures in of him,  and every time he came back he seemed to look more like those photos, even though he went a long time without any lower teeth,' Dr Auth said.

'We knew the area we were moving into was one of the rougher areas,' he said. Even though he has since left the Marines, Corporal Carpenter has maintained close ties - and has been guest of honor at several command events. On the anniversary of the blast last year, he wrote on Facebook to thank his supporters. He said: 'It's hard to comprehend that three years ago today my life and body was torn apart by an enemy hand grenade on a hot dusty rooftop in Afghanistan.' 'At times it has felt so long ago and yet, when I close my eyes, I can still feel the warm blood pouring out of me onto my skin and fading out of consciousness with my the final thought of ""I'm going to die"" in my head... And here I am.' Corporal Carpenter will be the third Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the start of the Afghanistan and war in 2001.

"Roman Polanski has said that he felt ‘more persecuted’ after his arrest in 2009 on a historic child sex charge than in 1977 when he was charged. The film director served 42 days in jail in 1977 as part of a 90-day plea bargain after his conviction for unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl at Jack Nicholson’s Hollywood mansion. Polanski fled America in 1978, fearing he might actually be jailed for up to 50 years. In 2009 he was held in Switzerland but the authorities decided against extraditing him to the US. Roman Polanski said he felt 'more persecuted' after his arrest in 2009 on a historic child sex charge than in 1977. He is pictured with his wife Emmanuelle Seigner at the premiere of the film 'Blue Jasmine' this month . Now he has told Vanity Fair magazine the hatred he faced in 2009 was ‘much more like’ the anger he faced after the murder of his wife Sharon Tate and her friends in 1969. There were misleading rumours he was involved in their deaths – which were carried out by Charles Manson’s gang. The Oscar winning 'Rosemary's Baby' director said: ‘I didn’t have that at all then. ‘This was much more like the assassination of Sharon and what happened afterwards.' He said about his decision to flee California to live in exile in France: ‘It was such a shock to learn that it’s not finished, after they let you out of prison. Free! With your bundle under your arm, with the lawyer waiting for you outside, standing there, in your mind it’s all over, it’s finished. 'And then the judge changed his mind. And I have to go back to prison, and nobody knows how long. I just could not go through that.' Polanski was arrested in 2009 en route to the Zurich Film Festival, and spent two months in a Swiss jail. He was then placed under house arrest at his chalet in the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Gstaad. Samantha Geimer, now 50, has published a book called 'The Girl: A Life In The Shadow of Roman Polanski' In July 2010 Swiss authorities decided they would not extradite the director to the US. The veteran director responded to reports that he was living as a fugitive in Europe, answering: ‘I was moving freely for 32 years” between homes and projects in Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Tunisia. Although Polanski’s victim, Samantha Giemer, now 50, was outspoken in claiming ‘enough is enough’ in 2009. This week, Geimer published a book telling her side, called ‘The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski.’ Despite having left Hollywood four decades ago, the director still has his supporters, such as actor Jack Nicholson, who told Vanity Fair: ‘I knew this man was not going to say, ""Oh, God, this has ruined me. I can’t work."" That is not in his vocabulary. ‘He’s not going to give in. It doesn’t mean he’s not aware of the loss. But Roman has never been one to let anything limit what he does. He is a genius.’","Roman Polanski compared the reaction to his 2009 arrest to the aftermath of his wife Sharon Tate's murder in which he was wrongly implicated .

"Lawyers for Boston . Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have asked to move his . upcoming trial from Boston, proposing Washington, D.C., as the new . location. In a motion filed in U.S. District . Court late Wednesday, Tsarnaev's public defenders said a survey of . potential jurors in Boston, Springfield, New York City and Washington . suggests the nation's capital would be a more suitable location for a . trial. The lawyers, who cautioned that they . still need more time to study the issue, said Boston residents were the 'most prejudiced' on a number of critical measures, based on the May . survey's preliminary findings. Scroll down for video . Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have asked to move his upcoming trial from Boston, proposing Washington, D.C., as the new location . Among Boston . respondents aware of the case, they said, nearly 58 per cent 'definitely' believed Tsarnaev was guilty and 37 per cent believed that if convicted . he deserved the death penalty. More than 50 per cent of Boston . respondents said they or someone they knew had participated in or . attended last year's marathon, at which three people were killed and . more than 260 others were injured. About 37 . per cent of Washington residents surveyed 'definitely' believed Tsarnaev . was guilty, 19 per cent said he deserved the death penalty and about 12 . per cent said they or someone they knew had participated in or attended . the marathon. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev and his . brother planted two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the . 2013 marathon. His brother died following a shootout with police several . days later. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges. His trial is expected to begin in November. Among Boston respondents aware of the case, they said, nearly 58 per cent 'definitely' believed Tsarnaev was guilty and 37 per cent believed that if convicted he deserved the death penalty . Tsarnaev's . lawyers said their motion has precedent: They noted that 'tremendous . local impact and galvanizing community reaction' prompted the trial of . Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to be transferred to Denver in . 1996. The lawyers argue that the marathon bombings present an even greater impact to the Boston-area community. They . pointed to the 'trauma' of the four-day police search, capped by the . dramatic final day, on which thousands of Boston-area residents were . ordered to shelter in place until Tsarnaev was found. Defense . lawyers also noted the intense and sustained media coverage after the . bombings and the ever-present 'Boston Strong' billboards, T-shirts and . other paraphernalia. The request to change trial venues capped a busy day in the case. Earlier, . U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole ruled that 'betrayal of the . United States' should not be among the factors prosecutors cite when . arguing whether Tsarnaev, who lived in the former Soviet republic of . Kyrgyzstan and in Russia before moving to the U.S., gets the death . penalty if convicted. The judge said it was 'highly inappropriate' for prosecutors to draw a distinction between a 'naturalized' and a 'natural-born' U.S. citizen. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and his trial is expected to begin in November . Federal . prosecutors have argued, in part, that Tsarnaev, 20, deserves the death . penalty because he betrayed his allegiance to the country that granted . him asylum and later citizenship. Tsarnaev's attorneys have said the argument is unprecedented in death penalty cases. The . judge on Wednesday also denied a request by Tsarnaev's lawyers to allow . them to meet with their client and his sisters in prison without . federal agents present. Instead, prosecutors agreed to have an FBI agent . or other federal official not assigned to the case monitor the . meetings, for security purposes. And the judge . issued a stern warning to prosecutors about former or current members . of their team speaking to the media.

"A six-month-old baby who has spent her entire life in hospital because of a super-rare condition which affects just 500 people in the world is finally going home. April Karmazyn-Wall, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, suffers from Emanuel Syndrome, a genetic disorder which affects the body's cells and could mean she will never walk. Despite her health problems, parents Nadia Karmazyn, 31 and Scott Wall, 25, are hoping she will be discharged from Newcastle's Royal Infirmary within the next few weeks. Trooper: Six-month-old baby April Karmazyn-Wall, has Emanuel Syndrome, a rare and debilitating condition which only effects 500 people in the world . First time parents Nadia Karmazyn, 31 . and Scott Wall, 25, were unaware that their daughter had the condition . until she was born. Miss Karmazyn, a technical advisor, said: 'April was born by emergency caesarean section at 38 weeks, weighing 4lb 10oz. 'When she was born we did not know about the medical condition and we were shocked that she was diagnosed with it - it has been an incredibly difficult few months. 'April has quite a lot of medical problems but she smiles all the time and is easily entertained by the balloons around her cot. 'We can't put into words how proud we are of April as she has been through so much and continues to smile.' Relief: Mother Nadia Karmazyn is looking forward to finally taking April to her new family home . Miracle baby: As well as Emanuel Syndrome, April suffers from a heart condition and has a cleft palate, but has battled through all of her health problems . She added: 'She is so happy and it is amazing she has got through it all. 'Babies with Emanuel Syndrome tend to have weak muscles and their development is impaired.' Little is known about, Emanuel Syndrome so it is not known exactly how April will develop as she gets older. So far April has endured 10 operations and has to take three different types of medication. Emanuel syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that disrupts normal development and affects many parts of the body. It is caused by the presence of extra genetic material. People with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two. The excess genetic material disrupts development. Infants with Emanuel syndrome have weak muscle tone and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate. Their intellectual development is also usually significantly delayed. About half of all affected infants are born with a cleft palate. Miss Karmazyn added: 'A lot of babies with Emanuel Syndrome do not survive. 'April has low muscle tone and can't sit up as she is behind with her development. 'We are not sure if she will be able to walk or talk as it all depends on her - some children with the condition do, whilst others don't. 'But April has been so ill and it was touch and go as to whether she'd survive, so we are just so grateful that she is here with us. 'Whatever happens we will deal with it.' April was also born with pulmonary atresia, meaning parts of the heart did not develop properly, and she received life-saving treatment at Newcastle Freeman Hospital's children's heart unit. She also had a cleft palate and has had problems with her gut. Nadia said: 'We can't wait for April to come home as she has only been home for one hour in her life. 'It will be lovely to be able to do normal things with April, like going shopping or go for a coffee with friends.'","Little April has Emanuel Syndrome, which affects just 500 people worldwide .

"Mitt Romney’s White House bid took another blow last night after he appeared to suggest a pro-Iranian terrorist could hold America to ransom by threatening to blow up Chicago with a nuclear bomb. In one of the most bizarre remarks ever made by a presidential candidate, the Republican challenger outlined how he might carry out an attack – comments critics claimed exposed America’s weaknesses. They were revealed just hours after videotapes of Mr Romney showed him making a series of derogatory remarks about Americans, Palestinians, Mexicans and the Chinese. Scroll down for video . Caught on tape: Mitt Romney shares his laissez-faire approach to solving the 'Palestinian Problem' at a dinner for wealthy donors in Boca Raton, Florida . Doubling down: Romney has refused to back away from comments he made during a private fundraiser -- instead saying they could spark a debate about the size of government . Visitors: Romney offered his daughter-in-law Jenn and five of grandchildren a tour of campaign jet . ‘If I were Iran – a crazed fanatic, I’d  say let’s get a little fissile material to Hezbollah, have them carry it to Chicago, and then if anything goes wrong, or America starts acting up, we’ll just say, “Guess what? Unless you stand down, why, we’re going to let off a dirty bomb. ‘I mean this is where we have – where America could be held up and blackmailed by Iran, by the mullahs, by crazy people. So we don’t have any option but to keep Iran from having a nuclear weapon.’ In another secretly filmed video clip, Mr Romney claimed there was no point trying to appeal to Democratic voters because they were ‘freeloaders who don’t pay taxes’. ‘There are 47 per cent who are with Barack Obama, who are dependent upon government, who believe they are victims,’ he said. ‘These are people who pay no income tax.  My job is not to worry about those people.’ Family man: Romney spent time with his grandchildren,  left to right: Owen, 5, Gracie, 9, Wyatt, 7, Nash, 3, and Sawyer, 1, on his campaign plane on Tuesday . Home: Romney returned to his ancestral home of Salt Lake City on Tuesday for a campaign rally . In another video, he fires a . broadside at the Palestinians,  saying: ‘I look at the Palestinians not . wanting to see peace anyway, committed to the destruction of Israel, and . I say there’s just no way [there will be peace].’ And . he can be heard joking he would have an easier time winning the US . election in November if his father had Mexican parents, instead of being . a state governor and wealthy car company boss. In the same video, Mr Romney also tells how he considered investing in a sweatshop-like factory in China when he was head of US private equity giant Bain Capital. Damage control: Romney responded quickly to the Mother Jones secret tape saying his remarks were not 'elegantly stated' The businessman – who recently criticised Mr Obama for ‘spending 43 months failing to confront China’s unfair trade practices’ was given a tour of the factory in the 1990s, where 20,000 women earned tiny wages and lived in squalid conditions. He said: ‘As we were walking through this facility, seeing them work, the number of hours they worked the pittance they earned. ‘And around this factory was a fence, a huge fence with barbed wire and guard towers. And we said gosh, I can’t believe that you, you know, keep these girls in. ‘And they said, no, no, no. This is to keep other people from coming in. Because people want so badly to work in this factory that we have to keep them out’. US news channel CNN said sources revealed Bain did not invest in the firm or buy it. The videos, which were all taped during a $50,000-a-plate dinner for wealthy donors in Florida, surfaced as the presidential campaign enters its final 50 days. Snippets were placed online in YouTube films by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, which said it obtained them from a guest at the dinner hosted by millionaire US financier Marc Leder on May 17. The footage was unearthed with the help of former Democrat president Jimmy Carter’s grandson, James, who is credited with ‘research assistance’ on its website. Last night, Jim Messina, Mr Obama’s campaign manager, said: ‘It’s shocking that a candidate for President would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the  American people view themselves as ‘victims’ entitled to handouts, and are unwilling to take 'personal responsibility' for their lives. ‘It’s hard to serve as a president when you’ve disdainfully written off half the nation.’ Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian lawmaker and scholar, said Mr Romney’s remarks were ‘irresponsible and dangerous’. Mission: Jimmy Carter's grandson James says he had been researching films on Republicans 'almost every day' and that he did it 'just for fun' However, the politician said he stood by the remarks which were ‘not elegantly stated’. The fundraiser where Romney made the fateful remarks was thrown in May by hedge fund manager Marc Leder, who has developed a reputation as a party boy. Mr Leder, who is worth a reported $400million, runs Sun Capital Partners in Boca Raton, Florida. The New York Post reports that he threw a lurid end-of-summer party in the Hamptons last year at a mansion he rented for $500,000 a month. The raucous gathering included at least one couple that stripped down naked in the pool and then had sex on the pool deck in full view of other party guests. All of this took place to the backdrop of go-go dancers, fire twirlers and throbbing techno music. Mr Leder, 50, reportedly kicked up his partying lifestyle after his wife of 22 years cheated on him with her 23-year-old tennis instructor. Gracious host: Marc Leder, the hedge fund manager who sponsored the Romney fundraiser, has a reputation for throwing wild parties . Obama has been working hard to make political hay out of Romney's comments at the fundraiser. During an interview with David Letterman late Tuesday, the president accused his Republican challenger of dividing the nation. 'My expectation is that if you want to be president, you have to work for everyone, not just for some,' he said. 'What I think people want to be sure of is you are not writing off big chunks of the country because the way our democracy works.' He also criticized Romney for saying 47 percent of Americans think of themselves as 'victims,' saying the American Dream is alive and well among all of the voters he meets. Romney didn't score marks for his choice of words -- even from his own running mate, who called the comments 'obviously inarticulate.' Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan made the comment in an interview aired Tuesday by KRNV-TV in Reno, Nevada. Asked what he thought of Romney's remarks, Ryan told the Nevada station: ""He was obviously inarticulate in making this point."" Ryan went on to say the point the Republicans are making is that, under the Obama economy, government dependency is up and economic stagnation is up. Meanwhile, Republican launched a counteroffensive in an attempt to regain momentum. Appearing on Fox News on Tuesday, Romney pointed to a secret 1998 tape of Obama saying he wants to redistribute wealth in the United States. Hitting back: President Obama said Romney's remarks were not fitting for a national leader. He said a president must represent all Americans . Then-Illinois state senator said: 'The trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution. 'Because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make to make sure everybody has got a shot.' The audio of the tape was posted on YouTube on Tuesday and dated October 1998. Romney says it shows a clear division between the vision of America that he is offering and the ideals that Obama espouses. 'Frankly, we have two different views about America. The president’s view is one of a larger government. There is a tape that came out where is the president is saying he likes redistribution. I disagree,' Romney told Fox News.'I think a society based upon a government-centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role, redistributes money, that’s the wrong course for America. That will not build a strong America or help people out of poverty.'","Republican presidential candidate was secretly filmed at a $50,000-a-plate dinner for wealthy party donors .

"An NHS campaigner has fled her home town following death threats, abuse and the desecration of her mother’s grave. Julie Bailey, who helped expose the horrific neglect at Stafford Hospital which cost up to 1,400 lives, says ‘vipers’ have victimised her ever since she set up Cure the NHS. She started the pressure group in her own cafe following the death of her mother at the hospital. But yesterday she handed over the keys to the business, having agreed a cut-price sale on eBay. Vile: Stafford Hospital campaigner Julie Bailey has quit the town after her mother's grave was desecrated as part of a campaign of intimidation . Breaks Cafe, the business the mother-of-two has been forced to sell in a cut-price sale . ‘People have been coming into the cafe shouting that nothing happened at Stafford, that I am lying and there were no unnecessary deaths,’ she said last night. ‘I have been run out of town by small minded people, leaving my home, my livelihood and my friends because a few misinformed local political activists have fuelled a hate campaign based on lies. 'This is a classic case of shooting the messenger.’ She said the final straw was the ‘desecration of my mum’s grave’ that continued for six weeks. The 50-year-old mother of two says her troubles began in 2009 when a Healthcare Commission report into the failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS put the future of its casualty department under threat. Miss Bailey said residents boycotted her café, reducing takings to as little as £40 a day . She became a hate figure after local party activist Rolfe Pearce posted a video on YouTube in which a man signing a Labour petition to save the unit expresses a hope that Miss Bailey would die. The video, which provoked a torrent of hateful emails and telephone calls, was posted by Mr Pearce in a personal capacity and was later taken down. The 49-year-old said the comments were tongue in in cheek. Miss Bailey’s plight became worse when another Labour party activist claimed she had said at a public meeting: ‘Let’s shut the hospital, let’s sack all the staff’. That demand, the activist, Diana Smith, said, was ‘met by loud cheers from her band of followers’. This year the campaign against her took a sinister turn when the grave of Miss Bailey’s mother, Bella, who was 86 when she died at the hospital after ‘being dropped’ by a nurse, was vandalised. This was followed by a postcard saying: ‘Thank you for closing Stafford hospital, Ha, Ha, Ha, you better now spend more time watching your mother’s grave.’ Last month, emergency call handler Roy Guest, 54, was sacked by West Midlands ambulance service after comments appeared online about a wish for Miss Bailey to suffer ‘a life-threatening illness’. Miss Bailey said residents have been boycotting her café, reducing takings to as little as £40 a day. She is moving out of her rented home in Stafford this weekend, initially to live in a static caravan at an undisclosed location. She sold the café for £14,000 and now plans to devote more time to turning Cure the NHS into a national charity. Miss Bailey told last month how damage had been caused to her mother’s grave over a six-week period. Julie Bailey's mother Bella Bailey, . who died at Stafford Hospital. Her grave was desecrated and a note left on it reading 'ha ha ha' Speaking at the time, she said: ‘The momentum seems to be growing when I go out onto the streets of Stafford. People come up to me and say “It’s not true, you were lying. You brought shame on the town and nobody died”. ‘It just drains the strength from you and you’re back grieving again. But the one thing I do say is, “Have you read any investigations? Did you go to the inquiry?’’’ Paramedic Roy 'Murph' Guest, 51, who launched a Facebook attack on Julie Bailey and wished a terminal illness on her, was sacked . Last night, Mrs Smith, who was a volunteer assistant to David Kidney, the former Labour MP for Stafford, stood by her blog post and accused Miss Bailey of forgetting what she had said at the public meeting in 2009. She said: ‘I have notes of what Julie said and witnesses who also heard her comment.’ Mrs Smith, who is involved in the Support Stafford Hospital campaign which organised a march through the town attended by 30,000 people in April, said: ‘Barely anybody will have read that blog until its contents were picked up and disseminated by Cure the NHS members and supporters.’ Cheryl Porter, one of the founders of the Support Stafford Hospital campaign, insisted: ‘We have had absolutely nothing to do with any of the problems Julie Bailey has faced. ‘We condemn the abuse Julie Bailey has received – the desecration of her mother’s grave, the abusive emails and phone calls. ‘But these incidents are nothing to do with us. ‘We were set up as a campaign group fighting against night-time plans to close the accident and emergency department at the hospital, two years ago. 'We are thankful for what Julie and Cure the NHS have done in exposing what went on at the hospital. But we are now one of the top 20 hospitals in the country for safety and Julie is part of the reason why. ‘We simply want to secure the long-term future of acute services at Stafford. We all need to work together to achieve this.’ She said it was sad that Miss Bailey had felt compelled to leave her home town. In February Sir Robert Francis QC published his final report into Mid Staffordshire which said the trust had put corporate self-interest ahead of patients. The public inquiry cost £13million. A West Midlands Labour Party spokesperson said: 'We utterly condemn any abusive actions or comments made towards Julie Bailey or the Cure the NHS group.'

Users keep a record of their achievements and monitor how they improve in the bedroom . Other features include recording the frequency of love-making, the most thrusts per minute a person is able to achieve as well as the peak number of decibels a person makes when reaching climax. The app, costing $2.99 - although discounted to $1.99 for the rest of this month -  also has a points system whereby you can set yourself a challenge to prove how dedicated you are to your sex life. A session of early morning loving gets you 10 points, while a lazy Sunday session earns you 20, for example. Spreadsheets works by monitoring data from a user’s movement and audio levels through the phone's inbuilt accelerometer and microphone, to provide statistical and visual analysis of their performance in bed.

However a large number of apps have been turned down by iTunes for being too explicit and breaching Apple's guidelines. For example, apps that were deemed too offensive and rejected, include iBoobs, an app that involved shaking the phone to make a pair of virtual breasts move, and PinPoints X that used GPS to plot the location of sex adverts around cities. There was also the Puff app that involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls' skirts on the screen and Video Strip Poker app that would remove clothing from a virtual model each time a user won a card hand.","Spreadsheets is an iTunes app that monitor everything from thrusts per minute to peak number of decibels a person makes while having sex .

"World-renowned musician Duncan McTier (pictured) pleaded guilty to three sexual offences . A world-renowned musician told a teenage pupil 'my wife doesn't understand me', before trying to sexually assault her, a court heard. Duncan McTier, 59, admitted trying to entice the young woman into a sexual liaison as he pleaded guilty to three sexual offences dating back to the mid 1980s and 1990s. McTier, who has resigned as Professor of Double Bass at the Royal Academy of Music in London, escaped jail after admitting the attempted indecent assault and two further counts of indecent assault as he was about to go on trial at Liverpool Crown Court. Each of the victims were highly gifted musicians and pupils of McTier who taught at various prestigious music schools across the UK. He touched two of his victims' breasts over their clothing and on the other occasion put his arm around another pupil. Divorced father-of-two McTier, of Isleworth, west London, was given a three-month jail term on each count, suspended for two years and ordered to do 240 hours community service. McTier is recognised as one of the world's foremost double bass soloists and teachers. Passing sentence Mr Justice MacDuff said: 'You will never be able to hold your head as high in society again and that is to your shame but also your punishment. 'It's a long time ago, but that behaviour as you know was shameful and horrid for somebody who had the trust of students and took advantage of your position, or tried to, because you could influence their potential careers and that's what makes this the more serious. 'You took steps to try to begin sexual liaisons with three of your students. 'At the time it must have been an awful experience for them, how to deal with you.' Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, told the court the first offence in 1985 involved a young music student. After a music lesson McTier, then aged 30 or 31 and married, began drinking wine and invited the 17-year-old to sit with him on a sofa. Mr Cadwallader said: 'By that stage he was drunk and was using lines which can perhaps be summarised as, ""my wife doesn't understand me"".' McTier then put his arm around her and she 'froze' and this continued for 20 minutes. He later made a 'drunken grab' for her breasts which she knocked away. Two months later she warned her attacker: 'Don't ever do that to me again.' Later he smirked and told her she would not be successful in getting a prestigious musical position. The victim said: 'Is it because I won't sleep with every male member?' To which McTier replied: 'That's about right,' the court heard. His second victim was a student aged in her early 20s . During a lesson in the summer of 1988 after drinking wine he again put his arm around the young woman and this time touched her breast over her clothing. The 'shocked' victim 'did not want to make a fuss', Mr Cadwallader said - but left immediately. His final victim was also aged in her early 20s and having a lesson from McTier in March 1994 while he was teaching. Both were sat on a sofa when 'out of the blue' he lunged at her, again touching the young woman's breast over her clothing. Video Source www.claissicalplanet.com . Liverpool Crown Court (pictured) heard that each of McTier's victims were highly gifted musicians and pupils of McTier . Again the victim got up and left. David Toal, mitigating, said the prosecution has had a 'significant impact' on McTier, having resigned from the Royal Academy, he has also lost other teaching work due to the publicity. Mr Toal added: 'He's a different individual from the one who has acted in the way described. 'His life is a world away from the dock of a criminal crown court, in every other respect he's a decent, law abiding citizen.' A formal not guilty verdict was recorded on a fourth charge of attempted indecent assault against McTier. McTier was arrested by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) in an investigation triggered by the conviction last year of Michael Brewer, former director of music at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester. Brewer was found guilty of sexually assaulting Frances Andrade, a pupil at the school, from the age of 14. She killed herself after giving evidence against him. A spokesman for the Royal Academy of Music said: 'In May 2014 Duncan McTier was charged by police regarding historic cases of sexual abuse in Manchester before his employment at the Royal Academy of Music. 'During his bail Duncan McTier was placed on a precautionary suspension from duty at the academy. 'He has now resigned from the academy with immediate effect.'","Duncan McTier was Professor of Double Bass at Royal Academy of Music .

"Claims: The book reports alleged conversations with Tennessee Williams, Gore Vidal and Truman Capote, including Vidal and Capote's 'revelations' about Jackie Kennedy's love life . Driven to distraction by the amorous betrayals of her . husband, Jackie Kennedy embarked on a wild fling with ballet dancer Rudolf . Nureyev while she was still in the White House, according to a new tell-all . book. Nureyev, who was nine years younger than the First Lady, . was also once spotted with Jackie’s brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy ‘kissing . each other passionately in a phone box’, the book claims. Much has been written through the years about President . Kennedy’s dalliances while in office. His mistresses were famously said to . include actresses Marilyn Monroe and Angie Dickinson, mafia moll Judith Exner . and a 19-year-old White House intern. But ‘The Pink Triangle’ – due for release on the 20th . anniversary of Jackie Kennedy’s death from cancer in 1994 – suggests the First . Lady wasn’t content to sit idly by while her husband had countless affairs. According to Globe magazine, which has an . advance copy of the book, it claims Jackie flew Nureyev to Washington in 1963 and they . soon ‘plunged into a secret love affair that lasted years.’ ‘Jackie first fell for Rudi the day she invited him and . his legendary dance partner Margot Fonteyn to perform at the White House during . Jack’s administration,’ writes co-author Darwin Porter. The First Lady arranged a private jet for Nureyev and the . dancer reportedly sat in JFK’s rocking chair and informed the president’s wife: . ‘Unlike your husband, I have a powerful back.’ Later days: Jackie Kennedy allegedly had an affair with Rudolf Nureyev in the 1960s, but they remained close for decades as they are pictured here in 1983 when she was married to Aristotle Onassis . While only a few close friends in America allegedly knew about the . fling, the couple remained close after JFK’s 1963 assassination. They were photographed together in the English . countryside in November 1968 and that same year, Paris Match magazine claimed . the ballet star had been overheard drunkenly boasting about his conquest. Nureyev, who defected to the west from the Soviet Union . in 1961, made no secret of the fact that the Kennedys fell under his spell. ‘I am the sexiest man alive,’ he told a Danish newspaper . before his death from AIDS in 1993. ‘Just ask Lee Radziwill. Just ask Jackie . Kennedy. And if you don’t believe me, ask Bobby and John-John Kennedy. Nobody . can resist me. Everyone who has gone to bed with me has fallen in love with . me,’ he added. The book details the lives of playwright Tennessee . Williams and two of Jackie’s closest friends, authors Truman Capote and Gore . Vidal. Robert Kennedy pictured with the dancer (left) and with Jackie Kennedy (right) with whom he allegedly had an affair . Capote told Porter at a 1977 dinner in Key West, Florida, . that Jackie and her sister Lee Radziwill both competed for Nureyev’s . affections. ‘I think Rudi systematically plans to seduce every member . of my family, even my son when he grows up,’ the book says Jackie confessed to . Capote. Capote was also said to be shocked to learn about . Nureyev’s affair with Bobby Kennedy, whom the writer had long suspected of . being a deeply closeted homosexual,’ says Globe. An outraged Jackie only ended the relationship when she . saw the dancer paying too much attention to her son, JFK Jr., writes Porter. He . says she clashed with Nureyev in 1993 when she learned he was encouraging her . son to become an actor rather than go into politics as his family wanted. A second ballet dancer, American John Kriza, was also . linked to Jackie, according to the book. All in the family: A new book claims that not only did Jackie and Bobby have romantic affairs with Nureyev, but so did her sister Lee Radziwell (seen with Nureyev in 1987) ‘Each of us launched an affair with him,’ writer Gore . Vidal is quoted as saying. ‘Jackie using my apartment when I did not have John . otherwise engaged.’ Although Jackie played the part of the picture-perfect . wife during the marriage, she did spend some time apart from her husband. At a low point in their marriage, she escaped from the . pressure cooker life in D.C. on an Italian cruise in 1962 with Fiat’s . millionaire kingpin Gianni Agnelli and then sailed the Aegean Sea with . Aristotle Onassis on his yacht, the Christina, the following year. Camelot's controversy: For decades, it was only former President John F. Kennedy's love affairs that were public . There were rumors of a close relationship with actor . William Holden, although it was never more than speculation. The new book claims Richard Nixon also tried to seduce . Jackie before the 1960 presidential election. ‘One afternoon, when Jack was making one of his endless . speeches, Nixon made a pass at me,’ Jackie revealed to Tennessee Williams, . writes Porter, who co-authored the book with Danforth Prince.","The Pink Triangle penned by Hollywood biographer Darwin Porter and independent publisher Danforth Prince comes out next month .

"As a self-confessed expert in ‘supermarket sociology’, David Cameron may have just been carrying out research for his theories on people’s shopping habits. But just days after being called ‘stuck up’ for preferring the type of people who shop in Waitrose, the  Prime Minister popped in to a branch of value chain Asda. Mr Cameron made a point of chatting with Ange on the fish counter, before meeting customers and hugging babies as he hailed the creation of 12,00 new jobs by the supermarket giant. David Cameron tweeted this picture of himself speaking to Ange on the fish counter of Asda in Clapham Junction, south London . In the tradition of politicians on a walkabout, the Prime Minister found a baby to hug, 11-month-old Luca who was hopping with mum  Tara Leniston . Mr Cameron, pictured talking to Tara Leniston and her son Luca, wanted to promote tax changes which he says will help workers and businesses . Last week Mr Cameron made a brave intervention into the politics of the weekly shop, claiming there was ‘something about’ Waitrose customers who are more ‘engaged people’. Labour accused the PM of making a ‘bizarre and empty-headed intervention’ at a time when many families were struggling to make ends meet. In an apparent attempt to prove he is just as comfortable at the budget end of the market, Mr Cameron toured an Asda store in Clapham Junction, London today. Admiring the fish counter, he tweeted a picture of himself ‘talking to Ange at Asda, a company announcing 12,000 new jobs and helping show our Long Term Economic Plan is working’. He also toured the meat section and had a cup of coffee with some Asda staff in the store café. Mr Cameron posed for photos with Luca, as Asda staff and customers looked on . This was the picture Tara Leniston took of her son Luca with Prime Mr Cameron . In the tradition of politicians meeting ordinary members of the public, Mr Cameron also took time to hug a baby – 11-month-old Luca who was shopping with mum Tara Leniston. Mr Cameron did not seem to struggle striking up conversation, despite his theory that people in other supermarkets usually ignore him. Speaking last week, Mr Cameron said: ‘I have got a piece of supermarket sociology, which is that there is something about Waitrose customers ... they are the most talkative. ‘I found that if I shop in Waitrose it takes me about twice as long as everyone wants to stop you and have a chat. Whereas in other supermarkets I find I can dart round very quickly and get everything. ‘It is something about your customers, they are very talkative, engaged people.' Mr Cameron revealed that he shops at Waitrose - regarded as a favourite of the middle classes - whenever possible. Mr Cameron said he was 'delighted' that Asda is continuing to invest heavily in the UK . After claiming the people in Waitrose were more talkative and engaging, Mr Cameron was keen to show that staff in Asda were chatty too . On the up: Mr Cameron was in the store to promote the news that Asda is to create 12,000 new jobs over the next five years . But today he was in Asda to promote the firm’s announcement  that it is to create 12,000 jobs in the UK over the next five years. Mr Cameron said: ‘Supporting business, creating jobs and cutting taxes are all part of our long-term economic plan. ‘Yesterday, our tax reforms cut income tax for 26million people and will help businesses to create jobs. ‘I am delighted that Asda is continuing to invest heavily in the UK, creating another 12,000 jobs that will give people financial security for the future.’","Prime Minister revealed he has a theory about 'supermarket sociology'

"Jack Bernardo spent more than two decades serving his country in the marines and only wanted to come home, but when he finally returned to the fixer-upper he bought in January he discovered something so shocking that he broke down in tears. His friends had taken the house and given it a complete make-over, giving Bernardo the dream home he always wanted. 'He's . a pretty emotional guy, so he's...

'At first I was like are you sure you guys want this house,' she said. Bernardo had asked Epperson to watch the property in their absence.

"A leading scientist has said that life may still exist on Mars, despite Curiosity Rover’s inability to find methane gas on the planet’s surface. The president of the Mars Society, Robert Zubrin, told CNET that methane- a gas produced by living things- may still exist because the rover has only analysed a relatively small area of the red planet. Last week, Nasa said that it was unlikely that microbes capable of producing the gas were living below the planet's surface after Curiosity failed to find the gas. Scroll down for video... The president of the Mars Society, Robert Zubrin, has said that methane- a gas produced by living things- may still exist because the Curiosity rover (pictured) has only analysed a relatively small area of the red planet . But Mr Zubrin criticised Nasa’s lack of direction claiming that the space agency ‘doesn’t have a goal’. The criticism follows a discussion of Curiosity Rover’s findings presented at the European Planetary Science in London earlier this month. The conference highlighted some of Curiosity’s most brilliant finds before the rover began its journey to Mount Sharp in July. Data collected by the Curiosity rover at this time suggested the red planet's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than Earth, giving serious weight to the theory it could have previously harboured alien life. In July, data collected by the Curiosity rover suggested the red planet's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than Earth . A team of Nasa scientists said that a change in the ratio of two different kinds of argon gas was evidence that the atmosphere has been stripped away. Nasa's Dr Chris Webster said: 'As Mars became a planet and its magma ocean solidified, catastrophic outgassing occurred while volatiles were delivered by impact of comets and other smaller bodies. 'Solar wind, and the possible impact by a Pluto-sized body is thought to have stripped much of the initial early atmosphere from the planet, and since then the atmosphere has developed as a balance between volcanic injection and loss to space.' Only a month earlier, powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars was found by the ageing vehicle. Evidence of water on Mars had previously been indicated by a succession of discoveries- but all had suggested flows of sulphuric acid. This was the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable. Scientists also discovered pebbles on Mars, showing that a stream had flowed on the planet. The rounded pebbles could only have formed when they were carried through water over long distances, according to researchers. Scientists had previously discovered pebbles on Mars, showing that a stream has flowed on the planet - giving more weight to the theory that it was once able to support life . In April, the $2.5 billion rover found evidence that as much as 90 per cent of the original atmosphere there had dissipated into space over the planet's lifetime. Curiosity also revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds. The conference focused heavily on a the Tintina pebble crushed under the Curiosity Mars rover's wheels which split open to reveal a dazzling white interior - a sign that it contained hydrated minerals, formed when water flowed through it. Curiosity is now on a long journey to Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles into the Martian sky from Gale Crater's center. The rover will take monthly readings of the Martian atmosphere during the road trip, expected to last almost a year . 'Curiosity rover can do all kinds of things. It could find fossils. It has imaging capability, a telescope for microorganisms,' said Mr Zubrin in his interview with CNET. 'Maybe a puff of methane will come and it will be detected later. There's lot for Curiosity to look for.'","Curiosity rover has found no sign of methane, which is produced by life .

"A grandfather with no flying experience managed to land a light aircraft after the pilot collapsed at the controls. With his friend dying beside him, John Wildey, 77, flew solo for 70 minutes as he was talked down by an instructor. They told him to ignore most of the plane’s instruments and concentrate on using the joystick to keep its nose up. An RAF helicopter acted as an escort.After three abortive attempts, Mr Wildey made an ‘almost perfect’ landing in semi-darkness – and bashfully denied being a hero, saying his actions were ‘nothing really – I was just holding the joystick’. The pilot was taken to hospital but died later. Scroll down for video . The drama occurred after Mr Wildey – who served as a clerk in the RAF for 24 years but had never piloted a plane – and his friend had spent the day flying, as they had done many times before. They took off from Sandtoft Airfield, between Scunthorpe and Doncaster, in glorious sunshine on Tuesday morning and flew the Cessna 172 Skyhawk to Skegness, on the Lincolnshire coast, with a stop at a small airfield for lunch. They were due to return to Sandtoft shortly before 7pm. But at about 6.15pm, the pilot – whose name has not been released – fell seriously ill and began drifting in and out of consciousness. ‘He said he was sick and asked me to take care of the aircraft controls,’ Mr Wildey said. ‘He set the controls and put me on the right path. Then he was unwell again, completely unresponsive. I called his name but he didn’t answer. I said we were going to have to land soon but when he didn’t respond.’ Modest: John Wildey back on the ground yesterday (left) after landing the  plane safely at Humberside Airport. Mr Wildey is pictured (right) as a clerk in the RAF in 1968 . Touchdown: the  Cessna 172 Skyhawk, with which Mr Wildey made an 'almost perfect' landing in semi-darkness despite having never piloted a plane before . The Cessna 172 has dual controls, so Mr Wildey steadied the aircraft to the best of his abilities. He was wearing a headset linked to the plane’s radio and raised the alarm. ‘I called “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” but forgot to give the registration of the plane,’ he said. ‘I said, “I’ve got no flying experience and the pilot isn’t very well”. I said he couldn’t control the aircraft. I said that I thought I was heading to Sandtoft. They said they were still trying to sort out what they could do for me. ‘They asked if I could circle round Sandtoft. I said I would try my best. I circled around Sandtoft a few times. The pilot was still conscious but clearly incapable of flying the plane. ‘I kept knocking him to try to get him to do something because I hadn’t a clue how to get down,’ Mr Wildey said. He had watched his friend bank, climb and descend using the steering column, and had a notion of what some of the baffling array of dials and instruments in front of him did. 'Remarkable job': Mr Wildey was forced to make an emergency landing at Humberside Airport, north Lincolnshire (pictured), after his friend the pilot was taken ill . Ground control: Flying instructor Roy Murray, who gave Mr Wildey step by . step instructions over the radio, is pictured in the cockpit of the . plane . He was put through to the tower at . Humberside International Airport, which has a longer landing strip and . full emergency services, and told to await instructions. Flights to and from Humberside were suspended or diverted as the runway was cleared for an emergency landing. A Sea King helicopter was scrambled from RAF Leconfield in East Yorkshire to fly alongside the Cessna to guide Mr Wildey on the 25-mile flight. Roy Murray, chief instructor at the airport’s Frank Morgan Flying School was called at his home in the Waltham, Lincolnshire. Route: Mr Wildey flew the Cessna from Sandtoft Airfield before touching down at Humberside Airport, in north Lincolnshire . He was told that a pilot had passed out and a passenger with no flying experience would need to be talked down. Fifteen minutes later, Mr Murray pulled up at the airport’s air traffic control tower and was taken straight to the radar room. ‘The . atmosphere was all calm, nobody was panicking and it was all very . professional,’ he said. He spoke to Mr Wildey, who was calm despite his . predicament. ‘I told him to keep calm and not to over-control the aircraft,’ he said. Mr Murray decided that the best option available was to guide Mr Wildey in with a ‘blind landing’, in which he was told to ignore the bulk of the instruments, and use just three main controls: the throttle to lower the plane, the steering column to keep its nose up – and the brakes to slow the plane down if and when he touched down successfully. ‘All cockpits and controls are different and I didn’t want John looking around and panicking. It was tense at times, especially the last mile or so, as he was talked in.’ At around 7pm, as it was getting dark, Mr Wildey, who had been following the Sea King helicopter, came into view of the control tower. Because the Cessna had been flying during the day he had no lights on outside or inside the cockpit. All Mr Murray could see was the outline of the plane against an darkening sky. As he explained how the plane worked and how Mr Wildey should land it, he stressed the need to keep the nose up when touching down to avoid smashing off the front landing wheel. In a calm voice, he went on to impress on the novice pilot the need to steer the vehicle when braking, in case it veered off to one side and struck a landing light. ‘If he had hit one the landing lights there could be a fuel leak with the risk of fire,’ Mr Murray said. ‘Thankfully, he was doing what I was telling him to do.’ On three nerve-racking occasions Mr Wildey tried to touch down, before pulling back on the steering column to lift the plane up again, increasing the throttle to avoid stalling and swinging round to make another attempt. A Sea King helicopter was scrambled from RAF Leconfield in East . Yorkshire to fly alongside the Cessna to guide Mr Wildey on the 25-mile . flight (file picture) Mayday: Moments before the pilot fell unconscious, a mayday call was sent and the emergency response was declared on the ground. Pictured is Humberside Airport . Each ‘go round’ was a terrifying . experience for pilot and those on the ground. Mr Wildey said: ‘I could . see the runway lights. They said, “bring her down gently, take the . throttle back.” And I was doing that and it seemed to be all right but . then they said I was going too low, power up and go, so I powered up and . went round again.’ The . airstrip is one and three-quarter miles long and, if everything went to . plan, he was due to land at a speed of about 80 to 90mph. The runway length, Mr Murray thought, should give Mr Wildey plenty of time to brake. Guardian angel: Air Traffic Control Manager Debbie Zost, who along with Flight instructor Roy Murray, helped Mr Wildey land . On . the fourth attempt, he was given the go-ahead but it was still far from . plain-sailing, Mr Wildey said. ‘I know you bring back the controls but I . didn’t bring them back hard enough. So really I was sort of nose down . rather than anything else,’ the father of three said yesterday. ‘Then we touched and there was a right bump – two or three bumps. I suppose it was a controlled crash really. ‘But I just couldn’t get the brakes because I couldn’t reach them. I managed to get them in the end. ‘But then we sort of went off the runway and all I could see was this runway indicator wall coming towards me and I thought: “I am not going to do it”. But we managed to stop in the end.’ Experts said the landing, at 7.30pm, was ‘almost perfect’. Stuart Sykes, who saw the aircraft land, said: ‘It came down with a bump, a bump, a bump, hit the front end down, I heard some crashing and it’s come to a halt.’ Others said they saw sparks as it touched down. Mr Murray said: ‘The emergency services were there immediately and may have turned off the engine. When he landed, we all sort of shook hands and said “Thank God for that”.’ Miraculously, Mr Wildey emerged from the aircraft shaken but uninjured. An ambulance took the dying pilot to hospital. Mr Murray said: ‘I’m satisfied but sad. There was a death involved. But, I’m satisfied because it could have been a lot worse. ‘But, I can say that I wouldn’t be frightened to fly with John. He was very calm and in control.’ Mr Wildey was described yesterday as a ‘hero’ for having kept his nerve during the traumatic incident. But speaking from his home in Rossington, South Yorkshire, he played down his role as ‘nothing really’. He was simply the man holding the control stick, he said. Mr Wildey told his local BBC television station: ‘Air traffic control at Humberside, two flying instructors, and also a Sea King helicopter were all helping. ‘They all did their best, I was just the person holding the stick. They were telling me what to do but because I didn’t have any lights on I could barely see any of the sticks, which made it even more difficult.’","John Wildey, 77, took control of the Cessna 172 Skyhawk light aircraft after his friend became ill .

"Nostalgic fans of the 1970s video game Pong will recall playing it in a video arcade or perhaps on a Sega Mega Drive. Now the classic Atari game has been beamed into the 21st century - and straight onto the walls of a 29-storey skyscraper. A group of computer scientists commandeered programmable LED lights lining the side of a 437ft office building to stage the world's biggest video game in Philadelphia. Scroll down for video . World's largest video game: Scientists commandeered LED lights on this Philadelphia building to play a giant version of Pong . 'Cultural milestone': The version of the classic 1970s Atari game that fans will be most familiar with . More than 100 people gathered close . to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to watch the fully interactive game of . Pong - with 'bats' spanning nine storeys and a 20ft 'ball' - unfold on the side of the Circa Centre on the other side of the . Schuylkill River on Friday. Drexel . University professor Frank Lee and his team transformed the lights - . which typically display static images or looping patterns - into a game . of Pong in the space of a few months, according to a report on arstechnica.com. Mr . Lee and his team devised a way of hack the system controlling the LED . lights - each of which can be lit or unlit in a variety of colours - . turning it from something designed to display static images to something . interactive. The Circa Centre lights, each of which has its own internet Protocol (IP) address, are controlled by a system from Philips. The . computer scientist explained how he and his team managed to determine . the commands being fed to the lights, in order to interactively turn . them on and off. One of the scientists created a script capable of . analysing a file containing the IP addresses of all of the lights, and . mapping out a virtual image of what the lights on the building were . displaying at that time. Mr . Lee and the rest of the team used this structure to write software that . interfaces with the programme controlling the Circa Centre lights.

Taking in the view: A crowd gathered to watch as the game played out on the office building across the river in Philadelphia . The scientist and gaming buff first came up with the idea in 2008, when the patterns of light on the Circa Centre one night reminded him of another classic video game; Tetris. 'Every other night I would just pass by... but this night I saw Tetris shapes forming in my mind's eye, falling down, and that began this long journey to try to make this game possible,' Mr Lee said. Inspiration: Drexel University professor Frank Lee first came up with the idea for the giant game of Pong back in 2008 . Code: He and his team wrote the software that interfaces with the programme controlling the Circa Centre lights - making the system interactive . The professor told his idea was initially 'shot down' by the owners of the building, the Brandywine Realty Trust, who questioned whether anyone would be interested in a giant version of an outdated video game. But after enlisting the support of Philly Tech Week - an event showcasing the city's technology scene - Mr Lee managed to secure a meeting with trust CEO Gerard Sweeney, who was immediately on board. 'Little kids know Pong, grandmothers and grandfathers know Pong, and so on,' said Mr Lee. 'It is part of our cultural fabric, because it was the first successful commercial video game that launched the multi-billion dollar industry that we have now.'

"Under fire: Bashir has been criticised for poking fun at the NRA prayer event . British TV presenter Martin Bashir has come under fire in the US after he took aim at gun-owning churchgoers on his talk show. Bashir mocked members of America’s National Rifle Association over their plans to attend a religious gathering after their national convention wraps up Sunday in Houston, Texas. ‘There is also a prayer breakfast at this weekend’s conference,’ Bashir said on his MSNBC cable programme, ‘presumably to include the NRA’s version of the Lord’ s Prayer: ‘Thy kingdom come, help me keep my military-style gun’; ‘Give us this day our daily dead’; and other various phrases like that.’ Bashir, 50, is best known for his interviews with Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, but started out working for the BBC’s ‘Songs of Praise’ and identifies himself as a committed Christian. He said he was worried that other Christians aren’t more concerned about the gun rights movement. ‘This is not a freak organization,’ he said. ‘There are large numbers who will be hearing this [prayer breakfast]. Yet they spew this kind of venom about an issue that is as saddening and shockingly disturbing for us all, after what happened in Newtown and all the other massacres that we reflect on.’ But Bashir’s comments provoked fury among the gun lobby. Dr. Bob Reccord, a family-values political leader who once oversaw more than 5,000 evangelical missionaries for the Southern Baptist Convention, will be the prayer breakfast's keynote speaker on Sunday morning . ‘I wish someone would slap some sense . into that idiot,’ said a Dallas native named Bob who said he was . attending the NRA convention for the first time. ‘Nothing gets me more worked up than self-righteous religious people who think they have all the answers. 'I go to church every Sunday, and I’ll be at the prayer breakfast,’ he added. Charlotte, a middle-aged mother of two who flew from Nebraska, claimed Bashir was ‘the kind of Brit we should deport before Obama pushes his immigration legislation through.’ Convention-goer Janet Bero waited in line to have her German Luger pistol appraised by hosts of the NRA's Antiques Guns and Gold Showcase, an Antiques Roadshow-like television program focuses largely on firearms .

"GPs have been paid bonuses to put elderly patients on controversial ‘death lists’ in an attempt to save the NHS money by cutting the number of people who die in hospital. They have been given £50 a time to draw up ‘end-of-life advanced care plans’ for patients they predict will pass away within a year. The payments are designed to encourage doctors to start talking about death with elderly and seriously ill patients and to keep a record of where, ideally, they would like to die. Those behind the ‘yellow folder’ scheme – so named as that is where the care plan forms are kept – insist its main aim is to give patients a  better death. But critics say it was designed to save money and could result in  people being denied treatment or help. According to documents seen by The Mail on Sunday, a ‘key objective’ of the project, trialled in eastern England, has been ‘to shift the place of death’ away from hospitals so ‘reducing .  .  . healthcare costs’. Every death that takes place outside of hospital saves the NHS almost £1,000, official calculations show. Average hospital deaths in England costs the NHS £3,065 but those elsewhere cost only £2,107. Our latest report comes three months after The Mail on Sunday revealed ambulance crews can refuse to take extremely ill people to hospital if they have stated on their care plan they want to die  at home. Dr Gillian Craig, a retired geriatrician, questioned why GPs were being offered an extra payment for having a difficult conversation. GPs have been paid bonuses to put elderly patients on controversial 'death lists' in an attempt to save the NHS money by cutting the number of people who die in hospital. Picture posed by models . ‘Why should a GP be paid for this conversation, as opposed to any other?’ she said. ‘I feel doctors are paid very well and there should be no extra payments. Anything else is open to abuse and misuse.’ She also feared that patients signing up to die in their own home may unwittingly be ‘closing the door on potentially life-saving hospital treatment’. She explained: ‘A doctor may not realise that, while the person appears to be dying, they actually have a reversible condition.’ The GP bonus scheme rewarded doctors at 41 practices in Ipswich and East Suffolk, who were paid £50 for each care home patient they signed up to an end-of-life plan. Patients were asked to stipulate where they would like to die, whether they wished to be resuscitated, and what drugs they wanted in their final hours. Ambulance services and out-of-hours doctors’ services were informed. The family doctors were also asked to sign up elderly people living in their own homes, although they were not paid the £50 bonus in these cases. The ‘pilot’ project ran for two years from July 2011 to this September and was deemed ‘successful’. Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which ran the scheme, has refused to say how much was paid out in total. Stated benefits of the scheme include improving the quality of end-of-life care – but also ‘reducing emergency admissions, length of stay, use of unnecessary treatments and healthcare costs’. Scandal of ambulance drivers being told: Do not take 'death list' patients to hospital. The Mail on Sunday report in July . Surveys show that 66 per cent of people would like to end their lives at home, but only 43 per cent do so as most are admitted to hospital. Dr Anthony Cole, acting chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, said: ‘I think it’s got everything to do with money, with the cost of a hospital bed being £200 a day.’ He added there was ‘a real danger’ patients might not realise the choice could lead to them not having medical support in their final days. A CCG spokesman said: ‘The  purpose of the scheme is to improve end-of-life care, not save money. Any reductions in hospital expenditure are likely to be balanced by alternative community-based services. ‘The £50 payment to GPs was part of a two-year pilot to raise the profile of the scheme among staff. The reimbursement reflects the time spent by GPs with a patient and their family to achieve a dignified death.’ Health bosses have been forced into publicising a ‘big brother’ database of medical records, after The Mail on Sunday highlighted serious concerns over the plan. Millions of medical notes are to be uploaded from GP surgeries to a national computer database . under the scheme, which Ministers hope will attract drug firms to the UK to help with their research.Health bosses insisted it was not necessary to inform the public directly. Instead, they would rely on doctors telling patients or putting up posters in surgery waiting rooms. But in a climbdown, NHS England will now spend £1.2 million on mailshots to every home in England after MPs criticised the scheme as an ‘enormous threat’. NHS England insists patient information will always be anonymised before being shared with third parties, such as universities and private companies. It says the project will provide a valuable tool for medical research, monitoring flu outbreaks and screening for common diseases. But campaigners fear ‘identifiable’ data will be released to the wider NHS and even private firms such as Bupa. Your confidential medical records for sale...at just £1. The Mail on Sunday headline in August . In August, privacy campaigners told this paper there were ‘huge risks’ with putting so much patient information into so many hands. Last month, we revealed how GPs across the country were threatening to boycott the ‘care.data’ scheme, in part because patients were not being told data would automatically be shared unless they objected. And two weeks ago prominent Tories raised concerns, with MP David Davis describing the scheme as a ‘honeypot of data’ to hackers that was ‘an enormous threat to privacy and patient trust’. Now, NHS England has bowed to pressure and agreed to send leaflets to all of England’s 22 million homes, while it is also setting up  an £800,000 information line in January. Patients will then have four weeks to tell their GP surgery if they want to opt out – meaning the actual ‘data extract’ has been delayed from this autumn to next spring. An NHS England spokeswoman denied it had made a U-turn. ‘We never said there was no need for a national campaign,’ she said.","GPs paid to draw up 'end-of-life advanced care plans'

"Unsafe devices are often made in China for as little as 3p . On first examination the small white plug that arrived in bubble wrap in the post appeared perfectly innocuous. Hundreds of thousands of devices much like it are currently plugged into sockets in offices, children’s bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens around the country, powering up mobile phones — of which 30 million are sold in the UK each year. But the bang that resounded, with a puff of black smoke, moments after new mother Katie Vines plugged this device into her bedroom wall was anything but harmless. So powerful was the explosion, that the charger actually split in two and left a large, sooty circle around the socket. This wasn’t a one-off, however: it would go on to happen a second time with an identical device. The thought of what could have been still makes care assistant Katie, who lives in Bristol with partner Chris Smitherman and their 19-month-old daughter Aimee, shudder. The incident, last November, has taken on a chilling significance since it emerged that a fire which claimed victims from three generations of one family last month, including a nine-week-old baby, was probably caused by a faulty charger. The blaze started in the living room and swept through the terrace home in Sheffield overnight on April 28, killing brothers Adyan Parwaiz Kayani, nine, and Amaan Parwaiz Kayani, seven, their baby sister Minahil, aunt Anum Parwaiz, 20, and grandmother Shabina Begum, 53. Such was the extent of the damage that it may be many weeks before fire investigators are able to confirm what caused the blaze, or even what type of charger was in use. But a spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said that ‘the most probable cause’ of  the fatal fire was an ‘electrical fault involving a faulty charging device’. The tragedy highlights growing concerns about the dangers that may be hidden behind the casing of the ubiquitous charger in the wall. While the chargers which are supplied with branded electronic goods are made to the highest standard and are no cause for concern, it’s cheap, unauthorised, ‘unbranded’ chargers — the type usually bought on the internet, from market stalls or abroad, rather than from reputable shops and suppliers — that can be hazardous. According to the charity Electrical Safety First, many of the cheap devices it tests fail to meet the requirements of the Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations Act 1994. Product safety manager Steve Curtler warns: ‘It’s driven by demand. People want multiple chargers to keep their lives going, one for home, one to take on holiday . . .  When you can see one for £5 it seems worth taking the risk — at least that’s how it seems at the time.’ Unsafe devices are often made in China for as little as 3p. Victims: Adyan Parwaiz Kayani (left) and his brother Amaan, seven (right) died in their home in Sheffield . There have even been allegations that manufacturers may submit well-engineered products for testing, only to remove non-essential components to reduce costs — thereby increasing the risk of disastrous malfunctions. With an estimated 1.8 million mains mobile phone chargers bought online in the UK each year, safety experts are concerned that thousands of lives are being put at risk. The evidence speaks for itself: last year, air stewardess Ma Ailun, 23, was electrocuted at home in China when she answered her iPhone while it was charging. In 2007, seven-year-old Connor O’Keefe, from South-East London, died playing with his Game Boy — he had been using a cheap, unbranded charger his family had bought on holiday in Thailand. He was electrocuted and found dead in his hotel room. Tests revealed the charger had ‘serious defects’. His mother, Patsy, said: ‘Until this happened to me, I would never have thought twice about buying a charger online. But you don’t have to go to a foreign country to get a dodgy plug, you can get them here, or get them sent here.’ what to watch out for graphic.jpg . Indeed you can. While mains plugs for the iPhone cost £15 from the Apple store, add in a USB cable and you’re looking at another £15. More generic USB mains chargers at Carphone Warehouse sell for £17.99 and Nokia small-pin chargers are £14.99. But venture online and there are all manner of deals to be found. An iPhone 5 mains adaptor can be picked up for as little as £3.69. For less than £5 you can also add an in-car charger. The same goes for devices which are compatible with Samsung, BlackBerry and Nokia phones. It was this price discrepancy that drove Katie Vines, 33, to buy a cheap charger online last year. Her branded iPhone charger had broken and she wanted to buy a replacement. ‘Aimee was only about three months old and I was on maternity leave, so we didn’t have a great deal of income,’ she says. ‘The branded products were quite expensive, so I decided to look online and found a charger being sold for about £4. The seller had good ratings and seemed to be in the UK, so I decided to buy it.’ 'People think it's worth the risk to buy a £5 charger' When the charger arrived, it looked entirely safe. Katie thought nothing of popping it into her bedroom wall, a few feet from her daughter’s cot, attaching her phone, and walking into the bathroom, leaving partner Chris changing their baby’s nappy. ‘I’d only just got to the bathroom when I heard a huge bang and ran back into the bedroom,’ says Katie. ‘The charger had exploded and was practically fused to the wall.’ Putting the experience down to bad luck, Katie contacted the seller, who apologised and dispatched a replacement charger. She was stunned when exactly the same thing happened. This time, it was in her living room wall and the plug itself blew apart. ‘I was naive buying something off the internet because it was cheap. I thought if it had happened once, it wouldn’t happen again. But the damage could have been so much worse. ‘As soon as I heard about the house fire in Sheffield I thought: “That could have been us.” When I think that Aimee’s cot was near the socket I used, it makes me sick.’ The Mail found multiple reports from around the country of house fires being attributed to an issue with a mobile phone battery or charging device in the past month alone. Only days ago, mother-of-two Julie Swift, of Bearsted, in Kent, was woken by a flash and a ‘bang’ from her mobile. She had been charging it with a cheap plug purchased online while she lay sleeping in bed. With an estimated 1.8¿million mains mobile phone chargers bought online in the UK each year, safety experts are concerned that thousands of lives are being put at risk . While the explosion tripped all the electrics in the house, fortunately it caused no damage.‘I still charge my phone overnight now, but only with an official Apple charger and not near my head,’ says Julie, 48. ‘I feel very lucky that  this happened to me and not to my 12-year-old daughter.’ Fire chiefs confirm that the problem is growing. Meanwhile, European rules governing reduction of electrical waste have seen many manufacturers now selling new phones with only a USB cable, which are used to charge via your computer, and no traditional wall plug. This, say experts, will only make people seek out cheap plug-in alternatives all the more. Last year, it emerged that the UK had seen a six-fold increase in the number of counterfeit electrical goods seized over the previous four years. And the value of such goods seized by councils and the Border Force rose from just over £2.6 million in 2009 to more than £15.7 million in 2012. The most-seized items were chargers. Some 67,000 potentially dangerous mobile chargers were uncovered in a single raid by Trading Standards officers in Ealing, West London, last year. So what can go wrong to make a charger blow up? Unfortunately, most faults are not visible to the buyer, but instead involve the internal components. For example, the device may lack a suitable fuse to ensure that if something else on the phone fails, such as the battery, it safely contains any power surge or explosion. Steve Curtler says dodgy devices often lack this. This means that if the charger overheats, pressure will build, blowing the charger apart, creating a risk of fire and electric shock. Cheaper products are often found to have pins that are too small or incorrectly placed. If they are the wrong size, they can damage the socket and lead to overheating. Even without a naked flame, a charger can ignite under extreme heat, which is why fire safety experts stress that chargers should never be covered. By law, pins must be 9.5mm away from the edge of the charger body. If the distance is less — as it was with nine out of ten chargers in a recent sample test — there is a very real risk of electric shock from skin contact. As a consumer you might like to think that a CE mark — a declaration by the manufacturer that the product meets requirements of European law — means your product is safe. Sadly, this can be all too easily faked. And many mobile phone users leave their devices charging overnight. Is this safe? While Apple insists its devices are designed so ‘you can keep your device plugged in as long as you would like’, Steve Curtler still advises caution. ‘It does extend the risk unnecessarily. And the risk is exacerbated by using a cheap, unbranded charger. And when you are asleep you are less alert and less able to react.’ He says if you must leave your phone charging overnight, make sure you have a working smoke detector. Similarly you should switch your power off at the wall if you leave your charger plugged in when not in use. Simple tips — but as Katie Vines knows only too well, they could  be life-saving.","Many cheap devices fail to meet requirements of the Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations Act 1994 .

"It is feared a deadly drug known as 'cannibal heroin' which eats flesh from the inside out is about to take off in the United States. Krokodil, which is similar to heroin and originated in Russia 10 years ago, turns users into zombies as their bodies begin to rot leaving addicts with reptilian skin. Following reports over the past month of cases of krokodil abuse in both Arizona and Chicago, Illinois, the drug is now believed to have hit New York. Other victim: The drug was first found in Russia where many- including blind victim Margarita Schelkunova, pictured- came forward after receiving treatment for the drug in Siberia after using it for seven years . The homemade concoction can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline or oil. The drug is made of readily available ingredients such as codeine, iodine and toxins such as gasoline, industrial cleaning oil, lighter fluid and paint thinner. Users filter and boil ingredients together, then inject the drug. The results are catastrophic. Continual use of krokodil, Russian for crocodile, causes blood vessels to burst, leaving skin green and scaly and eventually causing gangrene. In Russia around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year. It is thought about a quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison. Within 30 minutes the substance can be cooked up before it is injected into the user's veins . Addiction is spreading among young people and even those who manage to quit come away disfigured for life. Margarita Schelkunova, 28, and her husband became hooked on the drug seven years ago. Even though Schelkunova is now clean, she has lost her sight and has been diagnosed with cancer and HIV. She has only weeks to live. Her husband died at the age of 27. Drug addict Tanya started using Krokodil after a boyfriend got her hooked on heroin . Irina Dyadyuchenko, 35, has survived being a krokodil addict and has now been clean for two years. She began using heroin at the age of 14 and when her local drug dealers were jailed she turned to homemade krokodil to get her fix. Irina, who is the daughter of an engineer and a teacher, said when the recipe landed in Russia, she realized she could make it herself with for a fraction of the cost of her heroin addiction. Krokodil could already be hitting the U.S. even as authorities battle huge numbers of people using homemade crystal meth. Devastating: Margarita Schelkunova is now clean but she has been left blind and has cancer and HIV . A British doctor believes he may have came across a case in the UK. Dr Allan Harris, a GP in Gloucester, wrote in an article for The Independent that the man was homeless and in his 30s. 'There was essentially a crater in his arm and you could see the bone and tendons,' he wrote. Maria Fadeeva (left) a recovered Krokodil user who cared for Irina Dyadyuchenko who has been clean for two years . 'It is hugely addictive and potent and can be cooked up in 30 minutes. It's only a matter of time before we start seeing it in Britain. It is not a case of 'if' but 'when'. Fears that the drug could head to the United States have been rife since 2011, when a Drug Enforcement Administration official said the agency was aware of its use overseas. But even with a drug treatment physician publicly announcing that medics have now treated four users within the U.S., the DEA has said it is not ready to recognize it as an immediate threat. Agency spokeswoman Dawn Dearden told FoxNews.com: 'We, the DEA, are not seeing cases of it. Nothing’s been turned into any of our labs. As far as the DEA is concerned, we have not seen any cases.' Krokodil's medical name is desomorphine and it is created by mixing codeine with gasoline, paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine and red phosphorous. There are millions of users in Russia and the epidemic began in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The drug causes flesh to rot from the inside out and the addict's skin becomes scaly, like a crocodile's, hence the name. Blood vessels burst and the surrounding tissue dies. Gangrene and amputations are a common result and sometimes bone can be exposed. The high lasts for about an hour-and-a-half and the drug can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin.","Krokodil is similar to heroin and originated in Russia 10 years ago .

"Suicide: An autopsy report has confirmed that director Tony Scott killed himself in August . At least five female motorists reported seeing director Tony Scott leap to his death from a Southern California bridge in mid-August, according to 911 tapes released on Tuesday. The 68-year-old filmmaker behind movies like Top Gun and Crimson Tide committed suicide by jumping off Vincent Thomas Bridge linking the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach in broad daylight on August 19 in full view of boaters and passing drivers. ‘We are just on the Vincent Thomas Bridge and there’s a guy that looks like he’s just about to jump off … he’s jumped, he’s jumped, [off] the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro!’ said one 911 caller heard in a recording posted on TMZ.com. Another witness reported the fatal . leap to 911 operators, and was then transferred to a fire dispatcher. During the transfer, she could be heard gasping: ‘Oh my God.’ The caller said: ‘He was a bald white guy. Oh my gosh, he just jumped off the bridge. We actually witnessed the whole thing.’ Motorists driving over the bridge . reported seeing a black Toyota Prius, lights still flashing, parked on . the side, as an older white male climbed a pole before leaping more than . 185 feet into the water. Scott had been preparing to do a sequel to his 1986 Tom Cruise hit Top Gun. He and Cruise were spotted in Fallon, . Nevada — where the Navy’s Top Gun program had been based before moving . to San Diego — meeting with Navy officials, a week before the suicide. The mystery surrounding Scott's death . has deepened after his death certificate was released in late August - . listing his cause of death as 'deferred'. Disheveled: Scott was pictured looking pained as he dined out in Beverly Hills on July 23 . Instead of the expected verdict of . suicide, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health has decided to wait . for toxicology and other test results and said the death is 'pending . investigation'. The . certificate states that an autopsy has been performed, that the . 68-year-old died 'Under Vincent Thomas Bridge' - but also indicates that . a biopsy was not performed on the dead body. There has been no confirmation from . the Department of Public Health if the famed director of action films was suffering from cancer as some . reports indicated. In late August,the coroner's office said that Tony Scott left a suicide note . and several messages to loved ones before he jumped to his death, but . none of them shed light on why he killed himself. Coroner’s . officials also said that the notes didn’t mention any health problems, . after reports circulated that the 68-year-old may have been suffering . from cancer. Unclear: His death certificate initially failed to list a cause of death for the well-known director . Coroner's office spokesman Ed Winter . says one of the notes left in Scott's black Toyota Prius was a list of . emergency contact numbers and another found in his study included . messages to friends and loved ones. The note in the car listed names and . contact numbers - including that of his wife - so police could call his . friends to tell them of his death, TMZ reported. The mystery surrounding the suicide . deepened after the chairman of 20th Century Fox said that the director . was 'burning with excitement' over new projects just two weeks before . his suicide. It also emerged that just two days . before 68-year-old Scott leaped to his death he had been with Tom Cruise . discussing a sequel to their 1986 hit 'Top Gun'. The . pair toured the Fallon U.S Naval air station in Nevada, which is home . to the Naval Weapons Fighter School where the real life Top Gun pilots . complete their training. 'We had a meeting just two weeks ago . and he was burning with the excitement of creating stuff,' said Tom . Rothman, chairman of 20th Century Fox. Scott had more big-budget Hollywood . films lined up, but his death has left them in limbo, as well as . stunning his family and friends. Coroner's officers in Los Angeles . said that they were still trying to solve the suicide riffle after . Scott's wife Donna said U.S. reports that her husband had cancer were . 'absolutely false'. Brother: Ridley Scott is pictured here at his office in West Hollywood in the days following his brothers death . Friends of the director said that he . had no marriage or money problems and was focused on the 'Top Gun' sequel which was preparing to go into production early next year. Scott was also in pre-production on . an underwater drug-trafficking thriller 'Narco-Sub', another smuggling . drama 'Lucky Strike' and a remake of the 1969 western 'The Wild Bunch'. While celebrity website TMZ reported . that Scott's wife didn't know of any serious illness that may have been a . motive, it raised the possibility that the director of 'Crimson Tide' may have kept his illness secret. If not there must have been a . different reason behind his decision to leap from the Vincent Thomas . Bridge in Long Beach on Sunday afternoon. He left a contact list of people to . be informed about the tragedy in the Toyota Prius he abandoned before . climbing a fence and jumping into the Pacific. The 68-year-old director, best known . for Top Gun, was said to have leaped to his death 'without hesitation' in an effort to spare his family the pain of watching his slow death, . ABC News reported. But hours later, ABC backed away from that report and the Los Angeles Times confirmed that Scott's family told the corner's office Scott did not have cancer - or any major illness. 'The . family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer,' Craig Harvey, a chief at the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office told . the newspaper. TMZ were the first to report that Scott's wife Donna told authorities her husband was healthy, according to unnamed sources. Donna Scott told investigators that rumors . of a return of her husband's cancer was 'absolutely false', TMZ says. The . celebrity news site also claims the preliminary results of an autopsy . did not reveal the presence of cancer - though more tests are needed. It . is believed the autopsy report could take several weeks . Tragic: Los Angeles polie officers pulled the body of Tony Scott from the water beneath the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California . The denial of his brain cancer begs the question - what could have driven the successful director, whose . films have grossed more than $2 billion and who left behind a young family, to kill himself? Tony Scott's tragic death came just . weeks after he was pictured looking pained as he left a Beverly Hills . restaurant on July 23 - but friends denied he had problems in his . marriage to wife Donna. A source told the New York Post: 'He did have . cancer, and for a while he was cancer free. He didn’t have any money . problems or marriage problems.' The beloved filmmaker, who . directed movies including Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II and Enemy Of . The State and was the younger brother of director Ridley Scott,  fell within feet of a cruise boat around 12.30 p.m. on Sunday as horrified tourists watched. 'He landed right next to our tour boat, and many . of us saw the whole thing,' a witness, who had been on the cruise around the Los Angeles Harbour, told TMZ. According to the Contra Costa Times, Scott climbed a fence on the south side of the bridge, which spans San Pedro and Terminal Island, at 12.30 p.m. on Sunday and leaped off 'without hesitation'. A view of the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California from where Tony Scott jumped to his death . A witness, who was a passenger in a car driving along the bridge, said Scott looked nervous. 'He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet. He looked nervous,' David Silva told the Los Angeles Times. Silva thought he was a stuntman or taking part in an extreme sports event - until he realised there was no safety cord. He went on: '[He] paused a couple of seconds and then began . to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused . again. Then he threw himself off. I immediately thought, that guy is . dead.' Friends told the New York Post they were not surprised that the director chose to leap to his death as he was a thrill-seeker who loved scaling high mountains. Several people called 911 around . 12.35pm to report that someone had jumped off the bridge, according to Los Angeles police Lt. Tim . Nordquist. British-born Scott, who lived in Beverly Hills, was producer and director Ridley Scott's younger brother. Distinct visual styles mark both siblings' films - Ridley Scott mastering the creation of entire worlds with such films as Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien and this year's Prometheus, Tony Scott known for hyper-kinetic action and editing on such films as his most recent, the runaway train thriller Unstoppable, starring regular collaborator Denzel Washington. Tony was the first of the Scott brothers to enjoy blockbuster success with Top Gun, starring Tom Cruise, the top-grossing film of 1986 at $176 million. Scott teamed with Cruise again four years later on the hit Days of Thunder. He also had a sequel to Top Gun in development. But Ridley Scott later managed more and bigger hits than his brother and earned a level of critical respect never achieved by Tony Scott. Gladiator won the best-picture Academy Award for 2000 and earned Ridley Scott one of his three best-director nominations; Tony Scott never was in the running for an Oscar, and critics often slammed his movies for emphasizing style over substance. The two brothers ran Scott Free Productions and were working jointly on a film called Killing Lincoln, based on the best seller by Bill O'Reilly. Their company produced the CBS dramas NUMB3RS and The Good Wife as well as a 2011 documentary about the Battle of Gettysburg for the History Channel. Besides Unstoppable, Scott worked with Washington on four other movies: Crimson Tide, Man on Fire,  Deja Vu and The Taking of Pelham 123. Other Scott films include True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino, The Fan, with Robert De Niro, and Enemy of the State, starring Will Smith.","LA Department of Public Health have deferred listing the cause of death until after the toxicology results are back .

"The sister of OJ Simpson's murdered wife Nicole blasted the serial killer who claimed he carried out the slaying as a sick fame-seeker. Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing two women in 1995, is on death row in Florida. He reportedly confessed to the brutal stabbings of Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman. But Denise Brown told Mail Online: 'I don't know of Glen Rogers but from what I've heard he's not famous and wants to be. My thoughts are he should have come forward years ago if fame is what he's seeking.' 'Sick': Denise Brown, the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, said Glen Rogers' 'confession' is nothing more than a publicity stunt . 'I think it's the biggest bunch of crap I've heard in a while and I've heard a lot,' she added. Denise, who now gives lectures across the country to raise funds for women's shelters, was speaking after Ronald's father, Fred Goldman, also dismissed the so-called confession. He remains adamant that Simpson killed his son. The new theory about the infamous 1994 murders, floated by filmmakers for Investigation Discovery, marks only the second time an alternate suspect has been suggested. The nine-month trial of millionaire OJ Simpson, defended by some of the top attorneys in the nation, remains the most explosive court case in modern American history. Different suspect: Glen Rogers is on death row in Florida and has been linked to five other murders, but now he is thought to be the killer of Nicole Brown Simpson as well . Domestic life: Simpson was married to Nicole Brown for seven years; here, they're pictured at the opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe; Brown filed for divorce in 1992 . The acquittal of Simpson on the murder charges is still a deeply divisive topic. Investigation . Discovery, an offshoot of the Discovery Channel, reports that Rogers . boasted that he befriended Nicole shortly after he moved to Los Angeles . from Ohio. He is said to have bragged about partying with her and, more ominously, warning that she was rich and he was ‘going to take her down’. The New York Post reports that Rogers confessed to the crime years after he was already jailed for the murders of the two other women, even giving police a few receipts as evidence that he was in the area at the time of the double-homicide in June 1994. The documentary explains that the reason why Rogers’ name has never come up before is because Simpson was purposefully keeping his connection to Rogers under wraps. Rogers, who at one point boasted about having killed up to 70 women in a cross-country serial spree, alleges that Simpson hired him to break into his ex wife’s home to steal a pair of $20,000 earrings. Adding up: A new documentary bases the connection of Rogers to the Simpson case largely on his own confession . Timeline: Rogers said that he was hired by OJ to steal expensive earrings from Nicole's home and he gave him permission to kill 'that b****' if necessary . He also says that while the original intention of the partnership was to get the earrings, Simpson gave Rogers permission to kill ‘the b****’ if necessary. Fred Goldman has campaigned to keep his son Ron, 25, from being forgotten as only Nicole Brown Simpson's friend. He has not given any thought to the suggestion that someone other than OJ maybe have been responsible for the murders. 'OJ Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The criminal trial showed overwhelming and monumental evidence that OJ Simpson was the killer. There was no contrary evidence other than guess, innuendo, and rumor,' he told TMZ. Mr Goldman says he believes Investigation Discovery is playing up Rogers' alleged confession to boost the ratings of the show. The documentary does not feature Rogers himself, who is serving time on death row in Florida, but it comes close to home as it is based largely on interviews with his brother Clay who was the person to tip police off to Glen’s whereabouts. 'Gimmick': Fred Goldman, the father of murder victim Ron Goldman, says he still believes OJ killed his son . Murdered: Ron Goldman, 25, an aspiring actor, was found stabbed to death, along with Nicole Brown Simpsons . Glen allegedly told Clay about the . Brown-Goldman murder but he did not believe it. Later on, Glen spoke to a . criminal investigator and went through step-by-step details of how the . murder took place. Rogers is suspected of being a prolific murderer who used his charm and good looks to pick up women at bars. He is currently on death row in Florida for the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs in Tampa. He and Cribbs reportedly had sex at a motel after meeting at a bar. He then stabbed her multiple times and left her to bleed to death in the bathtub. He was later convicted of murdering Sandra Gallagher, a mother of three, in Los Angeles in 1995, as well. Her body was found in her burning pickup truck. He is also suspected in the deaths of women in Mississippi and Louisiana. California authorities suspect he was behind four other murders in that state, as well. At one point, Rogers boasted her murdered 70 people, though later recanted and said he was only joking. The truth behind the murders of Nicole . Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman has gotten murkier, not clearer in the 17 . years since OJ's acquittal. The timeline of the crime has long . been a point of contention as OJ infamously signed a deal to pen a book . called ‘If I Did It’ which was ultimately cancelled. Numerous friends and acquittance have . come forward, claiming firsthand or secondhand knowledge of OJ . confessing to the crime. However, the former football star and actor has . publicly maintained his innocence. Despite being found not guilty at the . criminal trial, the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman . sued OJ in civil court. Trial run: In the sensational 1995 murder trial, O.J. Simpson tries on a leather glove allegedly used in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman . Acquitted: Simpson, centre, smiled while standing with his attorneys F. Lee Bailey, left, and Johnnie Cochan, right, after hearing the not guilty verdict in his criminal murder trial; Cochran died in 2005 . Several pieces of evidence were introduced that had been excluded from the criminal case. The jury found Simpson legally liable for the wrongful deaths of the two victims. Their families were awarded more than $33million in damages. Earlier this year, private investigator William Dear floated a theory that OJ's son Jason Simpson committed the murders. In a book, Mr Dear claimed that OJ stood trial to deflect attention away from his son, who he says was mentally unstable at the time. The theory has been called 'absolutely absurd' by some legal analysts. One of the key witnesses in the case, Kato Kaelin, a small-time actor who testified for several days at the trial, has flipped-and-flopped back and forth on whether he believes Simpson committed the crimes. Most recently, he said he had no direct knowledge of Simpson admitting to the crimes. Simpson is now serving 33 years in prison for a recent armed robbery in Las Vegas. In 2007, two sports memorabilia dealers say Simpson and four other men reportedly broke into their hotel room and robbed them at gunpoint. Simpson denies that he used weapons and claims he was only taking back property that was rightfully his from his days as a college football and NFL star.

"Fifty drunken elephants caused havoc in an Indian village and destroyed three houses after gulping down an astonishing 500 litres of alcohol. The animals destroyed a shop stocking Mahua and ruined crops in Dumurkota, east India, after drinking 18 containers of the alcoholic drink. However they were not satisfied after the drinking session and ransacked adjoining huts to find more of the liquor, according to local reports. Rampage: The animals destroyed a shop stocking Mahua and ruined crops in Dumurkota in eastern India after drinking 18 containers of an alcoholic drink (file) The herd had been drawn out of a forest by the strong smell of Mahua and raided the shop stocking the drink, reported the Times of India. But Dumurkota villagers managed to drive away the elephants after the incident and forestry officials then tried to get them to cross a nearby river. ‘Unfortunately these animals live in close proximity to man and they recognised the smell of the drink,’ police spokesman Asish Samanat said. He added that the elephants were similar to a drunk human in that they were ‘aggressive and unreasonable’, but they were ‘much, much bigger’. Youngsters: Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and easier to tame, although they can still charge at speeds of up to 30mph (file picture) The elephants were said to be part of a herd of 120 that had arrived from another town on Friday night, before the havoc ensued on Sunday. 'They'll have one heck of a hangover' Inspector Asish Samanat . Police asked for help from villagers in escorting them back to the other town. ‘They'll have one heck of a hangover,’ Inspector Samanat said of the elephants. Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and easier to tame, although they can still charge at speeds of up to 30mph. But there are only around 50,000 adult Asian elephants left in the wild - even though they have no natural predators.","Animals destroyed three houses in Dumurkota, India .

"Former BJP chief Bangaru Laxman could have endangered the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers for some money and personal gain, a special court observed on Saturday while sentencing the 72-year-old to four years in prison. Laxman, who was caught on tape accepting a bribe from journalists pretending to be arms dealers, was also slapped with a fine of Rs100,000. 'The convict had kept his individual interests over and above the national interest and had even agreed to compromise the security and safety of the nation,' additional sessions judge Kanwal Jeet Arora said. BJP leader Bangaru Laxman (centre) outside a Dwarka court, which sent him to prison for four years in a corruption case . She added that 'corruption is worse than prostitution as it endangers the whole society'. '(He) agreed to compromise with the lives of lakhs of soldiers who, without fearing for their lives, fight for the nation'. In 2001, Laxman had been caught in a sting operation receiving Rs100,000 in bribe from Tehelka.com journalists who had claimed to be representatives of a fake UK-based arms manufacturing company. The video showed Laxman accepting . money from 'West End International' officials who were seeking his . recommendation for the supply of hand-held thermal imagers to the Indian . Army. Jailed: Bangaru Laxman, former President of the BJP . The court, while considering what . sentence to give Laxman, was alarmed at the cavalier attitude with which . he was ready to exercise his influence over defence contracts. 'Even . in the very first meeting with the representatives of a company, (he) had agreed to extend his influence for getting a supply order in their . favour, with respect to defence-related equipment for his personal . gains, without giving it a thought that the equipment of this company . may or may not be of standard quality,' the court said. Despite . 'West End International' being a fictitious company and fake arms . dealers, the court said Laxman's willingness to influence the defence . contract in return for illegal gratification was genuine. This . conclusion led the court to convict the former BJP president under . section 9 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which entails a prison . sentence ranging from six months to five years. Though the defence counsel had argued for leniency, saying the 72-year-old suffers from diabetes and health issues, the CBI demanded maximum punishment, saying it would deter others from going down the path of corruption. 'Considering the gravity and the impact which his influence would have had on the lives of the soldiers of Indian Army, had the design of convict materialised, I am of the opinion that there are no mitigating circumstances and he does not deserve the leniency,' the court said. 'Being president of a political party (he) was supposed to have shown exemplary character to lead by example. But that was not to be.' Bangaru Laxman, the septuagenarian Former BJP chief, now faces four years behind bars at Tihar — and he will have work since he has been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. Laxman was brought to Tihar Prisons on Saturday after he was sentenced. R.N Sharma, DIG, Tihar Prisons, said he will be lodged in ward 15 of jail No. 4, the same one where sacked Commonwealth Games organising committee chief Suresh Kalmadi (pictured) had been lodged. No special arrangements have been made for him, Sharma added. He . will join former telecom minister A. Raja and former telecom secretary . Siddhartha Behura — being tried in the 2G scam — as fellow inmates. The verdict gave the Congress the . ammunition to gun for the BJP. 'It is for the first time that the former . president of a national party has been found guilty of corruption and . has been sentenced. It's the right time for the BJP to introspect and . self-analyse. 'The Opposition party has lost all moral rights to talk about corruption,' Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said. The . BJP attempted to counter the jibes. Party spokesperson Prakash . Javadekar said in Nagpur: 'The Congress should not lecture us on . morality.' He went on to . add: 'The way the CBI has shown quickness of action in this case, it . should also show the same pace in the alleged corruption cases such as . the 2G scam, the Commonwealth Games scam and cases involving former . finance minister and current home minister P.

"Young: Ivor Perl was sent to Hitler's camps when he was just 11 years old. In this picture, taken after he was liberated, he is 14 . In February of 1945 Ivor Perl, 13, was standing in the snow cold, hungry, desperate, and dimly aware that under normal circumstances it would be time for his bar mitzvah. But instead of a celebration, Ivor, staring through the fence of Allach, a Nazi concentration camp, had been put to work for months on end with nothing more than thin prison clothes to protect him from the bitter winter, and a slice of bread a day to sustain him. Remembering his desperation, Ivor, now 81, recalls: 'The camp was in the middle of the forest, and a fence ran through the trees. I was praying to God “help me, if you let me get out of this place, I shall not ask anything else of you in my life.”' But his liberation was not to come for months, when the American soldiers would sweep into Germany and, horrified, stumble upon the hellish camps where Ivor and millions like him were held. So Ivor, suffering not only from terrible deprivation and could, but a typhus infection, worked on through the winter. The gruelling regime hit him especially badly as, having pretended to be older than he was to avoid being killed, he had to do the work of an adult to keep up the act. Ivor, a Hungarian, was imprisoned in 1944, after his country had been occupied by the Nazis for attempting to defect to the Allies. Transported: Ivor was forced on to a crowded railway car and transported to Auscwitz in awful conditions (file picture) He, his parents and his eight siblings were sent first to Auschwitz, where women and children would be separated from men, and killed. Ivor was saved because he mother ordered him to join the adults despite still being a boy. The decision saved his life, as his mother and seven of his siblings died in the camps. 'Of course at the start, I ran over to my mother's side, with the children and the women', Ivor says. 'I told her: “I want to come with you, mum.” She said: “No, don't come here.”' He pleaded but gave in and joined one of his brothers in the other line. However, even then he was almost sent back to die by the notorious Auschwitz camp Dr Josef Mengele. 'I could see a German officer with white gloves', Ivor says, 'who we heard later on was Dr Mengele. He was pointing left and right. And as he came to me, he suddenly stopped and said “how old are you?” 'Remembering what I was told, I said I was 16. Fortunately I was big for my age. 'I've often, even now after all these years, I can remember his eyes as he was thinking to himself which side he should put me to. He must have thought that if I'm lying I won't be strong enough so it doesn't matter.' In Allach for the bitterest months of the year, Ivor's strength was sorely tested. An average meal in the camp was a slice of bread, a cup of hot water and, perhaps, a dab of margarine. To protect them from the weather, prisoners had only the infamous black-and-white striped prisoner underclothes and a thin cotton overcoat. Desperate: These Jewish survivors, mostly children, were photographed when Auschwitz was liberated (file picture) Skeletal: Children were kept in horrible conditions inside the camps . Alongside hundreds of others, he was put to work on gruelling projects such as digging underground bases for military equipment with only rudimentary tools. Order was kept with a combination of fear and extreme force. When Nazi guards realised some prisoners were hiding in a cave to avoid work, they thought nothing of throwing grenades in after them. When a register of prisoners was taken in the morning, everyone faced an agonising decision of which group of labourers to join. Some tasks were easier than others – and the hardest work could easily drive struggling prisoners to death. One day Ivor made a different choice to his brother, and didn't see him for three weeks. While his brother was posted to a farm, and allowed to eat decently for a time, Ivor grew so emaciated and ill that his older sibling did not recognise him. Marched: Hungarian Jews, marked with a Star of David, queue on their way into Auschwitz in 1944, the same time Ivor was taken to the camps (file picture) Work: Children are seen behind barbed wire in Auschwitz . Indeed, at one point Ivor's typhus, which was ubiquitous in concentration camps, grew so bad he was referred to the camp hospital. 'The hospital block was laughable', Ivor recalls. 'Twice a day – in the morning a camp doctor would come along, you would uncover yourself, he'd see how much flesh you had on you, whether you were able to work. 'Those who were not considered workable were pointed towards, and those people had to be taken away to be killed. All of us would push our stomach out to pretend we were more healthy than we were.' With the help of his brother, Ivor sneaked out of the hospital, where there was clearly no prospect of getting better. Haunting: A recent images shows a wintery Auschwitz as it is now, with the infamous slogan 'Arbeit Macht Frei' written above the gate . But outside, in the camp, things began to change, as the noise of Allied war planes gradually began to fill the air. But for those still inside, it wasn't a symbol of hope. 'They said the worse the Germans treated us the more we were losing the war,' Ivor remembers. And indeed, the worst was yet to come. After weeks of restlessness in the camp, the order was given that it be abandoned. Ivor and his brother were told that they must march, for days, to a larger camp. Recollection: Ivor Perl, pictured recently, was able to start a new life in Britain . They were given a single loaf of bread to sustain them for several days, and warned that if they finished it too soon there would be nothing else. Part way through this gruelling journey, with a pace so uncompromising prisoners would die on their feet, it became too much. 'We were walking along in the mud and suddenly my brother and I accused each other of taking bigger bites than we should have done,' Ivor remembers. 'We started fighting and wrestling in the mud.' 'And as we were fighting in the mud suddenly I could see a pair of army boots and the butt of a gun on the floor.' The two thought – with good reason – they would soon be brutally punished. 'Then suddenly we heard this soldier talking to us in Hungarian', Ivor says. 'He said “Don't fight, because you'll soon be liberated and then afterwards you'll be sorry you fought each other.” 'That was about the only kindness that I experienced in my camp life.' Even this was only a blip in the otherwise unrelenting suffering of Ivor's year under Nazi persecution. But, as he marched towards Dachau, where he would soon be liberated by the American forces, it was a sign of better things to come. After the war, Ivor was granted a visa to come to the UK. He spent his working life in fashion retail, married and has four children and six grandchildren. Ivor Perl shared his story in conjunction with the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.

"Companies will be allowed to ‘frack’ for shale gas underneath people’s homes without telling them, if government proposals go ahead. Shale gas firms drill straight down into the earth before redirecting their drills horizontally over a wide area to maximise the amount of gas they can collect. The plans, which would make it easier for companies to drill for miles underground, met with fury from green campaign groups and locals in the Sussex village of Balcombe who say drilling has made their lives a misery. A test drilling site for shale gas non the outskirts of Southport, Lancashire. Companies will be allowed to 'frack' for shale has underneath people's home without telling them, if government proposals go ahead . Juliette Harris said water from her taps at home was coming out brown, adding that noise from Cuadrilla’s early activity was already ‘unbearable’. Chancellor George Osborne yesterday stepped up the Government’s support for fracking, which involves injecting water and chemicals into the ground to release gas trapped inside rocks. The Department for Communities and Local Government said it was ‘unreasonable and impractical’ to expect companies to warn all those whose homes might sit above one of its wells. The DCLG said anyone living near proposed above-ground facilities would still be notified. But it said there was no need to tell people if firms planned to drill beneath their property because gas reserves are more than 1,000 metres below ground. Miss Harris said the DCLG’s plans would heap more misery on locals. ‘They’ve got pound notes in their eyes and a government that used to champion the countryside is just throwing it away,’ she added. ‘The fact they can then go horizontally under your house and you have no say is compounding the way this government is trying to bulldoze through this policy without any care and attention to us as residents.’ Residents in the Sussex village of Balcombe, where protests were held against company Cuadrilla, say fracking has made their lives a misery . ‘I’m a lifelong Conservative voter, my family are, but I cannot understand what this government is doing.’ Mr Osborne pointed out that communities where fracking is to occur have been offered a £100,000 incentive and 1 per cent of future revenues. He said: ‘Of course, we want exploration of our shale resources to be safe, to avoid environmental damage, and be done in a way where communities get the benefit of what’s happening in their backyard.’ He added: ‘Britain is not going to turn its back on the energy sources of the future. So we’ve set out a generous new tax regime for shale gas and removed the bureaucratic obstacles to its use onshore and offshore.’ A Friends of the Earth spokesman said: ‘It’s astonishing that ministers want to end people’s right to be notified about plans to drill for gas and oil under their homes. 'It’s little wonder communities don’t trust the Government over fracking when their rights are so clearly being bulldozed aside to smooth the path for the big fracking firms.’ Chancellor George Osborne stepped up the fracking campaign and said Britain will not 'turn its back on the energy source of the future' The DCLG is inviting responses to its proposals until October 14, but has no fixed timetable for implementing the changes. Plans to revise the oil and gas planning regime came as Cuadrilla withdrew its own planning application, admitting it had not consulted people living above areas where it wants to drill. A company spokesman said it was ‘coincidence’ that Cuadrilla withdrew its planning application 24 hours after it emerged that the Government might change the rules. It is expected to resubmit its application, potentially delaying operations in Balcombe.","Plans would make it easier for companies to drill miles underground .

"The world's only 'married' lesbian threesome are expecting their first child. Doll, Kitten and Brynn, from Massachusetts, were joined together in a marriage-style ceremony last August and are expecting a daughter in July. Kitten, 27, is pregnant after undergoing IVF treatment using an anonymous sperm donor, and the trio eventually plan to have three children - one for each of them. Scroll down for video . Doll, 30, Kitten, 27, and Brynn Young, 34, (L-R) from Massachusetts, USA, are the world's first married lesbian threesome and are expecting a baby daughter in July . The plan at the moment is that Kitten will bear all the children - possibly using her wives' eggs and donated sperm - but they are open to other options, such as adoption. Brynn, 34, says: 'The hope is to have three kids altogether. We always joke that the children should never outnumber the parents.' Doll, Kitten and Brynn Young married in a ceremony in August 2013, when each of their fathers walked them down the aisle. All three women wore white wedding gowns and exchanged rings. The so-called 'throuple' worked with a specialist family lawyer who drew up the paperwork and drafted the ceremony so that all three of them were obligated and bound to each other . While Brynn and Kitten are legally married, Doll is handfasted to both so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible. The 'married' lesbian threesome on their wedding day in August 2013 . Doll, 30, says: 'As far as we know, there aren't any other three women who are married like us.' It was back in 2009 that Brynn first met Doll through an online dating site. Senior Software Designer and Engineer, Brynn had been married twice before to women and both experiences had made her acknowledge that monogamous relationships weren't for her. Meanwhile Fashion Designer, Doll had known that she was polygamous since high school. She explains: 'I had always dated girls - who although they had boyfriends or girlfriends - were also allowed to date me. 'I never thought that much about it and I had never really 'come out' as poly to my friends and family. To me, it was just how I was.' Brynn and Doll dated for eight months before moving in together. Two years later, they purchased a house together. Having both enjoyed polygamous relationships before, Doll and Brynn looked for a third woman to join them. After a few failed liaisons, Doll and Brynn created an OKCupid couple's profile. Eventually, they received a message from Kitten. Before meeting Doll and Brynn, Kitten had been in two long-term relationships with men. Her first relationship lasted ten years and she had been engaged to her second boyfriend. Fashion Manager, Kitten says: 'My second boyfriend and I had been together for several years but a few months before our wedding, he called the whole thing off without explanation. At first, I was distraught but now, I'm grateful for what he did. 'The whole break-up forced me to really think about who I was and I realised that I had not been honest to myself. On reflection, I realised that I hadn't been happy in my previous monogamous relationships and I discovered that I was poly. 'I set up an OKCupid profile for myself and began dating an awesome woman with the happy consent of her husband. They were a lovely couple but we ended the relationship after I had to move away. 'Soon after that amicable break-up, I came across Doll's and Kitten's OKCupid profile and saw they were looking for a third member to join their 'Super Hero Group'.' The 'throuple' are eventually hoping to have three babies, one for each 'wife' Doll, Brynn and Kitten went for dinner at a Chinese Restaurant for their first date and immediately liked each other. Doll says: 'There was an instant attraction with Kitten but I think we all really bonded when we baked cookies together on our fourth date. I didn't know what love was until the three of us clicked like that.' Brynn adds: 'With Doll and Kitten, things finally made sense. It was as if the puzzle was finally complete with all three pieces.' Within a few months, Kitten moved in with Doll and Brynn. Two years later, they decided to get married after Kitten proposed the idea to them. Kitten says: 'I had always wanted to get married and I guess Doll and Brynn indulged my wishes! I had a very traditional upbringing and marriage had always been an important symbol of commitment for me. We wanted to celebrate our love in a wedding like everyone else.' The threesome insist their relationship is like that of any normal couple: having breakfast with one another, watching TV after work and sharing a bed together. Being married to more than one person is not currently legal. While Brynn and Kitten are married, Doll is handfasted to both, so the threesome are as equally married to each other as legally possible. Doll says: 'The only difference is that communication is a lot more difficult for us than others. There are three people so our relationship takes detailed scheduling - everything we do goes on the calendar! 'Whilst communication is tricky, household chores are a lot easier with three people! You can slack off on your errands and another person can pick them up.' Brynn adds: 'Each of us has our own allocated chores and roles - I like to think of us a romantic committee. In our relationship, I'm the traditional breadwinner. I work a forty hour week and make the majority of the family's income. 'Doll does the cooking and Kitten does the cleaning. Sometimes, Kitten also helps me with my hair and make-up before I go to work.' The threesome spent several date nights planning their dream wedding - making decorations and shopping for matching traditional, white gowns. Brynn says: 'Planning our wedding was hectic. It took a lot more organizing because there were three brides involved. Kitten, Brynn and Doll had to work with the legalities of the state to get married to each other. As being married to more than one person is not currently legal, they had to combine handfasting, legally binding documents and legal marriage. A family lawyer drew up paperwork - in terms of assets, wills and legal rights to children - to bind them all together as much as they could without an actual three way marriage. While Brynn and Kitten are legally married, Doll, far left, is handfasted to both . Brynn explains: 'Just because we aren't the atypical configuration, I didn't want to not get married. We're very traditional people and that sense was reflected in our wedding.' When Doll, Kitten and Brynn walked down the aisle, each of their fathers gave them away. This moment was especially memorable for Kitten as her father had previously disowned her due to his disapproval of her poly-lifestyle. Kitten explains: 'My father had stopped talking to me for a period of time after I came out not only as gay, but as also dating two women. 'But shortly before the wedding, the bonds began mending and he agreed to walk me - his youngest daughter - down the aisle. It was wonderful.' After saying their vows and exchanging rings, the girls had a drinks reception. The trio did their first dance to Kitten's favourite love song, 'I'll Stand By You' by The Pretenders'. It was only three months after their beautiful wedding day that Kitten fell pregnant, after undergoing IVF treatment using a sperm donor. They hope to conceive using the same method with all of their future pregnancies. Doll, Kitten and Brynn showing off their wedding rings . Kitten says: 'The three of us have always wanted kids. Doll, Brynn and I are committed to each other and we wanted to grow our family. 'We decided that I would be the one to carry the babies because I am more than happy to become a full-time mum. When our daughter arrives in July, I'll be the one changing the nappies and doing the feeds!' The trio also plan on homeschooling their children to prevent them getting bullied by peers for having an unconventional family. Doll - who was herself teased at school - explains: 'Traditional school's tough enough for a normal kid and I don't want my child to be picked on because they're raised differently. I can't stomach the idea of putting them in the crossfire like that.' Brynn adds: 'Through homeschooling, I think we can also educate our kids to have the same strength that Doll, Kitten and I have. 'The three of us have been brave enough to stand tall and go against what society calls normal. I hope our child will feel free to do the same thing if they wish.'

"Before the likes of Apple, Google and other pioneers of the technological world, 20th century inventors came up with novel and wacky ways of developing existing products. Among the most bizarre ideas that never managed to take off include reading glasses fitted with mirrors and radio-fitted hats from the 1930s; an extendable caravan that made a stretch limousine look compact, and a car that could scoop pedestrians off the road to prevent them from being run over. Other inventions include a vending machine that served hot sausages in Germany and a contraption that shut out all outside noise and was fitted with an oxygen mask to ensure the wearer didn't suffocate. These Hamblin glasses were invented in 1936 and were designed to make it easier for people to read in bed. The words from the page were beamed to the reader's eyes using mirrors so the reader could lie on their back and now have to strain their neck . Forget the stretch limo, this invention from 1934 is a stretch caravan. It was designed by a French engineer and comprised of three sections that slotted together when the caravan was being towed. When the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite, the caravan could be extended to provide extra living space . In 1924, swimwear was fitted with wooden panels as safety devices. The wood was naturally buoyant and were designed to stop wearers from drowning . Yet despite these early inventors' forward-thinking, many of these creations never made it into the mainstream. The pioneering radio hat designed in the U.S in 1931 comprised of a boater hat fitted with a transmitter and speaker, allowing the wearer to take the news with them wherever they go. A more ambitious way of using the relatively new wireless radio technology was in the 1921 radio pram. It was fitted with a transmitter and meant parents could keep up with news and current affairs while walking their child. The radio could also be used to soothe the baby's crying . For people who preferred reading rather than listening to the radio, a pair of Hamblin glasses were invented in . 1936 designed to make it easier for people to read in bed. The . words from the page were beamed to the reader's eyes using mirrors so . the reader could lie on their back and not have to strain their neck. Many of the other historical brainwaves of the early 20th century involved inventors' taking transportation at the time and making it more efficient or useful. A French inventor created an amphibious bicycle that let the user navigate land and sea using bulbous floats combined with wheels. The 1924 Wooden Swimsuit allowed wearers to swim safely because the wooden panels were naturally buoyant and would keep them afloat. Following the invention of the wireless, inventors in the U.S took the technology a step further. The radio headwear, left, was invented in 1931 and comprised of a boater hat fitted with a radio transmitter and a speaker.  While the radio pram from 1921, right, was equipped with a transmitter that could be used to soothe the baby as it slept . Before radar equipment became more mainstream, an inventor in the 1940s came up with this novel way of trying to listen for enemies. The dishes were used to pick up and amplify sounds, which became louder as they moved through the tunnels. The user could then listen into by standing in the centre and putting each ear on the tunnel exits . Italian Goventosa de Udine’s harebrained idea for a one-wheeled motorcycle was conceived in 1931 and enabled the rider to hit speeds of 150 kilometers per hour.

When the holidaymakers arrived at the campsite, the caravan . could be extended to provide extra living space. Another wacky design to come from the same decade may have been one of . the first off-road vehicles. Invented in 1936, the truck was fitted with ten wheels and each tyre sat at slightly different angles. This meant it could drive across . all terrains and climb up and down slopes with a 65 per cent gradient. This wacky design may have been one of the first off-road vehicles.

"A Minnesota jury has heard the shocking moment a 65-year-old homeowner shot dead two teenage intruders in his basement, and then told his female victim 'You're dying... b****.' Byron Smith recorded the double slaying in his Little Falls basement and on the second day of his murder trial the crystal clear audio was played to a silent courtroom, except for a woman holding back sobs. In the recording, glass can be heard breaking, movement, then two gunshots as Nick Brady, 17, groans, 'Oh.' To this, Smith responds: 'You're dead,' the Star Tribune reports. Then the rustling of a tarpaulin can be heard and a dragging sound as Smith, breathing heavily, moves the teen into his workshop to stop his dead body staining the carpet. Scroll down for video . Accused: Byron Smith, center, comes out of a Morrison County courtroom in Little Falls, Minnesota, Monday, April 21, 2014, during a break in his trial. Smith shot and killed two teenagers who broke into his house on Thanksgiving Day 2012 . Trial: The 65-year-old faces two counts of premeditated first-degree murder for the killings of Haile Kifer, 18, and Nick Brady, 17, who broke into his home on Thanksgiving Day 2012 . Moments later, jurors heard the sound of a gun reloading and deep breaths. Then a female voice mumbles 'Nick.' It's 18-year-old Haile Kifer - Brady's cousin. Again, gunshots ring out and then Kifer falls down the stairs. Smith says 'Oh, sorry about that' and a terrified Kifer screams 'oh my god!' The old man then says 'you're dying,' before shooting her again and calling her 'b****' twice. More dragging sound is heard and then a final crack of a gun, which is where prosecutors turned off the sinister recording. Smith is . charged with first-degree premeditated murder in the slayings of Brady and Kifer on Thanksgiving Day . 2012. The killings rocked the small central . Minnesota city of about 8,000 and stirred debate about how far people . can go in defending their homes. Charged again: Byron Smith had his charge increased from second degree murder to first-degree after killing two teenagers . The horrifying audiotape came after . jurors listened to an interview from the day after the shootings in . which Smith matter-of-factly described what happened in chilling detail, . telling authorities he finished Kifer off with a shot under her chin . because a .22-caliber 'doesn't go through bone very well.' Prosecutors said during opening statements that Smith planned the killings and was lying in wait in his basement. Smith's attorney said his client was terrified after several increasingly violent break-ins and was hiding after he heard a window break and footsteps upstairs. 'He became frightened and scared to live in his own home,' said Smith's attorney, Steve Meshbesher, later adding, 'He began to wear a holster and pistol in his own house. That is how afraid he is, and became.' Assistant Washington County Attorney Brent Wartner told jurors that Smith thought a neighbor girl had been breaking into his home. On that day, he moved his truck away from his house, sat in his basement 'and he waited,' Wartner said. 'He's down in the basement, in a chair, tucked between two bookcases at the bottom of the stairs. He said he was down there reading a book ... with his Mini-14, a .22-caliber revolver, some energy bars and a bottle of water,' Wartner said. During the afternoon the jury was also shown several photographs of the basement where the shootings occurred. BCA Forensic Science Lab forensic scientist Nate Pearlson testified that the teens bodies were found partially wrapped in the same camouflage tarp. Kifer’s sweatshirt hood was up and her purse was next to her body. Using gunshot residue, Pearlson said he was able to determine the two bullet holes in the hood of Kifer’s sweatshirt were likely made at the distance of about six inches and 12 inches - or point blank range. Under Minnesota law, a person may use deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling, but authorities have said Smith crossed a line when he continued to shoot the teens after they were no longer a threat. The teens were not armed, but Smith told authorities he assumed they were - and he thought they had taken guns from his house in a past burglary. In the recordings, Smith can be heard politely recounting details to investigators. As the recordings were played Monday, Smith sat still at the defense table, at some points crying. Smith told Morrison County Sheriff's Sgt. Jeremy Luberts that he was in his basement when he heard someone rattle his door, followed by footsteps on his deck and a shadow in a window. Dead: The bodies of cousins Haile Kifer, 18, (left) and Nicholas Brady, 17, (right) were found stashed in the basement of a man who claimed the teenagers had broken into his home on Thanksgiving Day 2012 . Byron Smith takes his first break during the first day of his trial at the Morrison County Courthouse in Little Fall, Minn., on Monday . 'I'm getting seriously stressed . because somebody wants in,' he said. After a moment of silence, he said . he heard a window break, and footsteps inside. Smith . told authorities he saw Brady begin descending the basement steps, then . fired once Brady's hips came into view. Brady fell. 'He's looking, facing up at me, and I shoot him in the face. I want him dead,' Smith told investigators. Smith . said he put Brady's body on a tarp so he wouldn't get blood into his . carpet, dragged it into his workshop, reloaded his rifle and sat down. Smith . described feeling adrenaline, and 'blood was pounding in my ears.' He . said he also felt he was being ganged up on, something he called one of . his 'red buttons.' So when he saw Kifer come down the stairs minutes . later, 'I killed her too.' He shot her, and when he tried to 'finish her off' his rifle jammed and she laughed, he said. 'I . just pulled out the 22 and I shot her,' he told authorities. He said he . then pulled her into the workshop, but she was still gasping, so 'I did . a good, clean finishing shot and she gave out the death twitch.' He . said he didn't call police because the teens were already dead and . 'just cause my Thanksgiving is screwed up I don't need to screw up . yours.' The next day, he asked a neighbor to call police. Scene: Smith has always claimed self-defense, saying he feared the teens were armed and he was on edge after earlier repeated break-ins at his home . Friends and teachers had expressed their shock at the deaths and described Haile as a popular role model . Smith is a retired security engineer for the U.S. Department of State. Kifer and Brady were cousins. The two were well-known in the community, and both were involved in sports. Court documents from another case show Brady had burglarized Smith's property at least twice in the months before he was killed. Earlier, . Meshbesher told jurors: 'This is not a case of whodunit. Mr. Smith is . the person who shot and killed those two people, but he is not . criminally responsible for the deaths. He is not guilty of murder.' Assistant Washington County Attorney . Brent Wartner told jurors that Smith thought a neighborhood girl had been . breaking into his home, so on that Thanksgiving Day, Smith sat in his . basement, waiting. Wartner said Smith . heard the door of his house rattle at about 12:30 p.m., then someone . walking across the deck, then a window breaking. 'And he waited,' Wartner said. But Meshbesher said his client was hiding after break-ins that had gotten increasingly more violent. 'He . became frightened and scared to live in his own home,' he said of . Smith, later adding, 'He began to wear a holster and pistol in his own . house. That is how afraid he is, and became.' Joker: Friends remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile . Prosecutors . say as Brady descended the basement steps, Smith shot him in the chest, . then in the back while Brady fell, Wartner said. Smith fired a final . shot into Brady's head, the bullet passing through Brady's hand, Wartner . said. Smith put Brady's body on a tarp so he wouldn't get blood on his . carpet, dragged the body into his workshop, reloaded his Mini-14 rifle . and sat down again, the prosecutor said. A . few minutes later, Kifer walked down the stairs and Smith shot her, . Wartner said. He tried another shot, but his rifle jammed, Wartner said, . and Smith told police he believed Kifer laughed at him. 'He . was angry,' Wartner said. He said that Smith then pulled out his . revolver and he shot her twice in the head, once in the left eye and . once behind the left ear. Smith . dragged Kifer's body into the workshop and laid it on top of Brady's, . Wartner said. Smith told investigators he thought he heard Kifer . gasping, so he placed his revolver under her chin and fired what he told . police was a 'good clean finishing shot to the head,' the assistant . prosecutor said. After . their deaths, authorities said a car linked to Brady and Kifer . contained prescription drugs that had been stolen from another house, . apparently the day before they were killed.","Byron Smith, 65, is on trial for killing two teenagers who broke into his home - Haile Kifer, 18, and Nick Brady, 17 - on Thanksgiving Day in 2012 .

"Residents of one Texas city will soon be drinking recycled sewer water as drought conditions reach critical levels. Three years ago, 88 per cent of Texas was in the 'exceptional drought' category - the worst drought in its history. Today, just one per cent of the state is in that category, including the northern city of Wichita Falls. The emergency water reuse pipeline process in Wichita Falls has been on the cards since 1999, but as the city entered its fourth years of drought, officials realized it was time to roll it out. Scroll Down for Video . Dust bowl: The dried and cracked bed of Lake Arrowhead, the main water source of Wichita Falls . Dry dock: A dock made to fish from stands completely out of water at Lake Arrowhead State Park near Wichita Falls, Texas . Wichita Falls may bring to mind flowing waterfalls and limpid pools, but its main water source, Lake Arrowhead, is a dustbowl at just 27 per cent of its capacity. The city is currently at stage four: drought disaster, meaning extreme water restrictions are in place. Restrictions have brought the city's water usage down from  50 million gallons per day to 12 million gallons each day, but the savings aren't enough and city officials have now decided that recycling waste water is the only way to keep the city hydrated. The city is currently in the midst of a 45-day test period of turning waste water into drinking water. It's pumped through a black pipe that runs through the city directly from the water treatment facility to the water treatment plant, where it undergoes four stages of purification. Wichita Falls water tower: Water restrictions are so severe in the city that most residents rely on bottled and filtered water . Desert-like: The bed of Lake Arrowhead is a graveyard for fish and other life that once thrived in its waters . Once the testing is complete, the results will be sent to the state environmant quality department, which will deem whether or not it is fit for human consumption. Public utilities operations manager Daniel Nix told CBS, 'We evaluated the waste-water first to see what kind of quality we would be dealing with. The wastewater quality coming out of that plant was very high, so we didn’t have a lot of things to deal with.' According to KFDX, Wichita Falls will be the first city in the world to blend 50 per cent lake water with 50 per cent waste water to use for drinking water. 'No one's taken treated effluent from a waste water plant before it enters into a stream. No one's captured that and used it as a drinking water source,' says Public Works Director Russell Schreiber told KFDX. Desert-like: The bed of Lake Arrowhead is a graveyard for fish and other life that once thrived in its waters . Dried up: Wichita Falls has been in 'exceptional drought' for three years . Pipe dreams: A black pipeline runs through town taking water from the treatment plant to the recycling facility . Usually, waste water is treated and released back into the environment. Water to be used for human consumption is then drawn from lakes and reservoirs and treated in much the same way before it comes out of the tap. According to Earth Magazine, repeated studies have show that many people have an aversion to consuming water they know has once been in a toilet bowl. The 'flush to faucet' factor applies even when people know the water has been treated and is just as clean as bottled water. However, as the drought grows more and more intense in Wichita Falls, residents are just relieved to know that there will be water coming from somewhere. 'I’m happy about it because we’re concerned here about our water levels and whether or not we’re going to have water,' Juanita Dean told CBS. If approved, the program could be in effect by April.","Wichita Falls is entering its fourth year in 'exceptional drought'

"Two former police chiefs have questioned why the officer who shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, didn’t retreat after his initial encounter with him and wait for back-up. Officer Darren Wilson, in a recent TV interview about the tragedy, said ‘I did my job right’. However, former officers with decades of experience have cast doubt on that statement. Wilson, in his testimony to a grand jury, said that after asking Brown to move onto the sidewalk from his car, he punched him in the face and tried to grab his gun ‘with the most intense aggressive face’. Scroll down for video . Officer Darren Wilson, in a recent TV interview about the Michael Brown tragedy, said ‘I did my job right’ Former police chiefs believe Wilson could have made a tactical retreat after the struggle with the gun with Michael Brown (pictured) He explained that he fired the fatal shots after Brown charged at him, having ignored his orders to get on the ground several times. When ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Wilson if he could have prevented the death, Wilson replied ‘no’. But Eugene O’Donnell, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former New York City police officer, disagrees. He believes Wilson could have made a tactical retreat after the struggle with the gun. He told the New York Times: ‘There certainly wouldn’t be a prohibition of him driving a little further along and regrouping, calling for help and thinking about nonlethal weaponry. Just because you’re a police officer doesn’t mean you have to go into a situation headfirst.’ Vincent E. Henry, whose career with the New York Police Department spanned 21 years, including undercover work, agrees. Former Boston police commissioner Edward Davis (right) said it was disappointing that Wilson didn’t use a Taser or pepper spray to defend himself . He told the paper: ‘To back up and maybe follow him until backup arrived, in retrospect it might have been a better choice.’ Another former officer questioned the use of a lethal firearm to deter Brown’s aggression. Edward Davis, who retired as Boston police commissioner last year, said it was disappointing that Wilson didn’t use a Taser or pepper spray. However, there was also some sympathy from experts over Wilson’s handling of the situation. Henry said ‘Who would want to get punched in the face and then kind of say, “Let me just back up and follow this individual”?’ While Fred Bealefeld, a Baltimore police officer for 31 years, told the New York Times: ‘If someone grabs your weapon, as a cop you’re not thinking they are going to scare you with it.

"A three-year-old girl was found dead inside a large bean bag in her Kentucky home after she apparently burrowed inside the toy during a game of hide and seek. Kylee Mills Simmerman went missing just after 3pm on Wednesday inside her family home in Lexington, and one of her relatives called police to report her missing a half hour later. Firefighters and police responded to the scene and one of the emergency medical technicians found her inside the bag. She was unresponsive at the scene and was rushed to the University of Kentucky Hospital, but she could not be revived. The coroner listed her cause of death as asphyxia or suffocation. Tragic: Kylee Mills Simmerman was reportedly found inside a large bean bag used as a chair in her family's home . Emergency: After frantically looking for the girl around the home for a half hour, her relatives called police . Kylee was the youngest granddaughter of Kentucky state representative Terry Mills and he told The Lexington Herald-Leader that the death was a tragic accident. ‘We are suffering here,’ he said. ‘We’ll get through this, but it’s not going to be easy. We’ll just have to deal with this. The investigation into the death is ongoing, but the Fayette County coroner said there were ‘no outward signs of trauma'. Grieving: Kylee was the youngest granddaughter of state Rep. Terry Mills . They would not officially deem the death an accident or a homicide. ‘There was a police interview for about three hours, and it was quite an ordeal for Kylee's dad,’ Rep. Mills told The Lexington Herald-Leader. ‘The coroner's office called my daughter. They apologized for the police interrogation. They assured her that the cause of death was suffocation.’ While the police and investigating authorities did not release any of the details about the nature of the girl’s death, her grandfather has been speaking out on behalf of his daughter Terri Lee Mills and her husband Andy Simmerman. ‘I think it’s clear what happened... we believe she climbed into a bean bag,’ Rep. Mills said. If that is the case, her death is far from the first to occur under such circumstances. Consumer advocates have issued warnings about the suffocation and choking hazards for decades. Consumer Watch reports that at least five children died in incidents involving the chairs prior to 1995. Rep. Mills told local station WKYT that Kylee’s parents plan to send a thank you note to all of the people that contacted them with supportive messages.","Kylee Mills Simmerman was found inside a bean bag in her home .

"The southwestern United States has fifty percent change of suffering a 'megadrought' that lasts 35 years, scientists have warned. They say they are 'not optimistic' of the chances of avoiding huge droughts. They say global warming has meant the chance of a decade long drought is at least 50 percent, and the chances of a 'megadrought' – one that lasts up to 35 years – ranges from 20 to 50 percent over the next century. Scroll down for video . Ault said that the West and Southwest must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long-drought scenarios . In computer models, while the southern portions of the western United States (California, Arizona, New Mexico) will likely face drought, the researchers show the chances for drought in the northwestern states (Washington, Montana, Idaho) may decrease. Beyond the United States, southern Africa, Australia and the Amazon basin are also vulnerable to the possibility of a megadrought. The study by Cornell, University of Arizona and U.S. Geological Survey researchers will be published in a forthcoming issue of the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate. 'For the southwestern U.S., I'm not optimistic about avoiding real megadroughts,' said Toby Ault, Cornell assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences and lead author of the paper. 'As we add greenhouse gases into the atmosphere – and we haven't put the brakes on stopping this – we are weighting the dice for megadrought.' As of Aug. 12, most of California sits in a D4 'exceptional drought,' which is in the most severe category. Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas loiter in a substantially less severe D1 moderate drought. Ault says climatologists don't know whether the severe western and southwestern drought will continue, but 'with ongoing climate change, this is a glimpse of things to come. 'It's a preview of our future,' he said. While the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest lasted four to eight years, depending upon location, a megadrought can last more than three decades, which could lead to mass population migration on a scale never before seen in this country. Ault said that the West and Southwest must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long-drought scenarios. 'This will be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years and would pose unprecedented challenges to water resources in the region,' he said. Researchers warn  the West and Southwest must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long-drought scenarios . In computer models, while the southern portions of the western United States (California, Arizona, New Mexico) will likely face drought, the researchers show the chances for drought in the northwestern states (Washington, Montana, Idaho) may decrease. Prolonged droughts around the world have occurred throughout history. Ault points to the recent 'Big Dry' in Australia and modern-era drought in sub-Saharan Africa. As evidenced by tree-ring studies, a megadrought occurred during the 1150s along the Colorado River. Lake Mead drops to it's lowest water level ever as a 14 year drought continues throughout the US. Pictured is the Hoover Dam, once know as boulder dam which lies on the border of Arizona and Nevada. The dam is at it's lowest level dropping more than 130 feet. In natural history, they occur every 400 to 600 years. But by adding the influence of growing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, the drought models – and their underlying statistics – are now in a state of flux. Beyond the United States, southern Africa, Australia and the Amazon basin are also vulnerable to the possibility of a megadrought. With increases in temperatures, drought severity likely will worsen, 'implying that our results should be viewed as conservative,' the study reports.","Southwestern United States has fifty percent change of suffering a 'megadrought' that lasts 35 years .

"With a happy grin on her face, Malone Farrow nestles into her husband - the man whom she credits for helping to put the troubling memories of her childhood behind her. At the age of 28, the adopted daughter of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow has settled down and is a college graduate, writer and artist, married to an information-technology specialist. Malone - who changed her name from Dylan - says he helped her recover from a childhood which she claims was marred when she was molested by award-winning director Allen when she was seven. Breaking her silence last year, she told Maureen Orth in November's Vanity Fair: 'He’s the best thing that ever happened to me. I would not be functioning without him.'

Ronan, 26, whom Mia recently revealed could in fact be the biological son of . her first husband Frank Sinatra, lashed out on Twitter as Allen's long-time collorator and ex-girlfriend Diane Keaton made a lengthy and gushing tribute to the Blue Jasmine director. ‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did . they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at . age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ he tweeted. In August 1992, Malone told her mother that Allen had touched her inappropriately and kissed her all over in the attic at Mia's Connecticut country home. Allen, 78, has always denied the claims. However, Malone stands by the allegations and told Orth she bitterly regrets not standing up herself in court, insisting: 'I have never been asked to testify. If I could talk to the seven-year-old Dylan, I would tell her to be brave, to testify.' She claims that Allen told her it was their secret, but said it made her feel that she was a 'bad kid', stating she told her mother because she was 'cracking' and wanted the alleged abuse to stop. Speaking to Vanity Fair, Malone recounted her childhood and revealed that even the sight of a fellow student at school wearing a Woody Allen T-shirt had once left her in a 'fit of vomiting'. She told writer Orth that she will never utter her father's name, adding: 'There’s a lot I don’t remember, but what happened in the attic I remember. I remember what I was wearing and what I wasn’t wearing.' Orth added: 'I asked her if what she had said happened in the attic happened more than once', only for Malone to reply: 'That was isolated. The rest was just everyday weirdness -the weird routine I thought was normal.' She called her fears of her father 'crippling' and said: 'I’m scared of him, his image. Nobody wants to think this legendary filmmaker is my worst nightmare. That’s what scares me, when I picture things chasing me or happening—I think it’s him after me. It’s hard to explain how terrifying that is.' Justice Elliott Wilk dropped the . case in 1993. He awarded custody of Malone - then Dylan - to Mia and . denied Allen immediate visitation with her. He allowed Mia's son Moses to decide for himself whether he wanted to . see his adoptive father again, and he increased Ronan’s - then Satchel’s . - visits to three a week, supervised. The . judge concluded that Allen demonstrated no parenting skills and was . 'self-absorbed, untrustworthy, and insensitive.' Allen appealed, but the . opinion was upheld. And he lost his visits with Satchel in 1996 due to . his son's 'phobic reaction' of him. The judge then ruled Dylan would . never have to see him either and both brother and sister have since had no relationship with their father. Malone married her husband in 2010 and it's obvious that Mia is hugely proud of her daughter, posting a touching picture Twitter in September 2012 with the note: 'My daughter Malone & her husband. Happiness. Love.' Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes . It is a far cry from Malone's childhood, in which she recounted struggling with depression and even making a suicide attempt. Malone's claims were made in 1992 - a year after Mia and Allen separated when . the actress discovered the director was having a sexual relationship . with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi. The couple are now married and have two adopted daughters. Following the molestation court case, Mia moved her children from New York to Connecticut. But following the death of her adopted sister Tam at the age of 21 in 2000 from a heart condition, Malone told how she sank into a deep depression. She started cutting herself and made a 'halfhearted' attempt at suicide, admitting: 'I’m not proud of it. It was very hard for me to cope. My mom was my rock, and Ronan was my best friend.' Her depression was further exacerbated when she said that Allen succeeded in contacting her. The first time was just before her 19th birthday in 2004, she said, when he sent her a letter saying that because she was 18 he wanted to have a conversation and 'set the record straight about what your mother has told you,' signing off 'Love, your father.' Three years later, during her senior year of college, she said, he sent her a package of pictures of the pair together - and said that Soon-Yi missed her - adding that he wanted her to meet his new, adopted daughters, which stunned Malone. Since meeting her husband, Malone is now writing and illustrating a book and made it clear he is her 'saviour'. Controversial relationship: Mia and Woody split when she discovered he had a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he is now married to. Woody and Soon-Yi are pictured here in September . But that does not stop her mother and brother from furiously bringing the case back into the public eye. Rosemary’s Baby star Mia had been . live tweeting throughout the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday, but made it clear that as soon as Woody’s . tribute was about to begin, she was switching off. ‘Time to grab some icecream & switch over to #GIRLS,’ she wrote, followed by a simple: ‘Nite all.’ [sic] . She re-tweeted her son's message, but today hit back with anger, tweeting: 'A woman has publicly detailed Woody Allen's molestation of her at age 7. GoldenGlobe tribute showed contempt for her & all abuse survivors,' The star then added: 'Is he a pedophile', before linking back to the Vanity Fair article. Meanwhile, a family source today told MailOnline; 'Whever Ronan gets the chance to remind people he has no problem taking advantage of this opportunity.' Anger: Mia Farrow's text on Monday . Fury: Mia Farrow today linked back to the Vanity Fair article in the November 2013 issue where daughter Malone speaks for the first time . Great honour: Diane Keaton takes to the stage on behalf of ex-husband Woody Allen . Special honour: Diane Keaton (L) and Emma Stone accepted the Cecil B. DeMille award on Woody's behalf . Reached this afternoon by MailOnline at her home in an exclusive . private gated community in Florida, Malone Farrow had . nothing to say about her adoptive father's Golden Globes honour. 'We . are aware that her mother and brother have spoken out, but at this time . she has no comment to make.' Malone's husband said. 'Everything Malone wanted to say was in the Vanity . Fair article and if she chooses to say anything else in the future it . will be at a time of her own choosing,'he added. Up on stage: Diane was on hand to collect the Cecille B. DeMille Award for Woody Allen . Quite the speech: Diane spoke, sung and even swore (but got cut off) as she discussed the iconic director's work .","Malone Farrow - whose birth name was Dylan - is now 28 and happily maried to a man whom she says: 'I would not be functioning without'

"Nasa's Curiosity rover has captured the passing of Mars' two miniature moons in a fascinating photo sequence taken from the surface of the red planet. The eclipse of the moons - Phobos and Deimos - was captured for the first time from Mars using Curiosity's telephoto-lens camera and it is so detailed that craters are visible. The larger moon, Phobos, passes in front of Deimos in the 30-second video comprised of 41 images taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists working at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Scroll down for video . This view of the two moons of Mars comes from a set of images taken by NASA's Mars-based rover, Curiosity, as the larger moon, Phobos, passed in front of the smaller one, Deimos, from the rover's perspective, on 1 August . Curiosity recorded the spectacle on 1 August using one of the two cameras on its mast, known as Mastcam. The video will enable scientists to learn more about the moons, including giving a more precise picture of the moons' orbits. Mark Lemmon of Texas A&M University, College Station, said: 'The ultimate goal is to improve orbit . knowledge enough that we can improve the measurement of the tides Phobos . raises on the Martian solid surface, giving knowledge of the Martian . interior.' 'We may also get data good enough to . detect density variations within Phobos and to determine if Deimos' orbit is systematically changing,' he said. The orbit of the larger moon, Phobos, is slowly getting closer to Mars, while smaller Deimos' orbit is gradually moving away from the red planet. Phobos has a diameter of less than one per cent of the Earth's moon and it orbits much closer to Mars than our moon's distance from Earth. The larger of Mars' moons measures just 22 kilometres in diameter but orbits just 3,700 miles from Mars' surface. When viewed from the surface of Mars, Phobos looks about half as wide the Earth's moon appears to viewers on Earth, according to the scientists. The larger of the two moons (pictured), Phobos, . passes in front of Deimos in the 30-second video comprised of 41 images . taken by the robotic vehicle that were stitched together by scientists . working at Nasa's JPL. Here Phobos is seen just before the eclipse . Here, Phobos eclipses Deimos, as seen by the Curiosity rover on Mars. The smaller moon becomes visible once more in the right-hand image . The Earth's moon is vast compared to the Martian moons, with a diameter of around 2,160 miles but orbits much further away from it's planet's surface at an average of 239,000 miles. Dr Lemmon and his colleagues said the two moons would be visible crossing paths at a time shortly after Curiosity would be awake for transmitting data to NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter for relay to Earth. This made the moon observations feasible with minimal impact on the rover's energy budget. Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory project is using Curiosity and the rover's 10 science instruments to investigate the environmental history within Gale Crater, a location where the project has found that conditions were long ago favorable for microbial life. This illustration provides a comparison for how big the moons of Mars appear to be, as seen from the surface of Mars, in relation to how big the Earth's moon looks from the surface of Earth. Earth's moon actually has a diameter more than 100 times greater than the larger Martian moon, Phobos . The rover recently celebrated . its first anniversary on Mars by using its Sample Analysis at Mars . (SAM) instrument to 'sing' Happy Birthday by vibrating at different . frequencies. Since completing its dramatic landing sequence just over a year ago, the rover has already achieved its mission aim by discovering that Mars could have supported life and is sending back information about its surroundings to inform future missions to Mars. The mobile laboratory has provided more than 190 gigabits of data, returned more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images, fired more than 75,000 laser shots to investigate the composition of targets, collected and analyzed sample material from two rocks and driven more than one mile. Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory project is using Curiosity (a computer-generated illustration is pictured) landed on Mars in August last year for a two-year mission to determine if the planet most like Earth in the solar system has, or ever had, the an environment to sustain life . The rover has travelled almost 700 metres in the past month since leaving an area of Mars where it has been analysing rocks for around six months. Cuiosity is now trundling along to its final destination - Mount Sharp - where it will look at the lower layers of the mountain that towers over the centre of Gale Crater by almost three and a half miles. Mount Sharp is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet's changing environment over time.","Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said the larger of the two moons, Phobos, passed in front of Deimos on 1 August .

"America faces its first government shutdown in 17 years amid dispute over healthcare reforms . America faces its first government shutdown in 17 years beginning at midnight tonight as Republicans and Democrats fight bitterly over Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms. Under pressure from hardline members . tied to the Tea Party movement, the Republican-controlled House of . Representatives is using a government funding bill to attack the . adoption of the controversial policy, called ‘Obamacare’. The House approved the bill yesterday on the proviso that it delays the new healthcare law for a year and repeals a tax meant to pay for it. But, even before the House voted for the . amendment yesterday following an angry debate in which members . shouted each other down, the Democrat-controlled Senate pledged to . block it when it meets today - making a shutdown all but . inevitable. Mr Obama has insisted he will not see his healthcare reforms - his biggest domestic achievement-  gutted. If this happens, overall funding to government departments – due by an October 1 deadline – will not go through. More than 800,000 federal staff deemed non-essential – including park rangers and passport officials – will be put on forced unpaid leave. Millions more may have to work unpaid to keep critical services such as border patrol and air traffic control running. A spokesman for the President accused the Republicans of being ‘reckless and irresponsible’ and other Democrats said the opposition was putting contempt for the President above the good of the country. But Republican campaigners insisted they have the public on their side and claimed the health law that will reduce the quality of medical care and cost jobs by forcing employers to provide healthcare. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives hurry up the outer steps to the chamber before the door is secured for a series of votes on Saturday night . Republican representative Robert Pittenger said Americans dislike ‘this crazy, delusional idea that nationalized, centralized planning will work’. If the government shutdown goes ahead military personnel will still be paid, but half the Pentagon’s civilian staff will be temporarily laid off, prompting Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to claim US military capability would be weakened. ‘This is an astoundingly irresponsible way to govern,’ he said. 'If this continues, we will have a country that is ungovernable'. Millions may have to work unpaid as critical services such as border patrol, air traffic control and meat inspection continued to function. The last shutdown, in 1995 to 1996, cost the US more than $1 billion and seriously dented the popularity of the Republicans, who were principally blamed. Their slump in the polls helped Democrat Bill Clinton win a second presidential term. But with Obama flailing in the polls and increasingly being seen as a lame duck president, many Republicans feel he is particularly vulnerable now. The Republicans are still threatening to stop the government borrowing any more money, potentially leading the US to default on its debts, something Obama has warned would have a ‘profound destabilizing effect’ on the world economy. They say they will only agree to increase the government’s debt ceiling if the White House agrees to a string of conservative demands such as delaying Obamacare and green-lighting a major new oil pipeline. The Congress has only weeks to reach agreement after the Treasury Department announced last week that the government will reach its borrowing limit by October 17. In a government shutdown, spending for essential functions related to national security or public safety would continue along with benefit programs such as Medicare health insurance and Social Security retirement benefits for seniors. But civilian federal employees - from people who process forms and handle regulatory matters to workers at national parks and museums - would be furloughed. The last government shutdown ran from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, putting about 800,000 federal workers on furlough. Here is a roundup of the expected impact of a shutdown: . FEDERAL WORKERS . Up to 1 million U.S. federal workers could face furloughs without pay beginning on Oct 1. Most federal agency workers would be furloughed, but a small number of 'excepted' employees must continue to work. These include security workers such as air traffic controllers and prison guards. Congressional staffers could work if requested by the lawmaker or committee that employs them. Congress has previously paid federal workers for their furlough days. Federal workers could face penalties if they tried to do any work during the furlough. FINANCIAL MARKET CONSEQUENCES . Apart from potential market swings, companies hoping to raise money in an initial public offering could face delays. Businesses will still be able to file certain documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the agency said on Friday that processing and approving applications will be discontinued during a shutdown. 'Capital-raising will have a huge hiccup if the SEC shuts down as it has said,' said Eric Jensen, a partner with law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California. Drug companies waiting for a decision from the Food and Drug Administration could also see delays. The FDA said it would continue 'limited activities' related to programs that are paid for by user fees from drug approval applications. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS . A shutdown lasting less than two weeks would not hurt big defense contractors, which can survive temporarily without federal contract payments, said ratings agency Standard & Poor's. But a longer shutdown could weaken the financial profiles and liquidity positions of smaller defense contractors. 'It is felt a heck of a lot more keenly by small contractors,' said Bradley Wine, co-chair of Morrison & Foerster's government contracts practice. MEAT INSPECTORS . Meat inspectors for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, considered necessary to national safety would stay on job. U.S. ARMED SERVICES . All military personnel would continue in a normal duty status. But a large number of civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed, according to the Pentagon. Official furlough notices would be issued on October 1 if no agreement to fund the government has been reached. FEDERAL COURTS . Federal courts will remain open for about 10 business days. By October 15, the Judiciary will need to provide more guidance. The Supreme Court, which is scheduled to start its fall 2013 session on October 7, declined to comment on whether it has plans for a government shutdown. But a court spokesman noted that in past shutdown situations, the court continued operating as normal. IRS . The Internal Revenue Service has a major tax due date on October 15 for Americans who got an extension to file their 2012 taxes, which were due on April 15. The IRS will be accepting tax returns and other tax payments during a shutdown, but will suspend many other activities, including audits. About 90 percent of the IRS's 90,000 workforce would be furloughed, the agency said on Monday, meaning call centers would be closed and audits halted. HEALTHCARE LAW . President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law is scheduled to debut on October 1 when people can start shopping for health insurance. Money to fund implementation of the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, has already been committed.","The House of Representatives approved a bill to attack Obamacare to delay the new healthcare law for a year .
The Democrat-controlled Senate however pledged to block the law when it meets today .
President Obama insists he will not see his healthcare reforms gutted .

"A judge has ruled a mother serving life in prison for murder must be allowed to regularly see her children - despite the wishes of their father who wants to leave the country and move to Australia with them to start a new life away from her. Judge Nancy Whittenburg's order requires Michael Roberts to take his children from their home in California to visit Tracey Richter at the women's prison in Mitchellville, Iowa even though she is serving a prison sentence for executing her neighbour 11-years ago while they were in the room next door. 'Do you think Tracey cared about the children when she stashed them in the room 15 feet from where she fired 11 shots?' said Sac County Attorney Ben Smith today. 'She should have lost any and all rights to make those kinds of decisions or to have an influence in her kids' lives when she executed somebody.' Tracey Richter is pictured during her first-degree murder trial in Fort Dodge, Iowa. The mother who is serving life in prison for killing a neighbor in 2001 has been granted continued visitation rights with her two minor children, who were present in the rural Iowa home during the execution-style slaying . In the ruling issued last week, Judge Whittenburg said Roberts cannot move to his native Australia with his 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl until Richter's appeals are exhausted, even though Roberts claims his temporary visa has already expired. Sac County Attorney Ben Smith said Thursday that it is unbelievable Richter maintains parental rights after a jury convicted her of shooting 20-year-old Dustin Wehde at their home in Early in 2001 while the children – then 3 and 1 – were one room away. Judge Whittenburg said the 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl have a 'long, positive history with their mother,' whom she called an excellent parent. She said the visits will help 'bring closure to the sudden and traumatic events of the past year' in which Richter was arrested and convicted of killing Wehde as part of a plot to frame her first husband, John Pitman, who is the father of her child Bert, for a home invasion. Ten-years ago Tracey Roberts was celebrated as a heroic mother who acted in self-defence to protect herself and her children from men who broke into her home in Early, Iowa and assaulted her. Dustin Wehde, her neighbour was found slumped at the bottom of a bed at Tracey and Michael Roberts’ home in December 2001 in a pool of blood. One bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye socket. Noah and Mason Roberts pictured with their mother Tracey Richter in this undated photograph (left) now live with their father Michael Roberts (right) She claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her three young children - Bert, Noah and Mason - when Dustin and another man barged through her unlocked door. Roberts said one of the men choked her with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the sound of Bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his younger siblings. She said she ran to the bedroom and reached for the gun safe, as Dustin tugged at her hair and yanked on her feet. When the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the trigger. Then she said she grabbed a revolver, spotted Dustin moving and fired at him. He stopped moving and the second man fled. She later said it was only one man, not two, who got away. Her attorney picked up on inconsistencies in Roberts's story as she retold it. In different accounts, she said she fired from different positions. House: This photo shows the home of Tracey . Roberts in Early, Iowa. In 2001, she fired nine shots from two guns into . Dustin Wehde, a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her . bedroom . Murder trial: Tracey Roberts, now 46, left, . fired nine shots from two guns into Dustin Wehde, right, in 2001 - a . 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . In January, 2011 Sac County had a new prosecutor in Ben Smith, who went through years of files and months later filed a first-degree murder charge against Roberts, who is now called Tracey Richter. And in November 2011 a court in Iowa found that Richter shot Wehde several times at close range in the back of the head in her bedroom, and concocted an elaborate hoax that she acted in self-defense to protect her children after Wehde and another man attacked her. It was established by the court that Richter wanted to frame her first husband and father of her first child and paint him as the man who in fact hired Wehde as a hitman to kill Richter. The court heard this was because he was attempting to take sole custody of his child and was threatening to cut of the $1,000 in child support he was paying monthly to Richter. And then a key piece of evidence emerged - a pink spiral notebook that had been recovered from Wehde's car. In Wehde's handwriting, it suggested he had been hired as a hit-man by a ‘mysterious fellow’ named John Pitman III, who was Tracey's first husband. They split up four years after marrying in 1988. 'J.P. wants me to get/force his ex T.R. to kill her son Burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails Plan B is to make it appear as though T.R. had committed the murder of her son & then committed suicide,' he wrote. Tracey Richter was found guilty of an elaborate ruse to frame her first husband who was threatening to cut of alimony payments . Originally Tracey Richter was hailed as a hero for protecting her children against a home invasion but after the tireless work of Sac County Attorney Ben Smith her guilt was established in the murder of Dustin Wehde . But investigators never believed it was credible. Dustin, a special education student, did not like to write and he had never met Mr Pitman. Prosecutors suspect she had convinced Dustrin to write the diary, perhaps on the day he died. Roberts, on a business trip during the shooting, initially stood by his wife's account. But the two eventually divorced and Richter took primary custody of their children until her arrest last year. Roberts then moved with the children to a California city he has not disclosed, saying he fears for their safety. And days after her conviction, Richter was caught sending letters containing Roberts' Social Security number and other information that could be used to find him to an incarcerated Wisconsin sex offender. The female judge has ruled that because Richter held sole custody of her children for the ten years before her arrest she has a unique relationship with her children that needs to be preserved . A crucial piece of evidence that was presented during Richter's trial in October was a pink notebook that the prosecution claimed was written by Richter and not Wehde - who suffered from learning difficulties . Judge Whittenburg ruled that Richter's contact with the inmate was 'not consistent with the duties imposed on a joint legal custodian.' But she said Roberts didn't present enough evidence to justify hiding in California, saying: 'It is Michael who has created the distance and hardship that is attendant to visiting Tracey in Iowa.' Whittenburg ordered Roberts to disclose their address so Richter can send her children mail, including tapes of her reading them books. In addition to the visits, Richter was granted 30-minute phone conversations on the kids' birthdays. Roberts' attorney, Eric Borseth, said he was considering appealing the decision, which he called the first of its kind in Iowa. Borseth said he was also exploring settlement options that would allow Roberts and the children to return to Australia, where he has employment opportunities and family support. Remembered: The grave site for Dustin Wehde in . Holstein, Iowa. Seen through the middle of the heart is the gravestone . of his father, Brett, who committed suicide at that spot the year after . his son's death . 'We were disappointed in the ruling, primarily because we didn't believe it was in the best interests of the children to be visiting her at the prison,' Borseth said. 'The biggest concern we have, other than the trauma of going to a prison and seeing your mom there, is that mom and her family have continued to blame Michael for the predicament she's in.' Smith, the prosecutor, said he believed the decision did not consider Roberts' rights as a father. 'It's just mindboggling how somebody that is convicted of murder, fraud and perjury still gets a say,' he said. 'And not only does she get a say, the spouse is ordered to travel 1,500 miles to facilitate visitation with the very person that was convicted of the murder but yet blames him for it. Can you imagine?'","Judge has ruled that Michael Roberts can not take his children with him to Australia as their murderer mother still has legal visitation rights .

"It’s the game on many-a-young-person’s wish list. And for those who can’t wait for its release on next-gen consoles, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes has finally arrived on their rickety older brothers. But don’t expect to be punished for your impatience – for TT Games have squeezed every last drop of processing power from the aging Xbox 360 and PS3 to create their best-looking LEGO game to date. Hectic: for the most part, the game engine performs well - but on larger sections there can be some slowdown . Plot sees Doctor Doom teaming up with Loki to build a super-weapon from cosmic bricks, and it’s up to the Marvel team to stop them. But where LEGO Batman 2 DC Super Heroes held a lot of the playable characters back to the latter parts of the game, here you’re exposed to many playable heroes early on. From Spiderman, Thor, Hulk and Iron Man to the Fantastic Four and X-Men, it’s certainly an eclectic mix, but one that works surprisingly well. True to its roots: all of the characters are instantly recognisable . All stay true to their comic-book roots, and while some characters have abilities in common, every one has their own distinct animation and special ability. Whereas Spiderman can use his web to swing around and bind objects together, Thor can use his lightening to charge devices. And so forth. These come in handy when solving the game’s numerous puzzles – with certain characters’ abilities needed to complete each one. It takes two: co-operative mode makes a comeback and there is a wide variety of Heroes to choose from . It’s a tried and tested formula, and one that TT has long used in their LEGO games. But even though there is a slight whiff of this design starting to become stale, the open-world second part of the game more than makes up for it. Here you are given free range of Manhattan, tasked with numerous side-missions – such as checkpoint races - and unlocking new characters. It’s noticeably more populated and alive than in LEGO Batman 2, and it is backed up with mostly vibrant visuals. Sadly, though, the camera can prove an annoyance – especially when flying and playing through latter stages with a friend. Characters can get wedged in the environment, too. Thinking games: puzzles usually require a combination of multiple Super Hero powers to solve them . Flaws aside, TT Games have delivered another brilliant LEGO game. It may not be a radical change from the other outings – and maybe it’s time to try something new – but for now, it’s the best LEGO game yet. Just Marvel-ous. Version tested: Xbox 360 .

"Iron Maiden lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson has given heavy metal to millions of rock fans around the world. Now he’s bringing thousands of tons of it to South Wales - with the launch of an aviation company. Dickinson, a commercial airline pilot and established aviation entrepreneur, has set up Cardiff Aviation Limited, which will provide specialist services to the airline industry. Rocking the aviation business: Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson has set up Cardiff Aviation Limited . He hopes it will create around 1,000 jobs. The business will be based at St Athan Enterprise Zone in the Vale of Glamorgan, where it has taken 132,000 square feet of hangar space. It is expected the first clients will be announced next month, and the first Boeing 747 simulator has been purchased and is due for delivery in June. Dickinson, whose band was the subject of the documentary film Flight 666, said: ‘We're coming into this enterprise with the knowledge we'll be bringing business to South Wales. ‘A cautious projection is that we'd expect to create up to a thousand jobs within 18 months based on the level of interest and commitment from aircraft manufacturers and operators. High flyer: Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson (blue shirt) has flown large passenger jets during his time away from prowling concert stages . ‘South Wales has long had an association with the aircraft industry and I am delighted I am able to play a small part in the continuation of that tradition.’ Cardiff Aviation will be taking on the lease on the Welsh Government-owned Twin Peaks hangar to establish a maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) operation. As well as providing maintenance for aircraft up to Boeing 767 size, the firm will offer training packages and technical support services. Dickinson, who has flown his band in their ‘Ed Force One’ Boeing 757 during an Iron Maiden world tour, said he was grateful to the Welsh Government for its support. He added: ‘We've been impressed by how pro-active they've been. They've really wanted to make this happen, and we've experienced a level of enthusiasm and drive that has been a delight to behold. Bruce Dickinson belts out an Iron Maiden classic on stage with Daved Murray (right) and Adrian Smith . ‘We expect to announce the names of our first clients in May, and we're also currently dealing with expressions of interest from several more major and independent airlines.’ The 53-year songwriter also said the venture could provide a welcome boost to Cardiff Airport, which has recently seen visitor numbers drop and also drawn criticism from First Minister Carwyn Jones. Dickinson said: ‘The added value we can bring to the package is, while the team is expert in the provision of technical services, we also have expertise in aircraft sourcing and leasing. ‘This is another key aspect to the deployment of a total aviation services package, hopefully including the development of new airline services for South Wales. ‘Cardiff Airport has tremendous potential to challenge the successful English regional airports.’ Among those welcoming today's announcement was Wales's Business Minister Edwina Hart. Dickinson's plan is part of the regeneration of the St Athan Enterprise Zone near Aberthaw Power Station . She said: ‘The Welsh Government has been working closely with Bruce Dickinson and Cardiff Aviation on this exciting project for some time and we are delighted it has come to fruition. ‘This is exactly the type of investment needed, which will create hundreds of well-paid skilled jobs in one of our key sectors. ‘We have a strong, dynamic aerospace sector in Wales and this investment will build upon the skilled workforce that already exists in the area, providing a range of career opportunities. ‘This is a flagship operation and provides a great start for the new Aerospace Enterprise Zone.’ Last year, the Welsh Government confirmed it was setting up five enterprise zones in Wales, each specialising in a different sector. St Athan will focus on aerospace and officials say it has the potential to create up to 10,000 jobs by 2025. Its first tenant was announced in January, when classic aircraft firm Hunter Flying said it was signing a one-year lease on two hangars.","Bruce Dickinson has set up Cardiff Aviation Limited to provide services to the airline industry .

"A Canadian radio host and newspaper columnist took off her top during an interview with her local mayor this week and continued asking him questions bare-chested. Lori Welbourne, who hosts the radio show On The Rocks and writes a column for the Province newspaper, was talking to Walter Gray, mayor of Kelowna in British Columbia, about whether it was legal in the town for women to bare their breasts in public. 'What if I went walking down the street topless?' she asked in the recorded interview. Scroll down for video . Bare: Lori Welbourne, right, was talking to Walter Gray, mayor of Kelowna in British Columbia, left, when she stripped off . But before Gray could answer her question, Welbourne handed him her microphone and undid the strap on her dress, exposing her breasts. 'What are you doing,' he asked, to which she replied, 'it's really hot in here.' After regaining his composure, Gray explained that while someone may be tempted to call the police there is little authorities could do because it is in fact entirely legal for a woman to be topless anywhere a man can be. Interview: The journalist, right, was already exposing a fair amount before she removed her top . Welbourne's stunt was in anticipation of Sunday's Go Topless Day. Public toplessness is not illegal anywhere in Canada unless it's deemed to be indecent. It is also legal for women in a range of American states though plenty still outlaw. 'So I can go topless here in Kelowna?' Welbourne went on. Topless: The stunt was to draw attention to Go Topless Day, which was celebrated on Sunday . 'Well, evidently,' Gray said. 'I'm not suggesting you should do that but I don't think you’d be committing any crime or breaking any bylaw.' Groups of women turned out shirtless in cities including New York on August 25 to celebrate a women's right to bare her breasts in public. The annual event was started in 2007. Welbourne went on to ask the mayor whether he was aware we are all naked under our clothes and whether he had any piercing and he replied in good humor.","Lori Welbourne was talking to Walter Gray, mayor of Kelowna in British Columbia, Canada ahead of Sunday's Go Topless Day .

"When Perfect Dark Zero graced the Xbox 360, it served as a stunning showpiece of the console’s power. Entertaining it was not. The same can be said for Dead Rising 3. Indeed, when you’re first treated to hundreds of the undead roaming the streets of Los Perdidos, California, it’s a wonderful glimpse inside the Xbox One’s graphical potential. Sadly, within 30 minutes, boring, repetitive mission structure sets in and undoes all the hard work. View to a kill: make too much noise and you'll quickly be surrounded by hordes of the undead . Set 10 years after the events of Dead Rising 2, you play Nick Ramos, who has to escape the city before the army levels it with airstrikes. Basic plot, yes – but in similar vein to the other games, Dead Rising 3 tries to make the battle for survival as entertaining as possible. A large part of this revolves around the combat. Los Perdidos is littered with potential weapons – from plant pots and hairdryers, to more damaging kitanas, baseball bats, guns and machetes. But it’s the ability to create and combine weapons that hold the most intrigue, the best of which involves splicing a motorcycle engine with some boxing gloves. Vehicles, too, can be modified. Full steam ahead: the RollerHawg (above) is easily the best combination vehicle in the game . Strewn around the city, usable cars, bikes and lorries are indicated by flashing lights. In their ‘naked’ form, they’re easily damaged – with several zombies hanging on to your bumper and bonnet within seconds of starting the engine. But when spliced with other vehicles, they become different beasts all together. The RollerHawg is  perhaps the best example – a mix of motorbike and a steamroller, mounted with flamethrowers and capable of mowing down undead hordes within seconds. There are also plenty of costumes around – ranging from sports wear, full-on mascot outfits and more casual offerings. Dead Rising 3 tries so hard to please, but sadly the gimmicks can't hide the paper-thin gameplay. Mission structure too often involves running from one place to another, bashing some baddies or finding some item of interest, before returning. Psycho: this fellow is one of the game's early, human bosses - yet he takes hundreds of bullets to bring down . Backtracking is a soul-destroying affair, and it plagues Dead Rising 3. Boss battles, too – although the foes remain as varied as ever – are not particularly enjoyable. Often involving human foes rather than the undead, it’s ironic and absurd when watching a boss take 100s of bullets to the face, only to watch them shake it off and carry on. It just jars with the rest of the game... Driving too, isn’t as fun as it could be. Although there’s a variety of sports cars and motorbikes, the inclusion of these high-performance vehicles is odd, as - given how cramped the roads are – you’ll never come close to their top speed. Crash landing: the city may be large in scale, but roads are cramped and cumbersome to meander . The driving sections also highlight a more sinister problem… slowdown. As impressive the hordes of zombies are, the console does struggle when things get hectic (and this happens a lot). Textures will pop up, items will float in the air for no reason. These are problems expected of a launch title, but are nevertheless slightly disheartening. Still, it’s a solid entry into the series, even though it’s largely a case of style over substance.

"The heiress to the Wrigley Gum fortune came to the rescue of a US Marine by chartering a private jet to fly two dogs he rescued in Afghanistan to his new home in North Carolina. Staff Sgt Andrew Morales had adopted the two Anatolian shepherds, named Dusty and Wyatt, while deployed in Afghanistan almost three years ago and brought them back to San Diego with him. But recently he was reassigned from his base in . southern California to camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Morales called various airlines to book travel for the dogs, but was . told that the dogs were too big for commercial planes landing at the . airport at his new base. Helen Rosburg, the great-granddaughter of chewing gum industrialist William Wrigley, heard that Morales might have to lose his dogs through a plea for help on Facebook from the rescue league that helped Morales bring the dogs from Afghanistan to California. Flight of a lifetime: Staff Sgt Andrew Morales, centre, rescued the two Anatolian shepherds while deployed in Afghanistan. Here he is seen leaving the jet that took him and his dogs to North Carolina, courtesy of Helen Rosburg . Good deed: A private jet, paid for by Wrigley Heiress Helen Rosburg, flew the two dogs that were rescued in Afghanistan by their US Marine owner, Staff Sgt Andrew Morales, centre, to their new home in North Carolina . Good Samaritan: Helen Rosburg, heiress to the Wrigley Gum fortune, is an animal lover and wanted to help Morales so he wouldn't lose his dogs . ‘He was going to lose his dogs and I said ""Not on my watch"",’ Rosburg told ABC Affiliate WWAY. ‘He's a hero on so many different levels. The Wrigleys are an extremely patriotic family and I am a true Wrigley child.’ The thought of losing the dogs was devastating to Morales. ‘In Afghanistan, they are pretty much your best friend,’ Morales told ABC. 'Not on my watch': He was going to lose his dogs said Rosburg, who stepped in to help . A man's best friend: Morales said he had become so close with the two dogs while in Afghanistan they were 'pretty much your best friend' The two are brothers from the same litter, strays that were looking at grim futures before he decided to take them in. 'They've experienced some pretty bad things,' said Morales to 10 News. 'If you look at their ears, tails ... from what I understand, Afghans cut them off for fighting.' He called the rescue league that had initially helped bring the dogs back from Afghanistan, and they made an online appeal on the family's behalf. Rosburg acknowledged she has a reputation for rescuing animals and at-risk youth, as well as supporting the military. ‘Everybody in my circle knows what I do,’ said Rosburg. ‘If they see an impossible situation, they'll post something to my [Facebook] timeline.’ Bleak future: The two are brothers from the same litter and were strays with grim futures before Morales decided to take them in . Rosburg has a reputation for rescuing animals and at-risk youth, as well as supporting the military, which is why she stepped in to help Morales and his dogs . Rosburg is a horse exhibitor and published romance novelist who raises German shepherds for ‘personal protection, military, police, service’. She is the founder of animal rescue organization, On the Wings of Angels Rescue, and has pigs, chickens, goats, cattle, donkeys, rabbits, cats and exotic birds on her farm in Tampa, Florida. The Wrigley Company was founded on April 1, 1891, originally selling products such as soap and baking powder which then branched into chewing gum. In  2008, it was announced that Mars, Incorporated would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion. Happy man: The US Marine has his two dogs with him and says he is thrilled Rosburg came to their rescue . 'They quickly became a big part of our family, they're my babies,' said Kristen Morales, Andrew¿s wife . The Morales family said they were thrilled that Rosburg came to their rescue, and said they would love to thank her in person one day. 'They quickly became a big part of our family, they're my babies,' according to Kristen Morales, Andrew’s wife. ‘From the bottom of me and my wife's hearts we really appreciate what she did for us,’ said Morales. Last year, a former Marine, Shaun Duling, raised $4,000 to be reunited with a dog he was forced to leave behind in Afghanistan. Duling enlisted the help of an organization called Nowzad, which helps rescue animals in Afghanistan, to bring the stray back to his home in Alexandria, Virginia.","Staff Sgt Andrew Morales had rescued the two Anatolian shepherds, named Dusty and Wyatt, while deployed in Afghanistan .

"author] . Scientists have warned that the collapse of bee colonies could trigger a farming crisis, but why populations are being hit so hard has remained largely a mystery. Now one group of experts has proved that two widely used neonicotinoids - a class of insecticide – harm honeybee colonies over the winter, particularly when temperatures drop. Research revealed that even low doses of an insecticide called clothianidin had an adverse effect on hives. Although Hv1a/GNA was carried to the brain of the honeybee (stock image), it had no effect on the insect, which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee . There are only enough honeybees in Britain to properly pollinate a quarter of the country’s crops, scientists claim. Destruction of huge swathes of grassland and the use of agricultural chemicals have caused a spiralling drop in the populations of honeybees, which are vital for food production. Professor Simon Potts of the University of Reading, who led the research project, said: ‘We face a catastrophe in future years unless we act now.’ The research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that Europe has 13.4million too few honeybee colonies to properly pollinate all its crops. Bee populations have plummeted as their meadowland habitats were concreted over and their wildflower food supply killed by herbicides. Previous studies have estimated that the number of British honeybees have halved over the last 25 years. Scientists think the bee shortfall is leading to reduced crop yields and they warn that in future farmers may have to look at mechanical or hand pollination. The study by the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, strengthens the scientists’ findings from last year that low doses of imidacloprid - another neonicotinoid - are linked to colony collapse disorder (CCD) where bees abandon their hives over the winter and eventually die. Although other studies have suggested that CCD-related mortality in honeybee colonies may come from bees’ reduced resistance to mites or parasites as a result of exposure to pesticides, the new study found that bees in the hives exhibiting CCD had almost identical levels of pathogen infestation as a group of control hives, most of which survived the winter. This finding suggests that the neonicotinoids are causing some other kind of biological mechanism in bees that in turn leads to CCD, according to the study, published in the Bulletin of Insectology. ‘We demonstrated again in this study that neonicotinoids are highly likely to be responsible for triggering CCD in honeybee hives that were healthy prior to the arrival of winter,’ said lead author Chensheng (Alex) Lu, associate professor of environmental exposure biology at HSPH. The new pesticide, Hv1a/GNA, has no effect on bees' learning, which is key to their foraging for food. Researchers said that the chemical cocktail has potential as an environmentally friendly 'bee safe' pesticide and an alternative to those suspected of decimating colonies. A stock image of crop spraying is pictured . Since 2006, there have been significant losses of honeybees from CCD. Pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one-third of all crops worldwide. Experts have considered a number of possible causes, including pathogen infestation, beekeeping practices, and pesticide exposure. Recent findings suggest that CCD is related specifically to neonicotinoids including imidacloprid and clothianidin, which may impair bees’ neurological functions. Together with experts from the Worcester County Beekeepers Association, the scientists studied the health of 18 honeybee colonies in three locations in central Massachusetts between October 2012 and April 2013. At each location, the researchers separated six colonies into three groups -one treated with imidacloprid, one with clothianidin and one untreated. There was a steady decline in the size of all the bee colonies at the beginning of winter, which is typical among hives during the colder months in New England. The battle bee-gins: Since 2006, there have been significant losses of honey bees (pictured) from CCD. Pinpointing the cause is crucial to mitigating this problem since bees are prime pollinators of roughly one-third of all crops worldwide . Beginning in January 2013, honeybee populations in the control colonies began to increase as expected, but populations in the neonicotinoid-treated hives continued to decline. By April 2013, half of the neonicotinoid-treated colonies were lost with abandoned hives that are typical of CCD. While the 12 pesticide-treated hives in the current study experienced a 50 per cent CCD mortality rate, the authors noted that in their 2012 study, bees in pesticide-treated hives had a much higher CCD mortality rate of 94 per cent. That earlier bee die-off occurred during the particularly cold and prolonged winter of 2010-2011, leading the authors to speculate that colder temperatures, in combination with neonicotinoids, may play a role in the severity of CCD. ‘Although we have demonstrated the validity of the association between neonicotinoids and CCD in this study, future research could help elucidate the biological mechanism that is responsible for linking sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposures to CCD,’ said Professor Lu. ‘Hopefully we can reverse the continuing trend of honeybee loss.’ In a bid to stop the rapid decline, experts fitted ‘backpack’ sensors to 5,000 bees in Australia in January to unravel why colonies there do not seem to be affected by  the ‘colony collapse disorder’ that is decimating bee populations in other countries. The research aims to improve honey bee pollination and productivity on farms as well. Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) fitted 5,000 tiny sensors, measuring just 2.5mm squared to the backs of honeybees in Hobart, Tasmania, before releasing them into the wild. It is the first time such large numbers of insects have been used for environmental monitoring. ‘Honeybees play a vital role in the landscape through a free pollination service for agriculture, which various crops rely on to increase yields’ said CSIRO science leader Dr Paulo de Souza, who is heading up the swarm sensing project. ‘A recent CSIRO study showed bee pollination in Faba beans can lead to a productivity increase of 17 per cent. ‘Around one third of the food we eat relies on pollination, but honeybee populations around the world are crashing because of the dreaded Varroa mite and Colony Collapse Disorder. The research will also look at the impacts of agricultural pesticides on honeybees by monitoring insects that feed at sites with trace amounts of commonly used chemicals.

"An art collector at the centre of a row over £1billion of masterpieces believed to be stolen by Nazi's during World War II is the son of a dealer who pillaged remorselessly on behalf of Adolf Hitler, it has been revealed. Customs officials in Germany seized the paintings from Cornelius Gurlitt, 80, from his flat in Munich but he is fighting to get them back saying they were collected legitimately. It has now been revealed that his father Hildebrand was involved in the systematic looting of Jews across the Third Reich, according to Der Spiegel. Paintings were seized from the home of Cornelius Gurlitt, 80, pictured left.  It is alleged his father Hildebrand Gurlitt, pictured right, was involved in the systematic looting of Jews . A vast portion of this loot was . discovered by the 'Monuments Men' section of the US Army, tasked with . finding the stolen art of Europe and restoring it to its rightful . owners. The . Monuments Men moved into the Bavarian village of Aschbach in Bavaria in . April 1945 and arrested the local Nazi party leader Baron Gerhard von . Pölnitz who lived in the local castle along with art dealer Karl . Haberstock and Hildebrand Gurlitt whose house in Dresden had been . destroyed in the Allied bombing in February of that year. A . note from a Monuments Men team member found in an archive detailed the . astonishing artworks found in the castle: 'Rooms containing paintings, . tapestries, statues, valuable furniture and documents from the . belongings of two notorious German art dealers were found in the . castle.' Another . reads: 'A large room on the upper floor with 34 boxes, two packages . containing carpets, eight packages of books … one room on the ground . floor containing an additional 13 boxes owned by Mr Gurlitt.' Most of . these boxes contained pictures and drawings. Pictured: . The Munich apartment where officials discovered the hidden paintings which could be worth £1bn . Gurlitt, they wrote, was 'an art collector from Hamburg with connections within high-level Nazi circles. He acted on behalf of other Nazi officials and made many trips to France, from where he brought home art collections. There is reason to believe that these private art collections consist of looted art from other countries.' Gurlitt was described as an 'art dealer to the Führer.' Cornelius Gurlitt, who would go on to . inherit many of these treasures, was 12 at the time and living in the . castle with his father.  Hildebrand was quizzed by the Americans in June . 1945 and they noted he seemed 'extremely nervous' as if he was not . telling them the truth. 'Sitting . Woman' by Henri Matisse and a formerly unknown painting of French . artist Marc Chagall were both discovered among the £1bn artwork that is . believed to have been plundered from Jews during WWII. 'It . was during those days that Gurlitt, the 'art dealer to the Führer,' reinvented himself: as a victim of the Nazis, a man who had saved . precious artworks from destruction and someone who had never done . anything malicious,' said Spiegel. Gurlitt . said: 'I had to decide between the war and the work for museums. I . never bought a picture that wasn't offered to me voluntarily. As I . heard, laws were also enacted in France so that Jewish art collections . could be confiscated. But I never saw it with my own eyes.' Loot: American soldiers are pictured discovering one of Hildebrandt Gurlitt's enormous art stash during the war. Although they suspected him of dealing in Nazi art, they let him go . Among the paintings that the Americans returned to Hildebrandt in 1950 and which have turned up in the Munich trove are Max Liebermann's Two Riders On The Beach (above) The Americans were more interested in Haberstock.  He later complained that they had underestimated Gurlitt's role during the Nazi period. In a 1949 letter to a government official, he wrote: 'I was able to prove everything, including, for example, that I was not the main supplier for Linz, whereas Mr Voss, during his short term in office, bought about 3,000 artworks and took over confiscated collections together with his main buyer, Dr Hildebrand Gurlitt.'  Linz was to the be the city where Hitler intended to build the world's biggest art museum after the war. Hermann Voss, a museum director from . Wiesbaden, ran the art-buying programme for the Linz project from 1943 . onward.  Gurlitt worked for Hitler through Voss, who served as a . middleman. One . painting he bought at a rocket bottom price was by the Bulgarian painter . Jules Pascin called 'The Studio of the Painter Grossmann.' In . fact, Gurlitt bought the Pascin in 1935 for 600 Reichsmark, much less . than it was worth, from a Jew called Julius Ferdinand Wollf, who would . later commit suicide.  After originally confiscating it the Americans . gave it back to Gurlit in 1950. Under . Hitler, Gurlitt was tasked to sell modern art - 'Degenerate Art' it was . called by Hitler - abroad to bring in hard currency for the regime. One man he fleeced out of drawings by Adolf Menzel was Erns Julius . Wolffson, a Jewish doctor in Hamburg. Control: Hitler only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern 'dissident' pieces to show German people what not to like. Many of those paintings that appeared in those shows have been found in Gurlitt's collection . Spiegel also discovered Gurlitt senior struck up a relationship with Cornelius Müller Hofstede, a  Nazi in German Silesia, now Poland, appointed  to appraise the collections of persecuted Jews to sell on the open market. 'It was also Müller Hofstede who . obtained the Max Liebermann painting 'Two Riders on the Beach' for . Gurlitt. A few weeks ago, the work was one of the first pictures from . the confiscated Gurlitt collection in Munich to be shown at a press . conference. The Nazis had confiscated it from sugar refiner David . Friedmann, who died in 1942. Friedmann's daughter was killed in a . concentration camp in 1943,' said Spiegel. Gurlitt . also bought a painting at a knock down price from a Jewish couple . called the Kaims from Breslau who were later sent to the Warsaw Ghetto . and then to the gas chambers at Treblinka. The . magazine also discovered he bought millions of marks worth of paintings . under dubious circumstances from collectors in France.  In 1950, . Gurlitt's art was restored to him and he also made off with treasures he . had hidden in an old water mill. Spiegel . said of him: 'There are many examples of works that Gurlitt acquired . under questionable circumstances. There are also a number of pictures . hanging in German museums today, from Hanover to Wiesbaden, that were . bought from Gurlitt. There are even pictures that Gurlitt bought for . Hitler's museum in Linz, which, because of their unclear origins, became . the property of the state.' Sold: The Lion Tamer, by Max Beckmann, was sold by Gurlitt before the collection was discovered for £750,000 .","Customs officials in Germany seized the paintings from Cornelius Gurlitt, 80 .

"Allegations have surfaced suggesting that eccentric late writer Gore Vidal was a pedophile. The claims have been made by his half-sister, author Nina Straight, and his nephew, Hollywood actor and director Burr Steers, who are in the process of contesting the essayist's will. Vidal died last year, aged 86, from pneumonia and left his entire estate, estimated at $37 million, to Harvard University. In a feature that appeared in the New York Times, Ms Straight - who had a 'turbulent though close relationship' with Vidal - said the openly-gay author had had sex with underage men. She described the alleged circumstances as 'Jerry Sandusky acts', referring to the former Penn State assistant football coach convicted of child molestation. Mr Steers - who directed the Zac Efron film Charlie St Cloud - said that conservative columnist William F. Buckley - who had a long-running public feud with Vidal, which also played out in court - had evidence linking Vidal to the alleged crimes. Accused: Gore Vidal, an acclaimed U.S. writer who penned the screenplay for Ben Hurr, has been accused of being a pedophile . Controversial: Burr Steers, who directed movies Igby Goes Down and Charlie St Cloud, with his uncle Gore Vidal, whom he helped looked after before the writer's death. Mr Steers said allegations that Vidal had sex with children would 'make sense' Jerry Sandusky, assistant football coach at Penn State University, is a convicted serial child molester. In 2011, following a two-year grand jury investigation, Sandusky was arrested and charged with 52 counts of sexual abuse of young boys over a 15-year period. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Gore Vidal's half-sister, Nina Straight, alleged that Vidal did 'Jerry Sandusky acts' Vidal was said to be 'terrified' about the information Buckley had against him. 'I know Buckley had a file on him that Gore feared,' Mr Steers said in the New York Times article. 'It would make sense if that material was about him having underage sex. 'Gore spent alot of time in Bangkok, after all.' The Thailand capital is known for child prostitution, with an estimated 2000 children said to be forced into the industry. In 2012, Buckley's son Christopher worte in an essay for New Republic that he had disposed of a file his father kept on Vidal. 'When WFB [William F. Buckley] died, in 2008, I found in his study, more cluttered than King Tut's tomb, a file cabinet bursting to the seams, labeled 'Vidal Legal',' Christopher wrote. 'Into the dumpster it went, and I still remember the sigh of relief upon heaving it in.' Retrospect: Gore Vidal (right) debates politics with conservative William Buckley during the 1968 election. Buckley is said to have had a 'Vidal file' of incriminating evidence . The New York Times article also says that the ever-opinionated Vidal had a strange and controversial take on the abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests. 'He would say that the young guys involved were hustlers who were sending signals,' Mr Steers said. However the author of the article, Tim Teeman, wrote that 'other friends of Mr. Vidal told me they doubted he had sex with underage men'. In 2009, Vidal hit headlines for referring to the 13-year-old victim in the Roman Polanski rape case as a 'young hooker'. Vidal suffered from dementia and alcoholism towards the end of his life. Mr Steers said he would drink single male scotch 'until he collapsed'. Vidal also had 'wet brain' - proper name Wernicke-Korsakoff - a syndrome characterized by a number of symptoms, including confusion and hallucination. It is this illness that Ms Straight is using in challenging Vidal's will, saying he was not mentally competent when he filed it. Gore Vidal attends the MOCA NEW 30th anniversary gala in Los Angeles in November 2009. Vidal changed his will the year before his death to give his entire estate to Harvard University, where he once gave guest lectures but was never a student. Having written 25 novels and 26 non-fiction works, Harvard also receives profits from the continued sales of Vidal's books. Ms Straight said she is owed around a million dollars by her half brother after she paid his legal fees for his court battle with Buckley.

"Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates has said the world must use the lessons from battling Ebola to prepare for a future 'war' against a global killer disease. At a recent conference in Berlin, Mr Gates said the risk of a worldwide pandemic is so high it is reckless not to act now - and added technology will be a crucial asset in the fight against disease. He explained: 'We don't know it will happen but it's a high enough chance that one of the lessons of Ebola should be to ask ourselves: are we as ready for that as we should be? 'A good comparison is that we prepare ourselves for war - we have planes and training and we practise.' Scroll down for video . Speaking at a recent conference in Berlin, Bill Gates (pictured) said the risk of a worldwide pandemic is so high it is reckless not to act now . He explained: 'Are we as ready for that as we should be? A good comparison is that we prepare ourselves for war - we have planes and training and we practise' He said this included building teams of volunteers who are ready to mobilise quickly in a public health emergency, similar to schemes developed in the countries hit hardest by Ebola such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, which registered almost 9,000 deaths in the last year. 'Look at the death chart of the 20th century,' he told Vox this week. 'I think everybody would say there must be a spike for World War I. Sure enough, there it is, like 25 million. And there must be a big spike for World War II, and there it is, it's like 65 million. 'But then you'll see this other spike that is as large as World War II right after World War I, and most people, would say, 'What was that?' Well, that was the Spanish flu.' The deadly flu virus attacked more than one-third of the world's population, and within months killed more than 65 million people - three times as many as the World War I - and did it quicker than any other illness in recorded history. He said this included building teams of volunteers who are ready to mobilise quickly in a public health emergency, similar to schemes developed in the countries hit hardest by Ebola such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (pictured), which registered almost 9,000 deaths in the last year . In particular, Mr Gates fears a Spanish flu-like epidemic similar to the one that killed more than 65 million people in 1918 could decimate populations in a matter of months. In this image, patients of the Spanish flu lie in Influenza Ward No. 1 in a French hospital as doctors battled the virus and the effects of the War . Researchers recently discovered the pandemic virus arose shortly before 1918, when a human H1 virus, which they believe had already been circulating in the human population since about 1900, picked up genetic material from a bird flu virus. Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults. Microsoft's co-founder originally made the comments at a donor conference for the Gavi alliance which delivers vaccines to poor countries in January. Lacking a reliable cure, public health groups concentrated on prevention . The deadly flu virus attacked more than one-third of the world's population, and within months had killed more than 65 million people - three times as many as the World War I - and did it more quickly than any other illness in recorded history. Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile, elderly, or already weakened patients; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults. To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, Britain, France, and the United States. However, newspapers were free to report the epidemic's effects in Spain, creating a false impression of Spain as being especially hard hit - and leading to the pandemic's nickname Spanish flu. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation, researchers believe. The global mortality rate from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known, but an estimated 10% to 20% of those who were infected died, with estimates of the total number of deaths ranging from 50 to 100 million people. Calling vaccines the 'biggest saver of lives' worldwide, the 59-year-old praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel for hosting the conference and making vaccinations a priority of her G7 presidency this year. However,  he said he was 'concerned' about an anti-vaccination trend in the West, due to exaggerated fears of risks associated with the jabs, that was leading to dangerous outbreaks. 'Our focus is on the poor children where you have millions that die of vaccine-preventable disease. It's unfortunate that you're not getting 100-per cent coverage in the rich countries,' he said. 'They're choosing to potentially infect somebody who can't protect themselves,' he said, noting the renewed spread of illnesses such as measles and pertussis (whooping cough).

'I'm glad there are people who are championing reducing these misunderstandings in rich countries because of the risk that creates.' Mr Gates - ranked by Forbes magazine as the world's richest man with a net worth of some $80 billion (£52 billion) - said the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation already distributes about $4 billion each year to help the world's neediest. Ebola's 'Achilles heel' has been identified by a team of scientists, prompting hopes of new treatments to stop the virus spreading. Researchers in New York believe they have located the vital protein, which affects whether or not the virus can spread to infect its victim. Their study found the virus can only invade host cells by attaching to the protein - called Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). If it is unable to access that protein, it loses the ability to infect and kill its victim. The vicious disease has infected almost 27,000 people, killing 11,135, in the last 18 months. It is also a major contributor to the Gavi alliance, which Tuesday drew pledges of $7.5 billion to help immunise 300 million more children in developing countries over the next five years. And he continued technology is a crucial asset in his foundation's field work, seen most recently in a drive against polio. 'We use satellite photos to find out where people are living, we use a GPS tracker with a cell phone so that we can see if the vaccine team is going to every place they're supposed to go, we do statistical analysis within a few days to see if there's any kids that we missed,' he said. 'Measurement is a pretty natural private sector thing... Innovative new technologies are going to make it possible to see what's going on with far less cost.' Mr Gates said moving from the world of big business to working in villages in the developing world where people 'have no idea who I am' had been satisfying. 'I was super proud of the work I did at Microsoft..it let me carry the message of software out into the world in a very enthused way,' he said. 'Now I have a different message, my wife and I, that we should be generous to the poor. To the degree I have visibility hopefully I'm using that in a positive way.'","Gates said the risk of a pandemic meant it was reckless not to act now .

"Accusations of drinking among House Republicans during late-night debates spread like wildfire this weekend as they brought the government ever closer to a shutdown. Members of the political press corps made the claims from Capitol Hill on Saturday night. Politico reporter Ginger Gibson tweeted: 'I'm not over exaggerating when I say I can smell the booze wafting from members as they walk off the floor.' There were reports from other sources of members of Congress 'putting a few back' on Penn - presumably referring to Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown DC. One reporter added that she had run into two politicians in a liquor store. All work and no play... Rumors ran riot last night that Republicans in the House were drinking during the debates on Capitol Hill . Names of those letting their hair down in the midst of pressing government business have yet to emerge. The rumors of drinking came as Republicans voted to halt President Obama's plans to overhaul US healthcare. The move could lead to the first government shutdown in almost two decades. The Republican-controlled House approved legislation early on Sunday imposing a one-year delay in key parts of the nation's health care law and repealing a tax on medical devices as the price for avoiding a partial government shutdown in a few days' time. Even before the House voted, Senate Democrats pledged to reject the measure and the White House issued a statement vowing a veto in any event. Republicans are pursuing 'a narrow ideological agenda ... and pushing the government towards shutdown,' it said. Boozing? Congressional reporter for Politico Ginger Gibson tweeted this message late on Saturday night from Capitol Hill . Shaming: Kate Nocera, a reporter on Capitol Hill for BuzzFeed, shared a similar statement about politicians enjoying a few beverages with her followers . Spreading like wildfire: Members of the public were keen to know just which members of the House had been hitting the bar . The Senate is not scheduled to meet until mid-afternoon on Monday, ten hours before a shutdown would begin, and even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage in the fast-approaching end game. If . so, a House GOP rank-and-file that includes numerous tea party allies . would soon have to choose between triggering the first partial shutdown . in nearly two decades - or coming away empty-handed from their latest . confrontation with Obama. Undeterred, . House Republicans pressed ahead with their latest attempt to squeeze a . concession from the White House in exchange for letting the government . open for business normally on Tuesday. 'Obamacare is based on a . limitless government, bureaucratic arrogance and a disregard of a will . of the people,' said Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. Another . Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, reacted angrily when asked . whether he would eventually support a standalone spending bill if . needed to prevent a shutdown. 'How dare you presume a failure? How dare . you? How dare you?' he said. Demands: Speaker of the House John Boehner is followed by reporters. Republicans are attempting to delay Obamacare by one year. (There is no suggestion that anyone pictured was involved in drinking) Apart . from its impact on the health care law, the legislation that House . Republicans decided to back would assure routine funding for government . agencies through December 15. Under House rules, the measure went to the . Senate after lawmakers voted 248-174 to repeal the medical tax, then . 231-192 for the one-year delay in Obamacare. A companion measure to assure U.S. troops are paid in the event of a shutdown passed unanimously. The . government spending measure marked something of a reduction in demands . by House Republicans, who passed legislation several days ago that would . permanently strip the health care law of money while providing funding . for the government. It . also contained significant concessions from a party that long has . criticized the health care law for imposing numerous government mandates . on industry, in some cases far exceeding what Republicans have been . willing to support in the past. Acknowledging as much, Rep. Trent . Franks, R-Ariz., said that as a conservative he had often found during . Obama's presidency that his choice was 'between something bad or . (something) horrible'. GOP . aides said that under the legislation headed toward a vote, most . portions of the health law that already have gone into effect would . remain unchanged. That includes requirements for insurance companies to . guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions and to require children . to be covered on their parents' plans until age 26. It would not change a . part of the law that reduces costs for seniors with high prescription . drug expenses. ne exception would give insurers or others the right not to provide abortion coverage, based on religious or moral objections. The . measure would delay implementation of a requirement for all individuals . to purchase coverage or face a penalty, and of a separate feature of . the law that will create marketplaces where individuals can shop for . coverage from private insurers. By . repealing the medical device tax, the GOP measure also would raise . deficits — an irony for a party that won the House majority in 2010 by . pledging to get the nation's finances under control. The . Senate rejected the most recent House-passed anti-shutdown bill on a . party-line vote of 54-44 Friday, insisting on a straightforward . continuation in government funding without health care-related add-ons. That left the next step up to the House - with time to avert a partial shutdown growing ever shorter. For . a moment at least, the revised House proposal papered over a simmering . dispute between Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the leadership, and . tea party conservatives who have been more militant about abolishing . the health law that all Republican lawmakers oppose. It . was unclear whether members of the rank and file had consulted with . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who has become the face of the 'Defund Obamacare' campaign that tea party organizations are promoting and using as a . fundraising tool. In debate . on the House floor, Republicans adamantly rejected charges that they . seek a government shutdown, and said their goal is to spare the nation . from the effects of a law they said would cost jobs and reduce the . quality of care. The law is an 'attack and an assault on the free . enterprise and the free economy,' said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas. Democrats . disagreed vociferously. 'House Republicans are shutting down the . government. They're doing it intentionally. They're doing it on . purpose,' said Rep. Donna Edwards of Maryland, as Republican lawmakers . booed from their seats on the floor. In . the Senate, there was little doubt that Reid had the votes to block a . one-year delay in the health care program widely known as 'Obamacare'. The device tax seemed trickier, since 33 Democrats joined all Senate . Republicans in supporting repeal on a nonbinding vote earlier in the . year. But aides said both House-passed proposals would be rejected in a . single vote. The 2.3 . percent tax, which took effect in January, is imposed on items such as . pacemakers and CT scan machines; eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing . aids and other items are exempt. Repealing it would cost the government . an estimated $29 billion over the coming decade. If . lawmakers miss the approaching deadline, a wide range of federal . programs would be affected, from the national parks to the Pentagon. Some . critical services such patrolling the borders, inspecting meat and . controlling air traffic would continue. Social Security benefits would . be sent and the Medicare and Medicaid health care programs for the . elderly and poor would continue to pay doctors and hospitals. The . new health insurance exchanges would open Tuesday, a development that's . lent urgency to the drive to use a normally routine stopgap spending . bill to gut implementation of the law. On . the vote to repeal the medical device tax, 17 Democrats sided with . Republicans. Two Democrats supported the delay in the health care law, . and two Republicans opposed it.","'I'm not over exaggerating when I say I can smell the booze wafting from members as they walk off the floor' one reporter tweeted .

"Former President George W. Bush said in a rare TV interview broadcast Sunday Morning that he was shocked to learn Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive U.S. invasion. 'You know, when he was captured, I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him – he said, ""I just didn't believe Bush"",' he told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer Sunday morning. 'And it's hard for me to believe he didn't believe me.' 'We'd given an ultimatum to the Taliban and delivered,' Bush said. 'I make the point in the book, of course, that -- and Dad understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president, you better mean it.' That line is already being interpreted on Twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at President Barack Obama, whose 'red line' ultimatums leveled at Syria and Iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless. Former President George W. Bush appeared Sunday for a rare TV interview with CBS newsman Bob Schieffer on 'Face The Nation' 'I just didn't believe Bush,' Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein reportedly told American interrogators after his capture, a revelation that left Bush '43' surprised . 'Words mean something. ... I thought I was pretty clear at times during my presidency and meant it,' Bush said Sunday. 'Saddam Hussein didn't believe us. So I was surprised.' 'It was hard in retrospect for me to look back and say, ""I don't see how he could doubt my word"".' The  interview aired on CBS during a day when the network was marking the 60th anniversary retrospective of the program 'Face the Nation.' Bush's new book, '41: A Portrait of my Father,' will ship on Tuesday. It's a portrait of President George H.W. Bush, who served a single term in the White House before losing the job to Bill Clinton in 1992. The younger Bush kept the book project close to his vest for years. The Associated Press reported Sunday that it includes a probing analysis of his father's decision to invade Iraq the first time around. But he insists in the book that his 2003 Middle East battles with Saddam Hussein weren't son's homage to his dad. 'I was not trying ""to finish what my father had begun,"" as some have suggested,' he writes. Bush Sr. had driven Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait but allowed them a safe retreat to Baghdad. Bush Jr. swooped in to finish the job after al-Qaeda terrorists struck New York City and the Pentagon in 2001. 'I went in there as a result of a very changed environment because of September the 11th. And the danger we were concerned about was that the weapons ... would be put into the hands of terrorist groups that would come and make the attacks of 9/11 pale in comparison.' He included an explanation in his book, Bush said Sunday, because he 'was just responding to, kind of, the gossip that tends to work around the political circles – that ""clearly he had only one thing in mind and that was to finish the job his father didn't,"" because my dad decided not to go into Baghdad after routing Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.' The younger Bush preceded Barack Obama in America's highest office, and saw his Pentagon's hard-fought gains in the region reversed by troop pullouts from both Afghanistan and Iraq. He said Sunday that he has no regrets about sending American servicemen and women into a brutally fought and protracted war. 'I think it was the right decision,' he told Schieffer. Obama's troop withdrawals at the end of 2011 have been blamed widely for the rise of ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, which swarmed into the spaces left by America's departure. Bush appeared Sunday in a rare TV interview, discussing Iraq policy, his new biography of his father, and the chances his younger brother Jeb might make a White House run of his own . 'MISSION ACCOMPLISHED': President George W. Bush addressed the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2003 after what he called a 'victory in a war on terror' after Saddam Hussein's ouster – but Obama would later roll back those gains by withdrawing all US troops from Iraq . Saddam II? ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, shown preaching in a Mosque, has become public enemy no. 1 in Iraq and Syria, fueled by the absence of dominating US power in the region . ISIS now controls nearly two-thirds of both Iraq and Syria, by some estimates. Bush suggested Sunday that it didn't have to be that way. 'My regret is that a violent group of people have risen up again,' the former president said. 'This is ""al Qaeda-plus."" I put it in the book, they need to be defeated. And I hope we do. I hope that the strategy works.' Bush also commented on talk of his younger brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, making a run for the presidency in what would be a precedent-setting three-peat for the bush family if he were successful. Jeb is 'wrestling with the decision,' he said. 'I think it's 50-50.' 'He and I are very close,' offered the former president. 'On the other hand, he's not here knocking on my door, you know, agonizing about the decision. He knows exactly, you know, the ramifications on family, for example. He's seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency. I'd give it a tossup.' He said he would be 'all in' to support his brother if he runs, and would accept a behind-the-scenes role if that's what was asked of him. Former first lady Barbara Bush has gone on record saying that enough Bushes have already run for president. 'Sometimes her prognostications haven't been very accurate,' George W. said.","Bush insists he didn't invade Iraq in 2003 to finish what his father started .

"Tall, slender and beautiful, fashion models appear to have it all. But as these shocking images show, maintaining lovely looks can take a horrifying toll on health. And at the Lenny show at Rio de Janeiro Fashion Week, the scale of the problem became clear, as models strutted down the runway with just skimpy bikinis to spare their blushes. Proving that thin doesn't mean healthy, one model's buttocks seemed to be lacking in muscle tone - which some industry insiders say could be the result of skipping workouts and staying slim by eating very little. Less than toned: A model on the Lenny Niemeyer catwalk during Rio de Janeiro Fashion Week was slender but lacked muscle tone in her buttocks and thighs . 'It's . no secret that a bad diet, little rest, no exercise, caffeine and . smoking is not good for our bodies,' adds Sheldon Stringer, personal . trainer and owner of Urban Fitness Islington in London. 'The . main cause of cellulite is simple: a bad diet of fatty foods married . with long periods of not eating and dehydration or lack of water intake. 'A lot of people also . rely on other stimulants and sometimes even substitute food and water . for these stimulants. This will also lead to diminished muscle tone and . also promotes the development of cellulite. 'In . the case of these models, the stress of having to look their best, not . eating to try and remain slim and working long hours with little or no . rest, will result in cellulite build up as seen in these pictures. 'Due . to the lack of nourishment caused by their bad diets and their intense . schedules, their muscle mass is compromised as their bodies are starving . most of the time, which results in flabby or flat muscles.' Slender: The Lenny show saw numerous very thin girls take to the catwalk . The . new pictures come in the wake of revelations that models stay 'Paris . thin' by eating tissues and outrage caused by River Island's use of what . seemed to be a size zero model in its latest campaign. The tissue allegations appeared in . the memoirs of veteran fashion journalist Kirstie Clements, who was . sacked from her role as editor of Australian Vogue last May. According to Clements, she once spent three days on a shoot with a model but didn't see her eat a single meal. By the end of the trip, said Clements, the model was so exhausted and weak from lack of food, she could barely keep her eyes open. She also revealed that many starve themselves for days on end, endure regular stints on hospital drips and eat tissue paper in order to feel full. 'You know how you read interviews where models insist that they eat a lot? Not true,' added Clements. 'The only way they can get that thin is to stop eating. They eat tissue paper to stave off the hunger pangs – literally ball it up and eat it.'","Model appeared on the catwalk during the Lenny show in Rio .

"The internet is becoming a 'dark and ungoverned' place for paedophiles, murderers and terrorists to safely operate, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has warned. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has met with law enforcement experts at the headquarters of the New York police department as the levels of cybercrime increases ahead of officers ability to control it. The Metropolitan Police commissioner said encryption on computers and mobile phones is frustrating police inquiries and leaving parts of the web as ‘anarchic places’. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has warned that the internet is becoming a 'dark and ungoverned' place for paedophiles, murderers and terrorists to safely operate and has called on internet companies to do more . He called on communication providers and internet companies to do more to protect the public from the so-called 'deep' internet. Speaking at the conference in the U.S, he said: 'We cannot allow parts of the internet - or any communications platform - to become dark and ungoverned space where images of child abuse are exchanged, murders are planned, and terrorist plots are progressed. 'In a democracy we cannot accept any space - virtual or not - to become anarchic where crime can be committed without fear. Yet this is in danger of happening. 'This is a considered view that is shared by many law enforcement and intelligence professionals both at home and indeed here in the US.' Encryption on computers is frustrating police inquiries and leaving parts of the web as ‘anarchic places' He added: 'Privacy is important, but in my view the security of communications methods and devices is growing beyond what any genuine domestic user could reasonably require. 'The levels of encryption and protection that we are seeing in the devices and methods used to communicate are frustrating the efforts of police and intelligence agencies to keep people safe. Sir David Omand, former GCHQ director, said that cybercrime is racing ahead and there are not enough detectives with the ability to control it . 'We need an informed, balanced discussion with communications providers to explore what they can do to help us protect the public from serious crime and terrorism.' Last month a former senior civil servant warned that cybercrime was speeding ahead of law enforcers' ability to control it as the 'dark web' expanded. Sir David Omand, a former director of Britain’s electronic surveillance agency, GCHQ, said that law enforcers were trying to police the worst excesses of the internet - as it was used by thieves, fraudsters, terrorists and paedophiles. He told Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee: 'They are failing, because cybercrime is racing ahead, and the dark web is expanding. 'There aren't enough experienced cyber detectives, the tools for cybercrime can be bought, law enforcement can't access the communications data.' The law enforcers had been forced to look to the intelligence community, which was primarily involved with safeguarding national security, to help protect society from threats of terrorism and criminality. This has lead to a misconception that this amounted to mass surveillance, which was not the case, according to Sir Omand. The remarks made by Sir Hogan-Howe comes days after the new head of GCHQ, warned that US technology companies are becoming the ‘command and control networks of choice’ for terrorists. Robert Hannigan said Islamic State exploited social media for recruitment and propaganda, using the likes of WhatsApp, Twitter and YouTube to promote beheadings. Tor - short for The onion Router - is a  matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online. Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address that can be traced back to an individual computer. The Tor network on the Deep Web hides the IP address and the activity of the user. Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a specific search. An Internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a majority is deep and therefore missed.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe met with law enforcement experts in New York .

"Returning Islamist fighters are being offered ‘jihadi rehab’ instead of prosecution for supporting blood-thirsty terrorist groups. The vast majority of more than 300 young men who have arrived back from Syria and Iraq are being allowed to continue their normal lives. Many have been offered places on the Government’s counter-radicalisation scheme, known as the Channel programme, which has seen a substantial rise in referrals. Scroll down for video . More than 300 young Islamist fighters returning to the UK from fighting in Syria and Iraq are being offered places on the Government’s counter-radicalisation scheme. Pictured: British jihadist Abu Abdullah al-Britani . There has been a 58 per cent rise in the number of British jihadists being referred to the scheme, known as the Channel programme, since the crisis in the Middle East has grown. Pictured: British jihadists flying out to Syria . Evidence of the ‘softer approach’ comes despite assurances from Home Secretary Theresa May that terrorist sympathisers will face the full force of the law. She said new legislation should be ready by the end of this month as David Cameron insisted returning jihadists should face ‘criminal investigations and prosecution’. Two Cardiff men who travelled to Syria have been allowed to return to their homes despite being arrested under the Terrorism Act. Ahmed Mohammadi, 19, and Shahid Miah, 23, were released without charge and instead referred to Channel despite their close ties with Islamic State. The scheme has seen a 58 per cent rise (from 748 to 1,281) in the number of referrals in the past year as the crisis in the Middle East grew. Whitehall sources said one of the biggest problems is securing evidence of terrorist activities committed by Britons 2,000 miles away in Syria. One told the Sunday Times that investigators also want to balance the approach towards returning jihadists with the need to avoid being perceived as ‘anti- Muslim’. The official said: ‘The police and MI5 are being careful about how to handle the returnees because they don’t want to disturb community cohesion. ‘Obviously they have to protect this country’s national security, but without any solid evidence . . . it’s very difficult to arrest and charge them. ‘The authorities are increasingly using a softer approach by enlisting returnees into Channel which . . . helps them challenge and ultimately change their extremist views.’ Despite the 'softer approach', Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) has insisted that terrorist sympathisers will face the full force of the law . The Government raised the national security threat level in August to ‘severe’ amid warnings of the threat posed by returning jihadists. Some disenchanted travellers have asked for an amnesty after discovering the dangerous reality of infighting among Islamist groups on the frontline. Mr Cameron has warned of a ‘generational struggle’ against the ‘poisonous ideology’ of Islamist extremism. Last week counter-terrorism police arrested four men amid allegations that they were plotting attacks at Remembrance Day events. An assessment of Mohammadi and Miah by the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit in August found that the pair were susceptible to ‘indoctrination’. The pair are understood to have been friends with Reyaad Khan, 21, and Naseer Muthana, 20, two Cardiff jihadists who appeared in an Islamic State recruitment video. Mohammadi’s father, Karim, insisted his son did not fight in Syria and said he has returned to university to study civil engineering. Police chiefs have insisted that every case of a returning jihadi will be treated ‘on its merits’ with some offered support by mental health experts or social services. They are closely monitoring the progress of a Danish programme for rehabilitating jihadis which offers a wealth of support and counselling. Terror law expert Geoffrey Robertson QC said the Government has a ‘duty under international law’ to secure the prosecution of jihadis responsible for ‘crimes against humanity’. He said: ‘What we need is a full-blooded commitment to prosecute all returning Islamic State fighters who are British citizens. This is our duty and we need no new laws to do it.’ But Prof Peter Neumann, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, said the Government should step up de-radicalisation work. He said: ‘The people we have been talking to ... want to quit but feel trapped because all the Government is talking about is locking them up for 30 years.’","Several returning fighters offered place on counter-radicalisation scheme .

"The mother of a five-year-old Saudi girl who was tortured to death by her ‘celebrity cleric’ father, has said she wants him brought to justice. Lama al-Ghamdi died in October having suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, broken ribs and left arm as well as extensive bruising. It has been alleged that she had also been repeatedly raped and that the injuries she sustained from the sexual abuse had been burned. Lama suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, broken ribs and back, bruising and burns. She had also been raped repeatedly . It was previously reported that her father Fayhan al-Ghamdi, a prominent Islamist . preacher who regularly appears on television in Saudi Arabia, had been . released after paying ‘blood money’ to his ex-wife, and Lama’s mother, . Syeda Mohammed Ali. It has now emerged that Lama’s mother is bringing her own case against al-Ghamdi, who is still in prison. ‘My dear child is dead, and all I want . now is justice so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain,’ Syeda Mohammed Ali, told CNN, adding that her daughter was ‘brutally . tortured in the most shocking ways.’ She is divorced from al-Ghamdi who is . remarried and has two more children, and claims the torture happened . whilst Lama was in her father’s care in March last year. ‘The state needs to even consider taking his two children from him and his wife away because I fear for their lives,’ she added. Torture: Saudi preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitting beating his daughter with a cable and is said to have been concerned about his five-year-old daughter's virginity . 'These are not . some unfounded accusations, but everything is based on the medical . examination by the hospital and the team of physicians who treated Lama . when she was first admitted.' She said al-Ghamdi had voiced concerns about five-year-old Lama's virginity. According to the Saudi Arabian Human . Rights Commission, al-Ghamdi has been imprisoned for the past eight . months and that the case is still under review. Syeda Mohammed Ali said her ex-husband has admitted to the torture and will face justice when the next hearing in the case takes place in two weeks. Activists from the group Women to Drive said the preacher had doubted Lama's virginity and had her checked up by a medic. Randa . al-Kaleeb, a social worker from the hospital where Lama was admitted, . said the girl's back was broken and that she had been repeatedly raped and her injuries burned. It was reported that al-Ghamdi agreed to pay £31,000 ($50,000) in blood money, a fact denied by Lama's mother who says al-Ghamdi did not rape Lama. Activists say under Islamic laws a father cannot be executed for murdering his children. Husbands can also not be executed for murdering their wives, the group say. Three Saudi activists, including Manal al-Sharif, who started the women's right to drive campaign, have raised objections to the case as it highlights the urgent need for legislation to protect women and children from domestic abuse. Manal al-Sharif has launched a campaign on Twitter using the hashtag 'Ana Lama', which is translated as I am Lama, calling for an improvement on the judicial treatment of women and children. Local reports say public anger in Saudi Arabia is also growing and authorities have said they will create a 24-hour hotline to take calls about child abuse.","Lama al-Ghamdi's back was broken and she had been raped and burned .

"In charge: Enrique Pena Nieto was elected President of Mexico on Sunday and now his party- the Institutional Revolutionary Party- is restored to power after a 12 year absence . Mexico's newly elected government could start negotiating with the country's brutal drug lords in a bid to buy peace, senior U.S. politicians have warned. Enrique Pena Nieto's campaign team claimed victory in the country's presidential election on Sunday after exit polls showed him winning by a comfortable margin. But critics have warned his victory could mark a softening of the country's war on drug cartels. Pena Nieto, 45, of the Institutional . Revolutionary Party (PRI), had campaigned on switching authorities' efforts to reducing violence rather than smashing the drug lords. Opponents fear the new government might now enter into talks with the cartels, thought . to be responsible for 47,500 deaths so far. Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied wanting to open up negotiations - though this has not assuaged fears among some senior U.S. politicians. Republican Jim Sensenbrenner told a congressional hearing that he feared the history of Pena Nieto's party had a history of 'turning a blind eye to the cartels'. He said: ‘While in power, the PRI minimized violence by turning a blind eye to the cartels,’ adding that Pena Nieto ‘does not emphasize stopping drug shipments or capturing kingpins’. According to the latest figures, Pena Nieto led by between 8 and 11 percentage points in exit polls published by three of Mexico's main television networks after voting ended on Sunday night. The PRI had governed Mexico for 71 years but lost power in 2000 - ushering in a new hardline government which declared war on the cartels. Soon after taking power in December 2006, President Felipe Calderon announced a major new offensive on the narcotic rings. The moves were welcomed by the U.S. which pledged $1.6 billion to aid the fight. Scroll down for video . People place candles in front of crosses in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua state, Mexico, during a protest about the violence triggered by a military crackdown on drug cartels in the country . Police display some of the arsenal of weapons - including AK 47s and M-16 rifles - seized from cartels in the community of Paso de Ovejas in Veracruz, Mexico . But PRI's comeback, under the leadership . of handsome Pena Nieto, who has pledged to open state-owned oil . monopoly Pemex to foreign investors, raise tax revenue and liberalize . the labor market, has caused alarm. His campaign manager, Luis Videgaray, declared victory shortly after the exit polls were released. 'It is a resounding triumph,' Mr Videgaray told Milenio television, adding that he was hopeful the PRI would have a majority in the Senate and possibly in the lower house of Congress, too. The exit polls showed him winning around 40 per cent of the vote. Leftist rival Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was in second place with Josefina Vazquez Mota of the ruling National Action Party, or PAN, trailing in third. 'I recognize that the trend up to this point is not in my favor,' said Vazquez Mota, whose campaign was dragged down by a brutal war with drug cartels and the government's patchy economic record. Preliminary official results were due in the next few hours. 'It's time for the PRI to return. They're the only ones who know how to govern,' said Candelaria Puc, 70, as she voted in the beach resort of Cancun. To the streets: The weekend was busy in Mexico as Saturday was the country's gay pride parade (pictured) and Sunday was the national election . 'The PRI is tough, but they won't let the drug violence get out of control.' Others feared a return to the worst years of PRI rule and put Pena Nieto's big lead down to his cozy relationship with Televisa, Mexico's top broadcaster. 'It's the same party as ever and the people who vote for him (Pena Nieto) believe they are going to live happily ever after like in the soap operas,' Humberto Parra, a systems engineer, said as he went to vote in Mexico City. By the time it lost to the PAN in 2000, the PRI had a reputation for widespread corruption, electoral fraud and authoritarianism. The PRI was in disarray by 2006, when its presidential candidate came in a distant third, but it has rebounded since then and Pena Nieto gave it a new face. He is promising to restore security to cities and towns ravaged by the drug war and also plans to reform Pemex, a proposal once considered political suicide. Mexicans are fiercely protective of Pemex, but the PRI, which nationalized oil production in 1938, could be the one party able to liberalize the energy industry. The PRI laid the foundations of the modern state with a nimble blend of politics and patronage that allowed it to appeal to labor unions and captains of industry at the same time. Mexicans eventually tired of heavy-handedness that stifled dissent, rewarded loyalists and allowed widespread corruption.","Enrique Pena Nieto's presidential victory will see Mexican government negotiation peace with drug lords, opponents fear .

"Just two hours after he gunned down unarmed teenager Michael Brown following, he has claimed, a struggle for his life, Darren Wilson showed ‘no apparent distress’ and scant physical injury. Information leaked by the Ferguson officer’s supporters in the aftermath of the fatal shooting suggested that he had sustained facial injuries so severe that they called for X-rays and hospital treatment. Now medical records released as part of the evidence presented to the Grand Jury and reviewed by MailOnline reveal a very different scenario. The decision to X-ray Wilson, 28, was not a clinical one taken by his treating physician on the strength of his physical exam. Instead it was Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson who demanded the officer be X-rayed. Scroll down for video . Darren Wilson (right) shot and killed Michael Brown (left)  after a struggle with the teenager. He claimed the teenager hurt him badly by punching him and that a third punch could have killed him . Darren Wilson was photographed to document his injuries following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9 . Examined: Pictures of Darren Wilson were taken shortly after the shooting and disclosed to the grand jury as it was considering whether to indict him for the killing of Michael Brown . Reddening: One of the pictures showing the impact on Darren Wilson on what he described as being punched forcefully twice by Michael Brown . Marks: Wilson told doctors that he was at six out of ten on the pain scale and that he felt badly hurt . And the officer was discharged less than two hours after admission with a prescription for anti-inflammatory Naprosyn - described in his doctor’s statement as essentially ‘prescription strength Aleve’ - and advice to ice his jaw if necessary. Protesters tore the Missouri city apart in the nights following the August 9 shooting. When the Grand Jury’s decision not to indict the Ferguson officer was announced on Monday the city erupted once more with Brown’s stepfather’s screams of ‘Burn this b**** down’ before Ferguson PD Headquarters taken by some as a call to arms. Chants of ‘Hands Up Don’t Shoot’ - a reference to a now disputed eye-witness account - have echoed across the nation, with protests staged in 37 states. But while Ferguson burned Wilson has maintained that he has a ‘clear conscience’ about the shooting. According to his statement Brown was the aggressor, wrestling for the officer’s gun and punching him twice in the face so hard that he feared a third punch would kill him. But the medical records released in the evidence dump by Prosecutor Bob McCulloch show minimal physical injury and reveal Wilson to be ‘no apparent distress’ shortly after this fatal encounter. The records describe Wilson as ‘Well appearing; well nourished; in no apparent distress.’ He head is ‘atraumatic.’ There is ‘no palpable pain, swelling, ecchymosis (bruising) or deformity’ to his eyes; ‘no obvious nasal injury’; ‘no swelling, deformity or crepitus (popping or cracking when moving)’ in his jaw which is shows only ‘mild ecchymosis (bruising), and mild to minimal palpable pain. Despite claims that his neck was scratched and jarred in the tussle Wilson’s neck is described as ‘Supple and non-tender’ with only a ‘few faint superficial abrasions to posterior neck at hairline, no bleeding, no laceration and no bruising. Notes made on the officer’s admission quote Police Chief Jackson as stating, ‘He needs x-rays he was hit in the face a couple of times’ All of the X-rays taken are described as ‘unremarkable studies.’ When interviewed by Federal agents the treating physician recalled: ‘He was brought in by his supervisor and two St Louis County detectives with the complaint of being punched in his jaw twice. ‘He complained of pain to the jaw area primarily the right jaw with a little bit of redness.’ Evidence: Darren Wilson's evidence to the grand jury included his description of Michael Brown's strength - 'I felt like a five-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan' Claim: How Darren Wilson told the grand jury he feared he was going to die at Michael Brown's hands . Medical record: Evidence disclosed to the grand jury showed Wilson was 'atraumatic' and 'in no apparent distress' after shooting Michael Brown . Result: Wilson's records show he was discharged without doctors requiring further treatment, instead he was asked to discuss the assault with supervisors . Secret wedding: On Monday morning, it was revealed that 28-year-old Wilson (left) - who hasn't been seen in public since the shooting - quietly married his fellow officer, Barbara Spradling (right), 37, last month . Getting heard: Protesters in Ferguson walked through various stores with their hands raised - something that has become a symbol of their anger over the shooting of unarmed Michael Brown . Wilson himself rated his pain level as six out of ten on the pain scale. The doctor also told investigators that Wilson ‘appeared calm and in no distress at all.’ In his statement and subsequent television interview Wilson described Brown as appearing like ‘a demon’ and spoken of a struggle so violent and intimidating that he felt ‘like a five year old’ facing ‘Hulk Hogan.’ Despite the impression of a vast disparity in size between Wilson and Brown, at 6ft 4 Wilson is the same height as the teenager though some 80lbs lighter.","Darren Wilson was examined by doctors shortly after he shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on 9 August .

"An estimated two billion people around the world saw Jamaica's Usain Bolt thrash his rivals to win gold in the men's 100m final - but none of them were in the U.S., as NBC declined to broadcast the historic moment live. Bolt sailed through the semi-finals before successfully defending his Olympic title - against a field that included three Americans - at 4.50pm EDT. But, not for the first time this Games, NBC took the controversial decision to hold off broadcasting the hugely popular event until prime time, leaving millions of track and field fans outraged. Fastest man: Americans were not able to watch Jamaica's Usain Bolt, right, thrash his rivals in the 100m finals live . Celebrating: Usain Bolt, pictured, celebrates after winning the men's 100m final . Fans desperate to see the 25-year-old set the track on fire again, four years after his superb performance in Beijing, took to Twitter to vent their anger, using the hashtag #NBCfails. 'How can NBC be so inept? How many senior execs will be canned? How high will the cleaning go? It'll probably be delayed,' one user tweeted. Another wrote: 'Thank you NBC for showing Bolt winning the 100 meter finals instead of woman vollyball (sic) and horses. wait you didn't.' 'Would have been nice if NBC chose to broadcast it live.

The race had been billed ‘the greatest’ race of London 2012 – and it was certainly the most anticipated. The latest blunder comes after NBC's employees started turning on the network’s much-criticised Olympics coverage. Dan Hicken, who has been the sports director of NBC affiliate 12 News in Jacksonville since 1991, lost his temper live on air in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Hicken launched an attack on the network's Olympics anchor Bob Costas, whose tape-delayed broadcast overran by seven minutes and interrupted his show. 'He does it every four years,' Hicken said of Costas, who has has been the prime-time host of a record nine Olympic games.

'Bob doesn't know that 12 o'clock means 12 o'clock. It doesn’t mean 12:02, it doesn’t mean 12:04, it certainly doesn’t mean 12:07. 'Bob, when it’s 12 o’clock, you say goodnight. You don’t care because you’re sleeping right now.' Hicken said his team was working really hard for Costas, his 'NBC family'. 'I’m glad we had the little gymnast girls. I’m excited about it. I’m glad we got to interview Michael Phelps six times,' he added. 'It's just starting, mark my words Jacksonville. Tomorrow, it'll be 12:09, 12:11, he starts to push it that Bob does.' But he ended his rant on a more light-hearted note, adding: 'I love him, though,' Hicken added. 'He’s a great broadcaster.' NBC has come under fire for their Olympics coverage.

It was also forced to apologise after airing an ad featuring a monkey performing gymnastics, right after showing the performance of Gabby Douglas, the first African-American to win Olympic gold. Considering the hype surrounding the race before it happened, it is really surprising that NBC would have passed over the option to show it live. The race had been billed as the . ‘hottest ticket’ of London 2012 with people paying prices of up to £725 . to be among those in the stadium who could forever say 'I was there'. In . Britain alone the TV audience was expected to be about 15million – a . quarter of all Britons – with theatres and cinemas putting on special . screenings that had begun in time to the semi-finals earlier in the . evening. Despite . earlier heavy rain and soggy conditions, thousands who had been at . other venues inside the Olympic park on so-called ‘Super Sunday’ and . ‘Showdown Sunday’ stayed to watch the race on the big screens.

After the race, Bolt said: 'I was happy when I went out in the first round, I felt I could do this. 'I . was slightly worried about my start.

"The future shape of Britain if Scotland goes independent has been glimpsed in a piece of KFC chicken. The bizarre discovery was made by Terry O'Neil when he pulled out a breaded piece of fillet and noticed it looked just like a map of England and Wales - but no Scotland. It comes hot on the heels of the appearance of a cloud in the shape of the UK with Scotland removed. Scroll down for video . Bizarre: This piece of chicken looks like a map of the UK without Scotland, according to the man who found it . Mr O'Neil made his finding when he ordered a bucket of KFC while on holiday in Sussex with his family. The 55-year-old from the Isle of Wight said: 'I picked this one piece out and I thought it looked like the map of Britain, but then I realised Scotland was missing.' He added: 'I didn't notice it at first, but the closer I looked the more it just looked like the UK - well, England and Wales - but with no Scotland.

Mrs Begnan, 44, grew up in the village of Fairlie in North Ayrshire, on the west coast of Scotland, but has lived in Nottingham for 20 years and so is not able to vote in the referendum. She captured the photograph of the distinctive cloud while on holiday with her family in Sardinia. 'I was on my sun lounger when I spotted it in the sky,' she said. 'I thought it was a bit weird. 'The referendum is the talking point between everyone at the moment and I started to wonder whether it was an omen about how the vote is going to go.' Mrs Begnan added that she supports a No vote - but does not resent the fact that she is unable to cast a ballot. 'I would vote no,' she said. 'I think Scotland would be too small on its own. 'A split would have a negative impact on the rest of Britain as well. I think it would cause a huge disadvantage to everyone, financially and politically.'

"Volatile volcano Mount Etna has been blowing perfect 'smoke' rings into Sicily's blue skies. The volcano erupted violently on November 11 and since then has produced regular explosions, as well as hundreds of perfect vortex rings. While theories abound, scientists are not entirely sure why the volcano is able to blow the circular puffs of steam - although some think a circular vent could be the cause. Scroll down for video . Volatile volcano Mount Etna has been blowing perfect smoke rings after erupting violently on November 11 and has since produced regular explosions, as well as dozens of perfect vortex rings . Some of the smoke rings measure hundreds of feet in diameter, according to Volcano Discovery. German volcanologist Dr Tom Pfeiffer, who founded the volcano watching website and runs tours of active volcanoes, said dozens of smoke rings were blown eastwards by a strong wind. He believes the reason for the unusual smoke-like formations is because the violent eruption had changed the structure of a vent – perhaps into a particularly circular shape that allowed the volcano to make the steam rings, which he said are a ‘rare phenomenon'. Writing on the website, he said: ‘Being . Etna, she exaggerates: Not only one ring every now and then, but she . made dozens if not hundreds during a few hours, often in a row.’ In 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings, Two volcanologists, said they could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere. More recent rings are pictured . Volatile volcano Mount Etna has been blowing perfect smoke rings after erupting violently on November 11 and has since produced regular explosions, as well as dozens of perfect vortex rings . It is not the first time that Etna has managed to produce the circular smoke rings and photographs have been taken of them since the 1970s and notably in the year 2000. Mount Etna is the tallest and most active . volcano in Europe and is situated on the geological boundary where the . European and African plates collide. In . 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings, Two . volcanologists, Drs Jurg Alean and Maro Fulle, told the BBC: ‘They [the rings] could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere. ‘The physics seems somewhat complicated and we are trying to establish if there are sound scientific theories about them.’ The pair run a monitoring station and keep a photographic record of the volcano’s activity. Other experts have theories about why the rings of steam are produced. It is not the first time that Etna has managed to produce the circular steam rings and photographs have been taken of them since the 1970s and notably in the year 2000. Here, it is possible to see the steam rings above the volcano . German volcanologist Dr Tom Pfeiffer believes the reason for the unusual smokey formations is because the violent eruption had changed the morphology of a vent . Writing on Fiboni blog, Sana Lane said steam rings above volcanoes typically measure between 100m and 200m across. She said 'vortex rings' are formed when air mixes with steam or smoke, having been forced out of a small circular opening. Because there is a bottleneck at the opening, the air in the centre if forced out faster, which creates a circular motion to form a vortex. The shape of the ring is maintained because of the rotational motion of the air so the rings need the right shaped opening and velocity to form. Mount Etna is not the only volcano to have created the curious rings and Stromboli in Italy, Hekla in Iceland and Mount Aso in Japan are also said to have produced steam rings. Mount Etna is an active volcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, close to the cities of Messina and Catania. It lies on a convergent plate margin between the African plate and the Erasian Plate. It is the tallest active volcano on the European continent at 3,329m high . When Etna started to erupt last month (pictured) none of the villages of Catania, dotted around the mountain, needed to be evacuated, though airspace over the southern Italian island was briefly closed . More than 25 per cent of Sicily's population lives on Etna's slopes, and it is the main source of income for the island - a combination of agriculture, due to its rich volcanic soil, and tourism. Here, Etna is pictured erupting last month .","The volcano in Sicily erupted violently on November 11 and has created hundreds of smoke rings that travelled east .

"Nursery costs have soared by 30 per cent in three years, almost five times faster than average wages. Labour leader Ed Miliband warned many parents are now ‘struggling to cope’ and rising costs mean they spend much of the week working just to cover childcare bills.. He called for a new levy on banks to fund extra childcare for three- and four-year-olds, in the latest assault on the government over the cost of living. Nonsense: Mr Miliband said it was ridiculous that some parents spent most of the week working just to pay for childcare costs . In 2010 the average cost of a nursery place for a child aged two or over for 25-hours-a-week was £82. But . this year it has hit £107, while average weekly earnings have only . risen 6 per cent from £449 to £477 over the last three years. It is adding to the pressure on family finances, with energy bills due to rise by up to 10 per cent this winter. Mr Miliband accused the coalition Government of doing ‘nothing to help’ families and has added stress to family life. On a visit to a nursery today, Mr Miliband said: ‘Millions of parents are facing a childcare crunch. The cost of a nursery place is now the highest in history, at more than £100 a week to cover part-time hours. ‘And average costs for a full-time place are now rising up to £200 or even more. ‘That means a typical parent doing a part-time job would have to work from Monday until Thursday just to cover these costs of childcare. ‘Rising prices have been matched only by falling numbers of places.’ He added: ‘The Tories say they care about families but they have done nothing to help for three years while all the time adding to the stress and strain of family life. ‘If it's bad for families, it's bad for Britain too. Parents who want to work should be able to do so. We need to use the talents of everyone if we are to succeed as an economy and keep social security bills down.’ Ed Miliband met nursery manager Carol Yala-Hutchinson and three year old Alvise  Cocquio during the visit to promote his policy to offer more free childcare . Labour leader Ed Miliband was today forced to deny thinking his shadow chancellor Ed Balls is a 'nightmare' to work with. Leaked emails reveal how the pair are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival. They suggested the leader is sick and tired of the shadow chancellor’s refusal to obey his orders and ‘stay on message’. But today Mr Miliband denied a rift, telling ITV's Daybreak: 'It’s fair to say that people send silly emails in offices and this was one of them. 'Ed and I are working really well together, I’m really proud to have him as the Shadow Chancellor working alongside me. 'He’s somebody who I think has been right in his criticism of the Government’s economic policy and he’s also leading the way on this cost of living crisis that we’ve been talking about. So, as I say, people send silly emails in offices but that’s all it is.' Labour accused the government of overseeing the closure of 576 fewer Sure Start centres since the last general election, removing childcare places. But the Department for Education disputed the figures, claiming only 45 Sure Start centres have shut down since 2010 and new ones have opened with a record number of parents using them. In September Mr Miliband unveiled Labour's childcare policy, including an extension of free childcare for three and four-year-olds from 15 to 25 hours a week for working parents. Today the Labour leader said big banks should pay for the extra help for parents. It would be the equivalent of about £1,500 a year saving for families, he said. ‘Childcare costs... are just going up and up and up and parents are really struggling to cope,’ he told ITV's Daybreak. ‘The banks are actually making very big profits and I think they can afford a bit more to help families,’ he said. ‘It's one of those things that is going to be good for the country, because not every parent is going to want to work... but seven out of 10 mums are saying “I want to go back to work but I can't because of the cost of childcare”. ‘They're going to have to work all week to pay for their childcare costs and that's just a nonsense.’ Harriet Waldegrave, Education Fellow at Policy Exchange said: 'Families from all backgrounds face rising childcare costs. However, in a time of stretched budgets, supporting high quality care for children from deprived backgrounds offers greater value for money than subsidies to the richest parents. 'That’s why parents earning as much as £150,000 a year should have their tax-free childcare entitlement cut with the savings of up to £238m used to improve the quality of childcare in the poorest areas of the country.'","Cost of a 25-hour weekly nursery place has risen from £82 in 2010 to £107 .

"Bribing smokers to quit works – and could save the NHS money, controversial research suggests. An analysis of 16 projects in which people were given cash, vouchers, lottery tickets or other financial incentives to change their habits, revealed that rewards help. It is thought that while smokers are aware of the health benefits of quitting, they often seem too distant to matter. People are more likely to give up smoking if they are offered financial rewards for doing so, research shows . In contrast, the idea of instant cash, even in small amounts, is very appealing. The NHS-funded review also found financial incentives encourage people to exercise more and go for vaccinations and health checks. Even as little as £3 made a difference. The NHS has experimented with giving smokers, the obese and even breastfeeding women financial incentives but has been criticised for using taxpayers’ money as ‘bribe’. In one of the most controversial schemes, new mothers in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire are being given coupons for stores such as Poundland, Asda, Tesco and John Lewis as a reward for not relying on formula feed. The Newcastle University researchers crunched together the results of 16 studies in which financial incentives were used to encourage people to give up smoking, exercise more, go for vaccinations or attend breast or cervical cancer screening. Financial incentives could also encourage people to lose weight and to exercise more . It found that smokers taking part in such schemes were more than twice as likely to give up for six months than those simply given advice on how to stop. When all of the studies were taken into account, incentives increased the odds of behaviour being changed by 62 per cent. Interestingly, large amounts of money didn’t seem to be any more beneficial than small ones. Financial penalties, in which people lost a deposit if they didn’t change, were also effective, the journal PLoS ONE reports. More than 100,000 smokers would quit in . just one year if the Chancellor increased the tax on cigarettes to five per . cent above inflation, charities and health experts have calculated. The rise from two per cent above inflation would save almost 500 lives in the first year and net the Treasury £485million. The . report, from Action on Smoking and Health and the UK Centre for Tobacco . and Alcohol Studies, and backed by leading medics, also calls for tax . on hand-rolled tobacco, which smokers often switch to when cigarettes . become more expensive, to be increased to 15 per cent above inflation. The study did suggest that the effect begins to wear off after the incentives stop. But the researchers said that some people will eventually slip back into their old ways whatever technique they use to stop smoking, lose weight or improve their health. Researcher Dr Jean Adams said that the schemes offer ‘rewards’ rather than ‘bribes’. She said that although the 16 projects analysed were done in the US, effective financial incentives could help the NHS save money. For instance, giving or smokers small amounts of money to change their ways could be cheaper than giving them expensive drugs or dealing with the health conditions triggered by their bad habits. Dr Adams said: ‘We try all kinds of techniques to help people quit smoking or otherwise live healthy lives, so why not try this? ‘It is about nudging people to healthier behaviours. ‘There is a chance this could save the taxpayer money in the long-run.’ She added it is not yet clear how big the incentives should be. Dr Emma Giles, the study’s lead author, said that supermarket vouchers might be more acceptable than cash. Amanda Sandford, of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health, said that financial incentives are likely to be most appealing to those of a lower socio-economic status. She added that pregnant women are particularly worth targeting as their health and that of their child is at stake.","Bribing people to quit smoking could save the NHS money in the long term .

"Woolly mammoths could roam Earth again, according to one eminent scientist who believes frozen DNA from newly discovered frozen mammoths could be the key to the species' resurrection. Stem cell scientist Sir Ian Wilmut who is best known for cloning the world's first mammal, Dolly the sheep, thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal. While he believes the ancient animal could be re-introduced to the world - an idea reminiscent of Jurassic Park - there are ethical dilemmas. Stem cell scientist Sir Ian Wilmut who is best known for cloning the world's first mammal, Dolly the sheep, thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of a woolly mammoth like Yuka (pictured) who is on display in Japan having been pulled from the Siberian permafrost . Sir Ian said told The Guardian: 'I've always been very sceptical about . the whole idea, but it dawned on me that if you could clear the first . hurdle of getting viable cells from mammoths, you might be able to do . something useful and interesting.' 'I think it should be done as long as we . can provide great care for the animal. If there are reasonable prospects . of them being healthy, we should do it. We can learn a lot about them.' The source of viable mammoth cells could come from  a number of frozen bodies discovered in the Siberian permafrost in recent years. The source of viable mammoth cells could come from  a number of frozen bodies discovered in the Siberian permafrost in recent years. Here you can see frozen tissue and blood . The giant beasts lived in the late Pleistocene period, tens of thousands of years ago. Their numbers were thought to have fallen across North America and on mainland Eurasia around 10,000 years ago, probably as a result of hunting by our ancestors as well as a changing climate. Just last month,the most complete body of a woolly mammoth was recovered and captured the science community and the general public's imagination about the possibility of seeing the giant creatures walk Russia's plains again. The baby mammoth, called Yuka, lived around 39,000 years ago and her body is currently on display in Yokohama, Japan, where visitors can see her incredibly preserved fur and tissue. The baby mammoth pictured lived around 39,000 years ago and her body is currently on display in Yokohama, Japan, where visitors can see her incredibly preserved fur and tissue . Samples from the little mammoth have been sent to laboratories in South Korea and Russian researchers hope to clone her. Interestingly, Sir Ian told the newspaper he is not terribly optimistic about the scientist's chances as there are many technical challenges. Writing for academic publication The Conversation, Sir Ian said in order to clone a mammoth, hundreds of thousands of eggs from closely related species such as the Asian Elephant and plenty of healthy mammoth cells would be required to even stand a chance of achieving the scientific feat. Mammoth cells are needed that still have their DNA intact, but they degenerate quickly as the snow and ice that has kept them preserved for so many years melts away. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, involved DNA sequencing of a large number of mammoth remains found across northern Eurasia and North America . Sir Ian wrote: 'By the time you've got a bone sticking . up in the sunshine, it's effectively too late. You need to get it . straight out of the deep freeze, as it were.' The process of cloning also requires a female - in this case probably an Asian elephant - to provide eggs and carry a baby, which would be part created using a cloned embryo, but elephants themselves are rare. Sir Ian believes it is 'inappropriate' to collect 500 eggs from the animals when they themselves are at risk of extinction. He suggests that the best way to create a woolly mammoth is to re-programme good quality cells extracted from frozen mammoths using modern stem cell techniques. Sir Ian suggests the best way to create a woolly mammoth like Yuka, whose foot is pictured, is to re-programme good quality cells extracted from frozen mammoths using modern stem cell techniques . The cells - if they exist - could be transformed into different types, including sperm and eggs, which could create a new mammoth life. The technique has already been used to give birth to mice. Sir Ian thinks it could be 50 years before the technology is developed enough to create a woolly mammoth, but at least the time frame could give scientists a chance to work out if the idea is a good one, in order to avoid a disastrous scenario reminiscent of Jurassic Park. Scientists are reportedly concerned that a 'modern' mammoth would not be able to adapt to cold conditions, when its mother lived on hot, dry plains. They also worry that the science must be developed enough to create friends for a mammoth very quickly in order to care for the animal's welfare. However, none of these concerns will matter if scientists cannot get good quality cells from bodies of frozen mammoths and while Sir Ian says the prospects of reintroducing the mammoth to the Earth is 'fairly unlikely' he thinks there is a chance. Heaps of mammoth bones found piled up at the foot of a cliff were initially thought to be the results of Neanderthals driving the creatures over the edge .","Sir Ian Wilmut said the best way to create a woolly mammoth .

"A grief-stricken father, who lost his wife and newborn twin girls to tuberculosis, spoke for the first time about their deaths and revealed that his wife had never been tested for the disease. Ruben White, 30, is suing Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas over the deaths of his 25-year-old wife Vanessa and daughters Emma and Abigail. Mr White choked up as he talked about the terrible loss of his family on Thursday. He told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'I would never . wish this on anyone else. You get the sense that sometimes life is not fair. My hope is that nobody else would have to go through this.' A devastated Ruben White talks about the death of his wife Vanessa and newborn twin daughters at a press conference in Las Vegas on Thursday . Baby Abigail, one of the twins born to Ruben and Vanessa White, is shown in Summerlin Hospital, Las Vegas. She died of tuberculosis in August . Loss: Vanessa White and her newborn babies died after she contracted TB meningitis . The . twin girls were the couple's first children. Mrs White, a dental clerical worker, and her government employee husband had been married for three years at the time of her . death. Mrs White had visited the same ER in Las Vegas three times during her pregnancy with a relentless cough which caused her to bring up mucus, a high fever and delirium. She was never tested for tuberculosis, Mr White said. Mrs White gave birth prematurely in May to twin girls but her health rapidly deteriorated. TB meningitis - rare in the U.S. - is more deadly than other forms of TB. Between 1993 and 2005, the Centers for Disease Control recorded 1,649 new cases of TB meningitis. TBM is passed on through prolonged contact with an infected person. Early symptoms, like fatigue and aches and pains are often missed. Symptoms, such as vomiting, headaches, seizures and an aversion to bright lights, don't appear for several weeks. Treatment can take up to a year but in many cases patients suffer long-lasting effects due to brain-tissue damage. All of the people found to have contracted the infection are being treated with antibiotics. She watched as three-week-old Emma died on June 1 from respiratory problems. Despite rounds of heavy antibiotics, Mrs White, a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints, passed away on July 1. It was only when an autopsy was conducted that doctors discovered she had TB. Surviving twin Abigail was quickly diagnosed with TB and placed in isolation but died from the disease a few weeks later. Emma had never been tested for TB. Testing of family, friends and hospital . employees conducted after Mrs White's death in July found 26 people . tested positive for the infection. Two of those had the contagious form, while the rest had inactive TB. Mr White's attorney Robert Cottle said on Thursday: 'There were multiple diagnostic failures. Lives would've been saved had tuberculosis been thought of in May or June.' According to the lawyer, doctors conducted . multiple tests, but didn't pursue the possibility of TB after a nurse . screened for symptoms and ruled out the condition. He added: 'No one connected the dots in this case, and as you can see, the dots were very obvious.' A Nevada Bureau of Health Care investigation found that Summerlin Hospital didn’t take basic precautions to stop the spread of infection - but facility leaders still say they followed protocol, according to the Review-Journal. Mrs White was allowed to visit one of her twins in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit while she had a 103-fever and was not wearing a mask or gown. Mr White said on Thursday: 'We would never want to cause any harm to our babies, so we would have done whatever it took. 'There was nothing ever told to us about anything other than regular washing of your hands when going into the NICU.' The hospital issued a statement expressing sympathy for the family, but saying it took appropriate steps in the case. 'Medical experts who have . already reviewed this matter have confirmed there was no reason to . suspect that the patient had TB and an appropriate screening was . performed,' the statement said. Outbreak: Families of babies born at Summerlin Hospital in Las Vegas were tested for TB following the deaths of a mother and her newborn babies . Health . officials later expanded the testing to include about 140 babies and . their family members who spent time in Summerlin Hospital's neonatal . intensive care unit over the summer. The results of that round of tests, initiated in October, have not been released. Officials . with the Southern Nevada Health District said it appears that Mrs White . contracted the disease from an unpasteurized dairy product from overseas. Lawyers plan to seek damages and changes in hospital policy. One theory is that the delayed diagnosis may have come because the disease is relatively rare in the U.S. Symptoms . can often be overlooked because the first signs of infection include . gentle aches and pains, that gradually become worse after eight weeks. 'TB . can be very subtle, particularly as many doctors have not had much . experience with TB these days,' Dr William Schaffner, professor of . preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University . School of Medicine, said. The . infection is spread through prolonged contact with a patient who is at . the contagious stage, where symptoms include coughing and spluttering. Babies who may have been exposed to the . disease are unlikely to catch it, according to chief medical officer Dr . Joe Iser, but officials want widespread testing 'through an abundance of . caution'.","Vanessa White, 25, died from undiagnosed TB in July after giving birth prematurely to twin girls .

"This is the shocking moment a thug jumped on the head of an innocent teenage boy as he lay unconscious in the street after he happened to pass by a scuffle. Police have released the horrifying CCTV footage of the 18-year-old being floored with a punch before being stamped up to 10 times on the back of his head and neck in Birmingham city centre. The teenager had approached the attacker in the street after seeing witnessing him getting involved in a scuffle and suddenly found himself being brutally attacked in a savage assault which nearly cost him his sight.

The victim's vision has thankfully returned but he suffered nasty facial injuries and lost several teeth. West Midlands Police has deemed the moving footage too shocking to release publically, but the force has issued a still image of the attack and another clearly showing the attacker. The incident took place just before 4am on the morning of Sunday September 9 near Revolution bar in Broad Street. Investigating officer, Detective Constable Sarah McDonnell, said: 'The victim was a totally innocent party. Attack: The victim, pictured in hospital, was repeatedly stamped upon after being punched and was unable to defend himself . 'He got caught up in an incident and was understandably unhappy at being shoved to the ground. 'He approached the aggressor and was then punched to the floor and repeatedly stamped upon. 'He was lying prone, face down on the floor, and unable to defend himself - it is the most cowardly, sickening attack I’ve ever seen and I’d urge anyone who recognises the offender or any of his friends shown on CCTV to contact us.

"Taxpayers spent a staggering $172million in six years on penis pumps valued at twice the price they would have cost in a store. The U.S. government's Medicare program blew the cash between 2006 and 2011, according to a government watchdog's report released yesterday. The inspector general for the Department . of Health and Human Services said the health . insurance system for seniors paid for nearly 474,000 claims for vacuum . erection systems, or VES, totaling about $172.4 million from 2006 to . 2011. A staggering $172million was spent on penis pumps between 2006 and 2011, a report has revealed . Yearly claims for the devices nearly doubled from $20.6 million in 2006 to $38.6 million in 2011. According to the Mayo Clinic, penis pumps are one of a few treatment options for erectile dysfunction. Government waste is a major issue in budget talks in the U.S. capital as lawmakers try to reach agreement on a $1 trillion spending bill. 'Medicare payment amounts for VES remain grossly excessive compared with the amounts that non-Medicare payers pay,' said the report, dated December 2013. 'Medicare currently pays suppliers more than twice as much for VES as the Department of Veterans Affairs and consumers over the Internet pay for these types of devices.' If Medicare had adjusted its payments to approximately the price non-Medicare payers pay, the U.S. government would have saved an average of about $14.4 million for each of the six years, the report said. According to the Mayo Clinic, penis pumps are one of a few treatment options for erectile dysfunction . 'Considering the strain retiring baby boomers will soon be placing on Medicare's budget, shouldn't we be focusing this entitlement program on real, life-saving treatment and equipment to serve the health needs of seniors - instead of subsidizing penis pump purchases?' Ben Domenech of the Heartland Institute think tank said in an email statement. 'And to those seniors who really do want one,' added Domenech, 'just buy it yourself - you don't need to send the bill to your fellow Americans.'","The Medicare program spent the cash between 2006 and 2011 .

"An Arkansas man who police say got lost driving around Chicago was shot and killed early Thursday, apparently by a man he had just asked for directions. According to police, a man identified by the Cook County Coroner's office as 55-year-old Robert Franklin, of Blytheville, Arkansas, was with a friend in a car about 3:45 a.m. when a man that Franklin had asked for directions climbed into the backseat and pulled out a gun. Officer Jose Estrada said the gunman robbed the men of cash and 'as he is getting out he turns around and shoots (Franklin) four times in the back.' Arkansas resident Robert Franklin was lost and driving around Chicago in the early hours of Thursday morning when he was robbed, then shot and killed . Estrada said Franklin's friend drove him to Stroger Hospital, where Franklin was pronounced dead a short time after he arrived. Police had made no arrests as of Thursday afternoon. Police had not identified the suspect or determined exactly where in the city the shooting occurred. Chicago's violent crime has been the focus on national attention, particularly last year when the city led the nation in homicides with more than 500. Police note that the vast majority of slayings and other violent crime in the city are related to street gangs. Last year Chicago led the nation in homicides with more than 500 . In most cases, police say, the gunmen typically know their victims or they are bystanders caught in gang crossfire. In one such case that was reported around the world, police say two gang members mistook teenager Hadiya Pendleton and her friends as members of a rival gang and opened fire, killing the 15-year-old honor student not far from President Barack Obama's home on the city's South Side. But apparently random crimes are not unheard of in the city. A current criminal trial receiving extensive coverage focuses on a brutal baseball attack on two women who apparently were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.","Robert Franklin, 55, of Blytheville, Arkansas, was lost driving around Chicago at 3:45 a.m. on Thursday .

"The former lover of billionaire property mogul Nina Wang has been jailed for 12 years in Hong Kong after being found guilty of forging her will. Peter Chan, a former feng shui master had attempted to pass himself off as the sole beneficiary of Ms Wang's 83 billion Hong Kong dollar (£7.1billion) fortune after she died from cancer aged 69 in 2007. But his ploy was branded 'shameless, wicked and borne of unparalleled greed' by High Court judge Andrew Macrae at the end of one of Hong Kong's most high profile cases. Sentenced: Peter Chan, left, was jailed for 12 years for forging the will of late Hong Kong billionaire Nina Wang, right . Hong Police had originally charged Chan in 2010 after a court ruled that a will allegedly written by Ms Wang, once Asia's richest woman, was forged. Chan, who changed his first name from Tony when he recently converted to Christianity, was convicted yesterday of forgery and using a false instrument. In an attempt to prove that Wang and Chan's relationship was genuine, Chan's defense team showed videos in court last month of the pair kissing and caressing, according to media reports. Jailed: Chan, who recently changed his name from Peter, is pictured in the 1990s. He said he and Ms Wang became lovers in 1993 . A 50-minute clip showed the pair calling each other nicknames such as 'Piggy' and 'Daddy Piggy'. Chan claimed that the pair first became romantically involved in 1993, despite a 23 year age gap. The judge said Chan was not content with the HK$3 billion ($387 million) that Wang had given to him while she was alive and decide to claim her business empire and estate as well. Judge Macrae said as he sentenced Chan: 'I have no doubt you are nothing more than a clever and no doubt beguiling charlatan.' A court had already dismissed Chan's claims to the inheritance back in 2011 and the fortune was given to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, run by Ms Wang's sisters. Chan, a 53-year-old father of three who had worked as a waiter and barman before becoming a feng shui guru, was also ordered to pay costs of around £172,000. Wang inherited property development firm Chinachem after her husband Teddy was kidnapped in 1990. He was never found despite a $33 million ransom his family paid. She built the company into a huge property developer, with office towers and apartment complexes throughout Hong Kong. Nicknamed 'Little Sweetie' because she wore her hair in bunches and had a giggly persona, the eccentric businesswoman was named 154th on Forbes magazine's rich list the year before she died. She sometimes liked to bring a pet dog or monkey to meetings according to reports. Despite her vast fortune, Ms Wang is said to have been frugal and preferred takeaway food and leftovers to fine dining. The $33million ransom she paid when her husband was kidnapped for the second time in 1990 was only half the requested sum and she spent years looking for him when he vanished. According to reports, Mr Wang had reprimanded her when she paid the full amount after he was originally kidnapped four years earlier.

"A mother told yesterday how she tried in vain to save her four-year-old son after he fell into the sea from a jetty. Dylan Cecil lost his footing as he played with his two younger sisters an inquest heard. He was carried away by strong currents as his mother Rachel McCollum cried ‘My boy, he’s gone’. She and Dylan’s father Darren Cecil, 30, leapt into the water but were unable to find the boy and were also nearly swept away by the tide. Dylan Cecil (pictured with his parents Rachel McCollum and Darren Cecil on his birthday) died after he was swept out to sea on a family holiday in a 'tragic accident' Rachel McCollum and  Darren Cecil  arrive at the Old Municipal Buildings, Taunton, Somerset, for the inquest into the death of their son today. Both parents desperately tried to save their son after he was swept away by waves . Miss McCollum, 27, said in a statement that Dylan had been paddling at the  jetty’s edge. ‘He was jumping and laughing. But he suddenly went into the water. I heard a plop,’ she said. Dylan's body was discovered on August 23 by a walker who thought he had seen a child 'sleeping in the sand' ‘I couldn’t believe it was him. Then I realised it was and suddenly shouted to Darren, “He’s in, he has gone”.’ Miss McCollum, who wept throughout the . hearing, said she immediately jumped into the water, which was much . deeper than she had thought. ‘I was shouting, “My boy, he’s gone”. I . expected to touch the sand as soon as I was in, but the water was so . deep I was being dragged straight out. I scooped my arms to find Dylan . but he was not there. It felt like I was in a whirlpool, I was being . dragged everywhere. The current was so strong I couldn’t get back to the . jetty, I was just caught in a whirlpool. The next thing I knew, a red . ring [lifebelt] was being thrown around me.’ Mr Cecil, a poor swimmer, told how  he . too had dived into the water at  Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, to try to . save his son. In a separate statement,  he said: ‘I saw Rachel jump in. I . can remember her shouting, “Where’s  Dylan gone?”. I couldn’t see Dylan . but I put my arms out in front of me to try and grab him. ‘I couldn’t find him but I was sure he . had to be there because I jumped in at the exact point I saw his back . bobbing up and down. I kept looking for Dylan but I couldn’t find him. ‘I had been dragged by the tide and was now about ten metres away from the jetty. ‘I was trying to swim against the . current but I couldn’t. All my energy had gone, I was just exhausted. I . remember saying, “I’m gone”. I really thought I was going to die.’ The inquest heard that the tide often washes over part of the concrete jetty at Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset,(pictured), which is about 492ft (150m) long and nearly 20ft (6m) wide . Family at the scene, shortly after Dylan was swept away. The distressed couple had to be pulled from the sea and taken to safety as the Coastguard began a search for the little boy . Witness Alyn Pritchard, said that . moments before Dylan fell, he heard Miss McCollum telling him to keep to . the left and away from the water’s edge. ‘You could see the little boy . was jumping. But when he jumped the once, he went straight down the side . and he never came up,’ he said. Dylan’s body was washed ashore four days later. Miss McCollum and Mr Cecil, from . Kettering, Northamptonshire, had been visiting Dylan’s grandparents in . Burnham-on-Sea last August with his sisters, Faith, three, and . Alice-Kelly, 11 months, and cousin Georgie-May, two. They decided to go for a seaside walk . at around 6pm and wandered along the jetty to the water’s edge, where . children were playing. Flowers and tributes left at the scene. Mr Cecil, who said he was a poor swimmer, said he was barely able to take breath as he battled the surging water in the hope of finding his son . Candles spell out the name of Dylan Cecil amongst the mass of flowers left by friends, family and passers by exactly a week after he fell into the sea . More than 400 people joined Dylan's parents at St Andrew's Church in Burnham-on-Sea to remember him during a memorial service, while a minute's silence was also held for people to pay their respects near to where the little boy was last seen alive . But Dylan, who was wearing a blue . T-shirt and blue shorts, is thought to have lost his footing, causing . him to plunge into the  sea. The inquest, at Taunton,  Somerset, heard . how the tides at Burnham-on-Sea are some of the highest and most . powerful in the world. It was estimated that the speed of the . current on the day of the tragedy was around four or five knots, . approximately 5mph. That would have been enough  easily to sweep  an . adult off their feet. Despite a search involving both the . RNLI and the local Burnham Area Rescue Boat, it was not until four days . later, on August 23, that Dylan’s body was discovered at Burnham Yacht . Club. A married couple who were visiting the club found the missing boy, who looked as if he was ‘just sleeping’. PC Pete Wills, who attended the scene . to recover the body, said it was ‘as if the sea had just given the boy . back and placed him on the sand’. Recording a verdict of accidental . death by drowning, West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose said the tragic . events could not have been predicted or avoided. Describing Dylan as a ‘lovable  and . lively young boy’, he told the hearing: ‘This is something that could . happen to any parent and there was nothing Dylan’s parents could have . done to prevent this accident. ‘Dylan wanted to go down towards the . sea and he was jumping about and I think just mistook his foothold. Neither he nor his parents realised how vicious the sea can  be. The . tide was rising and tragically it was a spring tide which is the . highest.’ Dylan would not have had a chance once he fell, Mr Rose said. ‘We cannot restrain children. They have a life to live. Sadly, this was a tragic way to end it.’","Dylan Cecil was on a family holiday when he was caught by waves .

"The suspected gunman who opened fire on the White House was charged Thursday with attempting to assassinate the President of the United States or his staff. Idaho man Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, 21, was arrested at a Pennsylvania hotel after he shot an assault rifle at the White House believing that he was Jesus and President Barack Obama was the Antichrist, according to court documents and those who knew . him. At one point, he even suggested to an acquaintance the president was . planning to implant computer tracking chips into children. Meanwhile, details have emerged about further items found in Ortega's car, which included a baseball bat and brass knuckles. Danger zone: Police call in the bomb squad after a bag was found at the Hampton Inn, Indiana, where Ortega was arrested Wednesday . At his first appearance in court in Pennsylvania Thursday, Ortega sat . quietly, his hands free but his feet shackled. He said only, 'Yes, ma'am' when . he was asked if he understood that he would be going back to Washington to face . the charge. Ortega is accused of firing nine rounds from an AK47 at the White House Friday night, cracking one one window close to the President's bedroom. Police said that Ortega had become 'obsessed' with Obama and that God had given him a personal mission to attack the White House. 'He hates the president, he hates Washington, he hates society,' another official told the Washington Post. Gunfire . was heard between the White House and the Washington Monument on Friday . evening. An abandoned car with an assault rifle with a scope and nine spent shell casings were later discovered by police inside. The FBI have revealed the semi-automatic assault rifle was a Romanian Cugir SA. Probe: A bomb disposal officer looks closely at personal belongings of Ortega-Hernandez that were found outside the hotel . Police swoop on the hotel after a member of the public recognised Ortega-Hernandez as the man wanted in connection with the White House shooting . Witnesses say Ortega owned that type of gun in Idaho and claim it went missing a couple of weeks ago when Ortega left. According to the criminal complaint, police also recovered three loaded magazines and several boxes of cartridges from the car. They also seized an aluminum baseball . bat, brass knuckles and a sales receipt for purchases made at a WalMart . in Fairfax, Virginia, just four-and-a-half-hours before the shooting. Police believe that the gunman opened fire across a lawn from half a mile away around 9:30pm then ran off. When . the White House was checked Tuesday, a bullet was found to have smashed through . a window. Suspect: Police captured 21-year-old Oscar Ramiro Ortega, who has a lengthy criminal record in eastern Idaho, after a manhunt . It was only stopped from going inside the White House by the bulletproof . glass interior layer behind it. A second round was found outside. Authorities . are investigating Ortega's mental health and say there are indications . he believed his attack on the White House was part of a 'personal . mission from God', according to a law enforcement official. A U.S. Park Police bulletin said he was 'unstable with violent tendencies'. Mr and Mrs Obama were not in the White House at the time, instead en route to the APEC summit in Hawaii over the weekend. The White House has not said whether the Obamas' daughters, Sasha and Malia, . were there at the time or commented on the shooting. The window damaged is in front of the so-called Yellow Oval Room, according to the White House website. The . room is in the middle of the family's living quarters on the floor that . includes the president's bedroom and the Lincoln Bedroom. Ortega's mother has said he has no history of mental illness, though when . authorities were looking for him they reported he did have 'mental health issues.' In Idaho Falls, where Ortega is from, a computer consultant . told The Associated Press that the two met July 8th after Ortega asked for help . editing a 30-minute infomercial. Monte McCall said that during the meeting at . Ortega's family's Mexican restaurant, Ortega pulled out worn sheets of yellow . paper with handwritten notes and started to talk about his predictions that the . world would end in 2012. 'He said, `Well, you know the president is getting ready to . make an announcement that they're going to put GPS chips in all the children, so . they're safe,'' Mr McCall recalled of Ortega. '... And then he said, `That's just what the . Antichrist is going to do to mark everybody.'' Safe and well... 10,000 miles away: Obama gives a speech to troops at RAAF Base Darwin in Australia today . Close contact: Obama shakes hands with Australian troops and U.S. Marines at the military base . Kimberly Allen, the mother of Ortega's former fiancee, said . he had been well-mannered and kind in the four years she had known him. But he . recently began making statements to her daughter that were out of character, . including that he believed he was Jesus. Ms Allen said the family was worried when . he went to Utah recently, where he said he had business, and didn't come back. Ortega's family reported him missing October 31st. The . Secret Service said Ortega had been in . Washington for weeks before opening fire, coming back and forth to . the Washington Mall. Ms Allen said they were flabbergasted to hear he was wanted in . Washington. 'I believe that the boy needs help,' said Ms Allen, of Shelley, . Idaho. Agents said he is unpredictable and were extremely worried what he might do next. They were also unsure if he is capable of launching a more sophisticated attack. U.S. Park Police have in addition claimed he had a ‘direction of interest’ towards the President or the White House. Ortega was questioned by police on Friday morning, before . the shootings, just across the Potomac River from Washington in Arlington, Va. Police said they stopped him after a report of suspicious behavior, but let him . go after photographing him because they had no reason to make an arrest. Ortega has an arrest record in three states but has not been . linked to any radical organizations, U.S. Park Police have said. Law enforcement personnel investigate the south side exterior of the White House where a bullet was lodged in the window . The White House has a second layer of bulletproof glass which prevented the AK47 rounds from getting inside the building . Shots fired: At least two bullets made their way onto White House grounds. One was found lodged in a window . His criminal record ranges from domestic violence, drug charges, and assaulting a police officer. U.S. Park Police said that before the shooting Ortega had been spending time with the Occupy . D.C. protesters. Police were called by his western Pennsylvania . hotel after a desk clerk there recognized him and called police, leading to his arrest. The Secret Service, Park Police, FBI, and Washington police had thought he was still in the area at the time. Meanwhile, the President was busy meeting U.S. Marines and Australian troops at RAAF Base Darwin in Australia. Signaling a determination to counter a rising China, President Barack Obama vowed Thursday to expand U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region and 'project power and deter threats to peace' in that part of the world even as he reduces defense spending and winds down two wars. 'The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay,' he declared in a speech to the Australian Parliament, sending an unmistakable message to Beijing. If convicted, Ortega faces up to life in prison.","Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez arrested at hotel in Pennsylvania .

"Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympic games after winning a vote by the International Olympic Committee tonight. Members of the city's delegation hugged and wept with joy as IOC President Jacques Rogge announced that the Japanese capital had beaten Istanbul to host the games. It will be the second time that Tokyo has hosted the Olympics, after it held the Games in 1964. The city overcame fears of the dangers of radiation from the Fukushima fallout and concerns over finances to win the right to host the 32nd Olympiad. Scroll down for video . Members of the Tokyo 2020 delegation celebrate after Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Olympic Games . The Tokyo 2020 bid delegation celebrate as Tokyo is awarded the 2020 Summer Olympic Games during the 125th IOC Session . Victory: International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge shows the name of the city of Tokyo elected to host the 2020 Games . Delegations from all three cities had made final presentations to the committee earlier in the day before Tokyo won the final vote 60 to 36. In their final presentations, Tokyo made its case as the 'safe pair of hands', Madrid as the least-expensive option, and Istanbul as an historic opportunity to bring the Olympics to a predominantly Muslim country for the first time. Madrid, bidding for a third straight time, had seemed to have gained the most momentum in recent weeks despite Spain's economic crisis and 27 per cent unemployment rate. The Tokyo bid had been the favourite, but Istanbul had rallied, surprisingly tying with Madrid in a first round vote. Tokyo, bidding for the Games for a second time, will become the fifth city to host the Summer Olympics twice. Jumping for joy: Members of Tokyo's 2020 bid celebrate after their win is announced . Delight: Celebrations begin back in Tokyo after the successful bid is announced . Joy: People celebrate after the announcement that Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Olympics, in Tokyo, Japan . Relief: The people of Tokyo were delighted that their Prime Minister's attempts to allay fears over the prospect of nuclear radiation leaking from Fukushima were successful . A tiebreak in the first round of voting saw the Spanish city eliminated by just four votes to set up a final round between Tokyo and Istanbul. The Madrid team claimed the Games would pose no financial risk because most of the venues were already built. And when their bid was eliminated in the first round tie break there was an audible gasp from the audience, as the Spanish city had been expected to pose the biggest threat to the Japanese bid. The prospect of Tokyo hosting the greatest show on earth had raised concerns in the final few days of the campaign about the leak of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant just 150 miles away. Reward: Tokyo 2020 delegation members cheer and punch the air in delight as they find out that their hard work has paid off . Party time: Japanese citizens waved glow sticks as celebrations started back in Tokyo . Second time round: The city will host the games for the second time having previously held it in 1964 . But the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe moved to allay those fears. He told IOC delegates: 'Some may have concerns about Fukushima. Let me assure you the situation is under control. It has never done and will never do any damage to Tokyo.' Norwegian IOC member Gerhard Heiberg asked for more assurances. 'It poses no problem whatsoever,' Abe said in Japanese, adding that the contamination was limited to a small area and had been 'completely blocked.' Victory parade: Golden ticker tape rains down in Tokyo as delighted Japanese people gather to celebrate the news . Flag waving: The Tokyo bid had always been a marginal favourite to win the Games . All smiles: Tokyo residents looked delighted after the IOC's decision . 'There are no health related problems until now, nor will there be in the future,' he said. 'I make the statement to you in the most emphatic and unequivocal way.' Tokyo Electric Power Co, Fukushima's operator, has acknowledged that tons of radioactive water has been seeping into the Pacific from the plant for more than two years after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami led to meltdowns at three of its reactors. Recent leaks from tanks storing radioactive water used to cool the reactors have added to fears that the amount of contaminated water is getting out of hand. The work has only just begun: Japan's Olympic Committee President Tsunekazu Takeda celebrates following the announcement . Winners: The Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe (centre) celebrates by waving a flag with the bid logo on . Tokyo continued to portray itself as the safe choice at a time of global political and economic uncertainty. 'Tokyo can be trusted to be the safe pair of hands and much more,' bid leader and IOC member Tsunekazu Takeda said. 'Our case today is simple. Vote for Tokyo and you vote for guaranteed delivery. Tokyo is the right partner at the right time.' The Turkish delegation pressed its case of taking the games to a city linking the continents of Europe and Asia.

Nations united: Turks and Japanese tourists visiting Turkey watch the opening round of voting for the city that will host the 2020 summer Games live on big screens in Sultanahmet Square in Istanbul . With . the civil war in neighboring Syria posing a major issue for the .

He said: 'At this critical moment, we would like to send a strong message of peace to the whole world from Istanbul.' London Mayor Boris Johnson was among the first to offer his congratulations to the Japanese after the announcement was made. Still with the glow of the success of hosting the London 2012 Games, Mr Johnson said that Tokyo had a lot of work to do but masses to look forward to. Reassurances: Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses the International Olympic Committee session during Tokyo's 2020 bid presentation, before the announcement of the final vote .

'I am sure that, like London, your great city will put on an extraordinary event. This is a magical moment of celebration to savour before the years of hard work ahead. 'Staging the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a tremendous privilege that unleashes golden opportunities for the host city.

British Olympic Association spokesman Daryl Seibel said: 'We congratulate our friends in Tokyo and are confident that they will do a excellent job hosting the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2020.

Looking ahead: A graphic of how the Tokyo Olympic stadium might look during the Games . Istanbul, for a long time the front-runner in this race, has suffered a series of blows in recent months - beginning with the political protests in Istanbul earlier this summer, some of them on proposed Olympic venues, followed by a doping scandal, the jailing of political opponents and journalists, and now the looming war in neighbouring Syria. Istanbul had almost the perfect sales pitch until then, talking of the first Games in a predominantly Muslim country and a meeting of east and west. Its bid team took a leaf out of London's book with 50 young ambassadors from sporting backgrounds as part of its final presentation. Last time round: Tokyo last held the games in 1964.

Both Tokyo and Madrid pledged to spend a fraction of the cost of the London 2012 Games. Financial concerns have become the background to this race, especially with worries over the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and next year's winter games in Sochi being the most expensive ever. Madrid 2020 boasted 80 per cent of its venues are already in place and a construction budget of just £1.3 billion - London's comparable cost was £9 billion. The 2020 Games may be held thousands of miles away but it could create a boon for small British businesses. On the back of their links with London's successful staging of the 2012 Games, many of them will be urged to try and sell their services and win contracts for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics.","Japan capital will host despite fears of Fukushima radiation and recession .

"Home Secretary Theresa May left rank and file officers in shock today - after launching a furious assault on the police . The Tory minister, speaking at the Police Federation's annual conference in Bournemouth, accused officers of treating the public with 'contempt' over the way they treated victims of abuse and domestic violence. She also announced that she was scrapping all Police Federation funding because the organisation sits on 'vast reserves' of cash worth tens of millions of pounds. Mrs May's intervention came as a fourth police officer was sacked over the Downing Street 'plebgate' row involving the former Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. Theresa May, addressing the Police Federation's conference in Bournemouth today, launched a furious assault on officers' behaviour and accused them of holding the public in 'contempt' Theresa May's bombshell attack came as a it emerged another police officer has been sacked following the investigation into the Downing Street 'plebgate' row. Susan Johnson, a serving PC with the diplomatic protection group - which mans the gates in Downing Street - was dismissed today  for gross misconduct. The 'plebgate' row erupted after Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell launched into a foul-mouthed outburst when he was denied permission to cycle through the main gate at Downing Street on September 19, 2012. Mr Mitchell and the gate officer at the time PC Toby Rowland gave conflicting accounts of what happened. The officer claiming Mr Mitchell used the word 'pleb', something Mr Mitchell has always denied. Scotland Yard said a person 'closely connected' to PC Johnson, who was not on duty at the time of the incident in Downing Street, contacted The Sun newspaper the day after the incident. Another officer, PC Gillian Weatherley, was sacked at the end of April over leaks to the press linked to the row. She was on duty in Downing Street on the day of the confrontation. Four officers have now been sacked over the scandal. Scotland Yard today confirmed one further gross misconduct case remained. Mrs May warned the Federation, which represents ordinary police officers, that  it was time for them to 'face up to reality' and change their ways. The sustained assault left one officer complaining that he had never had 'such an attack and a personal kicking' in his 21 years in the police. Mrs May said she was determined to change the way officers behave and announced that she was willing to grant the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, more powers to investigate corrupt PCs. She said: 'It cannot be right when officers under investigation by the IPCC comply with the rules by turning up for interview but then refuse to cooperate and decline to answer questions.' The minister said this behaviour 'is often encouraged by the Federation'. She said this revealed an attitude 'far removed from the principles of public service felt by the majority of police officers'. Mrs May added: 'It is the same attitude exposed by HMIC when officers, called to help a woman who had suffered domestic violence, accidentally recorded themselves calling the victim a “slag” and a “bitch”. 'It is the same attitude expressed when young black men ask the police why they are being stopped and searched and are told it is “just routine” even though according to the law, officers need “reasonable grounds for suspicion”. 'It is an attitude that betrays contempt for the public these officers are supposed to serve – and every police officer in the land, every single police leader, and everybody in the Police Federation should confront it and expunge it from the ranks.' She said 'it is not enough to mouth platitudes about a few bad apples' in the face of a slew of high profile scandals that have hit the police. Mrs May said a third of the public do not trust officers to tell the truth. During questions and answers, one Police Federation representative, who said he had served as an officer for 21 years, told the Home Secretary: 'I've never had such an attack and a personal kicking from what you said there.' He added: 'We all accept we need to change. We want to do that. We do not need to be politicised.' 'You're threatening to bully us,' he said. Earlier, delegates heard from outgoing chairman of the Police Federation Steve Williams, who said the organisation was 'more than stories about plebgate'. The chairman, whose successor is expected to be chosen on Friday, told the Home Secretary said that members are 'deeply concerned' that officer numbers are falling across the country in the face of 20 per cent budget cuts, and claimed that staff levels were falling close to those in the 1980s. Despite previous claims that he had been bullied out of his role, he received a long round of applause at the end of his final annual address. The Government has already reduced the Police Federation's funding from £320,000 to £190,000 a year. But in a speech to around 2,000 officers Mrs May said: 'I can announce today that this funding will be stopped altogether from August.' The Federation came under fire earlier this year for having tens of millions of pounds stashed in unregulated accounts. There were murmurs through the audience after Mrs May told members: 'It is not acceptable that when the Federation is sitting on vast reserves worth tens of millions of pounds, it is in receipt of public funds to pay for salaries and expenses of the chairman, general secretary and treasurer. 'We have already said we would reduce this spending from £320,000 to £190,000 per year but I can announce today that this funding will be stopped altogether from August. 'Instead, the money will go into a new fund to accelerate the introduction of Police First - a new scheme designed to attract the brightest young university graduates into the police.' The Home Secretary also announced that officers will no longer automatically become members of the federation, and instead will have to opt in. Earlier, the Home Secretary told police officers who question the need for change to 'face up to reality'. Tory MP Andrew Mitchell  was accused of calling Downing Street police officers 'plebs' but angrily denied the accusation. He claims the police conspired to bring him down in a bid to damage the Government . Mrs May listed a string of damning controversies faced by forces across the country including the findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel and the so-called plebgate row . She said: 'If there's anybody in this hall who doubts that our model of policing is at risk, if there is anybody who underestimates the damage recent events and revelations have done to the relationship between the public and the police, if anybody here questions the need for the police to change, I am here to tell you that it's time to face up to reality.' In a forceful speech, Mrs May told members if the Federation does not change and accept reforms recommended by Sir David Normington, it will be forced to do so. She said that she will change the law to allow the Home Office access to the Federation's so-called 'number two' accounts, many of which are currently inaccessible even to the Federation's national leadership. Mrs May said: 'I do not want to have to impose change on you, because I want you to show the public that you want to change. 'I want you to show them that you have the best interests of the police and of the public at heart.' But Mrs May added that she would overhaul the police with or without their support. She said: 'Make no mistake, if you do not make significant progress towards the implementation of the Normington reforms, if the Federation does not start to turn itself around, you must not be under the impression that the Government will let things remain as they are. 'The Federation was created by an Act of Parliament and it can be reformed by an Act of Parliament. If you do not change of your own accord, we will impose change on you.' Mrs May was greeted with silence from audience members as she finished her speech, and no round of applause. The Police Federation, representing 126,000 rank and file officers in England and Wales, has come under sustained attack after being caught up in a series of scandals. An independent review earlier this year said it had lost the trust of ordinary police officers following its high profile and controversial campaign against Government cuts. The Federation had tried to use the 2012 Plebgate row - in which the former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of swearing at police officers  - to attack the Government. But it then emerged that a witness to the row was a Metropolitan police officer who had lied about what he had seen. The officer, PC Keith Wallis, was jailed for a year in February. Another two officers have been sacked for misconduct over the scandal. The subsequent review into the organisation found it needed change from 'top to bottom' and revealed the existence of secret accounts worth millions of pounds and lavish expenses claims. Chairman Steve Williams then announced he was standing down after being called a dictator and a traitor for trying to reform federation. The scandals surrounding the Federation came as the police as a whole faced growing public anger over cover-ups, corruption and racism allegations. It emerged last year that officers had tried to smear the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. A review into the murder also revealed shocking evidence of corruption during the original investigation. Officers have also been attacked for their role in the Hillsborough cover up scandal and for allegedly rigging recorded crime statistics to make their performance look better than it actually is.","Tory minister attacks corruption and treatment of women and minorities .

"The New Mexico Livestock Board has launched an investigation into a southern New Mexico dairy after an activist working with an animal welfare group recorded secret video showing workers whipping cows with chains and wire cables, kicking and punching the animals, and shocking them with electric prods. Board officials confirmed the investigation into the practices at the Winchester Dairy near Dexter on Tuesday. They were working on interviewing the activist and tracking down the workers identified in the video. 'We are investigating it very aggressively. The district attorney is on board and everybody is working hard to make sure we do this right,' said Shawn Davis, an area supervisor with the livestock board. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES. Scroll down for video . Disturbing: Animal rights group Mercy for Animal recently released a video showing abuse at a New Mexico dairy farm . Dairy officials have been cooperating since investigators first arrived last Friday, board officials said. The dairy said in a statement that animal care and well-being are central to its operation. As a result, the dairy fired all employees and referred the abusive workers to law enforcement for further review following its own internal investigation. The dairy also halted milking operations, stopped shipments to all vendors and dispersed thousands of cows to other dairies with strong track records in animal welfare. In pain: In the video, dairy employees are seen punching, kicking, prodding and whipping the helpless animals at Winchester Dairy in southern New Mexico . Kicked: Winchester Dairy produces milk for Denver-based Leprino Foods, a cheese company which supplies Papa John's pizza, Stouffer's and Hot Pockets . 'We remain committed to the ethical and responsible treatment of the animals and have learned from this incident,' the dairy said. It was not immediately clear whether the dairy's closure was temporary. Winchester is one of more than 140 family-owned dairies in New Mexico, a state that ranks in the top 10 nationally when it comes to milk production. The industry employs about 4,200 workers and has a direct economic impact of about $1 billion. The Los Angeles-based animal welfare group Mercy for Animals first sent the video footage to the livestock agency last Thursday. It released a compilation of clips that show the abuse during a news conference Wednesday in Albuquerque. An activist with Mercy for Animals shot the video while working on the farm in August and September. Aside from the whipping, kicking and punching, the video shows calves being tossed into the back of a truck and cows that can't stand being dragged with heavy equipment or lifted with clamps. Unsettling: The dairy has since issued a statement, saying they have fired all employees and transferred thousands of cows to other dairies with good animal rights track records . Hurtful: At one point in the video, baby calves are carelessly thrown into the back of a truck. The voiceover says many of the males will be killed for veal meat . The group said the abuses uncovered during its investigations of six separate dairies around the country — including the New Mexico dairy — are all similar. 'So this isn't a matter of a single dairy farm failing to meet industry standards. This is a matter of industry standards allowing for blatant animal abuse,' said Matt Rice, the group's director of investigations. 'That's why we're calling on the industry to make improvements at all of its facilities to prevent this type of abuse.' The Dairy Producers of New Mexico in a statement Wednesday said the industry is committed to animal well-being. 'The actions depicted in the video are unacceptable and do not reflect the daily care and comfort that New Mexico dairy farmers and dairy farmers nationwide provide their cows,' the statement said. Mercy for Animals is calling on Denver-based Leprino Foods, which is supplied by the New Mexico dairy and produces cheese for major pizza chains, to adopt a zero-tolerance policy for kicking, punching and shocking cows and require suppliers to provide safe and sanitary environments for the animals. Leprino Foods said Wednesday it cares about the health and welfare of the animals on the farms that supply the company with milk and that it terminated all shipments from Winchester Dairy.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"Ben Affleck has been banned from playing balckjack at a Las Vegas casino after allegedly being caught counting cards. The 41-year-old actor was gambling at a high rollers table of the Hard Rock Casino, close to the Las Vegas strip, when he was allegedly confronted Tuesday night for being 'too good'. Staff are said to have accused him of the tactic, which is not illegal but is a ground for being banned. Scroll down for video . Claims: Ben Affleck, pictured on Tuesday night was barred from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock casino for allegedly counting cards . The . father-of-three was in the Nevada city on vacation with his wife, Jennifer Garner, . although it is not known whether she was with him at the time. A source told MailOnline that Ben is still welcome to the hotel and was just banned from playing blackjack. The insider said: 'Security said, ""You are too good at the game.""' The hotel was really nice about . it and told him he could play other games. They ended up getting him . and Jennifer a car back to their hotel too.' Affleck was barred from play shortly after 10pm 'due to moving his money with the count,' according to an alert from a local security firm published by Radar. A rep for the hotel made a statement on Friday, 'Mr. Affleck, a valued guest of Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, is not banned from our property and is welcome back any time,' according to Fox. Warned: Ben Affleck, pictured in 2009, was allegedly given a warning last week about his playing tactics . Gamble: Affleck, who was on vacation with his wife, had been playing blackjack at the Hard Rock Casino . Meanwhile, the alert states that Affleck . 'uses perfect basic' - an industry term for card counting, 'but also . takes insurance according to the count.' It adds he: 'Uses black $100 cheques to keep track of the count while playing.' Radar reports that an alert was sent to surrounding casinos in Sin City the following day declaring that Affleck was 'currently suspected of advantage play.' The alleged ban comes after Affleck was warned on April 22 after he was suspected of using a similar strategy. Tough luck: Affleck looked dishevelled as he returned to his car to find a parking ticket in Los Angeles on Friday . Aftermath: Jennifer Garner looked a bit pensive as she strolled through Brentwood on Friday . In a document acquired by Radar the Games Protection Manager at the Wynn and Encore casinos, Rob Olivetti, sent an internal email stating: 'Ben Affleck (the actor) … Was informed that he . was being way too obvious moving his money with the count. 'He was . spreading $100 -10K on the double decks and $0-20K (2@10K) on the shoe . games. As of now, he is still being allowed to play per casino . management.' MaiOnline has contacted Affleck's reps for comment. Surely he can afford it! The Argo star discovered a parking ticket on the windshield of his 1966 Chevy Chevelle SS 396 . According to TMZ, the star is reported to have won $800,000 in 2001 at the Hard Rock by 'playing three $20,000 blackjack hands at once.' But he hasn't always had the best of luck as Radar claims Affleck lost $400,000 to entertainment executive Ron Meyer during a private game. Affleck is not only an avid gambler in real life but also on the silver screen as he played an online gambling mogul based in Costa Rica who is ultimately apprehended by the FBI for illegal activity in last year's thriller Runner Runner. Meanwhile, on Friday the star was spotted back in Los Angeles where he was looking a bit dishevelled as he stepped out of a building only to find that he'd gotten a parking ticket. Upon discovering the citation, the star grimaced before hopping into his his 1966 Chevy Chevelle SS 396. Onscreen gambler: Affleck played an online casino mogul last year in Runner Runner opposite Justin Timberlake . Card counting is a controversial strategy in blackjack used to determine whether the next hand is likely to give a probable advantage to the player or the dealer. While the practice, first outlined by American mathematician Dr. Edward Thorp in his seminal 1962 book Beat the Dealer, is not illegal, it is highly frowned upon in the gaming industry. Getting caught keeping a tally on card values could get you booted from Las Vegas, but in New Jersey's Atlantic City it is illegal for casinos to bar card counters. Gamblers who resort to counting cards in a bid to get an edge over the casino do so by keeping a running tally of all high and low valued cards seen by the player. Card counting, or card reading as it is also known, allows players to bet more money with less risk when the count gives an advantage, like with a high concentration of aces and 10s in the deck. It also minimizes losses when the count is unfavorable to the player, which happens when there are many low cards - 4s, 5s and 6s - in the deck, which benefits the house. It is a common misconception that card counters must possess savant-like mental abilities or photographic memory like the character Raymond Babbitt portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man. Instead of counting and memorizing each card, card counters assign a point score to each card they see that estimates the value of that card. The players then track the sum of these values by keeping a 'running count' - a tally. Basic card counting, known as the Hi-Lo system, assigns a positive, negative, or zero value to each card value available. When a card of that value is dealt, the count is adjusted by that card's counting value. Low cards increase the count as they increase the percentage of high cards in the remaining deck, while high cards decrease. For example, the Hi-Lo system subtracts one for each dealt ten, Jack, Queen, King or Ace, and adds one for any value from 2 to 6. Values between 7 and 9 are assigned a value of zero and have no impact on the count. The higher the count, the more players should bet because they have a greater chance of hitting a blackjack with many aces and 10s left in the deck.","Mr Affleck, 41, was allegedly using the tactic at the Hard Rock Casino .

"A man nicknamed the ‘Alabama Teabagger’ pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two obscenity charges for rubbing his genitals on an unconscious fan of a rival college football team in a New Orleans restaurant in January. Prosecutors reached a plea deal with Brian Downing, 33, of Smiths Station, Alabama, on the morning he was scheduled to be tried on charges that included sexual battery, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. While the battery charge has been dropped, Downing is still facing prison time for the obscenity charges. Arrested: Brian Downing, was booked on charges of sexual battery and obscenit after being videotaped 'placing his genitals on an LSU fan's face' Downing . is scheduled to be formally sentenced on November 29, but Orleans . Parish Criminal District Judge Karen Herman indicated she will sentence . Downing to two years in prison and recommend his participation in a boot . camp program run by prison officials. The Alabama resident will not be required to register as a sex offender. A . video that went viral on the Internet appeared to show someone in a . University of Alabama jacket exposing his genitals and performing a . simulated sex act on the unconscious man at the Bourbon Street . restaurant after the Crimson Tide beat LSU for the BCS football . championship on January 9. The . LSU fan has sued Downing, asking damages for ‘mental anguish, . humiliation, embarrassment, anxiety and depression ... damage to . reputation’ and lost tuition payments ‘for having to withdraw from . school.’ Christopher . Bowman, spokesman for District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro, said . prosecutors consulted with the victim before agreeing on the plea deal. He . described it as the ‘most just outcome and also the most certain . outcome.’ He rejected the notion that Downing's actions were merely a . drunken prank. ‘When you . put your genitals on someone's body, someone who is passed out, that's . not a prank,’ he said. ‘I don't think people would be asking that . question if the defendant had done it to a passed-out woman.’ Michael . Kennedy, one of Downing's attorneys, said his client decided to accept . the deal in large part because he has a one-year-old son and didn't want . to have to register as a sex offender. ‘Is . it worth the risk of never seeing a Little League game? Of never being . able to drop your child off at school? He decided no,’ Kennedy said. Although . Downing will be sentenced to two years, he may be eligible to serve . less than half of that. Kennedy estimated his client will serve a . minimum of nine months. Downing didn't answer a reporter's questions after the brief hearing. He walked out of the courtroom in silence, surrounded by his family and legal team. Captured: Downing is a second cousin of Russell County, Ala., Sheriff Heath Taylor, who said that he learned from other family members Thursday morning that Downing had been identified in the video and called his father to bring him down to the station . Sinister attack: An Alabama University football fan climbed onto an unconscious student from Louisiana State and rubbed his genitals in his face following a game in New Orleans . V for victory: The attacker raises his arms in celebration after he shoved his genitals into another man's face - he then returns to assault him again at the packed fast food restaurant in New Orleans . The footage of the January 9 was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel . BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted after it swept the . Internet. Police said sex crimes detectives met . Downing at his attorney's office in New Orleans, where officers . arrested him. Downing looked at the ground as officers escorted him in . handcuffs into the jail. Neither he nor the officers answered questions. Police said LSU and Alabama University campus police helped them collect . information and evidence needed to get a warrant for Downing's arrest. Downing is a second cousin of Russell County, Alabama, Sheriff Heath . Taylor who turned him in. Taylor said that when he heard the allegation from his family that he had no choice but to . arrest Downing or send him to New Orleans. 'I wasn't going to let . anybody say that because he's my family I wasn't doing anything about . it. Mr Taylor said, he called Downing's dad . and told him to bring him to the sheriff's office in Phoenix City, Alabama. It wasn't a hard decision, he said. 'You've just got to do the right thing.' Downing's actions were videotaped about 11.45pm January 9, at a fast food eatery on Bourbon Street, police said. 'Person of interest': New Orleans police have release the photograph of this man who they would like to speak to following the incident in New Orleans on January 9 . Getting into the spirit: Alabama student Ellen Cassin, dressed in the team's shirt, poses for a picture over the unconscious LSU student (left) and having more fun (right) A video taken on a camera phone . showed a group of students from Alabama University surround the . Louisiana State University student who is slumped over a table passed . out, at a Krystal restaurant in New Orleans on January. The . footage was uploaded to the Alabama University sports channel . BamaSportsForum on YouTube - and promptly deleted. It shows a man climbing on top of the rival fan and rubbing . his genitals repeatedly in his face. The sexual assault happened . following a game between the two colleges during the Bowl Championship . Series where Alabama beat LSU 21-0. The clip, which lasts for five . minutes shows a group dressed in crimson Alabama shirts placing cartons . on the young man's head while whooping and cheering, snapping pictures . on their camera phones. One voice, off camera, says: 'This guy's life is over.' The hazing continues with rival fans . sticking straws up the man's nose and leaning over him while football . chants echo around the fast food joint, where hundreds of fans have . gathered. Another man adds: 'Seriously, I don't see him moving' before adding, 'someone has to pour water on him.' The man shifts slightly in the seat with his head slumped on the table but remains unconscious. It is then that a rival fan, dressed . in a baseball cap, red hoodie and khaki shorts pulls his genitals out of . his pants and climbs over the other man, grinding into face. Scott Myers, a spokesman for Birmingham, Alabama-based Hibbett Sports Inc., . confirmed Thursday that the company fired Downing because . of his part in the video. He said the company had been aware of the tape but did not identify the . person on it until Wednesday. He refused to say what the man did for . Hibbett or how the company became aware of his alleged involvement. Hibbett Sports lists about 800 stores in 26 states. 'We were made aware of this situation late yesterday afternoon. We . conducted our own investigation, and after the investigation was . concluded, we made the determination to terminate his employment,' Myers . said. College graduate: Patrick Setterstrom (left) at first tries to reveal himself before he is stopped by his more sensible girlfriend Ellen Cassin. He recently left college (right) Two students in the clip have been identified by Deadspin.com - Patrick Setterstrom and his blonde girlfriend Ellen . Cassin. He appears to attempt to expose himself at the start of the . video before his girlfriend restrains him. Since the clip appeared both . have deleted their Facebook profiles. The . recent college graduate is the son of Alabama's WKRG TV station's . sports director Randy Patrick Setterstrom. The station admitted that it . was their director's 22-year-old son. Remi Braden, director of public . affairs at New Orleans Police Department, told MailOnline: 'We were . alerted to the video last Sunday and immediately started a preliminary . investigation. 'No one in the restaurant where the . incident occurred contacted police but the investigation is ongoing. Because this is a possible sexual battery case, we are not in a position . to release more information at this time.' The victim may not necessarily have to come forward as charges can be brought in the name of the state. However, Ric Simmons, a criminal law professor at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, points out that this is a far from a straightforward case. He told MailOnline: 'Technically a prosecutor does not need a victim to prosecute a crime, as long as there is other evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 'But although it is possible to obtain a conviction in a case like this without a victim, it will be difficult to do so. A jury may not take the case very seriously if there is no victim willing to testify. 'In this case, as reprehensible as the conduct may appear to some, others may see it as merely a crude college prank which does not rise to the level of criminal behavior. 'That perspective will only be reinforced if the victim does not care enough about the case to come forward.  Given this challenge, a prosecutor’s office may be reluctant to commit their scarce resources to prosecuting such a case.' Professor Simmons teaches criminal law at Ohio State. Prior to becoming a law professor, he was an assistant district attorney for New York County.

However, following the news, TMZ claims Dr. Luke has now filed his own lawsuit against the singer claiming she is 'lying to get out of her legally binding contract'. Dr. Luke's lawsuit claims Kesha's suit has been 'egineered' by her mother Pebe Servert and Kesha's new management company. He also claims her team have tried to extort him by threatening to 'spread lies about him' unless he released her from her contract. Kesha - real name Kesha Rose Serbert - also claims that the alleged abuse started early on when she signed her deal with the hitmaker, who is known for producing some of the biggest hits in pop music for the likes of Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Close: Kesha - real name Kesha Rose Serbert - claims that the alleged abuse started early on when she signed her deal with Dr Luke in 2005 . The suit also claims that Dr. Luke made 'repeated sexual advances' towards her and 'would use drugs and alcohol to remove her defences'. UsWeekly report that Kesha claims Dr. Luke allegedly gave her 'sober pills' and the following day she woke up naked in his bed 'sore and sick with no memory of how she got there'. After the alleged incident, Dr. Luke reportedly 'threatened that if she ever mentioned the rape to anyone, he would shut her career down, take away all her publishing and recording rights, and otherwise destroy not only her life but her entire family’s lives as well.' The lawsuit also alleges that he also 'threatened her and her family’s physical safety'. MailOnline has reached out to representative for both Kesha and Dr. Luke who have so far been unavailable for comment. Claims: In a lawsuit obtained by TMZ, Kesha claims she was 'verbally, emotionally, sexually, and physically abused' by music producer Dr. Luke . Svengali: Kesha and Dr. Luke are seen (far right) alongside Adam Lambert and producer Max Martin at the 28th Annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards at the Grand Ballroom at Hollywood & Highland Center in 2011 . The news comes after Kesha was sent to rehab earlier this year for a reported eating disorder, which the lawsuit claims was caused by the abuse. Since U Been Gone - Kelly Clarkson . Wrecking Ball - Miley Cyrus . Tik Tok - Kesha . I Kissed A Girl - Katy Perry . Roar - Katy Perry . California Gurls - Katy Perry . Who Knew - Pink . Hold It Against Me - Britney Spears . Domino - Jessie J . Where Have You Been - Rihanna . About You Now - Sugababes . In April this year, TMZ reported that Dr. Luke was behind Kesha's eating disorder, after he had called her 'fat'. A source told the publication that he had told her she 'looks like a f***ing refrigerator' and Kesha was understandably affected by it. Kesha has hinted at a fall out with the producer before when she told her Twitter followers that she never wanted to record or release their hit song Die Young, which was pulled from radio stations after the devastating Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. In September last year, one of Kesha's fans set up a petition 'Free Kesha' to help release the singer from Dr. Luke's management. It followed reports that Kesha had hardly any creative control of her second album Warrior. Meanwhile, Kesha's lawyer, Mark Geragos, told TMZ in a statement: 'This lawsuit is a wholehearted effort by Kesha to regain control of her music career and her personal freedom after suffering for ten years as a victim of mental manipulation, emotional abuse and an instance of sexual assault at the hands of Dr. Luke.' Geragos added: 'The facts presented in our lawsuit paint a picture of a man who is controlling and willing to commit horrible acts of abuse in an attempt to intimidate an impressionable, talented, young female artist into submission for his personal gain. Kesha is focused on moving her life and her career beyond this terrible time.' Long-term mentor: Dr. Luke (far left) and Kesha (center) in 2010 with friends, after her hit first single Tik Tok had been released . Dr. Luke has produced all of Kesha's big hits including, Tik Tok, We R Who We R and Your Love Is My Drug. He has also produced hundreds of hits for other artists, including Roar, California Gurls and Teenage Dream by Katy Perry, as well as Till The World Ends and Hold It Against Me by Britney Spears. He's also worked with Taio Cruz, B.o.B, Jessie J, Flo Rida, Miley Cyrus,T.I., Nicki Minaj, Juicy J, Rihanna and Shakira. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for Producer of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards for his work on Katy Perry's Teenage Dream album.

"A school bus carrying 11 elementary students and a driver was hijacked at knife-point in Arkansas on Thursday morning and involved in a 10-mile chase before the kidnapper finally surrendered. The man has been identified as Nicholas John Miller, he is a 22-year-old man from Jacksonville who has had a history of drug abuse and run-ins with local police. The incident began with Miller allegedly demanded a car from a woman in Jacksonville. Nicholas John Miller, 22, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, who has a history of drug abuse and run-ins with local police, told authorities that people were after him . When she refused to give up her vehicle, Miller boarded the bus which had stopped nearby and took over driving it. Police were informed about the incident by the woman who had refused to give her car and they eventually found the bus and pursued it north to Cabot. Cell phone footage of the chase, recorded by 17-year-old onlooker Kelsey Eggers, shows the bus moving along a two-lane road pursued by 10 police cars with flashing lights. Jacksonville police spokeswoman April . Kiser said Miller pulled over only after . seeing police spike strips on the road. The chase lasted approximately 20 minutes. Cell phone footage of the chase showed the bus being pursued along a two-lane road by 10 police cars . ‘We were able to get the bus stopped. The suspect was taken into custody, and nobody was injured,’ Jacksonville Police Capt. Kenny Boyd told CNN. According to an arrest report, Miller told authorities that people were after him and that he needed to take the bus to save his life. He said he had no plans to hurt any of the children – who attend Pinewood Elementary School in Jacksonville - or the driver. Miller has been charged with a felony count of vehicle piracy, 12 felony counts of kidnapping, and two felony counts of aggravated assault. The incident is not his first brush with the law this year and just earlier this month he was charged with Terroristic Threatening following a domestic dispute. Police stopped the bus roughly 20 minutes after the hijacking began, Miller was arrested and no one on-board was injured . According to a police report, nine days ago a woman told police Miller was high on methamphetamine and that he had assaulted and threatened to kill her if she took his son away. In May, according to a police report, Miller was arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering a vehicle, and stealing a shotgun and money. He was sentenced in September to 24 months of probation. In September, Miller was pulled over for having tags displayed incorrectly on the license plate of the car he was driving. After discovering Miller had a warrant out for his arrest, the officer requested a K-9 Unit to conduct a sweep of the vehicle, which subsequently turned up a syringe with residue on it in the center console, according to the report. Miller was arrested on the warrant and for possession of drug paraphernalia. In each of the incident reports, Miller was listed as a warehouse worker for a supply company.","Nicholas John Miller, 22, hijacked the bus after a woman in Jacksonville, Arkansas, refused to give up her car .

"Read his views on 'Big Cheese' Matt Prior . I did NOT text South Africans ways to get Strauss out . Flower's regime led to cliques (and Trott telling Prior and Swann to 'f*** off') Flower was a 'f****** horrendous' 'Mood Hoover' Kevin Pietersen has launched a brutal attack on Andy Flower, England’s most successful coach. Flower, who guided England to No 1 in the rankings and three Ashes victories, is relentlessly hammered in Pietersen’s new autobiography and described, among other things, as a ‘Mood Hoover’, who sucked the life out of the dressing room and helped divide it. Wicketkeeper Matt Prior is his other main target, portrayed with contempt as the ‘Big Cheese’ who stirred things up against Pietersen and was part of a bullying culture against other players as well. Kevin Pietersen and wife Jessica Taylor enjoyed a night out at the Pride of Britain Awards on Monday . Andy Flower (right) is relentlessly hammered in Kevin Pietersen's new autobiography . Flower is accused of treating Pietersen like ‘something stuck to the sole of his shoe' Graeme Swann is described at one point as a ‘sad, sad b*****d’ and someone who picked on other players. Alastair Cook is largely spared the vitriol, although Pietersen gives a picture of him as a bumbling leader out of his depth. Swann was swift to hit back, saying: ‘I was expecting the greatest work of fiction since Jules Verne, and I wasn’t disappointed.’ The book — KP: My Autobiography — would appear to end Pietersen’s stated hopes of finding a way back into the England team. The ECB declined to comment, though there appeared to be some relief that the attacks were not more wide-ranging. ‘There was a small earthquake yesterday and nobody died,’ said an ECB source.

MAR 2011 England crash out with a 10-wicket defeat by Sri Lanka and Pietersen emails Flower in an attempt to take over the one-day captaincy from Strauss. But Strauss stands down and is replaced by Alastair Cook. MAY 2012 Pietersen asks to leave the England camp between Tests against the West Indies to play for Delhi in the Indian Premier League. His request is turned down. AUG 2012 During the Headingley Test Pietersen is involved in an exchange of derogatory messages about Strauss with members of the South Africa side. Pietersen is axed and Cook replaces Strauss as Test captain after the series defeat. NOV-DEC 2012 Pietersen begins his ‘reintegration’ to the squad for the tour of India. His majestic 186 in the second Test in Mumbai lays the foundations for a series victory. JAN 2014 England’s 5-0 Ashes pummelling is complete with defeat in Sydney. Pietersen had been critical of Flower in Melbourne; relations are damaged beyond repair in Sydney and next month KP is sacked. The man in the firing line more than anyone is Flower, who is berated throughout a book that mainly dwells on the troubled episodes that marked Pietersen’s final years. Among the charges he levels at the Zimbabwean is a failure to stop Swann, James Anderson and Stuart Broad developing a bowlers’ clique, which he felt alienated other players along with Prior. He maintains that the incident involving texts about Andrew Strauss stemmed from his anger at a spoof Twitter account which he believed was being fuelled from within the dressing room. Flower is accused of treating Pietersen like ‘something stuck to the sole of his shoe’. He describes him as a ‘contagiously sour’ and ‘infectiously dour’ character who treated the players like naughty schoolboys. He claims the coach wanted to ‘neutralise’ him from the start of his reign and ‘keep me on the periphery until such time as he was ready to show me the door’. Matters came to a head on the last night of last winter’s Ashes tour in Sydney when they had an angry meeting full of recrimination that eventually led to his sacking by England. Prior is regarded with a mixture of ridicule and contempt, talked of as the Big Cheese who was a ‘Dairylea triangle thinking he was Brie’. More seriously, he claims the wicketkeeper undermined more vulnerable team-mates in the field by criticising them, leading to one incident when Jonathan Trott swore back loudly at him. On Monday Prior tweeted: ‘I’m looking forward to reading the full book. Might bully my kids into getting it for me for Xmas!! Obvs sad to see the accusations against me and I WILL have my right of reply! However today is not the day and Twitter is not the place for it!’ Prior trudges off after losing his wicket against India in July - he has not for England played since . Swann played 60 matches for England and he took 255 wickets during a successful spell for the country . Pietersen and England captain Alastair Cook are all smiles after England's Ashes win in 2013 . Swann is portrayed as the leader of a clique who slaughtered their colleagues in the event of a misfield or a dropped catch. Speaking at a NatWest function at Lord’s, Swann countered: ‘I immediately realised it was codswallop when I read the character assassination of Matt Prior. Tragically, I don’t think Kev realises the one person who fought tooth and nail to keep him in the side is the one person he is now assassinating: Matt Prior. Kevin has been quite clever because the guys still playing he has left alone and he hopes to get back in again one day.’ There is surprisingly little animosity towards Cook, although plenty of condescension about someone he sees as sincere but mainly as a puppet of the governing body. Former chief selector Geoff Miller said: ‘To my knowledge, there was no atmosphere of bullying within the England set-up. What we tried to do was pick the best squad to create the best atmosphere to win matches.’ Former England all-rounder Dominic Cork, his former skipper at Hampshire, was less sympathetic, telling talksport: ‘Do I think Kevin Pietersen was personally bullied? No. He was the person who had his own seat on the bus, and no one else could sit on that seat because that was Kevin’s seat. ‘Andy Flower took England to No 1 in the world so he did something right. There was a clash of personalities, they didn’t get on, so this is about getting back at Flower. Just remember — Kevin Pietersen, during his time in England, has left a trail of destruction wherever he has been.’","Kevin Pietersen described described Andy Flower as a 'Mood Hoover', who sucked the life out of the dressing room and helped divide it .

"Humans, pictured, dogs, cats, peacocks, finches and rats have all undergone the Egyptian ritual. Image represents a service and trademark of Summum . If being buried in a box underground doesn't appeal to you, but you don't want to be cremated, why not try mummification. For centuries, ancient Egyptians mummified pharoahs, and later, other nobility, to preserve their bodies and give them safe passage to the afterlife. The ritual eventually died out, yet a company in Utah has spent the last 30 years working on bringing it back. More than 1,500 people across the world have contacted Summum, the world’s only mummification company, to be preserved after they die. And it's not just for humans. The company, based in Salt Lake City, has previously mummified pets for customers worldwide. Summum was set up in 1975 by Claude Nowell, who later changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra - or Corky Ra for short. Dogs, cats, peacocks, finches and even rats have undergone Ra's updated version of the traditional . Egyptian burial routine. The Ancient Egyptians mummified . bodies because they believed in the afterlife. They believed that by preserving . the bodies of the pharaohs, these wealthy members of society would stand the best possible chance of living in the . eternal world. The process involved washing the dead body as a symbol of purification with wine and water from the River Nile. The modern-day process takes 90 days. The organs . are taken out and cleansed, then the body is hydrated for more than 70 . days in a tank full of chemicals. Summum was set up in 1975 by Claude Nowell, who later changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra - or Corky Ra for short. More than 1,500 people across the world have contacted Summum to enquire about the process for themselves, or their pets, example mummiforms pictured . Summum counsellor Ron Temu is pictured with a mummified cat, left, while Corky Ra is pictured right with his two mummified pets - a dog called Buster who died in 1986 and a cat called Oscar who died in 1985. Both caskets are covered in gold leaf . It is covered with lanolin and wax, followed by layers of cotton . gauze and a fibre glass finish. The body is then encased in a steel or . bronze casket. Summum counsellor Ron Temu told MailOnline: ‘The chemicals we use are so permeable . that if a drop was put on the hand, just seconds later it can be tasted . in the mouth. 'The olden day mummies look very dry and that’s because it was believed . the best way to preserve them for the afterlife was to completely . dehydrate them. 'We do the opposite and believe that . hydrating the body . fully is the best way to preserve it. That's why the bodies will still . look like the day they died - even thousands of years later.’ Yet . the process isn’t cheap. Cats start at £3,600 ($6,000), while dogs cost . around £15,000 ($25,000). Human mummification starts at approximately . £40,000 ($67,000) but can cost more for 'larger adults.' To prepare the deceased for mummification, the internal organs are removed, cleansed and placed back into the body. It is immersed in a baptismal font for 70 days. The body is then cleansed again, pictured left, before being wrapped in cotton gauze, right. It is finally covered in polyurethane, fibreglass resin and metal . 'As we have clients from all around the world, including the UK, if a . pet dies, then a vet packs it in ice and it is transported to us . straight away,’ continued Temu. Some people do like having their mummified pets in their own homes - even animals as small as a rat or finch.' ‘What is amazing is that these animals, like everything else we mummify, just looks exactly like the day it died. We test some of the pets after they have been mummified for years and they are perfect.’ The . first mummified humans were created by Summum almost a decade ago, but . each had to be opened after 18 months to check on their progress and . state law claims that once opened, the bodies must be incinerated. The Ancient Egyptians mummified . bodies because they believed in the afterlife and thought that by preserving . their bodies, they would stand the best possible chance of living in the . eternal world. The process involved washing the dead body as a symbol of purification with wine and water from the River Nile. An . incision was then made to remove all of the organs. These . included the liver, lungs, stomach and intestines but the heart was left . as it was integral to the life eternal. These organs were wrapped in linen and reinserted, and the body was then stuffed and covered with salt in order to dry it out for 40 days. It was later cleansed for a second time before being covered with oil to keep the skin elastic. Summum uses similar techniques, but these have been updated to use more modern materials and processes. Firstly, the body of the deceased is sent to a local funeral home for traditional funeral services before being sent to Salt Lake City. The internal organs are removed, cleansed and placed back in the body, It is then immersed in a baptismal font for 70 days. This tank is filled with a preservation solution made up of chemicals, some of which are used in genetic engineering. The body is removed from the tank, cleansed again, then covered with a lotion before several layers of cotton gauze are wrapped around it. A polyurethane membrane is applied over the gauze, forming a permanent seal, followed by a layer of fiberglass and resin. The body is encased within a bronze or stainless steel mummiform, which is then filled with an amber resin, completely surrounding and protecting the mummy. The openings in the mummiform are welded closed and it is enshrined within a mummy sanctuary or buried in a local cemetery. Other humans have signed up to be mummified in the future - and the company said this has tremendous implications for cloning. For example, it is feasible DNA could be removed at a later date by drilling into the casket. Temu added: ‘Being able to take out DNA at a later date has real . appeal for people. People like the idea of being able to clone . themselves. ‘We have a lot of people signed up to be mummified. They signed up in . their 30's and 40’s, and are now in their 50’s and 60’s, so we have a . lot of work ahead of us.’","Summum combines traditional techniques with modern-day materials .

"The student who was beaten up in the riots and then mugged as he struggled to his feet told yesterday how his attackers – some as young as 11 – threatened to stab him. Sickening video footage of a mob surrounding Mohammed Ashraf Haziq has been shown around the world after being posted on YouTube. Mr Haziq, who won a scholarship to study here, relived his ordeal from his hospital bed when he was visited by a friend who filmed the chat and posted it online. Recovering: Mr Haziq is seen in his hospital bed at Royal London . Hospital, where he is awaiting surgery on a broken jaw after the sickening . attack . Riot victim: Accountancy student Mohammed Ashraf Haziq, 20, had only arrived in Britain a month ago. Here he is pictured at home in Malaysia. Right he is sitting with his eight-year-old brother Mohammed Fatiri . Injuries: Mr Haziq still has facial swelling after the attack and can be seen missing several front teeth after having his jaw broken . ‘They threatened to stab me, they told me they had knives,’ he says in the footage. ‘Some of them were quite young, maybe still in primary school. They had their hoods on and demanded my bicycle.’ In the YouTube video, the student, . bloody and dazed after being punched to ground, is apparently helped to . his feet by a Good Samaritan. But the thugs then plunder his rucksack, . taking his wallet, phone and Sony PSP games console. The video was even mentioned by David Cameron yesterday. ‘When we see children as young as 13, . looting and laughing, when we see the disgusting sight of an injured . young man with people pretending to help him while they are robbing him, . it is clear that there are things that are badly wrong in our society,’ said the Prime Minister. The 20-year-old finance student’s jaw . was broken in the attack and he is due to have surgery at the Royal . London Hospital in Whitechapel, East London. He also lost some of his . teeth. His injuries mean he is unable to eat properly and he is being . fed via a hospital drip. At the family’s home in the affluent . suburb of Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, his mother Maznah Abu Mansor, 47, said . she was horrified by the attack. The mother-of-three, a school official, . said she was ‘very sad and upset’ and appealed to the Malaysian . government to help her to travel to London to see her son. She said: ‘I was initially very  worried but I’m glad that he is  all right.’ Dazed and confused, blood dripping from his mouth, Ashraf Rossli is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in London . From nowhere, an apparent Good Samaritan walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement . Lowest of the low: The teenager continues to tend to the wounds on his face as thieves make off with the contents of his rucksack . Lawless: A thief shamelessly rifles through Ashraf Rossli's bag as the young man stands bleeding after being punched in the face. The incident sparked national outrage . Discarded: The thief, having taken the items from the teenager's bag, then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away . Mr Haziq arrived in London last month . to study at Kaplan College in Tower Hill, East London. He was cycling . from his student accommodation in Barking with a friend when they saw a . mob coming towards them. His friend managed to escape but said . the 20-strong gang blocked Mr Haziq’s path and knocked him to the . ground before taking his bicycle. He has told friends he passed out . from the force of the blow. It was when he tried to move away that he . was mugged. Bystander Abdul Hamid, 23, who filmed the YouTube footage, . said: ‘I wanted to go down and help but I was terrified that I would get . beaten up as well. There was about 50 or more of them.’ Aftermath: Mr Haziq is caught on camera moments later, standing confused and alone at the side of the street . Campaign: A website has been set up in the hope of gathering donations to make a gesture towards Ashraf Haziq after the ordeal he went through . Mr Rossli was treated at Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, following the attack . Well-wishers are organising an appeal . for the student, though last night it was unclear if it would be led by . those who set up the fund website – . http://somethingniceforashraf.tumblr.com – or by the Malaysian High . Commission. Former aid worker Jamie Cowen who set . up the internet appeal insisted the money raised would go to Mr Haziq . and any surplus would be given to ‘other London riots-related causes’. He added: ‘I and thousands of other . British people are disgusted that this happened in our country and want . to do something nice for Ashraf to show to him and his country that only . a tiny minority of us are scumbags.’ Within hours of the website launching, it had received more than 17,000 pledges of support.","Student robbed while bleeding only arrived in England a month ago .

"It was a heart-wrenching story that proved too good to be true. Hundreds of users of social networking sites and blogs followed the trials and tribulations of a Canadian family over the course of 11 years. During that time, they read of five-year-old 'Warrior' Eli Dirr's battle with cancer and just last month, the death of his mother Dana in a car crash en route to the Saskatchewan hospital where she was a surgeon. Hoax: Pictures used to depict the Dirr family had been lifted from other people's profiles on sites such as Facebook, including images of twins that were actually the children of a South African blogger . John 'JS' Dirr, an officer in the Canadian Royal Mounted Police, movingly described how she miraculously hung on to life just long enough to give birth to their 11th child, daughter Evelyn Danika. All of it, however, was a complex hoax. Through her blog Warrior Eli: A Hoax? Taryn Wright has revealed JS is actually a 22-year-old medical student living with her father in Ohio. One of the only elements of truth in the countless posts on sites such as Facebook was that the woman - Emily Dirr - shared a surname with the family she had invented. Miss Wright wrote on the Gawker website: 'I was very surprised to . find out that a med student was behind the whole thing because of the . amount of time that had to have been involved with creating so many . characters.' Duped: Hundreds of people were tricked into falling for convincing social network profiles that used photos lifted from the internet . Miss Wright speculated that the author may have a condition known as Munchausen disorder by internet, which was identified in 1998 by psychiatrist Dr Marc Feldman. She said: 'It says that people who have this disorder invent stuff like this over and over and over again. 'The only real treatment is having their internet use carefully monitored.' The most outrageous message was posted on Facebook on May 13 - Mother's Day in America - when 'Warrior Eli' broke the grim news that Dana Dirr had died from  injuries sustained in a car crash. Fabrication: Widower John 'JS' Dirr poured out his grief over the supposed death of his wife Dana in this Facebook post, which went viral . It read: 'Last night at 12:02am I lost the love of my life. I lost my wife, the mother of my children and my best friend. 'She fought so hard to cling to life. All of the doctors couldn't believe she survived as long as she did.' A tribute page quickly sprang up in memory of Mrs Dirr and raised more than $1,000 for a cancer charity before it was taken down. Meanwhile, hundreds of people left condolence messages on Facebook. It was at this point, however, that the hoax began to unravel. It emerged that pictures used to depict the Dirr family had been lifted from other people's profiles on sites such as Facebook and Flickr, including images of twins that were actually the children of a South African blogger. Vital clue: Taryn Wright managed to track down the person behind the fake posts using the Ohio return address Emily Dirr provided when she sent Warrior Eli bracelets to online followers like the one pictured above . As more questions were asked, the Warrior Eli Facebook page was deleted and the privacy settings increased for the JS and Dana Dirr profiles. Eli Dirr's page on the CaringBridge networking site was also made private. To track down those behind the charade, Taryn Wright set up a blog and email address for people to send information. She tracked down Emily Dirr after she was told the woman - described online as the younger sister of JS - sent Warrior Eli bracelets to anybody who requested them. Emily Dirr provided a return address in Rootstown, Ohio - and Miss Wright found she was the only person mentioned on the sites who was real. After being outed, Miss Dirr apologised in a written statement published on Miss Wright's blog. It said: 'I am deeply sorry for all the pain I have caused everyone. 'It was never my intention to do so. 'This all started 11 years ago when I was a bored 11-year-old kid looking for an escape from the pain and heartache I saw in my own family. 'It started almost as a fiction writing, but the more time I spent escaping to it, the more ""real"" it became. 'I am so sorry it hurt so many real families, and so many people out there.' Miss Wright said that although the hundreds of people who were duped are angry, Miss Dirr does not appear to have committed a crime because she did not materially gain from the hoax. Money raised for the cancer charity went straight into their coffers, she said. However, she said that Miss Dirr's medical school is carrying out an investigation.","Ohio medical student, 22, invented several online characters using profiles on sites like Facebook and lifting photos from the internet .

"Last month, a keen art lover spent $3,500 (£2,181) at an auction house in New York – but took nothing home. That’s because Benjamin Palmer had in fact purchased ifnoyes.com, a web page with geometric patterns that change in response to mouse movement. It may seem like a steep price for something that only exists in a mass of wires, but the website is part of a growing trend establishing itself in the art world.

"Around this time of year most squirrels are busy burying acorns and preparing their nests for a nice long sleep through the winter. But not these cheeky critters, who have been spotted doing the conga on the branch of a Maple tree. The three siblings, all from the same nest, were photographed by 50-year-old Robert Ganz in his back garden in Quebec, Canada. Robert Ganz, 50, a software support technician from Quebec, Canada, spotted these cheeky critters doing the conga on a maple tree in his back garden . The software support technician watched on, camera in hand, as the trio then turned around to face the opposite direction. After a few more seconds the grey squirrels glanced up at the higher branches before scurrying away after one-another. Eastern Grey Squirrels are native to Eastern United States, as well as Eastern parts of Canada, including Quebec. The three siblings, who come from the same nest, formed into a line just in time for Ganz to take pictures . They have been introduced across most of the US and Western Canada now, as well as Europe where they are considered a pest because they compete with native squirrels. In Britain the Grey Squirrel has almost competed the native Red Squirrel out of existence, and there are now programmes to trap and kill the grey variety to give the reds a chance of surviving. Despite their name, Grey Squirrels can actually be born with reddish fur, or even completely black. Sitting 7ft above the ground the trio followed their brother's lead as he suddenly did an about-face . They have large, bushy tales which they use for balance, to keep warm in the winter, as a sun shade and as a means of communication. While they feed on leaf buds in the spring, with their particular favourite being maple leaves, at this time of year they mostly eat nuts and grains including acorns and beechnuts. They also use autumn as an opportunity to bury food which they will then dig up in the spring. The grey squirrels, Quebec's native species, then did some more of the conga facing the other way before scurrying back up into the higher branches . While they do lose some of what they hide, it is a misconception that they are regularly unable to track down their stash, and find about 85 per cent of what they bury using their keen sense of smell. They also sometimes eat insects, bird eggs and even, occasionally, chicks from a nest. They are preyed on by foxes, wild cats, owls and hawks. In the wild it is unusual for one to live longer than six years.","Robert Ganz, 50, saw the trio in a maple tree in his garden .

"The suspended 'dirty' dentist at the centre of an infection-control investigation raked in more than £1,000 a day seeing huge numbers of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle. Desmond D'Mello's alleged flouting of NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed as he treated up to 40 patients in one morning. NHS bosses have urged any former patients who were treated by the 60-year-old at Daybrook Dental Surgery to come forward for blood tests for HIV and hepatitis. A whistleblower claimed he re-used dirty equipment and failed to change his gloves between patients. And it emerged the latest CQC report by health inspectors who examined the surgery in July found medical equipment was stored in a staff toilet, posing 'a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated'. Dentist Desmond D'Mello is at the centre of a major public health scare amid allegations he flouted infection-control measures at his Nottinghamshire practice over a 32-year period. So far more than 2,000 of his former patients have sought help and advice . It has emerged Mr D'Mello raked in around £1,000 a day treated a huge number of patients to fund his lavish lifestyle. He sold his Georgian mansion on the outskirts of Nottingham for £1.5 million earlier this year and moved to a luxury Nottingham flat, pictured . Six months earlier inspectors had given Mr D'Mello a clean bill of health. Detectives are also investigating whether the death of 23-year-old patient Amy Duffield is linked to dental treatments she received. More than 1,300 people have so far contacted a helpline set up to advise former patients, and another 600 have visited a dedicated clinic to seek blood tests. It comes as the true scale of Mr D'Mello's vast income has emerged, fuelled by a huge turnaround of patients to fund an extravagant lifestyle. The 60-year-old lived in a lavishly furnished Georgian mansion and drove a range of sports cars, including a Mercedes, a Porsche and a Ferrari, with personalised number plates. The impressive Georgian mansion stands in seven-acres of grounds. It features seven bedrooms, three reception rooms and a study, garages for three cars, a tennis court, pond, wood, meadow and secret garden. It is built on land formerly owned by the Seely family, renowned landowners in Nottinghamshire. He sold the £1.5million grade two listed property, Ramsdale Farm, on the outskirts of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, earlier this year and moved to a luxury flat in an upmarket area of Nottingham. Dentists are paid per patient, earning a minimum of £18.50 for a basic check-up and polish on the NHS. Health bossees revealed Mr D'Mello saw 166 patients in a three-day period when he was filmed by a whistleblower in June. At an average of 55 patients a day, Mr D'Mello would have earned a minimum of £1,017 a day and around £3,071 if all patients were paying the minimum fee. If 55 patients a day was an average for Mr D'Mello, it means the 60-year-old would have earned in excess of £371,000 a year, before tax. It is not known how many of Mr D'Mello's patients had their treatment fully funded by the NHS. But it is unlikely that over the course of the three-day period in June Mr D'Mello only treated those patients charged the minimum fee. Dentists charge NHS patients according to three bands - a band two appointment costs £50.50 and a band three, for the most complex procedures including dentures and bridges, costs £219. It is therefore likely that Mr D'Mello's earnings were in excess of £,3,071 across the three days, and £371,000 a year. Nottinghamshire Police are making enquiries into the death of Amy Duffield, 23, a patient of Mr D'Mello who died unexpectedly last year . Dr Doug Black, a medical director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'He saw 166 patients in a three-day period. 'That is a lot of patients. The footage showed us there were serious lapses.' Mr D'Mello, who studied at the University of Manchester and qualified in 1977, was suspended for just 18 months in August by the General Dental Council, pending the start of the investigation. NHS dentists are paid according to three bands. Band 1: £18.50 covers an examination, diagnosis and advice. If necessary it will also cover X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment . Band 2: £50.50 covers all treatment covered by band one, plus additional treatment including fillings, root canal and removing teeth. Band 3: £219 covers all treatments covered in bands one and two, plus complex procedures including crowns, dentures and bridges . Miss Duffield, 23, visited her GP on August 18, 2013, suffering from palpitations, and was taken to Queen's Medical Centre before being transferred to Nottingham City Hospital, where she died on August 22 of viral acute myocarditis. Now Nottinghamshire Coroner Mairin Casey, who was not made aware that she had visited Mr D'Mello's surgery prior to her death, has asked police to investigate. Miss Duffield's death was attributed to natural causes and because she died in hospital no inquest was held. The coroner has to power to order an inquest if she feels there are any questions over her death. NHS England has set aside £500,000 for a massive operation to recall the 22,000 patients he treated in a career spanning three decades. Patients say their dentist's fall from grace has sent shockwaves through their community. He was as a well-liked and popular man before he left his role at the surgery earlier this year. One former patient of Mr D'Mello, Chris Dalkin, told MailOnline he had only ever been impressed by his dentist of more than 20 years. Mr D'Mello worked for 32 years at the Daybrook Dental Practice, pictured, in Mansfield Road, Nottingham. NHS bosses stressed the practice is under new ownership . He said: 'He is a brilliant dentist. Professional, courteous and the same goes for the staff. 'A very popular dentist as the large numbers involved prove. 'The whole thing stinks. I hate to think what Mr D'Mello is going through.' Rumours of his suspension had spread through the community before this week's report was released by the General Dental Council, criticising his hygiene practices. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission visited Daybrook Dental Surgery on July 17. Their inspection came a month after a whistleblower raised concerns with health bosses over alleged infection-control breaches. In August, a report into their findings, found the practice failing in three of the five areas assessed - cleanliness and infection control, safety, availability and suitability of equipment and assessing and monitoring the quality of service provision. The report highlighted a range of hygiene concerns. Inspectors noted: 'We observed the staff toilet and the room next to the toilet were being used as store rooms for equipment. 'This posed a risk of these items coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated. 'This risk had not been identified by staff at the dental surgery and no action had been taken to minimise it. 'We saw that mops and buckets for cleaning the practice were stored directly next to the staff toilet, in the same room, which again posed a risk of this cleaning equipment coming into contact with body fluids which may be contaminated.' The report noted the practice had an infection-control programme in place, and that it had been reviewed in February 2013. Inspectors had visited the clinic just six months before, in November last year, and gave it a clean bill of health. Martin Clamp, 24, a construction worker from Daybrook said: 'When my partner told me about it, I was speechless. I came straight down to the centre and registered to be tested. 'I had three teeth out earlier this year and there were no problems but it makes you think. 'It all makes me feel uneasy, worried and a little bit scared. I've been going there all my life and if I've got something in my blood and passed it on to my partner, she could have given it to my son when she was pregnant.' Emma Hopewell, 27, from Arnold, said she was worried about the situation because she is eight months pregnant. She said: 'I'm having to get my children to go and have blood tests because of this, and I'm pregnant I shouldn't be having to worry about it. 'I think it's disgusting. It's a small dentist so I know they kept files in the toilets, so it wouldn't surprise me if he kept equipment in there as well.' She said they had been given packs with advice in and now had to wait 14 days until they find out the results. Her mother, Iris Brace, 54, also of Arnold, said: 'It's absolutely disgusting. To think that our whole family has been going to see him for so long and now we're all having to get tested over this.' NHS England said 1,333 patients had so far called the helpline, and more than 600 people had gone to a clinic set up to deal with queries and perform precautionary blood tests. A spokeswoman said 452 patients had so far been tested at the clinic in Arnold, Nottingham. A dedicated advice line has been set up offering guidance on how to access additional support. Anyone who is concerned can call the advice line on 03330 142479 from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week. NHS England has also set up a temporary Community Clinic for patients, to provide further advice, counselling, and where necessary blood testing. Patients can visit the clinic from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, at the Arnold Health Centre, located at Highcroft Medical Centre on High Street in Arnold, Nottingham. Anyone who lives outside the area, or is housebound should contact the advice line for information about how to access screening.","Desmond D'Mello has been suspended amid claims he flouted safety rules .

"He may be second line to the throne, but Prince William has described his job as a search and rescue pilot as his greatest calling in life. The Duke of Cambridge has spoken movingly about the emotions of saving lives as an RAF helicopter pilot in never-before-seen footage of him on duty.

Scroll down for trailer . In the pilot's seat: Prince William sitts behind the controls of a Royal Air Force Sea King helicopter at RAF Valley in Anglesey, as qualified as a Search And Rescue Operational Captain. (File photo) Flt Lt Wales as he is known in the RAF, who lost his own mother in 1997, said: 'There's no greater feeling than when you've actually done some good and saved someone's life.

Flight checks: The Duke of Cambridge heroics as a Search and Rescue pilot are to feature in a BBC documentary airing tonight . The Duke as been serving with C Flight of 22 Squadron at RAF Valley on Anglesey since 2010. One of the rescues featured in the documentary which airs tonight on at 10.35pm on BBC 1, sees William take control of his Sea King helicopter during a difficult mission to save a young boy who has fallen dangerously off an old railway bridge onto rocks at old quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog. Describing the moment a life and death mission comes in, William said: 'As captain you're trying to play out the entire rescue, the transit to the rescue and back again in your mind, and pick up any circumstances or problems you can foresee, and try and fix them on the ground before you get airborne.' The documentary also catches action and ethos of the other crew members around the prince on Anglesey, and at RMB Chivenor in Devon. Winchman and paramedic Master Aircrewman Richard Taylor describes just how treacherous rescue work can be, as a decision is made that they should winch a casualty on board the helicopter on a stretcher. He said: 'It's a challenging procedure,' adding: 'and inherently dangerous to put a man on a very thin piece of wire, hanging underneath nine tons of helicopter that's susceptible to turbulence and problems itself, and may have to fly away.'

"A massive 93 per cent of British women say that wearing high heels is painful . British women own 25 pairs of shoes - but don’t wear a quarter of them because they are too uncomfortable, according to a new study. The research shows the typical woman has five shoes worth £190 languishing unused, as much as £3.3 billion worth lying abandoned across the UK. Yet this apparent waste doesn’t slow down spending, with the research showing British women buy 17 pairs a year at a cost of £608. Even the stylish French and Spanish buy fewer pairs, although it seems women on the continent are more likely to value quality over quantity. The study commissioned by Compeed shows German, Italian and French women all spend more per pair, with ladies in this country typically raiding the sales and spending £38 a time. Four in ten British women admit they snap up ‘bargains’ in the summer and spring sales. In contrast, German and Italian women spend £55 on each pair of shoes. Perhaps buying in haste leads British women to regret their purchases with 21 per cent admitting they feel pain due to blisters. Indeed, 93 per cent say wearing high heels is painful. So why is it women are happy to spend so much on unwearable shoes which they then leave to gather dust in the back of the wardrobe? Psychologist Emma Kenny suggests they are willing to repeatedly endure discomfort because heels make them feel sexy, confident and elegant. Four in ten Britons admit they snap up 'bargains' in the summer and spring sales, but may regret their purchase later . She said: 'Women buy high heels because they make them feel confident and sexy. 'Confidence is something we all aspire to. It makes us happy, full of direction and in control of our lives; so it makes sense that we invest in things which aid this feeling. 'The results show that British women agree, and that’s why they see shoes as important purchases they make on a regular basis. 'With confidence comes possibilities which helps explain the amount of money women will spend on shoes over a lifetime.'","German, Italian and French women all spend more per pair .

"The married high school teacher and mother-of-three was sentenced today to five years behind bars after a jury found her guilty of having sex with five male students, four of whom she had group sex with while being videotaped. It came after her husband pleaded with the judge for leniency in her sentencing and vowed to stand by his wife after he revealed they liked to have legal group sex as a couple. A jury took less than an hour to find Brittni Colleps guilty today of the sex crimes after they were shown a video of the orgy  with her students in court. Her husband Christopher Colleps told the court he is working on forgiving his wife and admitted that, though they had engaged in group sex together before, he felt wronged by her actions with the students. He said: 'I'm asking you to give her probation. It's not my fault or her children's, and taking her away from us is . punishing us. Brittni saved my life before I met her.

The . married mother-of-three, met the students while she worked at Kennedale . High School in Texas as an English teacher and repeatedly invited them . to her home for sex. The jury took less than an hour to find her guilty on five counts of having an inappropriate relationship between a student and teacher. Her mother also testified during the sentencing hearing to ask the judge to show some mercy. Shirley Bush said: 'Have mercy on her as someone who has . done nothing wrong except in that time period.

Although all of the students she had sex with are 18 or older, the law protects students from a relationship . with someone in a superior position. The . teenagers said she contacted them through text messages - with one . saying she texted him 100 times in a day - or by 'poking' them on . Facebook. On Thursday, one student, John, said he had been to the teacher's home with friends . and on his own and had sex with her. He told the court that on one occasion, Colleps cooked the students spaghetti, showed them sex toys and then modelled lingerie, the Star-Telegram reported. The group then went to the back yard . where they played a game of truth and dare and one of the boys . was dared to have sex with the teacher. They went to her bedroom, where they had sex. John added that the group had agreed . to 'keep it on the low' so Colleps would not get in trouble, and added . that he did not want to testify against her, and did not consider . himself a victim. When he was asked what should happen to her, he responded: 'I wouldn't say jail time.' Another student, Jordan, . said he learned from friends that the teacher was having sex with . students and he 'just was amazed,' he told the court. He went to her house twice, where he engaged in group sex, he said. He added that he recorded the last encounter using one of the other boys' phones. The video, which was shown to the court on Tuesday, showed Colleps having sex with the boys; although her back is to the camera, she is identifiable by a neck tattoo, they said. Colleps looked away from the screen and appeared uncomfortable when it was shown. Prosecutor .

"If you thought the recent bad weather was just a storm in a teacup, think again - it could dump some nasty news on your plate, too. The cost of a fish supper could jump by as much as 10 per cent after trawlers were unable to go out to sea in the storms, a report has claimed. The shortage has pushed up wholesale prices of popular white fish such as haddock, plaice and whiting to one and a half times what they were this time last year. Any bites? A fisherman braves storms in Cleveleys, Lancashire, earlier this month. A report by trade magazine The Grocer has said prices of popular white fish are up by more than 50 per cent on this time last year . Research by trade magazine The Grocer showed haddock has leaped in price to £1,474 a tonne (up 54 per cent), plaice has risen to £1,246 (51 per cent) and whiting is now £1,675 (44 per cent). The cost of whiting has risen 37 per cent over the last month alone, according to the report, with plaice up 11 per cent. The government body Seafish, set up to ensure quality of the fish that ends up on our plates, said most of the rise will be absorbed by business owners until the price drops back to normal levels. But the National Federation of Fishmongers told the Mirror customers could expect to see a rise of about 10 per cent. The federation's president Jonathan Adams told the newspaper: 'The price of fish is always affected by the weather, but when it goes up, consumers must expect to pay as much as 10 per cent more.' British staple: Once a cheap and cheerful Friday night supper, a trip to the chippy can hit you in the pocket . Once a cheap and cheerful Friday night . takeaway, the cost of cod and chips for a family of four has risen to . well over £25 in some areas. Haddock is particularly affected because of reduced quotas, according to The Grocer. Bad weather in Norway has also taken its toll, with farmed salmon up 46 per cent since this time last year. The problem was caused by cold weather disrupting supply and an increased demand over Christmas.","Prices of plaice, whiting and haddock all up around 50 per cent on last year .

"A classic Ferrari has become the most expensive car ever sold in Britain after changing hands for an estimated £24 million. The 1957 prototype of the Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa won high-profile races and competed twice at 24 Hours of Le Mans, the oldest active car race in the world. It has now been sold to a so-far anonymous enthusiast - and the price is understood to be three times what was paid for a Testa Rossa in 2009. Just popping to the shops: This Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa has sold for an estimated £24 million, smashing the British record. It was raced by Formula 1 world champion Phil Hill and competed at the world's oldest car race . Mid-life crisis? The car features leather seating, an original steering wheel and only reasonable wear and tear . Hailed by an expert as one of the five best Ferraris in the world, the model was also raced by the Formula 1 world champion Phil Hill. It was previously owned by the millionaire investor Eric Heerema until he was persuaded to sell it to Derbyshire dealer Tom Hartley Jr. Mr Hartley revealed he has now sold the Ferrari, but wouldn’t confirm the exact selling price. However, well-placed sources said the anonymous buyer paid in excess of £24.1 million - making it the most expensive car ever sold publicly. The highest was previously the £22.5 million paid in 2012 for a Ferrari 250 GTO, also owned by Mr Heerema. The Testa Rossa achieved the record figure because of its looks, racing pedigree, rarity and the fact is in 'unmolested' - completely original - condition. Another Testa Rossa was sold in 2011 at a U.S. auction for £10 million ($16.4 million), but they were both far inferior examples to the latest model. The specialist dealer, who sold his first supercar at the age of 11, said: 'I can confirm that the car has sold, although due to client . confidentiality we will not disclose the buyer or the price achieved. 'This . Ferrari is without question one of the most important cars on the . planet if not the most important because of its originality. 'While I won’t go into the terms of the sale, I am sure it will prove to be a great investment for the new owner. Legendary: Chassis 0704 remained a favourite of Ferrari designer Sergio Scaglietti until his death aged 91 . 'Now . it is done, my only disappointment is the fact I don’t think it can . ever be bettered as I truly think it is the greatest car in the world.' The model sold was the second prototype and factory team car for two seasons with Ferrari, when then made a further 19 customer cars. Top spec: The V12 engine helps the car achieve 0-60 in about six seconds, spellbinding for its day . Known as Chassis 0704, it was designed by legendary Ferrari pioneer Sergio Scaglietti and was one of his favourite models up until his death aged 91. At the 1957 Le Mans race the prototype ran as high as second position but did not finish the race. The next year, however, Chassis . 0704 picked up two wins - in the 1,000km Buenos Aires and 12 Hour Sebring . races - with Formula 1 legends Phil Hill and Peter Collins behind the wheel in both. It was later sold to a U.S. customer and was driven to victory in 16 races on the other side of the Atlantic. In 1967 the car was donated to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, where it stayed for 30 years. Ferrari historian Marcel . Massini described the prototype as 'one of the top five . Ferraris on the planet'. He added: 'It is so valuable because it is totally unmolested and not . restored, genuine and very original. It also comes with a fantastic . history which is most important. 'I . believe the Ferrari market will continue to go up as more and more . wealthy people need to reinvest their cash but there are not many more . top quality cars available. 'It’s simple supply and demand. Classic cars as hard assets are just one of several asset classes nowadays.' The HAGI index, which tracks the market, estimates the classic Ferrari market has increased fourfold over the past decade. This has seen savvy investors and car collectors ploughing their cash into the classic market which is seen by some as safer and more profitable than stocks and shares - not to mention more fun.

"They may have worked together for three years at Real Madrid, but Sergio Ramos seems to have forgotten all about his former manager Jose Mourinho.

Ramos and Mourinho are locked in a spat over comments the Spanish defender made about Chelsea stars Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa. Sergio Ramos (right) celebrates Real sixteenth consecutive win, after snubbing Jose Mourinho . The Real Madrid man questioned whether Chelsea's two players were genuinely injured, insinuating that they were more committed to playing for their club than country. But Mourinho hit back, stating that Ramos 'is not a doctor', and criticised him for questioning the duo. And, when asked about those comments, Ramos seemingly snubbed his former boss, acting as if he didn't know who Mourinho was. Jose Mourinho had hit out at Ramos, arguing that 'he is not a doctor' and should not criticise Chelsea's players . 'I have nothing to say to the president of Celta,' Ramos responded after Real Madrid's win on Saturday night when the Chelsea manager's jibe was mentioned. The defender was more eager to discuss Real Madrid's win over Malaga, their 16th straight victory. That meant Carlo Ancelotti broke a club record - which was jointly held by Mourinho.

"Controversial: Francesca Minerva says doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies because they are disabled, too expensive or simply unwanted by their mothers . Doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies because they are disabled, too expensive or simply unwanted by their mothers, an academic with links to Oxford University has claimed. Francesca Minerva, a philosopher and medical ethicist, argues a young baby is not a real person and so killing it in the first days after birth is little different to aborting it in the womb. Even a healthy baby could have its life snuffed out if the mother decides she can’t afford to look after it, the article published by the British Medical Journal group states. The journal’s editor has defended . the piece, saying the publication’s role is to present well-reasoned . arguments, rather than promote one particular moral view. But . the article has angered other ethicists, peers and campaigners. They . have described the call for legalised infanticide as chilling and an . ‘inhumane defence of child destruction’. The doctor, a research associate at . Oxford, has received death threats and hate calls telling her that she will 'burn in hell', and she said the last few days since publication have been 'the worst of my life'. Writing . in the Journal of Medical Ethics, Dr Minerva and co-author Alberto Giubilini, a University of Milan . bioethicist, argue that ‘after-birth abortion’ should be permissible in . all cases in which abortion is. They . state that like an unborn child, a newborn has yet to develop hopes, . goals and dreams and so, while clearly human, is not a person – someone . with a moral right to life. In contrast, parents, siblings and society have aims and plans that could be affected by the arrival of the child and their interests should come first. The article, After-birth abortion: why should the baby live? first addresses scenarios in which parents are unaware their child is disabled until after it is born. The piece argues that, though the child may be happy, it will not reach the potential of a normal child. ‘To bring up such children might be an unbearable burden on the family and on society as a whole…On these grounds, the fact that a foetus has the potential to become a person who will have an (at least) acceptable life is no reason for prohibiting abortion.’ Right to decide: Dr Minerva argues a young baby is not a real person and so killing it in the first days after birth is little different to aborting it in the womb . The ethicists are also in favour of . the infanticide of a healthy baby when the woman’s circumstances have . changed and she no longer has the time, money or energy to care for it. They argue that while adoption might be an option, it could cause undue psychological distress to the mother. As the hate calls came in, Dr Minerva she had not . been expecting the overwhelmingly negative reaction. Joanna Jepson: 'A compelling reason to stop late-term abortions' She . said she . believes her argument was taken out of its academic and theoretical . context, and that 'I wish I could explain to people it is not a policy - . and I'm not suggesting that and I'm not encouraging that'. She believes the majority of threats have come from religious or Pro-Life groups. Some of the hate messages told her that she would be punished by God, while others suggested she should 'burn in hell'. The article also provoked responses from religious and pro-life groups. Rev Joanna Jepson, came to public attention when she spoke out against a late abortion that had been carried out in 2001. Doctors are permitted to carry out abortions beyond the 24-week legal limit if they believe a baby's disability is serious enough, but Joanna argued that a cleft palate was a minor physical flaw, not a severe abnormality. She revealed that, until surgery at the age of 19, her own face was disfigured by a congenital defect. Her upper jaw overhung her lower jaw, which receded into her neck, and posed the question: 'Would it have been right to abort me?' She said: 'It's misleading to call this 'after birth abortion'. The pregnancy is already over, there is nothing to abort.  What is being discussed is infanticide. 'There is a logic to their point - if we consider it acceptable to abort a baby up until birth then why not allow it to die afterwards? It is just a difference in geography -  within or outside the mother's body. 'Of course, I would see this a compelling reason to abolish late-term abortion, if infanticide is morally repulsive then abortion is too. 'If a baby, because of it's physical disabilities, is seen as being ""incompatible with life"" then we need to let life and death take its course. Becoming agents of death fundamentally changes doctor's role as healer and physician, and it also has massive repercussions on society's conscience shifting what is understood to be morally and socially unacceptable to become acceptable. Of course motherhood is inconvenient, physically, emotionally, psychologically, financially - but this inconvenience is not allowed to become acceptable grounds for abandoning one's child. 'If a child or an adult has a life-changing accident or illness, do we suggest we'll put them down because their goals and dreams now have to change? 'My brother, Alastair, has great and huge goals and he goes after them with great courage.  His Downs Syndrome does not stand in the way. 'They are very different dreams and goals to my own but no less valuable or of contribution to society.  At what level would Dr Minerva assign somebody's meaning and value to be worth a life? Mass grave: Yewden Villa in Buckinghamshire . While infanticide may seem an inhumane concept for many people, there have been periods in history where it has been accepted behaviour - and even a legal obligation. In Roman culture, disabled infants were often abandoned after birth by parents who did not want or could not afford the financial burden. The child would simply be left outside to die from starvation and the elements in a practice known as 'exposure'. It was an established and acceptable procedure. In 1912, Yewsden Villa (right) was excavated in Hambleden in Buckinghamshire, and researchers were shocked to find the bodies of 97 babies in a mass-grave. The babies had apparently all been killed shortly after birth, and the prevailing theory is that the site was near a brothel. With a lack of contraception in Roman times, unwanted pregnancies would likely have been much more common, and the mass grave is another example that infanticide did not pose such an ethical dilemma in that era. Archaeologists believe Romans did not consider infants to be 'full' human beings until about the age of two, and babies who died before that age were not buried in cemeteries, but instead in public or domestic areas. However a Roman couple were entitled to raise a disabled child. In Sparta, there was little choice in the matter. Newborns were seen as the property of the state and all babies were inspected by a community leader. If the child showed signs of deformity or ill-health, the parents were ordered to expose it. Many parents in ancient Greeks would also expose their newborns because of sickness, financial pressure, or simply for being the 'wrong' sex in the male-dominated society. Many religions had did not raise moral objects to infanticide, although Christianity and Islam notably rejected it. Leaving the child to the elements was the preferred method to 'dispose' of the child, because it meant the child died of natural causes, which was a more 'moral' death than directly killing the child. The practice generally died out, and was outlawed in the last years of the Roman Empire. However there are references to infanticide in many cultures in every historical era, and is believed to still take place in certain parts of India, Africa, and China. China's controversial 'one-child' policy leads to many children being abandoned after birth. Trevor . Stammers, a lecturer in medical ethics and former chairman of the . Christian Medical Fellowship, described the viewpoint as ‘chilling’. Gill . Duval, of the ProLife Alliance, said every life is precious and added: . ‘Everybody talks about what women want but women wouldn’t want this.’ Lord Alton, chairman of the All Party . Parliamentary Group on Pro-Life, told the Catholic Herald: ‘It is . profoundly disturbing, indeed shocking, to see the way in which . opinion-formers within the medical profession have ditched the . professional belief of the healer to uphold the sanctity of human life . for this impoverished and inhumane defence of child destruction.’ Julian Savulescu, the journal’s editor, said that the article’s argument has been made before by eminent figures. He added: ‘I’m not defending practising infanticide. I’m defending academic and intellectual freedom.’ He said that Dr Minerva has a ‘loose relationship’ with Oxford and her main position is at the University of Melbourne.

"Kevin Pietersen's autobiography was launched on Monday and the former England cricketer has certainly divided opinion with his revelations. Here, Sportsmail experts Nasser Hussain, Sir Clive Woodward and Martin Keown deliver their own verdicts on KP. Kevin Pietersen launched his autobiography on Monday morning and here's Sportsmail's experts' verdicts . NASSER HUSSAIN . What we are hearing from Kevin Pietersen all comes from England losing 5-0 in Australia. You never learn about divisions in the camp when a team is winning. The concept of team spirit makes me laugh. Michael Holding will tell you that some of the great West Indies players did not get on and Shane Warne will say the same about his great Australian side but what they all had was respect for one another when they stepped onto the field. Somewhere along the line that respect between Pietersen and other England players and coaches has been lost. It makes fascinating reading, Kevin is entitled to his views and makes some valid points. But the methods employed by Andy Flower that he condemns took England to the top of the world rankings and three Ashes triumphs. Sportsmail's Nasser Hussain (left) speaks with Pietersen (right) in 2012 at The Oval in London . Pietersen, with Surrey at the time, gestures as he speaks to former England captain and Sportsmail's Hussain . CLICK HERE for Sportsmail's exclusive! There is a fine line between bullying and banter. I have always found the way England’s bowlers respond to misfields as unedifying but I’m sure they will tell you that they set high standards and challenge each other in this way. And if what we hear about Pietersen’s attitude towards James Taylor at Headingley in 2012, which Kevin touches on in the book, is true then maybe that borders on the kind of ‘bullying’ he now condemns so strongly. Perhaps the lesson that needs to be learned from this affair is that Peter Moores and Alastair Cook need to keep an eye on the culture within the dressing room so that, if they gain success with a new England team, it does not all collapse around them because of a spectacular clash of egos. Pietersen, whose autobiography was launched on Monday, holds his head as he speaks to Hussain in 2012 . SIR CLIVE WOODWARD . I like Kevin Pietersen, he’s the kind of athlete I’d want in my team. But I can’t get on board with books of this nature. As a fan I’m saddened, and as a coach I just can’t believe it’s all got so out of hand. It just enforces my belief that unless you get it right off the field you have no chance on the field. Elite sport is a tough place and conflicts are natural behind the scenes. Our England team was at its best when a bit of sulphur was in the air, it’s important to speak out. Pietersen stands and chats with coach Andy Flower (right) during a nets session at Trent Bridge in 2013 . That said, the personal resentment and vilifying Pietersen’s book exposes is not a problem any team I’ve been a part of has had to deal with. Our team had a set of Teamship Rules — behaviours we agreed upon together. These would cover all manner of issues — many similar to those Pietersen highlights. We even agreed never to write anything in a book anyone in the dressing room would take offence to. For all the achievements that England team made they have clearly fallen short in this area, and there’ll be more to come. ‘How do you want to be remembered?’ is one of my favourite lines. I can’t help but wonder how some of these guys would answer this question now. Pietersen has exposed various incidents in his autobiography and Sportsmail's experts deliver their verdicts . MARTIN KEOWN . You cannot allow a culture to develop in a dressing room where you have cliques and people getting special treatment. So if England did put their bowlers on a pedestal, that is a huge failing of the management. The idea that fielders had to apologise to bowlers if they dropped a catch is really unhealthy. Walking on eggshells and living in fear of people within your own team is mad. People know when they make mistakes, they don’t have to be told to apologise. A big man will do that anyway. Being scared just means you make more mistakes. People need support — not to be screamed at. Pietersen has involved stories about his time with England and Sportsmail's experts have their say on it too . Pietersen seems to have spent a lot of time questioning and criticising the England management but doing that in front of everybody undermined them. The one time I captained England, manager Howard Wilkinson told me if there were problems, I should raise them with him, not in front of the group. Pietersen should have probably done the same. The problem with speaking out is that people get fed up and you end up looking the fool. If he hadn’t been so outspoken, he would still be playing for England. He has had a magnificent career. Now he should move on or the bitterness will eat away at him forever. VIDEO Pietersen blasts former England 'regime'","Kevin Pietersen launched his controversial autobiography on Monday .

"A teenager who suffers from a rare genetic condition which makes her look middle-aged has been given new confidence thanks to pioneering facelift surgery. Zara Hartshorn, 16, from Rotherham, south Yorkshire, had to endure years of cruel taunts and even physical abuse because of her appearance. She inherited lipodystrophy - which makes her skin looked wrinkled and twisted - from her mother Tracey Gibson who also suffers from the illness. But after hearing of her condition, a top surgeon in the US offered to perform cosmetic surgery for free. It has proved to be a complete success and Zara has felt able to start a relationship with new boyfriend Ricky Andrews and is even keen to go to college. Scroll down for video . Tough: Zara Hartshorn has endured a difficult childhood suffering from a condition which makes her appear middle-aged . New start: Thanks to pioneering facelift surgery, Zara says she feels much more confident about her appearance . It is a remarkable change of fortunes for the teenager who was once left in tears  after being made to get off a bus for not being able to prove she was eligible for a child's ticket. By the time she was 12, Zara was already being mistaken for a middle-aged woman - and was even mistaken for 17-year-old sister Chloe's mother. But now thanks to a lifeline by a surgeon in the US Zara feels indistinguishable from her peers. Dr Abhimanyu Garg told Zara her condition is actually cutis laxa, an even rarer disease which only . affects 30 people in the UK. And Zara, who one day dreams of owning a beauty salon, says she is ready to leave the past behind and forgive her tormentors. She said: 'Before I had surgery I was picked on for looking different, now I look the same as other girls my age. 'I don't feel like people are staring at me when I walk down the street anymore. I finally feel like a teenager. 'I've carried some hurtful comments with me all my life but now I feel ready to leave the past behind and forgive and forget.' Her newfound self-assurance has helped her start a relationship with apprentice painter and decorator Ricky, 22, three months ago, who she met through friends. She said: 'I've had boyfriends in the the past but I don't think any accepted my condition, really. But with Ricky it's never been an issue. Found love: On top of her facelift, Zara has also met a new boyfriend Ricky Andrews . 'He's seen pictures of me before and told me I was always beautiful - although I wouldn't have had the self-confidence to believe him before.' Growing up Zara put her rapid aging down to lipodystrophy - a genetic illness which decays bones and destroys fat beneath the skin. At age four doctors told her she had inherited the condition from Tracey after she developed excess skin round her jawline. Zara said: 'Mum explained that I had an illness like she did, but that I was beautiful and shouldn't pay any attention to what anyone said. 'The bullying was worst between the ages of eight and ten. Kids used to call me monkey and granny and I was even beaten up just because of how I looked. 'It got so bad I stopped going for a while.' But even after changing schools Zara's life was made a misery because of her illness. She recalled: 'I lived in fear of being asked how old I was. Genetic: Zara, pictured right pre-surgery, inherited the condition from her mother Tracey, left. But sister Chloe, centre, has not been affected . 'I was even mistaken for a teacher in school on a couple of occasions, which was just mortifying in front of my classmates.' After Zara's plight was made public she was contacted by lipodystrophy expert Dr Abhimanyu Garg, from Texas, US, who asked to carry out some tests on Zara and Tracey. The pair were found to be suffering from cutis laxa, an even rarer condition which can shorten life expectancy, weaken joints and can lung and heart problems. Taunts: As a child, Zara was bullied by other children who called her 'monkey' and 'granny' Although hard news to take in, Zara was later presented with the offer of a facelift and nose augmentation free of charge by top surgeon Dr Robert Ersek. She said: 'It was an amazing opportunity that I could never of dreamed of before. 'When I saw myself in the mirror after the bandages all came off it was mixture of surprise and happiness. 'I used to hate my nose, but now I love it.' Difficult: Zara said she was even confused as a teacher at school on several occasions, but feels much happier after her facelift with boyfriend Ricky, right . And thanks to her confidence boost, Zara is determined to go to college and achieve her ambition. She said: 'I feel much more confident and just happier in general. 'I'm now able to do things like going to college and having a career which I might not have felt possible before. 'The surgery has given me a boost and now I don't fear what other people think. 'I've noticed a change in me and I feel a lot happier.' And poignantly, Zara says she is all the more determined to live a happy, normal life because of the support she has had from her mother Tracey. She said: 'I know I'm lucky to have had the opportunity and it's something my mum would have loved to have been offered. 'I want to make something of my life for her - to make her proud. 'I know I'll always have this condition and it may shorten my life, but at least I can feel more like comfortable and confident. 'Although I look younger I still feel older than my years because of everything I have been through.'","Zara Hartshorn, from Rotherham, south Yorkshire, born with lipodystrophy .

"Click here to read the most damning allegations in the leaked ECB dossier . Kevin Pietersen has never been one to follow the norm, and on Tuesday night he chose one of the world’s 100 most endangered buildings to launch the book charting the recent career of this endangered cricketer. The former England batsman found himself in a stunning Franciscan monastery set, incongruously, in the unfashionable Manchester suburb of Gorton to publicise the autobiography that has lit bonfires around the national team. This late 19th Century building has long since ceased to be a place purely for religious contemplation - it is now rented out for assorted functions - but it still seemed an appropriate place for him to stop to consider the latest chapter in his colourful life. Kevin Pietersen, pictured during the last Ashes series, has told his side of the story in his new autobiography . Gorton monastery in Manchester, one of the world's most endangered buildings, where Pietersen spoke . By the time Pietersen was introduced, in conversation with journalist Tim Hague, he was being buffeted by the appearance of an ECB dossier, which had mysteriously appeared online to coincide with this book launch. Tuesday night was the first event of what might, in reality, be the last concerted blast of publicity for the wandering batsman, good or bad. His resurrected profile in the past week saw a late surge in interest, and it was standing room only in the cloisters with The Monastery full to its 400-capacity. Supplementing their number, and paying for their tickets, were representatives from the ECB, including one of M’learned friends in the governing body’s employ, just to keep an eye on things. A dossier of information on Kevin Pietersen put together by the ECB has been revealed . It was not long before Pietersen brought out the heavy roller with reference to the home board. ‘My character has been assassinated for five or six years by the ECB press machine, but I can go to bed at night and sleep easy,’ he said. This was the first time that he had put himself in the court of public opinion, and he got a warm enough reception from the gathering of cricketing enthusiasts, although it was hardly the One Direction treatment. The five-page section of the ECB dossier draft is marked STRICTLY PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL . After warming up, he lined up Graeme Swann in his sights, addressing the spinner’s decision to leave the Ashes tour after three Tests, something he omits  in the book. ‘Do I think it’s right he jumped ship? No, I think he let the England team down. A lot of the players felt very aggrieved by him jumping ship mid-series. ‘If his elbow was an issue, fine, but I think he could have held on for a couple more weeks.’ Never likely to escape was one of his main targets in the book, wicketkeeper and vice-captain Matt Prior, and laughter broke out when the Big Cheese label was brought up - ‘the Dairylea Triangle who thinks he is Brie’. A truncated round of applause broke out when he addressed the issue of England players being ‘picked on’. He said: ‘Everyone knew there was a bullying culture in that dressing room. A lot of players have texted me in the past 24 hours saying “Well done”.’ As his answers echoed around this former place of worship with its glorious acoustics (it was deconsecrated in 1989), the audience hung on his words. Whether people like Pietersen or not, they wanted to hear his every thought, even when credulity was stretched. ‘If there was a podium for egos in the England team, I wouldn’t be on it,’ he insisted. Sitting 30 yards beneath a giant crucifix hung from the ceiling, persecution for stating his beliefs was a recurring theme. It had been a long day of broadcast appearances and he sounded tired, and somewhat resigned to his fate with England: ‘I live in hope and I know a lot of people will think I have no chance, maybe rightly so.’ He reiterated his regret about Textgate, of how he added to Andrew Strauss’s stress as England captain, and how he apologised to the skipper’s wife, Ruth. Batsmen Pietersen spoke of his regret for adding to Andrew Strauss's stress as captain of England . And another thing he kicks himself for: ‘Watching an IPL match on the television while we (England) were batting - bad move. It sounds funny but it wasn’t.’ It is one thing saying it in a book or on the radio, it is another saying it to a room of 400 people. The first 40 minutes of last night was serious stuff and somewhat joyless, not unlike much of the book. He seemed relieved to, latterly, get questions purely about his playing experiences. The mood lightened considerably when it was thrown open to the floor, with the people seemingly well-disposed towards him. A boy, announcing that he was 10 years old, asked what tips he might hand out about batting. ‘If it’s up there, hit it into the car park,’ replied Pietersen. And for a fleeting moment it seemed like 2005 again, everyone eating out of his hand.","Kevin Pietersen launched new book in a stunning Franciscan monastery .

"In the small Australian city of Townsville, locals assume the name of their football club is a nod towards the tropical cyclones that batter the Northern Queensland coast at this time of the year. Spend 30 minutes in conversation with the man who doubles as manager and director of football at Northern Fury, though, and you could be forgiven for believing the team were named after him. Ask Ian Ferguson — formerly of this manor — about his hopes and ambitions for the fledgling Queensland State side and he speaks in calm, measured tones. Ian Ferguson (right) argues with the fourth official during his time in charge of Perth Glory in 2012 . Yet, when the topic turns to his first love, you appreciate it is maybe no bad thing that 10,000 miles currently separates him from Ibrox. If absence does indeed make the heart grow fonder, then what the 47-year-old has witnessed from afar over the past four years has threatened to break his. One of just three players to have featured in every one of the Nine-in-a-Row seasons, Ferguson now barely recognises the emaciated beast a once proud club has become. ‘It’s really sad. It breaks my heart sitting over here and seeing what’s going on,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘It actually makes it more frustrating when you are so far away.’ Distance and a sizeable time difference have proven no barriers to one of the club’s great midfield war horses keeping up to speed on the whole sorry saga. But it’s long since got to the stage where flicking on the tablet for a daily update is an act undertaken with considerablme trepidation. Like the vast majority of Rangers supporters, as far as Ferguson is concerned, there is no ambiguity as to where the blame for the current shambles lies. ‘We just want our club back and for it to be in good hands,’ he states. ‘At this moment in time, it’s not in good hands. ‘Every single day, you look online and it’s story after story after story — each one more negative than the last. ‘You just wonder what these guys (in the boardroom) are doing. Don’t treat the Rangers fans like idiots because that’s one thing they are not. They know the game and what’s going on here. ‘They won’t stand for mediocre people in the club.’ Ferguson is now the manager and director of football at Northern Fury in Australia . An £850,000 capture from St Mirren in 1988, it was Ferguson’s good fortune to join Rangers at the outset of an unprecedented period of dominance in the Scottish game. And yet, as a lifelong supporter of the club, he needed no one to point out the folly in taking the good times for granted. Before the arrival of Graeme Souness as player/manager in 1986, the Ibrox outfit had been also-rans in the Premier League since 1978. Under John Greig in the early 80s, crowds often struggled to reach five figures — the kind of paltry numbers no one inside the club ever thought they’d witness again. ‘You always thought: “This is Rangers FC” and it would never fall so far. Not in a million years,’ Ferguson reflects. ‘When you see Rangers playing to an 11,000 crowd (against Raith Rovers), when is the penny going to drop? It’s just diabolical. ‘Not so long ago, they were getting 50,000 every second week. What the hell has been going on for it to reach this point?’ The question is rhetorical. Ferguson knows well the whole sorry story involving Sir David Murray, Craig Whyte, Charles Green, the Easdale brothers and Mike Ashley. A catalogue of self-inflicted wounds by the so-called custodians of the club. A general view of Ibrox during the Scottish Cup match between Rangers and Raith Rovers on Sunday . That the scale of the mess is nuclear is beyond dispute. The pertinent question now is what happens to clean it up. ‘I think the whole place needs a total clear-out from top to bottom. We’ve got to start afresh,’ Ferguson muses. ‘The board just don’t listen. I hope that (Dave) King and the Three Bears get in and the shareholders vote this board out. They are treating Rangers fans and shareholders with total contempt. ‘Why are they taking this EGM to London? Is it to prevent people coming down and voting? ‘If it is, they really are vastly underestimating Rangers fans. They are sick and tired of what’s happening. ‘How can these guys believe that they are doing a good job? ‘What is it they don’t understand? They are not liked or wanted. Rangers fans want them out and people who will bring the club forward in. ‘Whether that takes another four, five, six years, then so be it. That’s what we have to do.’ While Ferguson holds the men at the top ultimately responsible for the mess beneath them, they are not the only targets of his considerable ire. A man who seemed born to play in Old Firm matches, he tuned on his television a week past on Sunday to watch the League Cup semi-final with Celtic far more in hope than expectation. He was wise to approach the game with pessimism. Not only did Rangers fail to progress, they failed to lay a glove on their great rivals. Ferguson (left) pictured with Ally McCoist after Rangers won the Skol Cup in 1988 . For Ferguson, not even managing to ruffle Celtic’s feathers was entirely unacceptable. ‘They should at least have a bit of pride and passion,’ he adds. ‘It was the first Old Firm game for three years and the boy (Scott) Brown was right — it was probably the easiest derby win in history. ‘It was heartbreaking to see a Rangers team lose so easily. ‘Don’t make excuses. I’ve heard the boy Ian Black making plenty about the referee bottling it and not sending Brown off. He got intimidated, bullied and his backside kicked. It’s as simple as that. ‘Then I see someone else (Fraser Aird) saying they wanted to play Celtic in the Scottish Cup because they wanted another crack at them. ‘He should have been worrying about beating Raith Rovers first. ‘There are absolutely no excuses for what they’ve been turning in on the park.’ There is, however, boundless sympathy for Kenny McDowall. A team-mate of Ferguson’s when St Mirren won the 1987 Scottish Cup, the caretaker manager presently looks like he’d rather be working in Siberian salt mines. ‘The fact Kenny is working his notice tells you a story about him,’ Ferguson says. ‘He has basically had enough and hasn’t been able to do what he wants. ‘I’m reading in the papers that this guy Derek Llambias told Kenny to play these (Newcastle) players and then Llambias comes out and says he never. He’s basically calling Kenny McDowall a liar. Ferguson (left) on the ball during a match between Rangers and Celtic at Parkhead in 1989 . ‘I know who I believe. I’ve known Kenny for a number of years and he doesn’t shirk out of decisions or anything he’s been told to do. ‘If he doesn’t agree with something, he’ll tell you. But these guys are putting that much pressure on him. ‘It’s a shame he’s landed the job in these circumstances. It’s the same with Ally McCoist. ‘The club is in such a sad, stricken way. I don’t think any other manager has had to put up with what these guys have had to and I really feel for them.’ McCoist, like Ferguson, is now watching matters unfold from afar. Does the latter believe the Ibrox icon — and the club at large — missed a trick three years ago by not flooding the first team with youth? ‘I don’t think it was a missed opportunity,’ he insists. ‘There are still kids coming through but are they ready to play for Rangers? ‘Do they understand what it means to play for that club and the pressures that brings? ‘Some people handle pressure differently. Not everyone can handle it. Some just get on with it. ‘The Premiership next season is going to be a really tough gig for those kids.’ That is, of course, assuming Rangers get there.","Ian Ferguson is saddened by the current state of the Ibrox club .

"Floating around the globe, drifting from country to country, never staying in one place long enough to get bored … . If you like travelling, life on the Freedom Ship, the world’s first floating city, sounds perfect. There’s only a couple of hitches – it’s not built yet, and it’s going to look an awful lot like a multi-storey carpark when it is. Scroll down for video . Designed by the Florida-based Freedom Ship International, the floating city, concept pictured, is set to cost $10 billion and weigh 2.7 million tonnes - making it too large to ever dock. The ship would spend the whole time at sea, circling the globe once every two years, powered by solar and wave energy . Width: 750ft . Length: 4,500ft . Height: 350ft . Weight: 2.7 million tones . Capacity: 50,000 permanent residents with room for an extra 30,000 daily visitors, 20,000 crew and 10,000 overnight guests. Cost: $10 billion . Buildings: Accommodation, schools, hospitals, businesses, parks, promenades, an art gallery, a shopping centre, casino and airport . Its designers have released computer-generated photographs of what they hope the mile-long vessel will look like. It . would have enough room for 50,000 permanent residents within its 25 . storeys and boasts schools, hospitals, art galleries, shops, parks, an . aquarium and a casino. It would even have its own airport on the roof, . with a runway serving small private and commercial aircraft carrying up . to  40 passengers each. Roger . M Gooch, director and vice-president of Florida-based firm Freedom Ship . International, said: ‘The Freedom Ship will be the largest vessel ever . built, and the first ever floating city.’ His . company is trying to raise the estimated £6billion needed to turn the . dream, which has been several years in the planning, into an ocean-going . reality. ‘This will be a . very heavily capitalised project and the global economy in the last few . years hasn’t been too inviting for unproven progressive projects like . ours,’ he added. ‘[But] in . the last six months we’ve been getting more interest in the project and . we are hopeful we will raise the $1billion (£600million) to begin . construction.’ The ship would spend 70 per cent of its time anchored off . major cities and the rest sailing between countries. Powered . by solar panels and wave energy, the city would navigate from the east . coast of the US across the Atlantic to Europe and into the . Mediterranean. It would loop . back and sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the tip of Africa and . across to Australia. Heading into East Asia, it would steer across the . Pacific before spending the end of the year on the west coast of North . America. It would chase the summer sun into South America. If . completed, the city will be 750ft at the beam, 350ft high and 4,500ft . in length – four times longer than the Queen Mary II cruise . ship which measures 1,132ft. Visitors and residents would be able to leave the ship, either by plane or by boat thanks to a dock at the rear, concept pictured, to visit cities and countries where the ship will also pick up supplies as and when needed . The Freedom Ship, concept pictured, is a mile long, 25 storeys high and features schools, hospitals, businesses, parks, promenades, an art gallery, a shopping centre, casino and airport on the roof . The planned route, pictured, would take the ship from the east coast of the U.S across the Atlantic into Europe, passing Italy before looping back and sailing around Africa and across to Australia. It would then travel into Asia before spending the end of the year on the west coast of the U.S and South America . In addition to 50,000 permanent residents, the Freedom Ship would also have room for an extra 30,000 daily visitors, 20,000 crew and 10,000 overnight guests . The airport, on the ship's top deck, pictured, would serve private and small commercial aircraft carrying up to 40 passengers each. It could also be used to fly supplies to the ship. Aircraft could land and takeoff even when the ship is moving . This drawing shows a cross section of the ship. If built, the whole vessel would be 750ft wide, 350ft tall and 4,500 ft long. This would make it four times longer than the Queen Mary II cruise ship . The vessel, concept pictured, is just an idea at the moment until the Florida-based designers can raise at least $1 billion to start construction. The company said following a hiatus, and a drop in the global economy, it has started receiving interest in the ship again and hopes to raise this funding soon .","The Freedom Ship is 25 storeys high and would feature a casino, an art gallery, a park and a shopping centre .
The concept, designed by a Florida-based company would cost $10billion if was commissioned to be built .

"Australians living in Britain are heading home where employment opportunities are at an all-time high. Known as the ‘boomerang effect,’ research has shown that Australian and New Zealand expats are sick of the miserable job market in the UK where unemployment was recently at a 17-year peak. The research, done by jobs website Track Me Back, found that the positive outlook at home is enticing expats to return. Dismal job market: Sick of the job queues and unemployment in the UK, many Australian and New Zealand expats are heading home where jobs are a plenty . Caroline Rafferty, the general manager of the website said: ‘People returning home have usually worked in multiple cities globally and are now returning to work in Australia because there are better job opportunities and the economic outlook is more positive. ‘Many of our expats left home 10 years ago with a backpack, thinking they'd be gone for six months. Plenty of jobs at home: There are better opportunities at home with Australia's economy growing 'remarkably', boosted by the mining and construction industries . ‘Now they're returning with a spouse and a family, and they're looking to settle at home for the long-term.’ Immigration figures from the Home Office showed that the number of Australians coming to the UK for employed had dropped by 35 per cent over the last three years.

Australia has been recognised as one of . the fastest growing economies in the world and in July the country . celebrated 21 years without recession, the longest period of time any . country had gone without recession. In stark contrast to the UK, which has a GDP growth rate of -0.8 per cent, Australia is enjoying a growth rate of 4.3 per cent. Chris Richardson, director of Deloitte Access Economics said: ‘As far as the statistics can tell us that is a record for any nation at any time.’ He said Australia’s economic growth is ‘remarkable’ and predicts its growth, driven largely by mining and construction, will continue. As a result there is currently an industry-wide, high demand for skilled workers to work in Australia, making it a very attractive destination for expats who have struggled in the flailing UK job market. According to the latest Manpower Employment Outlook survey for this year, Australia is in desperate need for more skilled workers, with more than half of 2,200 local employers surveyed in Australia having great difficulty in filling critical jobs.","Australian and New Zealand expats are sick of the dismal job market in the UK .

"President Barack Obama invited Billy Joel for a cigarette when he visited the White House last year, according to the Washington rumor mill. Despite having publicly announced he was quitting in 2007, both Obama and the iconic American singer allegedly dipped back into old habits for a smoke on the North Portico after an awards ceremony last year. The reported indulgence came after a 2013 awards ceremony, where the President saw Joel given Kennedy Center Honors for his contribution to American culture. Scroll down for video . Awards ceremony:  Billy Joel, left having just received Kennedy Center Honors, was invited outside for a smoke by President Obama, right, after the awards ceremony in December 2013 . Awards: Joel is recorded as visiting the White House in 2013 for the ceremony. He recalled the occasion last week in a meeting with Republican House Majority Leader John Boehner . According to political newspaper The Hill, Joel revealed the sly offer last week after winning another music award in the nation's capital. He remembered the offer after receiving a similar one from House of Representatives speaker John Boehner, who presented him with a pack of cigarettes in his office. He declined that offer, according to the report, but revealed that he was won over when the President made his approach. Round two? Boehner, who uploaded a photograph of himself meeting Joel last week, also offered a cigarette to the singer, who refused this time . Every now and again: Obama, pictured smoking in Kenya years ago, says he still succumbs to an occasional cigarette . Recalling the event, Joel reportedly said: 'I was at the White House recently, and President Obama did the same thing. He said,""‘I’m going out on the North Portico to have a smoke. Do you want to come with me?"" Despite his usual abstinence, Joel indicated that this time he said yes. White House records show that Joel was mostly recently a visitor last December, when the Kennedy Center Honors awards took place. Although Obama publicly pledged to stop smoking in 2007, he has since admitted that the occasional lapse is not unheard of. The White House did not comment, while Billy Joel denied the story, telling MailOnline: 'I met John Boehner in his office and he asked me if I wanted to have a cigarette with him. I told him I quit. That was it. 'The Obama part of the story is completely untrue. Nothing like that that ever happened. I think their 'spy' had a few too many cocktails at that bar.'","Obama reportedly made the offer after Joel won Kennedy Center Honors .

"A new reality series will send one winning celebrity contestant to the stars - literally. Milky Way Mission will follow ten stars through astronaut bootcamp, with the winner getting the chance to be a passenger in a real space launch. And incredibly its not the only reality series planning to offer a winner a chance to go into orbit, with the producer behind The Voice and Survivor pitching his own unscripted series. Out of this world: A scale model of the Space Expedition Corporations spaceship, which is set to launch in 2014 and will carry the winner of a reality television series planned by Sony Pictures Television . Sony's TV division is set to announce its Milky Way Mission collaboration with the Netherlands-based Space Expedition Corporation (SXC) at this year's MIPCOM industry event, Deadline reports. SXC is one of several private firms which, like Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, hopes to offer civilian trips to space by next year. Created by Tuvalu Media and Simpel Media, Milky Way Mission will follow 10 celebrities as they undergo rigorous and intensive training to prepare them for their space adventure. In a format reminiscent of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, the contestants will face a series of extreme mental and physical challenges as they battle to win the grand prize. They will be in interesting company, for it emerged last month that among the well-heeled customers hoping to board SXC's first flight are Boomtown Rats singer Bob Geldof, dance music DJ Armin Van Buuren and Victoria's Secret model Doutzen Kroes. Flights start at $100,000, with up to 100 people set to take part in the project in its inauguration next year. Dutch television channel Nederland 1 has already reportedly commissioned eight hour-long episodes of the linked reality show. SpaceShipTwo: SXC's mission is in competition with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which has signed up a deal to with another television producer for a rival fly on the wall series that doesn't feature celebrities . Wayne Garvie, chief creative officer of international production at Sony Pictures Television, told Deadline: 'For years people have dreamt about the possibility of a show in space. 'SPT is now poised to make that dream real.' But it does not have the luxury of an open playing field. Mark Burnett, the creative visionary behind The Voice, is also producing his own series which will send one lucky winner into orbit. That programme, produced in collaboration with Virgin Galactic, will secure a ticket for a reportedly non-celebrity contestant for a seat aboard Sir Richard's SpaceShipTwo.","Sony's TV arm teamed up with Dutch firm Space Expedition Corporation .

"The terrifying tide of violent protests sweeping the Islamic world over an anti-Muslim film hit London yesterday. Elsewhere British diplomats were in fear for their lives, with staff at the embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, locking themselves in as 5,000 angry demonstrators raged and lit fires in an attack on the German embassy next door. In London, 150 protesters marched on the US embassy chanting ‘burn burn USA’ as the American flag went up in flames, soon joined by the Israeli flag. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wave of hate: Protestors burn the American flag outside the country's embassy in London yesterday . Anger: The demonstrators shouted 'burn burn USA' as the American flag went up in flames, in response to a recent movie which portrayed the prophet Muhammad as a womanizer and child abuser . There was a call for sharia law to be imposed over Britain. Police made two arrests. Among the rabble-rousers  was notorious demagogue Anjem Choudary, who has led a number of Islamist groups that were subsequently banned. Firebrand: Choudary is the former UK leader of the al-Muhajiroun and Islam4UK organisation  - both of which have been outlawed under the Terrorism Act . It came as riots and demonstrations spread halfway around the globe, from Morocco in the west to Bangladesh in the east. American embassies and symbols were the primary targets for fury. The wave of hate has been sparked by an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, which was produced in America and has been criticised for ridiculing Islam and depicting the Prophet Mohammed as a fraud, a womaniser and a madman. The film was apparently produced by a Coptic Christian living in California, using funds raised by radical American evangelicals and Egyptian Coptic Christians. Since clips were shown on Arab television it has provoked ever-growing outrage, including the murder in Libya on Tuesday of the US ambassador. But Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made clear that ‘the United States government had absolutely nothing to do’ with the video. British diplomats were dragged into the protests after demonstrators stormed the German embassy next door in the Sudanese capital, burning a car and rubbish bins. The German embassy is believed to have attracted particular ire because Sudan’s foreign ministry had criticised the country for allowing a protest last month by right-wing activists carrying caricatures of the Prophet. There were no reports of British casualties in Khartoum. In violence elsewhere, the number of dead . and wounded grew. In the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli police began . shooting, killing one man, after a mob set fire to a Kentucky Fried . Chicken franchise and an American restaurant. Another 25 were wounded in . the chaos. Fury: Protesters on the road leading to the US embassy near Tahrir Square in Cairo . Too young: A boy holds a toy gun during a protest about a film ridiculing Islam's Prophet Muhammad in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain el-Hilweh near Sidon, Lebanon, . Rage of the mob: Muslims burn an American flag in Dhaka, Bangladesh as they shout slogans during a protest in front of National Press Club . And there was anxiety for the safety of Pope Benedict, who had arrived in the Lebanese capital Beirut yesterday for a three-day visit. In Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, 2,000 protesters set off for the US embassy, only to be stopped short by national security forces firing live rounds, killing one man and leaving 15 injured. In the Tunisian capital Tunis, several thousand demonstrators threw stones at the US embassy and set fire to cars, before being fought off with tear gas and gunfire. Three were reportedly killed. Hate preacher: The former solicitor, holding microphone, joined rallied around 150 hard-line Islamists in a march to the mission in Grosvenor Square this afternoon . In Cairo, Egypt, the mob was kept clear of the local American mission by riot police, instead protesting in Tahrir Square. The Muslim half of Jerusalem witnessed a mob of 400 marching towards the US consulate hurling bottles, but they were repelled by police. In Damascus, Syria, a 200-strong crowd demonstrated outside the US embassy – although it was abandoned in February because of the country’s bloody civil war. In Tehran, Iran, in Baghdad, Iraq, in Jalalabad in Afghanistan, in Istanbul in Turkey, in Bangladesh, in cities across Pakistan, and in Bahrain, protesting crowds limited their anger to chanting and burning US and Israeli flags.","Two people arrested at American embassy .

"One third of staff said they had witnessed medical blunders and one quarter have been bullied . Nearly 40 per cent of doctors would not recommend their own hospital to friends or family, startling new figures reveal. A further one in three do not believe NHS managers act on the concerns of patients. The Department of Health’s own survey also found that a third of NHS staff had witnessed medical blunders or near misses at least once in the last month. The North Cumbria University Hospitals . Trust, which runs Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle and the West . Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven, was the worst ranked of all the . trusts surveyed. Just 35 per cent of staff would recommend treatment to . their friends of family. The trust is among several being investigated for high death rates by Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of the NHS. Croydon Health Services, Mid Yorkshire Hospitals and Weston Area Health were also among the poor performers. And . Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, which was yesterday facing administration . by regulators, also continues to perform poorly, according to the . survey. Only 59 per cent of staff said they would recommend treatment to family and friends. The poll also revealed that nearly a quarter of workers had been harassed or bullied by other colleagues over the past 12 months. Just over 101,000 doctors, nurses, paramedics, and administrative staff took part in the annual survey. Ministers said the overall findings were broadly similar to this time last year although insisted there were some improvements. They also revealed that 17 per cent of staff did not think patient care was their manager’s top priority. A total of 38 per cent said they had suffered work-relayed stress in the last 12 months while 15 per cent had been bullied by patients or  the relatives of patients.

Less than 40 per cent of those who . work at the two trusts, both of which have relatively high death rates, . would recommend the treatment available, compared with more than 90 per . cent of staff at the top-rated hospitals. Health minister Dr Daniel Poulter said survey showed staff motivation and job satisfaction were improving . In the survey, 203,000 NHS staff were asked to respond to the . statement: ‘If a friend or relative needed treatment, I would be happy . with the standard of care provided by this organisation.’ They had to say whether they strongly agreed, strongly disagreed, agreed, disagreed or had no view.

"Nightmare: A senior aide to Ed Miliband (seated) described complained about Ed Balls' failure to stay on message . Labour leader Ed Miliband was today forced to deny thinking his shadow chancellor Ed Balls is a 'nightmare' to work with. Leaked emails sent reveal how the pair are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival. But Mr Miliband insisted he was ‘proud’ to have Mr Balls by his side as he sought to quell rumours of a damaging rift. In the emails Mr Miliband's adviser Torsten Bell describes Mr Balls's response to recent optimistic growth, jobs and inflation forecasts from the Bank of England as a ‘nightmare’. Today Mr Miliband tried to play down the idea of a rift, despite the damning criticism from one of his closest aides. ‘I think it's fair to say that people send silly emails in offices and this was one of them,’ Mr Miliband told ITV’s Daybreak. ‘Ed and I are working really well together. I'm really proud to have him as the shadow chancellor alongside me. ‘He's somebody who I think has been right in this criticism of the Government's economic policy and he's also leading the way on this cost of living crisis that we've been talking about.’ The row threatened to overshadow a major speech by Mr Miliband today on cutting the costs of childcare. Labour have struggled to find a coherent message in response to the growing economic recovery.

Mr Balls went on to complain about the ‘cost-of-living crisis’, called for a ‘recovery that’s built to last’ and an ‘economy that works for working people’. Forwarding the email to others in the Labour party, Mr Miliban;ds top economic adviser Torsten Bell said it was an ‘an example of why we’re having problems on EB (EdBalls) messaging’. He signed off with his own damning, one-word assessment of Mr Balls: ‘Nightmare’. The Tories seized on the revelations as proof Mr Miliband was ‘too weak’ to sack Mr Balls while other Labour frontbenchers were forced to deny the party leadership was split. Upbeat: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney declared last week that the economic recovery had taken hold, leaving Labour floundering in response . Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘With Labour's two most senior figures at each other's throats, they cannot be trusted to run the economy. ‘Miliband never wanted Balls in the post, but if he's too weak to sack his “nightmare” shadow chancellor, then he is too weak to cut the deficit, too weak to fix the welfare system and too weak to stand up for ordinary hard-working people. ‘Once again we're seeing in-fighting between a Labour leader and his shadow chancellor. It really is the same old Labour.’ But shadow health secretary Andy Burnham insisted that the Labour Party and its front bench was more united than it has been in 20 years. He accused the media of ‘scraping the barrel’ over the emails.","Emails sent last week reveal the Miliband's team think Balls is a 'nightmare'

"Graeme Swann is at the centre of Kevin Pietersen's allegations surrounding a culture of bullying and intimidation in the England dressing room. The former spinner is said to have berated youngsters for dropping catches and allowing batsman to get off the mark, demanding apologies. Swann retorted on Monday that the autobiography is a 'work of fiction.' And, talking to BBC Radio 5Live, Pietersen says that while his bullying claims are serious - he does contextualise them in a sporting arena and does not want to compare it to everyday abuse often felt in schools and at work. Kevin Pietersen wants a return to the England Test team after being dumped earlier this year . Pietersen after he left the BBC's Media City hub in Manchester on Tuesday morning . 'It happened and I wouldn't have written this book if I didn't think it had happened. I know that everything that's in this book, I can stand by 100 per cent. 'Swann is at the centre of this.' Asked for an example of the stress some England players incur, Pietersen went straight to the trouble faced by Jonathan Trott. 'Jonathan Trott lost it in Bangladesh, he started screaming at Swann and Broad because they kept going on him,' he said. 'We're supposed to be in an environment where we are able to enjoy ourselves, not be scared to take a catch or field a ball. 'I put bullying into the perspective of the England dressing room, as to how certain individuals made others feel in the dressing room.' Meanwhile, Pietersen has reaffirmed his desire to play for England again and maintains he has good relationship with 'everybody' in the dressing room. The 34-year-old was unceremoniously dumped by the ECB after a humiliating Ashes whitewash last winter. While Pietersen believes he was held up as a scapegoat in the immediate aftermath, the noises he made when talking to the BBC's Today Show on Radio 4 indicated a return could well be on the cards. Pietersen was sacked by England after the dismal Ashes defeat Down Under last winter . The South African-born batsman – who captained England for three Tests in 2009 – says he has no problem with Alastair Cook. And, interestingly, Pietersen claimed he wanted to continue playing in the middle order for Peter Moores when he resigned as skipper. Although he wants a Test match return, he barely played any four-day cricket for Surrey this summer. 'I had difficulties when I was captain. It wasn't him or me,' Pietersen said. 'I said to the ECB to let me go and bat. I couldn't tolerate captaining with Moores. The relationship with Pietersen and then head coach Andy Flower (right) had hit an all-time low . 'I'd like to be batting there with guys and helping them with their games.' Pietersen also insinuated that the current captain Cook was hung out to dry after decision taken over his head this year – including the removal of mentor Graham Gooch. 'I've got a great relationship with everybody in that team, including Cooky. They said it was his decision to get rid of Gooch… to get rid of me.'

Prince Philip, pictured the week before his operation at a Buckingham Palace garden party, spent his 92nd birthday in hospital . In a short statement the Palace said: . 'His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh is progressing according to . plans at this early stage. He is comfortable and in good spirits. 'He will remain in hospital for up to . two weeks, and it is expected he will then be taking a period of . convalescence of approximately two months.' The Palace confirmed the Prince is due to resume public engagements in the autumn. The Queen left at about 7.30pm after a half an hour visit. Prince Edward was the first member of the Royal Family to visit the Duke and said he was doing 'well' after his visit. His visit lasted 20 minutes and as he left he was asked by the waiting press how his father was and replied: 'Well, thank you'. The Duke has already received the . good wishes of the Prime Minister on his birthday and gun salutes have . been fired across the UK to mark the milestone. David Cameron took to Twitter to send . a birthday message to Philip: 'Wishing the Duke of Edinburgh a very . happy 92nd birthday as he recovers in hospital today.' All's well! Prince Edward waves to onlookers as he leaves the London Clinic after visiting his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, to wish him a happy 92nd birthday while he recuperates from an abdominal operation .

Welcome party: A member of staff greeted the Earl as he stepped from the vehicle and she curtseyed to the royal before walking into the building with him . Prince Edward arrived at the central London hospital in a Land Rover Discovery shortly after 3.30pm. A member of staff greeted the Earl as he stepped from the vehicle and . she curtseyed to the royal before walking into the building with him. The . police presence around the hospital increased ahead of Edward's arrival . and broadcasters and photographers sprung into action to capture the . moment. Following the Duke's operation on . Friday, Buckingham Palace said he was 'progressing satisfactorily' and . was 'comfortable', but has not released any further updates. Edward's visit indicates the Duke is well enough to see callers but he did not stay long, leaving after 20 minutes. Prince Philip had been too tired to accept visits but the Queen's arrival is a good sign of his recovery. Prince Charles and . Camilla were at Birkhall, their private residence at Balmoral. Bringing cheer: A man delivers flowers and birthday balloons to the London Clinic, where the Duke of Edinburgh is recuperating following an operation on his abdomen . 'Doing well': The Duke was admitted to the London Clinic for the pre-arranged operation on Thursday evening, following a garden party at the Palace that day . Gun salutes were fired today to mark his birthday. The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun royal salute at noon to mark Philip’s birthday. The . Palace has not revealed what prompted the exploratory surgery but . sources said doctors ‘picked something up’ during a routine health . check. The Duke was then admitted to the London . Clinic ahead of Friday's pre-arranged operation on Thursday night, following a garden . party at the Palace that day.

The Duke is likely to remain in hospital for up to two weeks in total . while he recovers. Royal-watchers said it was not unusual . for members of the Royal Family not to visit the duke in hospital, . because he disliked ‘fuss’. The duke’s latest admission is the fourth time in 18 months that he has needed hospital treatment. In . 2008 he was admitted for four days with a chest infection but refused . to receive any well-wishers, instead catching up on his paperwork. His . eldest grandson Peter Phillips said last week that the family was kept . informed but added: ‘He’s one of those people who wouldn’t want you to . stop just because he’s gone into hospital.’ The Queen has continued with her royal engagements and visited the BBC Broadcasting House on Friday . Last August he was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to be treated for a recurrence of a bladder infection while staying with the Queen at Balmoral. He was in hospital for six days and was not visited by any members of the Royal Family, following doctors’ orders for the elderly Duke to rest. Two months earlier he spent five days convalescing at London’s Edward VII hospital after being taken ill following the Diamond Jubilee pageant along the River Thames. And in 2011 he spent Christmas in hospital after he was rushed to Papworth Hospital in Cambridge with chest pains on December 23.

"A boarding school education, gifts at Christmas and birthdays …  Charlotte Colquhoun may have been illegitimate, but her baronet father ensured she enjoyed at least some of the privileges of an aristocratic background. Now the eldest child of Sir Malcolm Colquhoun is quite literally trading on her heritage – by selling herself for sex. Miss Colquhoun, 37, alludes to her blue blood on explicit websites where she advertises herself as a £140-an-hour ‘escort’ under the name Charlie Foxtrot – claiming her public school education makes her even more desirable. And the mother-of two has posted photographs of her Old Etonian father, her titled grandfather, the family crest – even her birth certificate – on her Facebook page, alongside intimate photographs of herself semi-naked. Confronted about her work, Miss Colquhoun told the Daily Mail: 'I’m sure my father would have a fit if he found out.' Father: Charlotte is the daughter of Sir Malcolm Colquhoun, who owns a 40,000 acre estate and two public schools . Sir Malcom, 65, who owns two private schools in London and a 40,000-acre country estate, fathered Miss Colquhoun when he was 28, after a fling with interior designer Susan Armstrong. He went on to marry twice – first to an American in 1978, while his current wife Katharine is Australian – but kept in touch with his first child and funded her schooling, even after producing an heir, Patrick, now 32. Only more recently did they became estranged after she went through a series of crises. Miss Colquhoun said: ‘I had a very good relationship with my father when I was younger, but through one thing and another I ended up having children very young and I got myself into quite a lot of trouble and a few messes. 'But eventually I managed to turn my . life around and I wanted to wipe the slate clean and start afresh with . him. I just want to have a normal father-daughter relationship with him . and to be included in family life.' Speaking . at his London home last night, Sir Malcolm told our reporter: ‘She is a . sad individual. She has a lot of problems and she only has herself to . blame.’ Miss Colquhoun, who . entertains paying customers at her cottage home in the sleepy village . of Eardisley in Herefordshire, bills herself as an ‘English rose’ courtesan, claiming to offer the ‘ultimate girlfriend experience’. Palatial: Pictured is Rossdhu House, the family seat on the banks of Loch Lomond, Scotland . She has posed for a string of naked and topless shots on escort websites. In one more modest image she stares seductively into the distance, posing in a gold and silver mask and lacy black lingerie. Miss Colquhoun says men can visit her for sex for £90 for half-an-hour, and says she will visit hotels for four-hour sessions at £500. She also says she will have group sex with men and women, and will agree to be filmed having sex. Keen to capitalise: Charlotte proudly displays . her impressive lineage on her Facebook page to prove that she is the . eldest daughter of Sir Malcolm Colquhoun and right, pictured at home in . Herefordshire . In her profile blurb she boasts: ‘You will impressed by my professionalism, attractiveness, intoxicating personality and unique seductive sexiness, having been well educated at boarding school to set me up in the art of intelligent conversation for any occasion.’ She also reveals she lost her virginity in a barn aged 16, and refers to ‘making love on a yacht’. Miss Colquhoun added: ‘I have some very nice clients, they’re respectable working men and I’m just providing a service like anybody else. Why not make money from it? 'A very cheap way to earn a living': Friends say she should stop selling herself. Pictured, 'Charlie's' price list as advertised on the website . ‘I’m very, very good at what I do. I make a lot of money, I support my way of life and I have dogs and race horses.’ Sir Malcolm, whose baronetcy dates from 1786, inherited the title from his father in 2008. His family seat is the stunning Rossdhu House on the banks of Loch Lomond in Scotland, currently the home of the exclusive Loch Lomond Golf Club which leases the land from the estate. The Luss Estate – which includes villages and holiday parks – attracts millions of tourists every year. Deceptive: The picturesque cottage (black door) where Miss Colquhoun meets the clients she describes as  'respectable working men' for sex . Proud: Miss Colquhoun uses her Facebook account to display pictures of her illustrious family tree. Pictured, her grandmother Lady Kathleen Colquhoun . Sir Malcolm also owns the £16,000-a-year Broomwood Hall and Northcote Lodge schools in South London. In 1975 he hit the headlines when he and girlfriend Miss Armstrong, then 25, were arrested in the first class cabin of a Pan Am jet en route from Paris to Australia, by detectives investigating a £10million stolen plane ticket scam. He was later charged with receiving stolen plane tickets worth £4,000, but cleared of any crime. Of his errant daughter, Sir Malcolm said: ‘I feel very sorry for this woman. She clearly has a number of problems, all of which are of her own making.’ A close friend of Miss Colquhoun said last night: ‘There are a lot of people who care about her and she must stop this. It’s a very cheap way to earn a living and unbecoming of someone with her ancestry.’ The Colquhoun family crest features the French words: 'Si je puis' which translates to 'if I can.' The . name of Colquhoun is taken from an area of land around Kilpatrick near . Loch Lomond which was granted to Humphrey of Kilpatrick by Malcolm, by . the Earl of Lennox, in the 13th century. It is thought that it was his grandson Ingram who decided to change his title to Ingram of Colquhoun. Colquhoun family crest: The family motto 'Si je puis', French for  'If I can'. Miss Colquhoun says on Facebook she is proud of her family's history, which can be traced back almost 1,000 years . The name and its derivations are now in . use all over the world and include Cowan, Kirkpatrick, Kilpatrick, . Ingram, McLintockm, Calhoon and Cahoon. In . around 1368 Robert the 5th of Colquhoun married a woman known only as . the 'fair maid of Luss', the daughter of the 6th Laird of Luss. As she was the heir this had the effect of uniting the estates from that point onwards. In 1603 the Colquhouns clashed with the MacGregors in the most dramatic event in their history at the battle of Glen Fruin. It . is believed that as many as 140 Colquhouns died in the bloody conflict . which saw them trapped by around 400 MacGregors who supposedly lost only . two members during the conflict. The . Clan's first home was built around the 16th century on the west bank of . Loch Lomond and was a four story defensive fort was visited by Mary . Queen of Scots and called Rossdhu Castle. In . the later half of the 18th century Sir James the 23rd of Colquhoun . build a new house within sight Rossdhu Castle called Rossdhu House. His son James later added to it and the building became what is now Loch Lomond golf Club.","Charlotte Colquhoun, 37, is the daughter of Sir Malcolm Coquhoun - and an expensive escort .

"A passenger on a British Airways flight lost luggage worth over £2,000. Nora Low was flying from a two-week . business tip in Amsterdam to her brother’s birthday celebration in Lake . Tahoe, California. She was among thousands of British . Airways passengers flying out of London Heathrow who discovered that her luggage was missing thanks to a computer . glitch. Let down: Nora Low took to Twitter to vent her frustrations about British Airways losing her luggage . 'It completely ruined my vacation,' she said. 'I had about $4,000 (£2,000) worth of clothing in it.' 'Not . only did their customer service stop taking phone calls; their . voicemail filled up, and they weren’t allowing you to leave a message.' Like many frustrated travellers looking for answers, Ms Low took to Twitter. 'I . just started tweeting,' she said. 'That’s when I started to realise . that there were other people that were tweeting the same. And we formed a . little army and just kept retweeting.' British Airways only contacted Ms Low after she informed them news channel ABC had been in touch . On her Twitter page, Ms Low wrote: '@British_Airways I wish I could just be patient but I have medication in my luggage. You shouldn't have taken off.'

"Republicans criticise Homeland Security deportation review as 'backdoor amnesty' The federal government will suspend deportation proceedings against many illegal immigrants who do not pose a threat to national security or public safety, the White House has announced. Republicans have decried the reform as backdoor amnesty, while Democratic congressional leaders praising the move said it would ease the way for individuals who came to the United States illegally as children and have already spent years in the country to stay and work legally. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano detailed the changes, on behalf of President Barack Obama, in a letter to Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, a long-time sponsor of immigration reform. Reform: Under President Barack Obama, over 1.4million people in all have been removed from the country for immigration violations . 'Together with the Department of Justice (DOJ), we have initiated an interagency working group to execute a case-by-case review of all individuals currently in removal proceedings to ensure that they constitute our highest priorities,' wrote Ms Napolitano. New cases placed in removal proceedings will get similar treatment, she said. A joint Homeland Security/DOJ working group will develop specific criteria and a process for identifying low-priority removal cases that call for prosecutorial discretion. Homeland Security will begin reviewing all 300,000 backlogged deportation cases, according to Mr Durbin's office. 'Young people should not be punished for their parents' mistakes.' Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, chief sponsor of the DREAM Act . Attorneys for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will individually review every case scheduled for a hearing in the next few months. Identified cases will be closed 'except in extraordinary circumstances,' which will require approval to proceed. Individuals whose cases are closed will be eligible to apply for immigration benefits such as work authorization. Mr Durbin and others had written the President several letters this year on the Administration's enforcement policies. Mr Durbin, chief sponsor of the recently introduced 2011 Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, praised the Administration's move on Thursday in a statement which said if fully implemented, 'the new process should stop virtually all DREAM Act deportations.' Change: Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano detailed the changes, on behalf of President Obama, in a letter to Senator Dick Durbin on Thursday . Effort: Senator Dick Durbin, chief sponsor of the 2011 Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, praised the administration's move . The DREAM Act would pave a path to legal status and eventual citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children, lived in the country for at least five years, and completed two years of college or military service, among other requirements. 'The Obama Administration has made the . right decision in changing the way they handle deportations of DREAM Act . students,' Mr Durbin said. 'Every amnesty encourages more illegal immigration, costs taxpayers who pay for government benefits, and displaces American workers.' Texas Republican and Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Lamar Smith, criticises the DREAM Act. 'These students are the future doctors, lawyers, teachers and, maybe, Senators, who will make America stronger.' The new process announced on Thursday . will consider such 'positive factors' as student status as criteria for . identifying low priority cases. But Ms Napolitano's letter also said: . 'It will not provide categorical relief for any group. Thus, this . process will not alleviate the need for passage of the DREAM Act or for . larger reforms to our immigration laws.' Republicans have said that if passed the DREAM Act would effectively constitute amnesty and encourage illegal immigration, and criticised the idea that the administration should implement similar policies on its own. Disappointment: Undocumented college student Jorge Herrera, 18, protests in Los Angeles in December, 2010 after the Senate rejected the DREAM Act . Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican and Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said of the DREAM Act: 'Every amnesty encourages more illegal immigration, costs taxpayers who pay for government benefits, and displaces American workers.' This week Mr Obama reiterated his support for comprehensive immigration reform but pledged stricter enforcement of high-priority removal cases involving illegal immigrants with criminal records. In fiscal year 2010, a record year for total removals, ICE deported 79,000 more aliens who had been convicted of a crime than it did in FY2008, when Mr Obama took office. Under Mr Obama, over 1.4million people in all have been removed from the country for immigration violations.",Republicans criticise Homeland Security deportation review as 'backdoor amnesty'
"It does not take Kevin Pietersen long to get the heavy roller out in his latest book, which is not so much an autobiography but his version of the often troubled episodes that marked his final years in international cricket. You get the idea very early on, in the first few pages, as he recounts the meeting with Alastair Cook, Paul Downton and James Whitaker when he is informed that his England career is effectively over. ""The three wise men have decided that the disastrous Ashes tour was all my fault,"" he declares. It cannot, of course, be true that they believed it was all down to one man, and over the next three hundred pages we are invited to make our own minds up about whether he was treated fairly or not. Kevin Pietersen poses for pictures outside the BBC studios in Salford before appearing on breakfast TV . By the very end of KP: My Autobiography, he admits ‘there should have been more cricket in these pages’, and he would probably have helped his own cause if that were to be the case. The theme of persecution runs through it like letters through a stick of Blackpool rock, as does the often very personal criticism of coach Andy Flower. There is too much of both, but it also leaves you to conclude that Pietersen has been sinned against as well as sinning. The overall effect is to bestow a sense of melancholy as much as anything, for with a little more understanding of the human condition on both sides the most exciting England batsman of his generation might not be lost to the team, as he surely is now. There is something faintly tragic when he almost pleads in the final chapter ""I hope it might not truly be over"" with reference to England. There is admirable self-awareness, and the tacit admission that being a Twenty20 freelance can never replace being a fully-fledged international, when he says in the preceding paragraph: ""Any player who has been to the top mourns the excitement when it ends."" Pietersen is heavily critical of former England head coach Andy Flower (right) throughout the book . That helps make this book is a fascinating read, expertly and colourfully ghosted by journalist David Walsh, and it will have an appeal well beyond the boundaries of the cricket constituency. When the smoke clears from all the vitriol and insults, there is much to glean for any follower of any sport. For instance the truism that success often only hides divisions in a dressing room, and that it is not necessarily the product of harmony behind the scenes. This effect is always exaggerated in cricket, which shoehorns players together for longer periods than any other pursuit. You are also reminded that even glamorous and gifted superstars of sport are as needy and insecure as anyone else, often more so. They are traits which abound in Pietersen, although he is a complex man of many parts. I got to know him relatively well in the early part of his England career as we used to collaborate on a column for Sportsmail together. Many of the things I recognised at the start of his journey are still recognisable throughout this book: he is someone of immense drive and ambition, likeable in many ways, intelligent and good company, polite and with some strong values. He could also, sometimes unwittingly, be quite rude and selfish. Pietersen takes in the applause after his famous century in the 2005 Ashes Test at the Oval . You can understand him being upset by the attitude of what he terms the bowling clique of James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann, who it is quite possible to imagine being a fairly malevolent force as a collective, if not as individuals. The business of the spoof Twitter account directed at him clearly wounds him more deeply than anyone would imagine, and exposes his more vulnerable side. He also had to cope with what seems the general mistrust in our country, not just in cricket, of maverick exceptional talents. He could, unquestionably, have been handled better by the ECB and Andy Flower in particular. Yet his brutal analysis of Flower – you may have read by now his description that 95 per cent of the time the coach was ‘f***ing horrendous’ – simply does not stand up to scrutiny. Flower’s methods could not have been so crude as clearly they worked for most of the time with outstanding results, and any fair-minded observer could hardly quarrel with what he and Andrew Strauss achieved. Pietersen’s treatment of the coach, with whom the whole IPL question was evidently a constant bone of contention, is unnecessarily vicious. Some of the ridicule heaped on Matt Prior is plain amusing, some of it surely unwarranted. His condescension towards Alastair Cook as a captain, who he almost describes as some sort of Sergeant Wilson figure from Dad’s Army, is a case of damning with the faintest praise, but may ring more true. Flower and Pietersen regularly clashed over the batsman's desire to play in the IPL . It is hard to disagree with Swann’s assessment on Monday that he has soft-pedalled on some figures in order not to jeopardise the possibility of a return one day. One example of how Pietersen has managed to alienate people through his career is a particularly gratuitous swipe at the undeserving Nottinghamshire batsman James Taylor, who he does not especially rate on account of his height. He refers to Taylor’s father being a jockey, and suggests the son might be more suited for that profession. But ultimately you cannot argue that Pietersen deserves his say, he has clearly been misunderstood to a degree and, to his credit, he does acknowledge that he has made plenty of mistakes. He is not as bad as some would portray him, but not as pure as he would portray himself. That is like so many autobiographies, but it would be wrong to paint this as any off-the-peg account of a sporting career. It is much better than that, and an essential read.","Kevin Pietersen's book, 'KP: My Autobiography' was released on Monday .
