"Cinnamoney Spiced Wine costs £60 a glass . It's the festive tipple that gets the nation feeling merry at Christmas, but you might sober right up if you had to pay £60 for a glass. That's the price of a new mulled wine on sale at Searcys bar in St Pancras station in London. Hailed as the world's most expensive, it costs £10 more  than last year's bankrupter - the £50 Mayfair Mulled Wine from Hush in west London.

These are added in along with the familiar spices that you would normally find in mulled wine for the made-to-order drink. Searcys' latest festive fancy has been specially developed by the bar's senior mixologists and renowned food and drink writer, Matthew Fort. Along with mulling spices such as cloves, bay leaves and cinnamon sticks, Cinnamoney Spiced Wine contains Lanson Pére et Fils Champagne, Muscat De Beaumes de Venise dessert wine, Blanche de Normandie Calvados and the cocktail's main ingredient, Chateau des Gravieres Bordeaux wine. Peter Alderin, general manager of Searcys at St Pancras International, said: 'Mulled wine is a staple of the festive period but this year we wanted to create something slightly different that brought together the finest ingredients from France and the UK. 'As with any good mulled wine, the base flavour is the full bodied and rich, Chateau des Gravieres Bordeaux wine that comes from Northern France. 'Lanson Pere et Fils Champagne - with its five different types of grapes and warm honey tones - and Blanche de Normandie cidre add a light and fresh tone while the Muscat dessert wine brings a touch of sweetness and the perfect finish.'

Liz Earle, creator of the award-winning Liz Earle Beauty Co., mother-of-five, organic farmer and founder of Liz Earle Wellbeing, writes about the health benefits of red wine and shares her favourite recipe for mulled wine: . 'The benefits of red wine have been widely publicised in recent years, with most scientists agreeing that, when drunk in moderation, it may help protect the heart, prevent blood clots and strokes, and even ward off certain cancers including colon and prostate. 'A glass of red wine contains high amounts of natural polyphenols or antioxidants which not only help our cells fight against free radical damage but also increase our levels of 'good' cholesterol. 'It also contains procyanidins which help reduce blood pressure and protect against hardening of the arteries. Studies have shown that red wine may boost brain power too, especially for older women, although the jury’s out as to whether this benefit comes solely from wine or includes other alcohol. 'Don’t forget, it’s only a glass or two that may keep the doctor away, not a whole bottle! 'If you’re in need of a little seasonal cheer, why not enjoy a glass of delicious mulled wine. Adding spices such as cinnamon, cloves and star anise also boosts our antioxidant levels. 'This is my personal favourite recipe which will be served to guests at an upcoming candlelit carol concert in aid of my charity, LiveTwice. A heart-healthy winter warmer.' Liz Earle writes about the health benefits of red wine and shares her favourite recipe for mulled wine . Ingredients: . Use the below as a guideline but feel free to add your own additional spices such as vanilla and cardamom. • 2 oranges, organic (or well-scrubbed) • Peel of 1 lemon (organic, un-waxed or well-scrubbed) • 100g caster sugar . • A generous pinch of freshly grated nutmeg . • 3 sticks cinnamon . • 6 cloves, plus extra for garnish . • 2 fresh bay leaves . • 2 bottles of fruity inexpensive red wine, preferably organic . • 500 ml water . • 5 star anise . Method: . Peel and juice one orange into a large saucepan along with the lemon peel, sugar and all the spices apart from the star anise. Add just enough water or a little wine to cover the sugar, then simmer gently until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to boil for a few minutes to infuse the spices until you have a sticky syrup. Then add the bottles of wine and star anise to the pan and heat gently until warm. Be careful not to let the mulled wine boil at this stage otherwise the alcohol will burn off, together with many of the healthy benefits of red wine! Ladle into glasses and decorate with a wedge of orange (studded with a few extra cloves if you wish). To make a less alcoholic version, simply add a little more orange juice and water. For a non-alcoholic version, replace the red wine with cranberry juice.

"Rafael Nadal has confirmed he will not participate in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London next month due to appendix surgery. The world No 3 revealed his decision after suffering defeat to 17-year-old Borna Coric in the quarter-finals of the Swiss Indoors on Friday. Nadal had pulled out of next week's Paris Masters earlier in the day and later announced that he was bringing his season to a close in order to undergo surgery on November 3. Rafael Nadal acknowledges the crowd as his season ends with defeat in the quarter-finals in Basle . Borna Coric, the 17-year-old Croatian wildcard, celebrates after sealing victory against world No 3 Nadal . He said: ‘It is the day to say goodbye for the season. I am not going to play in next week’s Paris Masters or in London. I am not competitive enough to do that. ‘It has been a very hard year for me mentally and physically too. ‘I tried to practise to try to get fit but it was not possible. It’s difficult to play and compete when you’re not able to practise weeks in a row. ‘I’m not a player who competes to try to be in quarter-finals. I try to win tournaments. I will be back at the start of 2015.’ Nadal had followed a course of antibiotics after being diagnosed with appendicitis ahead of the Shanghai Masters earlier this month. Nadal plays a forehand return as he attempts to fight back against Coric at the ATP Swiss Indoors . Coric chases down a ball before going on to complete a famous victory in Basle on Friday evening . The 28-year-old surprised some observers by competing in Basle this week and he struggled on court on Friday night, losing 6-2, 7-6 (4) to the Croatian teenage wildcard. Coric was just three points away from claiming a first-set bagel but Nadal reeled off two games in a row before Coric finally sealed the set. Nadal battled back in the second set and forced his young opponent to serve to stay in the set twice. Coric duly held his nerve and claimed victory on the first of two match points in the second set tiebreak as Nadal pushed a forehand wide. Nadal's withdrawal from the season-ending event is a boost for the qualification hopes of Andy Murray, who currently sits just inside the Race to London cut at No 8. The British No 1 still has much work to do, though, as he faces a semi-final against fellow contender David Ferrer at the Valencia Open on Saturday.

"You might call it the vengeful act of a bitter old woman, and for two centuries it has stood: an 18th-century spinster's demand for narrow pavements to prevent the irksome parading of young lovers arm in arm. The rule was put in place on the orders of Lady Jane Stanley, who in the late 18th century offered to pay £400 for new paved public footpaths throughout the Cheshire town of Knutsford. There was just one condition: they should be made so narrow that pedestrians had to walk in single file. But now, 220 years later, those narrow pavements will soon be no more as council chiefs put plans in place to pedestrianise the town's roads - effectively scrapping its narrow walkways.. Scroll down for videos . The only portrait of Lady Jane Stanley, who was the daughter of the 11th Earl of Derby, aged five . A couple walk hand-in-hand along the current narrow pavements, which were ordered by Lady Jane Stanley . It comes after a £15,000 study in to the effects of modernising pavements in the town after the narrow paths were ordered by the eccentric spinster who disapproved on public affection. Lady Jane became the inspiration for the main character in Elizabeth Gaskell's novel My Lady Ludlow and who was played by actress Francesa Annis in the adapted BBC drama, Cranford. Councillor Michael Jones, Conservative leader of Cheshire East Council, said: 'I am all in favour of retaining our fantastic heritage, but this is one of those occasions when we can improve on the legacy of the past. 'We want to create a space which will be enjoyed by the residents - whether they are walking arm in arm or not - while also attracting visitors and enabling businesses in the locality to thrive. 'The shops and businesses are a great asset to Cheshire East and the street merits and deserves enhancement works.' Just what Lady Jane, who was the daughter of the 11th Earl of Derby, would have thought of the scheme is impossible to say. She lived in Brook House in Knutsford until her death in 1803 when she was reputed to be in her 80s and was a benefactor to the town after paying £400 to have the pavements laid. In her book 'Knutsford: A history', author Joan Leach said: 'She did not approve of linking couples walking arm in arm, so stipulated that it should only be wide enough for one.' A group of men stand on King Street in Knutsford in 1861 where the narrow pavements were laid to stop people walking along arm-in-arm . The council kept the thin walkways for more than 220 years, but now they are planning to widen them . A history of the town records say that at least one countryman, who got in her way while she was out walking, received a firm tap from Lady Jane's gold-headed cane, accompanied with the words: 'Take that fellow!' But she often avoided confrontations on Knutsford's narrow pavements by taking to her sedan chair, which can still be seen in the town's heritage centre. The book continued: 'She paraded with her gold-knobbed cane which she used to reprimand those who impeded her progress. Her sedan chair makes an annual appearance at the May Day Festival.' In the book 'Mrs Gaskell: Haunts Homes and Stories' by Ellis Chadwick in 1910 it said: 'Lady Jane was beloved by her household, and admired by the whole neighbourhood; but she had very strict notions of propriety and of the courtesies of life, and would not have them infringed.' It is also said that Lady Jane, of whom there is only believed to be one portrait, also suggested as her own epitaph: 'A maid I lived and a maid I died; I never was asked and never denied.' Lady Jane Stanley was the daughter of the 11th Earl of Derby and was said to be an eccentric character, who remained single throughout her life. She was carried through the town in a sedan chair because in those days there were no footpaths and she complained the hard stone cobbles caused her discomfort. When she died she left a sum of money to provide a footpath, but because she disapproved of seeing young people walking arm-in-arm, she demanded that the footpath should be the width of a 'single flag'. That way it would only be wide enough for one person to walk along and would not encourage the common form of courting, which she frowned upon. As a result, the woman would occupy the pavement while the suitor had to either walk behind her or pick their way through the gutter. The sedan chair, used by Lady Jane Stanley, was built in 1769, left. It has since been used in the town's annual May Day celebrations, right is a young girl standing by the sedan chair in 1913 . One of the road's in the town, Love Lane, was renamed Stanley Road after funds from Lady Jane's pot were used to plant trees along the side of the heath. While this was going on, author-in-the-making, Elizabeth Gaskell was growing up in the town - and it later became the inspiration for her novel Cranford, published in 1851. Gaskell went on to write My Lady Ludlow, who she revealed was inspired by Lady Jane Stanley, which recounts the daily lives of the widowed Countess of Ludlow of Hanbury and the spinster Miss Galindo, whose father was a Baronet. The books were adapted by the BBC for a television series in 2007 and combines characters from both novels, starring Judi Dench and with Lady Jane played by actress Francesa Annis. Lady Jane's sedan chair, built in 1769, can still be seen at the town's heritage centre and is showcased every year in the Knutsford 'Royal' May Day celebrations. Some years ago it was urgently in need of restoration after parts of the frame had rotted, the fabric lining was in poor condition and the front window pane broken. It was relined with cotton chintz, woven to match the original pattern, and a piece of the original lining is preserved in the heritage centre. Elizabeth Gaskell wrote Cranford in 1849 and the story focuses mainly on the fictional Cheshire town's single and widowed middle class female inhabitants. Along with two other novellas My Lady Ludlow, and Mr Harrison's Confessions, it was developed into a BBC series Cranford in 2007 and also starred Dame Judy Dench as Matilda Jenkyns. Mrs Gaskell once wrote in a letter: 'The character of my Lady Ludlow at once suggests the Honourable Mrs Jamieson in Cranford, and it is interesting to know that they were both founded on the same original 'Lady Jane Stanley' who lived at Brook House, Knutsford. The street as it is now, is open to traffic and people are forced to walk along a tiny strip of paving stones . The plans for the road will mean that it will be completely pedestrianised and people can walk hand-in-hand . 'Lady Jane was beloved by her household, and admired by the whole neighbourhood; but she had very strict notions of propriety and of the courtesies of life, and would not have them infringed.' Cheshire East Council has drawn up a design concept to upgrade the street with wider pavements and higher quality materials. It says the changes are intended to transform King Street into a 'more vibrant public space and improve access for people whose mobility is impaired, while retaining vehicular access at all times and as much on-street parking as possible.' Andrew Malloy, chairman of the town centre working group in the Knutsford Town Plan said: 'After several years of hard work, and unparalleled engagement by the town plan, this is a real opportunity for Knutsford to get the high street it deserves - now is the time to get it right for everyone.' Knutsford might be best known for its service station but it has a history dating back until 1086 . It is perhaps best known for its motorway service station, but Knutsford has history that dates back as far as the beginning of the last millennium. Situated 14 miles from Manchester, the town was recorded in William the Conqueror's Domesday Book of 1086 as Cunetesford, after former King of England - King Canute. He is said to have forded the River Lily, which runs through the town and is believed to be the smallest river in Europe. The town celebrates an annual May Day celebration, which observes the custom of 'sanding the streets'. This is where the pavements are decorated with coloured sand and pictures. It is said to derive from tradition by King Canute, that while he was fording the river he threw sand from his shoes into the path of a wedding party - wishing the newlyweds as many children as the grains of sand at their feet. The town is said to be a reasonably residential affluent area in 'Cheshire's Golden Triangle',which include Hale Barns and Alderley Edge, with house prices ranging from £79,000 to £3,850,000. In 2005 Knutsford was named as the most expensive town to buy a house in Northern England, followed by nearby town Altrincham. And it's home to celebrities including comedian Craig Cash, actress Barbara Knox and singer Gary Barlow. It is also where the Tatton parliamentary constituency originated from, after it was named after Tatton Park, owned by the Egerton family.","Lady Jane Stanley offered to pay £400 for new pavements in hometown .

"Theresa May was yesterday accused of suppressing a critical report that found hundreds of foreign criminals are escaping deportation. John Vine, the independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, gave the report to the Home Secretary in the summer but it has only just been published. Mr Vine, who has exposed glaring gaps in the UK’s border controls, said he could ‘see no reason’ why she had not published it earlier. Scroll down for video . Theresa May has been accused of burying reports into holes in the UK's border controls by John Vine, the independent Chief Inspector of Borders, in order to limit their impact . He also claimed ministers were deliberately sitting on important reports to ‘reduce their impact.’ The latest report looked at a major new scheme known as Operation Nexus, which involves immigration officials working in police stations to run checks on suspects’ immigration status and criminal history. It concluded that despite significant improvements in some areas, many foreign offenders were still being released by police without checking they were allowed to be in the country. The scheme has had a ‘positive impact’ after it was introduced in London in October 2012, the report said. The number of immigration offenders deported from the capital has risen by 158 per cent from 418 in 2011-12 to 1,077 in 2013-14. But 336 of 717 foreign nationals detained by West Midlands Police – the other force in the scheme’s trial – were released before their immigration status was checked. The force also only saw a small rise in the number of foreign criminals that were removed – from 239 in 2012-13 to 274 last year. Mr Vine said he completed one report in the summer but it had only been published now. It concluded that many foreign offenders were being released without police checking if they were allowed  in the UK (file pic) And some suspects held by the Metropolitan Police were freed because staff shortages meant there were no immigration officers available to run the checks. Last week, it emerged that a Polish gang who attacked university professor Paul Kohler, 55, and his wife in their home in Wimbledon, south-west London, had convictions in their homeland for violent robbery. Other shortcomings revealed in the report included missed targets for foreigners leaving under ‘conditional cautions’, which are given for petty crimes and usually allow the suspect up to 16 weeks to leave Britain voluntarily rather than be prosecuted. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘Theresa May’s reputation for competence will suffer if she can’t ensure schemes like this that can deliver results are put into action properly.’ Mr Vine has been embroiled in an ongoing feud with the Home Office over the publication of reports, and last week sent a letter to the Commons’ Public Affairs Committee, which is investigating the immigration system, to condemn the delays. He also announced in the summer that he was resigning in ‘frustration’ at attempts by Mrs May to ‘manipulate’ his work.","Borders inspector John Vine says he gave critical report to May in summer .

"Tony Blair has taken another veiled swipe at Ed Miliband by criticising MPs who have never had a proper job. The former prime minister said the ‘gene pool’ of political leaders had suffered because too few candidates have ‘real-life experience’. He suggested that too many graduates went straight from university to a job as a political researcher, before then becoming an MP – a path that may sound familiar to Mr Miliband. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is worth around £10 million - and has given away the same to charity . The Blairs' £9m country pile 'South Pavilion' - once owned by Sir John Gielgud - in Buckinghamshire . The current Labour leader was elected to the Commons nine years ago, having done little after his philosophy, politics and economics degree at Oxford – apart from working in the Treasury as a special adviser. Writing in the New York Times, Mr Blair, who worked as a barrister before becoming an MP, also complained that Westminster fails to attract the best candidates because politicians are not paid enough. Recent estimates suggest his own fortune could be as large as £100million – although he claims to be worth less than £20million. Mr Blair also attacked leaders who over-react to online controversies – just two weeks after Mr Miliband sacked his shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, after she sneered at a white van owner’s flag-covered home on Twitter. The comments come at a difficult time for Mr Miliband, who is facing questions over his failure to take a commanding lead in the polls against a Government that has introduced significant spending cuts. Last week, Mr Blair cast doubt on whether he could win the next election, saying Labour needed a ‘strong’ leader and suggesting that Mr Miliband had thrown away the chance of a ‘substantial majority’ by dragging the party to the left. Mr Blair criticised politicians who had never had a real job - seen in Westminster as a swipe at Labour leader Ed Miliband. He also attacked political leaders pandering to controversies built up online . Mr Blair urged political leaders not to give in to political storms. It comes after online outrage forced Ed Miliband to sack Emily Thornberry (pictured) from the shadow cabinet . Two months earlier, Mr Blair was forced to deny claims he had privately told allies that Mr Miliband ‘cannot beat’ David Cameron, due to his failure to connect with voters. The Blair family property empire is thought to have grown to at least nine homes - and is worth more than £10million alone. Last year the family bought a six-bedroom, six-storey, Grade-II listed Georgian terrace home for their son Euan - costing an eye-watering £3.6 million. They later added an adjoining mews house to expand the property. The purchase came after their eldest son got married last year at the Blairs' £9 million Buckinghamshire estate. The sprawling South Pavilion in Wotton Underwood - close to the Prime Minister's country retreat Chequers - was once owned by Sir John Gielgud. The family also bought Greenville Cottage, next-door. Euan's London townhouse cost almost as much as Tony and Cherie's £3.65 million Connaught Square house, dubbed a ‘mini Number 10 Downing Street’. Their other children Nicky and Kathryn were also lucky enough to have been bought homes in London - costing £1.35 million and £975,000 respectively. The former leader is also believed to have bought two two flats in this Panoramic Luxury Apartment Block on Park Row, Bristol. Mr Blair, who did not refer to Mr Miliband by name in his latest comments, wrote: ‘At the very time when leadership is needed, the gene pool of political leaders has shrunk. 'How many leaders and, for that matter, followers in a parliament or congress have real-life experience in responsible positions outside of politics? ‘Today it is very common for a young person interested in politics to graduate from university, go to work for a politician as a researcher or political analyst, and then transition straight into an elected position.’ The former prime minister said of his time as a barrister: ‘I learned about business and about people in a way that was greatly beneficial when I later came to govern. ‘In particular, I learned the difference between academic political ideas and policies suited to “real world” application.’ He went on to claim: ‘On top of this – and only an ex-politician can say this – politicians are not really well-paid by the standards of those who are successful in the private sector.’ British MPs currently earn £67,060, while the Prime Minister is paid £142,500. However, Mr Blair said this pay structure ‘restricts the attractions of a political career, at exactly the time when we most need the gene pool of our politicians to be varied, vibrant and vigorous’. He added that leaders’ challenges were ‘magnified by social media’ such as Twitter and Facebook. ‘Waves of emotion used to build to tidal strength relatively slowly,’ he said. ‘They now reach tsunami force within days, even hours.’ He criticised those who bow to online pressure, saying that social media ‘is exciting and can effect real and positive change, but it is also the domain of the loudmouth’. He added: ‘Those who shout loudest don’t necessarily deserve to be heard most.’ Mr Blair had faced mounting criticism for providing advice to dictators like Kazakhstan’s president Nursultan Nazarbayev (right) and Egypt’s military ruler Abdel el-Sisi (left) Tony Blair was interviewed in the US magazine Vanity Fair, which said his office admitted his net worth was £10million .","Former PM's office say he's given away half his fortune since leaving office .

"This chilling CCTV footage shows a jilted lover stalking his ex-fiancée and her new boyfriend moments before slashing their throats because she had refused to marry him. Bharat Soma, 26, knifed 17-year-old Darshana Narotam and Prashant Govinde, 22, in broad daylight after Ms Narotam 'dishonoured him' by fleeing from their arranged marriage. Ms Narotam and Mr Govinde had left their homes in Wembley, London nine days earlier so the teenager did not have to go through with the forced marriage. But Soma managed to track the couple down in Leicester, where he carried out the so-called 'honour' attack in front of horrified shoppers on a Sunday afternoon. Scroll down for video . The footage shows Darshana Narotam, 17, her new boyfriend Prashant Govinde, 22 and another 15-year-old victim walking through Leicester, moments before they were attacked in an attempted so-called honour killing . Ms Narotam's jilted lover Bharat Soma is seen walking in the same spot as the victims less than a minute later, before carrying out a 'revenge' attack which involved slitting the victims' throats . Soma tracked down the couple after Ms Narotam fled from her home in Wembley to escape their arranged marriage . In the footage, Soma is seen following the victims along the busy street, just seconds after they have passed the same spot. Soma then slit Ms Narotam's throat while holding her from behind, before stabbing Mr Govinde through the neck with the same knife. He then repeatedly screamed 'my wife, my wife', as the weapon was prised from his hands by one of the victims. The defendant, from North Evington, Leicestershire, has now been jailed at Leicester Crown Court for 23 years after being found guilty of two charges of attempted murder. Soma was also convicted of unlawfully wounding a 15-year-old boy who was with the couple and eventually managed to disarm him. The teenager was left with a badly-cut arm. Sentencing, High Court Judge Mr Justice Saunders said: 'The attack was intended by Mr Soma to be a cold-blooded murder, committed to prevent Darshana from marrying anyone else. 'He grabbed hold of Darshana Narotam round the neck and while holding her from behind he slit her throat from one side to the other with a knife. 'He stabbed Prashant Govinde through the neck with the same knife, pushing the knife right through his neck from front to back.' The jury had heard Ms Narotam's family and Soma were originally from Dui, a small island off the west coast of India. They had moved to England in 2009. Soma, from North Evington, Leicestershire, has now been jailed for 23 years after being found guilty of two charges of attempted murder . In 2012, the two families agreed that Ms Narotam would marry Soma after she turned 18. But Ms Narotam did not want to go through with the marriage. Instead, she planned to marry Mr Govinde and left home with him on January 10. The defence counsel said that, after discovering she had fled, Soma was 'disturbed, troubled and depressed'. But he soon received a tip off about the couple's location from a family friend. He then 'acted on impulse' in carrying out the frenzied attack, the court was told. Prosecutors said Soma had tried to kill the pair because he considered they had 'dishonoured him'. But Soma had said he carried out the attack because his 'mind wasn't working' and he was a victim of black magic. During the eight-week trial the jury watched footage from body cameras worn by the officers which captured the aftermath of the attack. Sentencing, Mr Justice Saunders told the court that, if it were not for the quick actions of police, both victims could have died. He said: 'Fortunately the police were on the scene very quickly and took appropriate steps to stem the two victims' bleeding, which was considerable. 'They cared for the wounded until an ambulance arrived to take them to hospital. It may well be that the prompt police action saved the lives of these two young people.' He added: 'Both the jury and I were impressed with the efficient, calm and highly professional way in which the police carried out their duty. 'Because the police were carrying cameras, which recorded what was happening, we saw some very shocking scenes but it brought home to us the true nature of these events.' Earlier this week, Ms Narotam's father, Narotam Deugi, 40, from Wembley was found guilty of common assault against his daughter and given a 12-month conditional discharge. He was found not guilty of false imprisonment, along with her mother Parvati Natu, 42. Deugi was originally charged with conspiracy to murder his daughter and served 100 days on remand in custody before that allegation was dropped. During the attack, Soma slit Ms Narotam's throat while holding her from behind, before stabbing Mr Govinde through the neck with the same knife (pictured) Three of Ms Narotam's uncles Jignesh Devgi, 31, Harshad Jagdish, 25, and Shanitlal Natu, 37, and a cousin Kaushik Meghji, 18, all from Wembley were also cleared of kidnapping charges. Ms Natotam and Mr Govinde have since married and are living at a secret address, due to threats from other members of the family, the court was told. Mr Justice Saunders said: 'The background was that Bharat Soma was engaged to be married to Darshana Narotam, which was arranged by her parents and I'm satisfied Darshana never willingly agreed to it. 'She never told Soma she wanted to marry him although she agreed to the engagement because she felt she had no option but to go along with her parents' wishes until she was old enough to be able to marry Prashant without their consent. 'On January 10 this year, Darshana ran away with Prashant, intending to marry him and not Soma. 'When Soma discovered Darshana wasn't going to marry him he became very upset. 'I accept it may be that he was in love with her and developed a fixation about her, but I don't believe he ever had grounds for believing Darshana was in love with him. 'Mr Soma said in evidence he had wanted to marry Darshana since she was 11, although they didn't meet until she was 16 after they became engaged.' He continued: 'After Prashant and Darshana were seen out on the street (in Leicester) by a family friend on January 19, he informed Soma he had seen Darshana. 'After being given that information Soma went off to purchase a knife and I'm satisfied the reason for that was to use it to kill Darshana. 'I can't be sure he was intending to kill Prashant, who he may not have realised was with her at the time. 'He went around the streets looking for Darshana so he could kill her. Immediately after the attack Soma was repeating 'my wife, my wife'. The couple had left their homes in Wembley, London to live in Leicester in January this year, so Ms Narotam would not have to marry Soma . The pair left their homes just nine days before the brutal attack. They are now living at a secret address . 'The defendant told the police he lost his mind, because he believed that a curse had been put on him.' Soma was sentenced to 23 years in prison for the attempted murders, as well as three years for wounding with intent, which will run concurrently. The judge said he was not imposing a life sentence, because of Soma's previously good character. Although they have been left permanently scarred from their injuries, the judge also said it was believed that the victims had not suffered 'serious long term harm'. He added: 'That's not to underestimate the ordeal they've gone through and the considerable difficulties they still have. 'It's hoped they'll make a good long term recovery. 'They've had to move away from family, friends and jobs because they're under threat of reprisals from other people - which is not attributable to Mr Soma. 'I very much hope those threats will now cease.' He said that the mitigating factors were the defendant's good character and the fact he was suffering from an 'adjustment disorder with prolonged depressive reaction'. Soma's defence counsel, Jo Sidhu QC said that, although Soma was not suffering from a 'classified mental illness', the trigger for the offending was when Darshana eloped. Mr Sidhu said: 'It made him feel low and he felt very hurt. He had nightmares, he was seeing ghosts. 'He got a tip off about where they were and acted on impulse. He feels bad about the effect of his actions and many times he's cried about it. 'He's not wired the same as other people because in his family there's an unfortunate pattern of suicide; both his father and paternal grandfather killed themselves. 'In the defendant's mind he'd been rejected without a reason. His feelings for Darshana remained strong, right up until the day of this attack.' Police at the scene of the crime shortly after the attack. The judge praised officers for their quick actions in dealing with the attempted murders . The officers were carrying cameras, which recorded what was happening. The judge said the footage brought home 'the true nature of these events' After the case, Detective Inspector John Farndon from Leicestershire police's serious crime team, said: 'These were dreadful crimes, and could easily have caused the deaths of two young people who had harmed no-one. 'Crimes like these are very rare, and are sometimes called honour based violence. However, this has nothing to do with culture or religion, this is simple criminality. 'Leicestershire Police took this case extremely seriously and carried out a thorough investigation to put those responsible before the courts.' He added: 'During our initial enquiries this case was quickly identified as being one of honour based violence and concerns regarding a possible forced marriage. 'This case demonstrates that we take crimes of this nature incredibly seriously and we hope it gives potential victims the confidence to report it to the police or other agencies. 'Anyone who fears they may be subjected to honour based violence or have concerns about someone else should contact us at the earliest opportunity. There are a range of criminal and civil powers we and partner agencies can put in place to keep you safe.'","Darshana Narotam's parents had arranged for her to marry Bharat Soma .

"Hundreds of excited  shoppers poured through the doors of Sephora's first Australian store in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall today. The store launched at midday with a promise to bring cosmetics prices down for Australians, but a price comparison reveals customers will pay the same money for top brands as they do in Myer and David Jones. Sephora will introduce 32 new brands to Australia, some of which will be sold in line with prices in its European and U.S. stores, but the outlet has no plans to undercut any products already being sold locally. Scroll down for video . The first Australian Sephora outlet was launched in Sydney with a confetti cannon and a flash mob . Hundreds of shoppers packed into the flagship store to stock up on beauty products and cosmetics . Crazed fans rushed through the doors when the makeup shop officially opened at midday on Friday . The new brands include the store's own affordable makeup range, Formula X, Marc Jacobs, Ole Henriksen, Tarte, Kat Von D, Hello Kitty and SKIN INC. Sydney store director Danielle Hill said the prices in Australia would be as close to U.S. prices as possible. 'Some things are closer to the American range but not all,' Ms Hill told Daily Mail Australia. But brands including Clinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome and Clarins that are already sold locally  will not be sold for cheaper. Daily Mail Australia compared prices on products from top labels including Dior, Lancome, Shiseido, and Clinique and found no difference between Sephora Australia, Myer and David Jones. (From left) Troy Kellahan, Leanne Painemilla, Cristina Divina, Jemima Agnew  and Kirra Jackson camped in the rain overnight to be the first through the new Sephora doors . The store launched  with a promise to bring cosmetics prices down for Australians, but a price comparison reveals top brands are cheaper in the U.S. and cost the same as Myer and David Jones . Dior Capture Totale 60mL face cream costs $255, Lancome Blanc Expert 50mL night cream costs $129, Shiseido Benefiance Concentrated Neck Contour Treatment 50mL costs $70 and Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion 125mL pump costs $49 across all three stores.

Sephora U.S.: $US26 (A$31.06) The same products are sold to U.S. customers at lower prices and with free shipping on the Sephora website. The Dior cream costs $US160 ($A191.08), the Shiseido product costs $US52.50 ($A62.72) and the Clinique lotion costs Clinique $US26 (A$31.06). Price hikes on cosmetics have long been a sore point for local shoppers, with consumer group Choice finding that Australians pay up to 50 percent more than shoppers overseas for some products. Ms Hill said Sephora charged the same prices as other stores in Australia due to agreements with brands already available here. 'It's more of a category question where they just have a relationship the brands and the agreement that we have with them,' she said. 'We've got the Sephora collection which is our brand and we can control a little bit more.' The cosmetic superstore has proven irresistible to many Australian shoppers, with many camping in wild storms overnight just to be one of the first customers to walk through the door. When the clock hit midday on Friday, a confetti cannon went off to signify the store's open and shoppers filled the make-up giant's newest store, screaming and snapping selfies at the mirrors. Ms Hill said she had launched five stores in the U.S. but had never seen such a big turnout.

'Because it's Sephora, it's my life, like I cried when I walked in the store,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Many of the people were in line to be one of the first 300 to buy a product from reality TV star Kat Von D's range, so they can meet her at the store tomorrow. Troy Kellahan, 26, flew to Sydney from Brisbane for the opening. He has an image of Kat Von D tattooed on his calf. 'I'll probably faint when I meet her, she's an inspiration,' Mr Kellahan said. Store director Danielle Hill said Sephora had more control over the prices of its own brand . The Sephora label sells an affordable range of cosmetics including $10 eye pencils and $18 eye shadows . Ali Caley, 27, from Croydon stood in line from 4am to buy makeup so she can meet Kat Von D. 'I just think she's got so much confidence, doesn't give a damn what everyone else thinks about her,' Ms Caley said. Security guard Kuki Tomruk said the queue of 1000 people before the opening was 'crazier than a nightclub'. Longs lines are expected for days, if not weeks, because security will limit shoppers to 200 at a time. Kirra Jackson, 19, from Collaroy camped at the front of the line from midday on Thursday. She shielded herself from last night's storm using a tent and cardboard given to her by Westfield management. Performers entertained hundreds of shoppers as the queued outside the Sephora store ahead of the opening . Shoppers queue outside Sephora before it opened the doors to its Westfield Pitt Street Mall store . 'We're a little bit crazy, we like makeup just a little bit too much,' she told Daily Mail Australia, adding that she planned to buy as much as she could when she got in the doors. Ravi Thakran, Asia and Middle East president of Sephora's parent company LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton, said the company would keep its promise of maintaining low prices on its exclusive brands, the Australian Financial Review reported. But Mr Thakran added: 'If a brand is already in the market we don't tell them to give us a cheaper price (and) we don't want to compete with department stores and other players based on lower pricing.' He said the retailer planned to open 20 stores across Australia, first focussing on launching an extra store in Sydney and two in Melbourne. Make-up enthusiasts braved Sydney storms last night to be the first in line for today's opening . Sephora's first Australian store in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall will open at midday on Friday . Hundreds have queued outside the store and the first people in the line camped overnight in the rain . Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said Australians pay much more than shoppers in the U.S. and UK, whether its for cosmetics or digital content. 'If the retail outlets in Australia don't start to offer competitive prices consumers will be driven online,' Mr Godfrey said. 'People are going to continue to use VPNs (virtual private networks) to navigate around geoblocks and access a better deal.' VPNs disguise a person's IP address on their computer so they don't appear to be shopping from Australia, and can get the same cheaper prices as U.S. shoppers.

"Rebecca Berry, was found dead in the garden of her home in Edmondsham in Dorset with burns. Police are investigating how the teenager was injured . A schoolgirl of 15 has died from severe burns amid fears she may have set herself on fire. Police are investigating after Rebecca Berry was found collapsed in her garden by a relative. The teenager, pictured – known to friends as Rebe – was pronounced dead a short time later. Police said they were not treating her death as suspicious, but do not yet know whether she intended to set fire to herself or was the victim of a tragic accident at the house in Edmondsham, near Verwood, Dorset. One neighbour said: ‘She was lovely, very friendly. The whole village is very upset.’ Fellow pupils at Queen Elizabeth School, Wimborne, have been offered counselling. A police spokesman said: ‘The body of the girl was discovered at 9.18pm on Monday by a family member.’ The results of a post mortem examination yesterday have yet to be released. Firefighters were called to a property fire in the village at about 9.15pm on Monday, along with paramedics, but could do nothing to save the girl, who was pronounced dead at the scene. The teenager lived with her mother Gill and step-father Scott, a chimney sweep, at a farm in the sleepy and picturesque Dorset hamlet. A statement issued by her family said: 'We as a family are pulling together to help each other cope with the devastating loss of our beautiful girl and are gathering strength from each other to guide us through this time. 'We would like to thank friends and the village community for their continuing support and kind words. 'The family would like to encourage people to lay floral tributes at Edmondsham Pump to pay their respects to Rebe.' Tributes have appeared at the pump and close to her home in the hamlet since Miss Berry's death on Monday. The teenager was a year 10 pupil at Queen Elizabeth's School in nearby Wimborne. Dorset Police confirmed it was not treating the death as suspicious but had so far been unable to determine how the girl came to suffer the burns . Rebecca Berry, known as Rebe, was discovered with the burns by a relative in the hamlet where she lives in Edmondsham in Dorset . The family of Rebecca Berry have asked people to live floral tributes at the pump in Edmondsham, Dorset . Martin McLeman, headteacher at the school, posted on its website: 'It is with deep regret that I write to advise you of the death of one of our Year 10 girls. 'We are devastated by this news and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this extremely sad time. 'I have advised all Year 10 students at school this morning and they may need the support of their families when they return home this evening and over the coming weeks. 'Counselling and support has been arranged here and is available at school for everyone in the school community affected by this tragic event. The teenager's family said they were pulling together and people left floral tributes at the centre of the hamlet . Police said they are treating the death of Rebe at the Dorset hamlet as unexplained and are investigating . 'If you feel your son or daughter needs any support in dealing with this difficult issue at any time, then please let me know.' Mr McLeman added that staff and pupils were being supported by the chaplaincy team and county council and that they were praying for the student's family. A neighbour in Edmondsham, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'She was a lovely young girl, very friendly, you could always have a chat with her. The whole village is very upset.' The teenager was a pupil at Queen Elizabeth's School in Wimborne, where pupils are being offered support . The teenager lived with her mother Gill and step-father Scott, a chimney sweep, at a farm in the sleepy and picturesque Dorset hamlet . Floral tributes were left in the girl's village and the Christmas lights were switched off as residents paid their respects. A Dorset Police spokesman said: 'Her death is being treated as unexplained and officers are investigating the circumstances. 'Next of kin and the coroner have been informed.' A Dorset Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'A crew from Cranborne did attend that incident.'","Teenager was found by a relative in garden of her home in Edmondsham .

"A mother's grief: Karen de la Carriere said her son disowned in 2010 after she left Scientology . The mother of 27-year-old Scientologist Alexander Jentzsch, did not find out that her son died until days later, and said that she won’t be allowed to see her son’s body at the morgue. Karen de la Carriere, who was once married to current Scientology president Heber Jentzsch and left the Church in 2010, said that Alexander’s wife, who is also a Scientologist, is refusing to let the grieving mother view her son’s body. She also said that she was not informed of her son’s death for days, and had to find out from a friend, later confirming Alexander’s death with the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office of her son’s passing. ‘They didn’t inform me, they didn’t inform Herber,’ she told the Village Voice. Heber Jentzsch has not been seen in public for nearly a decade, one of several high-profile Scientology members removed from the public eye. The wife of church leader David Miscavige, Michelle ‘Shelly’ Barnett, has not been seen since 2007. Ms de la Carriere did not immediately return requests for comment from the MailOnline, but told the Village Voice in an emotional conversation the details surrounding her son’s death. Missing? President of the Church of Scientology International Heber Jentzsch has not been seen publically since 2004; their son Alexander, who was 27, died July 2nd . Permission denied: Ms de la Carriere said there was no funeral and that she was not permitted to see Alexander, pictured in this undated photo . She said that Alexander ‘had a high fever, and the next morning, he was icy cold and he was dead,’ the mother said, adding that he was on pain killers for a back injury obtained in a car accident. Ms de la Carriere told the Voice: ‘The dead body of the son of the president of the Church of Scientology has been sitting in a morgue for days, and they didn’t tell me because I’m a declared SP.’ She was excommunicated after she left the Church, and was branded a ‘suppressive person,’ the Voice reported. She told RadarOnline.com that Alexander’s wife, Andrea, refuses to let her see her son’s body. When Ms de la Carriere sent a friend over to their home with a letter for Andrea, the friend was turned away with the message, ‘All communication goes through the Office of Special Affairs.’ The mother told the Village Voice that the Church created a ‘hate website’ about her, and coerced Alexander to cut all ties with her. Happier times: Left, Karen and Heber on their wedding day and right, Heber and their young son Alexander . She said that he was spoon fed what to tell her, including the words: ‘Never phone me, never e-mail me. Until you get your s*** together, we can have no communication.  'Until then, we are disconnected.’ The mother added: ‘For two years, he disconnected from me, and now he’s dead.’ She found out three days after the fact that her son had died from former Scientology spokesman Mike Rinder. Apparently, Andrea had told some of her Scientology friends on Facebook about Alexander’s death, and the news eventually tricked down to Rinder, who currently lives in Florida, RadarOnline.com reported. Leaving: Karen, back right, left the Church of Scientology in 2010 and said her son cut all ties with her . Once told by Mr Rinder, Ms de la Carriere called the coroner’s office, which solidly confirmed her son’s death. In an explosive tell all published on a friend’s blog in 2010, Ms de la Carriere revealed her struggle with the religion, and explained how Alexander, who was born in 1984, was inculcated with the beliefs of Scientology from infancy. 'The dead body of the son of the . president of the Church of Scientology has been sitting in a morgue for . days, and they didn’t tell me because I'm a declared SP.' -Karen de la Carriere . According to her, Alexander was a member of Sea Org for more than a decade. She also wrote of the policies surrounding Scientology and reproduction. Alexander’s wife, Andrea, became pregnant in 2007. She wrote in the post: ‘Pressure is brought to bear for an abortion. It is done skilfully – no heavy threats, but both are taken off post to look at “the greatest good…” In the end, Andrea had an abortion and they were returned to post.’ Ms de la Carriere said in a 2011 interview that she and then-husband Heber had to petition for a second child, a newly-ordained rule at the time. She said she wanted a girl. ‘A new had come out that you had to petition to have a baby,' she explained. 'And along with the petition, you were to name why should be allowed to have a baby.’ Ms de la Carriere said that though she and her husband petitioned for three months, their petition was denied. She also said that her husband was beaten for making the request. She again became pregnant three years later. A spokesperson from the Church of Scientology International told MailOnline: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Heber Jentzsch and his entire family during this difficult time. ‘The Church takes offense at the irresponsible and false claims from excommunicated self-promoters who are sadly exploiting private family matters for their own personal financial gain.’ Hollywood split: The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, pictured . The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise. In light of the rumours that Cruise’ devotion to Scientology- and his supposed desire to enrol Suri in one of the religion’s intense boot camps - was one of the main causes for their split,  two senior Church administrators sent a panicked email giving followers advice on how to counter the negative press storm. The letter comes the day after one of the most noted ‘defectors’ from the religion predicted that Cruise’ latest divorce could be the ‘biggest nightmare in the Church of Scientology’s history’ because of the drama that could unfold if secrets are publicly revealed in court. Scientology was developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1952. Their website reads: ‘The ultimate goal of Scientology is true spiritual enlightenment and freedom for all.’","Karen de la Carriere, former wife of Scientology president Herber Jentzsch, did not hear of her son's death until three days later .

"One of the last great Turner masterpieces remaining in private hands set a world auction record for the artist, Sotheby's said. Rome, From Mount Aventine, sold for £30.3 million, including buyer's premium, easily beating its estimate of £15-20 million. The result also represents the highest price for any pre-20th Century British artist ever sold at auction, a spokeswoman said. JMW Turner's masterpiece Rome, From Mount Aventine, pictured, sold for £30.3 million at auction yesterday . Rome was painted in 1835 by JMW Turner, pictured, and exhibited at the Royal Academy the following year . Four bidders competed for the work, driving the price ever higher, before it was bought by one of them on the phone to the central London saleroom. The auction coincided with a wider moment of interest in JMW Turner, with a ground breaking exhibition at Tate Britain and Mike Leigh's film Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall. Painted in 1835 and exhibited at the Royal Academy the following year, when Turner was 61, the painting is seen as one of the artist's supreme achievements and arguably the most important view of the Italian city ever painted. The large-scale oil painting is further distinguished by its exceptional state of preservation, as well as a prestigious and unbroken provenance. Until the sale, the work had changed hands only once, in 1878, when it was acquired by the Fifth Earl of Rosebery, later Prime Minister. It has since remained undisturbed in the Rosebery collection. In 1836, The Morning Post described the work as 'one of those amazing pictures by which Mr Turner dazzles the imagination and confounds all criticism: it is beyond praise'. Alex Bell, joint international head and co-chairman of Sotheby's Old Master Paintings Department, said: 'It is hard to overstate the importance of Rome, From Mount Aventine. There are no more than half a dozen major works by Turner left in private hands and this work must rank as one of the very finest. 'This painting, which is nearly 200 years old, looks today as if it has come straight from the easel of the artist; never relined and never subject to restoration, the picture retains the freshness of the moment it was painted: the hairs from Turner's brush, his fingerprint, the drips of liquid paint which have run down the edge of the canvas, and every scrape of his palette knife have been preserved in incredible detail. 'The outstanding result achieved tonight is a further indication of the strength of the Old Master market. When there is quality, there are buyers.'","Rome, From Mount Aventine had a guide price of between £15-£20 million .

"A woman who claimed to have been tricked into thinking she had given birth by Nigerian fraudsters has lost her fight to care for the baby she brought home to the UK from the African 'clinic'. The woman, of dual British and Nigerian nationality, travelled from London to the African country in 2010 after struggling to conceive naturally. After being 'drugged' and undergoing 'a process which resembled birth', the woman returned to the UK with the infant who has severe disabilities. The woman claims to have believed she was pregnant and gave birth in Nigeria. She has lost a High Court battle to care for the baby boy she brought back to the UK after visiting the African country (file image) Within months the baby was taken into social care, with a judge ordering earlier this year the boy be permanently looked after by the state. The woman, who thought she was his biological mother despite DNA tests revealing otherwise, fought the decision, but has lost an appeal at the High Court. Today a judge ruled the woman should not have any part in the child's upbringing despite 'hoping against hope' he was her son. The court heard how the woman travelled to Nigeria in 2010 to undergo 'herbal treatment' she thought would help her conceive a baby. Despite being told by a British GP that she was not carrying a child, the woman returned to Nigeria where, following 'a process which resembled a birth', she was presented with the child. 'Her state of mind at that point was that she continued to hope against hope that it might just be the case that she was the baby’s mother. 'She closed her eyes to all of the pointers in the other direction,' Lady Justice Black said. In 2012 the pair returned to the UK where, despite her efforts, the boy's health suffered due to severe disabilities. Visits to health services raised concerns over how the woman and the child were related, and the boy was entrusted to the care of foster parents. The woman lost her appeal at the High Court today after acting in a 'hostile' way towards social workers . After launching an appeal to win back custody of the child, the woman was described as being 'hostile to social workers'. Judge Pamela Scriven QC told the court the woman 'saw the world through a narrow and self-justifying lens.' It was ruled the boy be permanently cared for by local authorities, a decision which the woman and her legal team appealed. However in a separate ruling, Lady Justice Black today said their efforts had 'no real prospect of success'. 'I consider that these various grounds of appeal have no real prospect of success on appeal. 'The judge made careful factual findings, which rightly identified the many problems in the way in which this woman approached the child’s welfare.'","Woman travelled to Nigeria for 'herbal treatment' to conceive in 2010 .

"With soft, fluffy manes, soulful eyes and tiny size, they look like something out of a fairy tale - and are cute enough to brighten anyone's day. But these adorable miniature horses had one mission: to put a smile on the faces of sick children at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center. Mystery and Lunar trotted into the hospital's pediatric unit last month to the delight of wide-eyed youngsters, some hooked up to IV poles, who stepped out into the corridors for a closer look. And those too sick to leave their beds weren't left out when the long-lashed little creatures came over for a spot of bedside nuzzling. Cute: Emily Pietsch, 17, spends time with mini-horse Mystery, who visited the pediatric unit at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago . Playtime: Patients Nathaniel Lopez, left, and Araceli Morales, right, pet Lunar from Mane in Heaven . The horses are about the size big dogs, and their roles involve offering comfort care and distraction therapy for patients. The role is often taken on by dogs in health-care settings, but mini-horses add an extra element of delight as many children don't know they exist outside of fairy tales. Animal therapy, according to studies and anecdotal reports, may benefit health, perhaps even speeding healing and recovery. Stroking Mystery's nose from her propped-up hospital bed, 14-year-old Elizabeth Duncan said: 'I want one.' And epilepsy patient Emily Pietsch, 17, after gently tracing Lunar's heart-shaped muzzle with her fingers, added: 'They're so nice and they don't judge and they're so sweet.' These two horses belong to animal-assisted therapy group Mane in Heaven, based in Lake in the Hills, northeast of Chicago. They have visited nursing homes and centers for the disabled, but this visit was their first ever inside a hospital. It was also the first horse-therapy visit for the hospital, and more are planned. Trotting in: Mane in Heaven staff and volunteers escort animal therapist Mystery into the hospital . Mythical: Nathaniel Lopez, left, and Isis Lindsey, center, pet Lunar, who is about the size of a big dog . Fairy tale: 'They're so nice and they don't judge and they're so sweet,' said epilepsy patient Emily Pietsch . Robyn Hart, the hospital's director of child life services, said: 'We have long had animal-assisted therapy here at Rush and just seen the enormous benefits that animals can have on most children — just the joy that they bring, the unconditional love.' He added mini-horses 'are something that most people whether kids or adults have never seen before, and so that builds in a little more excitement and anticipation. 'They almost look like mythical animals, like they should have wings on,' she added. The horses were 'a smashing success. We're looking forward to having them visit monthly.' Some people confuse these horses with better-known Shetland ponies, but minis are less stout, with a more horse-like build. Mane in Heaven's owner, Jodie Siegel, a former obstetrics nurse, says the minis bring 'smiles, joy, love and laughter and that's the true healing in action.' Some research has suggested that animal-assisted therapy may reduce pain and blood pressure, and decrease fear and stress in hospitalized children. But much of it is based on patients' reports. A review of 10 years of studies about in-patient therapy using dogs, published in April in the Southern Medical Association's journal, concluded that it's safe and can be effective.

Dr. Caroline Burton of Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, a co-author of the review, owns seven dogs, four regular horses and a donkey, and strongly supports animal-assisted therapy. She acknowledged that skeptics dismiss it as 'touchy-feely' and lacking hard evidence of any meaningful medical benefits. Dr Burton said studies are needed on whether animals in hospitals can shorten patients' stays and reduce readmission rates — something her hospital is looking into with dogs and heart failure patients. While some worry about animals bringing germs into hospitals, Burton's review found no associated infections in patients. Guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that animal-assisted therapy in health-care settings stems from evidence that having pets at home helps some patients recover more quickly from medical procedures. The guidelines focus mostly on infection control procedures and hand-washing for patients and hospital staff. Ms Siegel, Mane in Heaven's owner, and her horse helpers carry lots of hand sanitizer and a pooper scooper on therapy visits. She doesn't feed the horses beforehand, to help avoid accidents. Even so, one of the horses pooped in a hallway during the Chicago hospital visit, but the volunteers cleaned up in a flash and no one seemed phased.","Mystery and Lunar visited patients at Rush University Medical Center .

"A school that banned Red Bull and other energy drinks has seen the number of pupils being given detentions plunge by a third. In the latest piece of evidence that the drinks can cause poor behaviour in the classroom, staff said standards were transformed after just two terms. Drinks such as Monster, Red Bull and Relentless combine so much sugar and caffeine that Government advisers warn they make children hyperactive and difficult to control. Dee Griffiths, headteacher at Haydock High School in Haydock, Merseyside (pictured with a group of Year 9 pupils), said there had been a marked change in pupils' behaviour since the school banned energy drinks . Some 500ml cans contain the equivalent of more than 13 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg of caffeine – about the same as in four cans of cola. The ban was suggested by Year 8 pupils at Haydock High School in Merseyside. Head teacher Dee Griffiths said: ‘Research would suggest that levels of concentration among some young people are negatively affected by highly-sugared energy drinks. ‘Some students who use these cannot learn at their best. The consumption of vast quantities of “empty calories” can lead to health concerns, including obesity and dental issues.’ To help encourage fellow pupils to ditch energy drinks, members of the school’s student council designed a water bottle with the Friends of Haydock fundraising group. Haydock High School (pictured) said pupils designed a new water bottle to encourage fellow students to give up energy drinks and opt for healthier choices instead. The school has noticed an improvement in behaviour . These bottles were offered to pupils in return for a pledge to go further than the ban and steer clear of all fizzy, sugary drinks in exchange for water. In Years 7, 8 and 9, more than 95 per cent of pupils signed up, along with more than 70 per cent in Years 10 and 11. Earlier this year, Government adviser and restaurateur John Vincent called for energy drinks to be banned in schools - saying the beverages were as harmful as drugs. He said drinks such as Monster, Red Bull and Relentless  make children difficult to control. Mr Vincent said: 'Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs. The amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is in our view effectively allowing drugs into schools. ‘It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, how they feel and it is having health effects.' As well as the fall in the number of detentions, achievement and general behaviour levels rose – a trend Mrs Griffiths put down to the ban. Councillor Andy Bowden, of St Helens council in Merseyside, said: ‘It is good to see it was the students themselves that recognised the effects high- caffeine drinks were having and the benefits drinking water as an alternative can have.’ Earlier this year, restaurateur John Vincent – who founded the Leon fast-food chain and advised ministers on improving youngsters’ nutrition – said: ‘The amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is effectively allowing drugs into schools. ‘We don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school life. It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, how they feel and it is having health effects.’ Another school that reported improved behaviour after banning energy drinks is Chatsmore Catholic High School in Worthing, West Sussex, which in 2008 blamed them for pupils being noisy, late for lessons and failing to follow instructions. Energy drinks have been widely criticised. A survey last year found that one in 20 teenagers goes to school on a can of energy drink rather than eating a healthy breakfast. Haydock High School in Haydock, Merseyside, banned leading energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster . Former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne blamed them for the seizure her daughter Kelly had last year. Manufacturers and retailers have a voluntary ban on the sale of the drinks to under-16s, but there is no law to stop children buying them. A spokesman for the British Soft Drinks Association said that while most energy drinks contain no more caffeine than a typical cup of coffee, ‘We are clear that energy drinks are not recommended for children, and we want to get that message across to young people and their parents’. For comparison, a 150ml can of Coca-Cola contains 8mg caffeine and 15.0g of sugar. According to NewHealthGuide.org, a teaspoon is roughly 4 grams of white granulated sugar. RED BULL ENERGY DRINK (250ml) CAFFEINE: 80mg . SUGAR: 27.5g (11g per 100ML) RED BULL SUGARFREE ENERGY DRINK (25Oml) CAFFEINE: 80MG . Contains sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame K instead of sugar . MONSTER ENERGY DRINK (230ml/ 8 fl oz) CAFFEINE: 80mg . SUGAR: 27g . MONSTER MEGA ENERGY DRINK (680ml/ 680 fl oz) CAFFEINE: 240mg . SUGAR: 81g . RELENTLESS ORIGINAL ENERGY DRINK (250ml) CAFFEINE: 80mg . SUGAR: 25g . The Food Standards Agency advises that children limit their intake of drinks that are high in caffeine - saying the drinks ‘could potentially lead to short-term effects such as increased excitability, irritability, nervousness or anxiety’. A study by the Energy Drink Consumption in Europe found that large amounts of caffeine can cause heart palpitations, fits and even death, as well as raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Heavy consumption has also been linked to a greater risk of depression, addiction and alcohol dependency. Energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly, unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee, the study found. The British Soft Drinks Association code of conduct states that energy drinks should not be sold in schools.","Haydock High School banned  energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster .

"George Osborne will have to impose spending cuts ‘on a colossal scale’ to meet his targets, a leading think-tank warned yesterday. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor would have to slash welfare or put up taxes by £21billion just to keep cuts down to the same level as Britain has seen in the past five years. Without this, £55billion in cuts will be needed after next May’s election if the Tories win, compared with the £35billion made since the Coalition came to power in 2010. Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts . Chancellor George Osborne admitted difficult decisions lie ahead in order to get Britain 'out of the red and into the black' The respected think-tank suggested cuts on this scale would mean a ‘fundamental re-imagining of the role of the state’. It urged Mr Osborne to spell out before the election what the cuts would mean for public services such as transport, policing and defence. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ‘It is surely incumbent upon anyone set on taking the size of the state to its smallest in many generations to tell us what that means. 'How will these cuts be implemented? What will local government, the defence force, the transport system look like in this world? Spending by government departments will fall to just 12 per cent of GDP. If health, schools and foreign aid are protected, other areas will be severely squeezed . Plans to grant the taxman new powers to ‘name and shame’ serial tax dodgers could unfairly target the innocent, experts warned last night. Tax specialists and campaigners fear the proposals allowing HM Revenue & Customs to publicly identify suspected serial tax avoiders will backfire. Many legitimate tax schemes are set up to help burgeoning industries take off, and attract individuals keen to legally reduce their tax bill. But there are fears those who take advantage of such schemes could now be unfairly named as serial avoiders. Critics argue the change could name innocent individuals given bad tax advice, wrongly implicate hard-working entrepreneurs, and turn households into victims of mistaken identity. Elaine Clark, of accountants Cheapaccounting, said: ‘I’m all for people paying the right amount of tax. But any proposed scheme to collect more tax must target the correct people, not those engaged in legitimate practices.’ Campaigners’ concerns focus on small print buried in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, which proposed publishing the names of those it believes are ‘repeat users of known avoidance schemes’. These schemes are often fiendishly complicated and set up by financial specialists to attract funding to target industries. Backers range from ordinary businessmen to well-off investors and celebrities. Andy Silvester, spokesman for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘HMRC regularly get things wrong, so there’s a risk individuals could be named and shamed without having done anything wrong.’ HMRC said the proposals were aimed at a hard core of tax avoiders with an average income of £260,000 who have tried to avoid paying more than £10million in tax. ‘One thing is for sure. If we move in anything like this direction, whilst continuing to protect health and pensions, the role and shape of the state will have changed beyond all recognition.’ Figures released yesterday also suggest that Labour’s plan to cut the deficit more slowly if it wins the election would leave Ed Balls free to borrow about £25billion more than the Conservatives to fund a spending splurge – adding to Britain’s mountain of debt. Mr Osborne has already announced plans for a further £12billion of cuts in welfare after the election. But the IFS said this would have to almost double to £21billion to maintain the current pace of cuts to other areas of spending. The scale of the challenge is made harder by the Government’s decision to protect – or ring-fence – spending on health, schools and foreign aid, meaning that cuts in other areas of public spending will have to be far deeper. Budgets for unprotected departments such as defence, transport and the Home Office are on course to fall by an average of almost a third unless the Government cuts welfare more deeply or raises taxes. By 2020 spending on health and the state pension will account for almost a third of all Government spending – 32 per cent, up from 14 per cent when the welfare state was founded after the Second World War. The IFS said that despite a slew of announcements on new roads and flood defences there was ‘no spending dividend on the horizon’. Mr Johnson said: ‘On these plans, whichever way you look at it, we are considerably less than halfway through the cuts.’ The figures also underline the difficulty the Conservatives will face in finding the £7billion needed to pay for big increases in the personal tax allowance and the 40p income tax threshold after the election. Mr Osborne defended his proposals, insisting voters faced a choice between the ‘course to prosperity’ set out in the Autumn Statement or a return to the chaos seen under Labour. In June 2010, the Office for Budget for Responsibility predicted that in 2014-15 borrowing would fall to just £37billion, but it has remained high at around £100billion and is not expected to return a surplus until 2018-19 . George Osborne yesterday hit out at the BBC's 'hyperbolic' coverage of spending cuts, accusing the broadcaster of predicting the world would fall in. The Chancellor clashed with Radio 4 Today programme host John Humphrys about questions on the state of the country's finances. Mr Osborne said: 'When I woke up this morning and turned on the Today programme I felt like I was listening to a rewind of a tape from 2010. You had BBC correspondents saying Britain is returning to a sort of George Orwell world of The Road to Wigan Pier.' Orwell's bleak book chronicled poverty, hunger and social injustice in the north of England in the 1930s. Mr Osborne repeatedly hit back at Humphrys' 'nonsense' questioning, adding: 'I would have thought the BBC would have learned from the last four years that its totally hyperbolic coverage of spending cuts has not been matched by what has actually happened. 'I had all that when you interviewed me four years, and has the world fallen in? No it hasn't. The British economy is growing and the deficit is half what it was when I was doing those interviews.' Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC of being 'utterly negative' about the government's flagship welfare reforms, and challenged claims by Today present Mishal Husain that it had been 'dogged' by problems. ‘I’ve got a plan to reduce the deficit. I’m not going faster than that plan, I’m not going slower than that plan,’ he said. ‘We have demonstrated in specific ways over the past four years that we can reduce the cost of public services while actually improving the quality.’ He has already set out plans for £11.5billion of additional cuts for 2015/6. The Tories have said a further £25billion will be needed in the following two years to clear the budget deficit. However, the IFS says the true level of cuts needed for that period is nearer £30billion. It said recent progress on reducing the deficit had been ‘disappointing’, with the gap between spending and income falling by only £6billion in the past year to £91.3billion. The think-tank also raised concerns about the sharp fall in tax revenues. Mr Johnson said that, despite the recovery, the Office for Budget Responsibility had produced a ‘really substantial downgrade’ of £8billion in expected tax revenues this year. The shortfall is set to rise to £21billion by 2017/18, making it even more difficult for Mr Osborne to pay down the national debt. He said on Wednesday he wants a budget surplus of £23billion by 2019/20, which it is estimated would require a further £14billion of cuts. ‘This lack of buoyancy in tax revenues, associated with poor earnings growth, looks like being a continued cause for concern,’ said Mr Johnson. In 2010 George Osborne remained confident that borrowing would fall sharply, but in 2011 and 2012 a deterioration in the economic picture meant the prospect of balancing the books slipped further into the future .","Another five years of pain to get Britain back into the black by 2019 .

"Volunteers are planting thousands of trees as part of Britain's biggest ever man-made forest, in an attempt to replace entire swathes of woodland that were cut down during the First World War. The 185-acre site, which covers the same area as 105 football pitches, will be planted with 13,500 trees to try and restore the Slindon estate on the West Sussex South Down to its pre-war state. During the First World War, a large proportion of Northwood was felled for timber by Canadian foresters using prisoners of war to produce essential materials such as coal mine pit props and trench reinforcements. The Rise of Northwood project is set to see a huge area of the Slindon estate on the West Sussex South Downs return to its pre-First World War state, after much of the forest was cut down by lumberjacks (pictured) to help the war effort . During WWI, Canadian foresters used prisoners of war to produce materials such as coal mine pit props and trench reinforcements . Michelle Merritt, Cathryn Barty, Lucas Barty, 4, and Joshua Merritt , 4, (L-R) are some of the hundreds of  volunteers who have signed up to take part in the biggest-ever National Trust project . Now hundreds of volunteers have signed up to take part in the 'Rise of Northwood', the National Trust's biggest project to re-plant the site. More than 3,000 trees have already gone in and the group believe they are well on track to finish the woodland by the end of January. Project leader Hannah Woodhouse said: 'It was heartwarming to see such a great turnout of people giving up their spare time to help us. 'People feel passionately about trees, and many of our volunteer planters and their families have known this landscape for decades, so it has a very special place in their hearts. Northwood Project Ranger Hannah Woodhouse (pictured planting a yew tree) said it was 'heart-warming' to see such a good turnout of volunteers . David Porter, 10, and Madison Porter, 8, (pictured) chisel and sculpt the Portland stone that will become a sculpture to be featured in the new forest . 'We've still got quite a long way to go, with around 10,000 more saplings to plant, but we're hoping people continue to come forward during our other planting dates in winter and spring. 'This is a wonderful opportunity to be physically involved in the creation of a beautiful landscape that will be part of the English countryside for centuries.' One volunteer, David Archer, said he had enjoyed the project so much he could not wait to do more. He said: 'This project is fabulous, and the weekend has been a huge success - it was such a lovely team effort. Personally, I can't wait to do more.' Apart from the thousands of trees, volunteers will also sew millions of plant seeds from a variety of different species, in a bid to eventually turn the area into natural woodland.

"Ever had a hankering for a toe spreading and grooming kit or what about Chinese cupping equipment? These were among the hot ticket items snapped up by bargain hunters during Sydney Airport's first-ever on-line lost property auction, which was raised $154,000 for a range of charities. More than 2000 items went under the hammer including the expected late model cameras, smartphones and tablets and then there were more unconventional items; including the Asian remedial massage equipment, microwave ovens, ukuleles, olive oil cans and even a toe maintenance pack for $59. There were countless bargains to be had, with bidding beginning at just $1 for most, including three GHD (hair straightening equipment) which went for $240. Feeling a little tense leading into the festive season? Chinese cupping kits were a popular piece snapped up by bargain hunters during Sydney Airport's lost property auction. These went for $36 . Toe grooming kits were among the hot auction items at Sydney Airport's first on-line lost property auction . $120 was the hammer price for this Ukulele left behind by a plane passenger and sold on auction . All types of musical instruments are found under seats in terminals or in the food courts of the airport . GHDs and hair straighteners were hot ticket items in the on-line auction by Sydney Airport which has raised more than $150,000 for charities ahead of the Christmas period . These Alpaca quilts look like they'd be hard to miss but they were by their owner and were subsequently sold via on-line auction for $320 . Watches of all varieties are retrieved and handed in by airport staff . 'We would like to thank the public for supporting the auction, our auction house reported website traffic 20 times higher than normal during the auction period,' Sydney Airport chief executive officer Kerrie Mather said. The auction was divided into six categories, with a viewing day ahead of time allowing the public to inspect the items for sale. All pieces were unreserved, with proceeds pledged to Sydney Airport’s community program. Chinese Cupping Kit $36 . Mirage Grommit Surfboard $52 .

'This year, we supported a range of charities and community groups in both our local area as well as nationally and we’re looking forward to announcing more next year,' Ms Mather said. Items left at the airport are logged into a system and stored at the airport for two months to give owners the opportunity to claim their goods or where items are clearly labelled, Sydney Airport endeavours to reunite them with their owners. However, for items which remain unclaimed, Sydney Airport places them in the lost property sale. Another on-line auction to sell items not collected in this year’s sale will be held early next year, with the proceeds also earmarked for charity. All of the 1500 plus items which went under the hammer had been handed in as lost property from the T1 international and T2 domestic terminals. 'They come from all over the place, but the main places where things are lost are in the food courts, at terminals and at security checkpoints where people forget things in the trays,' Sydney Airport Communications Manager Tracy Ong said. 'There were golf clubs, some brand new iPads, even two four-litre tines of olive oil, microwave ovens, induction cook tops, rice cookers, designer shoes, sunglasses and perfumes and a coffee machine.' Jewellery of varying quality are part of the on-line auction held for charity . You would think a bike would be hard to forget right? Bikes, tennis racquets, surfboards are all among the wide variety of forgotten items which went up for grabs in the auction which raised $154,000 . There were countless kids items including scooters and mini skateboards . Top draw golfing equipment was part of the 12 month bounty collected by Sydney Airport officials . A Grommit Surfboard was one of the bargains to be had at just $52 . Top quality cameras are featured regularly among the lost property found around Sydney Airports terminals . The Airport's Corporate Affairs GM, Sally Fielke said: 'Close to 38 million passengers travelled through Sydney Airport last year from all over the world and the items left at the airport reflect this diversity.' Ms Fielke said that last year's charity raised over $130,000 for the Salvation Army and the Australian Kookaburra Kids Foundation, which supports children living in families affected by mental illness. 'While we make every effort to reunite the thousands of lost items that are left at Sydney Airport each year with their owners, unfortunately hundreds of items are left unclaimed,' Ms Fielke added.","Toe grooming equipment tickle the fancy of on-line bidders .

"Two thug brothers are the first in the UK to be banned from their own home after new laws were introduced to clamp down on neighbours from hell. Balbir Ginda Ram, 46, and Surjit Ginda Ram, 44, of Newcombe Road, Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, have been evicted from their £93,000 privately-owned terraced property after a string of complaints from residents. Neighbours claimed the brothers' home was being used as a drug den which was attracting addicts to the area. Brothers Balbir and Surjit Ginda Ram have both been evicted from their house (pictured) in the Handsworth Wood area of Birmingham under a new anti-social behaviour law following complaints from neighbours . The brothers have been causing problems on the street for several years with neighbours complaining that the situation had become 'significantly worse' in the last 12 months. Police confirmed the pair have both been fined on several occasions for being drunk and disorderly. One of the brothers was also convicted of allowing the property to be used for heroin misuse in 2013. Over a six-month period police and the local council compiled a damning dossier of evidence which was presented to Birmingham Magistrates Court on November 14. The brothers were prosecuted under the new Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, which came into force in October. As a result Magistrates have now banned them from entering their home for three months. Yesterday  the run-down property was sealed with steel shutters boarding up the door and windows. A blue sign was strung on the front of the house which stated: 'Evicted. Anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated in Birmingham.' Now, anyone who attempts to enter the terraced house in the next three months will automatically be guilty of an offence and will be brought before the courts. Councillor James McKay (pictured) praised the commitment of staff from Birmingham City Council and West Midlands Police and local residents for taking a stand against the two brothers . Sergeant Nin Rattu, from West Midlands Police, said: 'We've worked closely with Birmingham City Council to resolve this problem as swiftly as possible. 'Despite many attempts by officers to help the brothers to change their ways, their behaviour did not improve. 'The impact on the community became so great that we had no choice other than to apply to the courts for a closure order and move them on. 'Such an order not only brings respite to the community but also allows the residents to make positive changes to their lives. 'PC Lampitt will continue to closely monitor the situation and, if further problems arise, will tackle them immediately.' Under the new powers, if the police or council are satisfied that a particular property is causing nuisance to neighbours, a notice can be served which limits access to the property for a specified period of time. The court can then support that notice by issuing a closure order for a period of three months which bans all access to the property. Councillor James McKay, cabinet member of social cohesion, equalities and community safety at Birmingham City Council, said: 'I praise the commitment of staff from both Birmingham City Council and West Midlands Police and local residents for taking a stand in this case. 'We will continue to work in partnership with the police to use closure orders against any person who causes nuisance behaviour in this way to ensure our communities remain safe places to live.' The brothers are currently being housed in temporary council accommodation until the end of the three month ban. Neighbours living close to the Ram brothers on Newcombe Road spoke of their relief at the pair being evicted. One, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said: 'It's an early Christmas present for us on this street. 'People in this area work hard, no one has much money but most are families with young kids. These two have been a cancer in this area. 'The drug dealing and nightly visitors to the house makes living here almost unbearable. 'It's a pity they will only be gone for three months but at least it's a start.' Sultama Begum, 41, a house wife who lives opposite with her husband and three children, said: 'I have been here about 24 years and they have been here most of that time. 'We had lots of problems with them bringing prostitutes round and dealing drugs. 'All the time, you could see women coming up to the door and then leaving again. 'Day by day it had been getting worse. When they first came here one of them had a wife. 'The men were loud and sometimes you would see them screaming in the street with people. 'The police would often go round to his house but I don't think they would usually go in. They were scum. 'I remember one time the police came and broke down the front door a couple of years ago, and there was lots of screaming and shouting on the street. That was one of the worst times.' Mother-of-four Parveen Hussain, 39, said: 'I have been here for nearly 10 years, and with them here it has not made it a nice place to live. 'We pay our taxes and are working, and trying to live our normal lives but early in the morning sometimes they would already be drunk and would have women coming over. 'They had no consideration for the atmosphere of the community. 'They have been raided twice and it is such a concern because I have daughters as well. 'I have two boys and two girls, and one of my boys is 17, but obviously I don't want him hanging around with these local lads and getting into drugs. 'Those men have destroyed a lot of people's lives by getting them into drugs. 'They never said much to us because they knew we lived here, but for the last year-and-a-half the police have taken it very seriously, because I have been complaining for a long time. Police and the local council compiled a damning dossier of evidence which was presented to Birmingham Magistrates Court (pictured) - magistrates have now banned the brothers from the house for three months . 'It was just dreadful, at 3am there would be scuffles and fights and sometimes you could even hear other neighbours shouting at them because it was so horrible. 'There was no peace with them here, but the worst moment was when they were fighting out on the street by my house and I thought they might smash my car or house window. 'I am trying to show my children the proper way to live, to earn a living and be honest, but then these people are just there causing trouble. 'Everything in their life is incorrect, they are selling drugs and being terrible role models. I know people who have left the area because of them, but I can't afford to. 'I think their mother passed away and handed the house on, but they were just wasting away. 'My friend came round to see me once, but as she got out of her car they even offered her drugs, I just couldn't believe it.'","Balbir, 46, and Surjit Ginada Ram, 44, have been evicted under new law .

"To passers-by, the pub’s decorations may seem a little understated. But for those who venture inside, The Hanging Gate more than makes up for it. With 27,000 twinkling lights and 6,000 sparkling baubles, it claims to be the pub with the most Christmas decorations in Britain. The Hanging Gate pub considers itself Britain's most festive public house with more 6,000 baubles and 27,000 lights adorning its dining rooms this Christmas . Everything is held in place with 8,000 metres of wire and 40,000 staples. Mark Thomas, 41, landlord of the pub in Chapel-en-le-Frith, in the Peak District, said: ‘We finished putting them up last week. It took three of the girls three weeks to put everything up. 'It all started twenty five years ago. We started with a good display – but it was nothing like this. Each year we put up a few more things and more customers come. 'There’s different themes and colours in each room. This year we’e got candy canes in the main room, a purple room and an indoor igloo.' Waitress Sophie Parkes-Morgan, 19, who helped put up the decorations, said: 'I spend all day banging my head on the baubles and they get tangled in my hair too. 'But I think they’re amazing. It’s worth it just to see everyone’s faces. 'It normally takes about three or four days to take them all down again. We get quite a lot of snow around here so that can delay things a bit.'

While most come to admire the decorations, some have been known to be eaten by children or be stolen . ‘It’s worth it just to see everyone’s faces. Mr Thomas said: ‘Our customers just love it – from Monday we’re almost fully-booked every day until Christmas.’ He admits to re-using a lot of decorations – but this year topped up with £4,000 of new lights and baubles. All in, he believes there are around £25,000 of decorations. ‘I don’t think there’s another pub that’s even close to what we've got,’ he added. While the majority of diners who flock to the 170-seat restaurant are happy enough to admire the festivities, others can't keep their hands off the dazzling display. 'Children sometimes try to eat the candy canes. And we’ve had a few things pinched in the past.

Chancellor George Osborne, pictured at a Bently Motors factory in Crewe today, hit back at Lib Dem criticism of his spending plans . Mr Osborne used his statement yesterday to reveal the deficit has halved since 2010. But the Office for Budget Responsibility warned only 40 per cent of the cuts needed have been made so far. The Tories have made clear they would seek to balance the books through spending cuts alone, with cutting welfare the top priority. But Mr Clegg has branded the approach 'complete and utter nonsense' and insisted there must also be tax rises. And Mr Cable said he had made 'very, very clear' his opposition to Tory plans to achieve the goal by cutting departmental budgets and welfare, without increasing taxes on the wealthy. The Business Secretary said his Conservative colleagues wanted to cut public spending 'rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable' and their plans were 'simply not realisable'. The Lib Dem criticism triggered a furious response from Mr Osborne. He told Sky News: 'In private, they sign up to all these decisions and then in public they slag them off. But that's for them to explain to you.' Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister missed the Autumn Statement in the Commons yesterday to visit flood defences in Penzance, Cornwall with local MP Andrew George (left) Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had made 'very, very clear' his opposition to Tory plans to achieve the goal by cutting departmental budgets and welfare, without increasing taxes on the wealthy . Mr Osborne also mocked Mr Clegg's decision to visit flood defences in Penzance instead of being in the Commons yesterday. 'He can choose to be anywhere he wants in the country,' Mr Osborne said. Mr Clegg denied trying to distance himself from the measures announced yesterday. Speaking during his weekly phone-in on LBC, he said: 'I've been doing autumn statements and budgets for five years now and sitting dutifully there. And, by the way, of course I have worked on this meticulously for weeks. 'Everything in that Autumn Statement is in there because we have agreed it and I fully support it. 'But, then I had a choice - did I listen to Ed Balls in the House of Commons or did I go out and talk to normal people?' Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts . Spending by government departments will fall to just 12 per cent of GDP. If health, schools and foreign aid are protected, other areas will be severely squeezed . George Osborne clashed with Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys . George Osborne today hit out at the BBC’s ‘hyperbolic’ coverage of spending cuts, accusing the broadcaster of predicting the world would fall in. The Chancellor clashed with Radio 4 Today programme host John Humphrys about questions on the state of the country’s finances. Mr Osborne said: ‘When I woke up this morning and turned on the Today programme I felt like I was listening to a rewind of a tape from 2010. ‘You had BBC correspondents saying Britain is returning to a sort of George Orwell world of The Road to Wigan Pier.’ Orwell’s bleak book chronicled poverty, hunger and social injustice in the north of England in the 1930s. Mr Osborne repeatedly hit back at Humphrys’ ‘nonsense’ questioning, adding: ‘I would have thought the BBC would have learned from the last four years that its totally hyperbolic coverage of spending cuts has not been matched by what has actually happened. ‘I had all that when you interviewed me four years, and has the world fallen in? No it hasn’t. ‘The British economy is growing and the deficit is half what it was when I was doing those interviews.’ Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC of being 'utterly negative' about the government's flagship welfare reforms, and challenged claims by Today present Mishal Husain that it had been ‘dogged’ by problems. Asked why he ever attended the Commons, Mr Clegg replied: 'That's a good question, actually.' Pressed on whether he had 'propped up' the Tories, he said: 'No, it's not propped up, far from it. I've steered it.' He insisted: 'It is a Liberal Democrat Autumn Statement just as much as anything else and this economic recovery wouldn't be happening without the Liberal Democrats. 'And, by the way, all this complete nonsense tittle-tattle about Vince Cable here or Danny Alexander there. What Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and indeed myself have been saying for ages is that we proudly stand together in this coalition Government to sort out the mess created by Ed Balls. 'As for the future, clearly we have a completely different approach to the Conservatives.' Government sources said Mr Cable had 'erupted' during yesterday's Cabinet meeting and told fellow Lib Dems, including Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander, that they had not signed up to the Conservatives' spending plans beyond the general election. Mr Osborne remains committed to balancing the budget – spending less than is raised in tax – by 2017-18. But to do so will require deep spending cuts. Total government spending will fall to just 35.2 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 – the lowest level for 80 years. It marks a dramatic decline from 45.3 per cent in 2009-10, the last year of the Labour government. In the mid-1970s state spending accounted for almost half of the entire economy. Just 40 per cent of the spending cuts needed have been made so far, with the remaining 60 per cent to come in the next five years. The Tories and Lib Dems committed in the Coalition to protecting health, schools and foreign aid spending. It means other departments face much deeper cuts of up to 50 per cent to find the money needed to eradicate the deficit. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects NHS spending to rise from £108.4billion this year to £110.2billion in 2019-20. But spending on unprotected budgets like defence, transport, business and councils will fall from £147.1billion to just £85.6billion. During the decade to 2020, spending per person on unprotected areas will fall from £3,020 to just £1,290. The OBR said: 'The implied cuts... during the next Parliament would pose a significant challenge if they were confirmed as firm policy, one that would be all the greater if existing protections were maintained.'","Chancellor hits back at coalition partners over criticism of spending plans .

"A farmer was killed after his shoe lace became wrapped around a rotating blade and he was dragged into a barley silo. Sheep breeder Jim Sharp, 66, from Lauder in the Scottish Borders, suffered multiple injuries after entering a barley silo which contained several feet of barley. A fatal accident inquiry heard he died at his farm, Newbigging Walls, on March 17 after his boot lace wrapped around the metal auger and he was pulled through. Sheep breeder Jim Sharp, 66, (pictured) suffered multiple injuries after his shoe lace became wrapped around a metal auger after he entered a silo - it is not known how his lace came into contact with the machinery . Mr Sharp was a prominent breeder of Blackface sheep and a former livestock convener of NFU Scotland. He was also a former captain of Melrose Rugby Club. In a statement read out in Selkirk Sheriff Court, Sergeant Graeme Shearer described how he found Mr Sharp's damaged clothing wrapped around the screw. He concluded that a boot lace was the first thing that had become entangled with the rotating blade. Hazel Dobb, an inspector with the Health and Safety Executive, said the electricity supply should have been isolated before the silo was entered to remove the power from the auger. Mr Sharp died after after entering a barley silo, where his boot lace wrapped around the metal auger and he was pulled through - he suffered multiple injuries (file picture of grain auger and tractor filling a grain silo) She added that because Mr Sharp was self-employed with no employees no enforcement action was required. Summing up, procurator fiscal Louise Graham said: 'The cause of the accident is that Mr Sharp appears to have entered the grain silo, but there is no evidence as to why that is the case. 'There may well have been a problem with the sweep auger on that date. 'When in the grain silo, his boot lace became entangled with the sweep auger.' She said it was not known how the lace came into contact with the metal auger. Delivering his determination, Sheriff Peter Paterson said the cause of death was multiple injuries after Mr Sharp's body became entangled with the auger. He made no recommendations. Sheriff Paterson extended his sympathies to Mr Sharp's wife, Obie, and two children who were in court for the 15 minute hearing.","Jim Sharp, 66, suffered multiple injuries after being dragged into the silo .

"The family of a married couple found stabbed to death at their village home have spoken for the first time about their loss. Police launched a murder investigation after Patrick and Gillian Kettyle, who were both in their 50s, died  at their detached property at The Copse in Fetcham, Surrey, shortly after midnight last Thursday. Their family have today said 'our world has been dimmed with their loss' as they spoke of their 'horrendous' ordeal. The family of Patrick and Gillian Kettyle (pictured) who were stabbed to death last week at their home in Fetcham, Surrey, have paid tribute to a 'wonderful couple' and say 'world has been dimmed with their loss' Lithuanian builder, Viktoras Bruzas, 38, who was arrested in nearby Oxshott after the discovery of the bodies, has been charged with two counts of murder. Their deaths had sparked a police search for Bruzas, 38, who was arrested 18 hours later in nearby Oxshott. The self-employed builder, from Walton-on-Thames, appeared at Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday charged with two counts of murder. He had appeared briefly at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court in Redhill, Surrey, on Saturday, where his case was sent straight to the crown court. Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas, 38, (pictured) has been charged with two counts of murder . Judge Christopher Critchlow, Honorary Recorder of Guildford, transferred the case to the Old Bailey in central London. Bruzas, who moved to England in 2008, was remanded in custody. Initial post mortem examinations show the couple died as the result of multiple knife wounds. A weapon was found near their home after detectives began a forensic search of the area. Today, the family of the Kettyles have paid tribute to the couple, who were known as Pat and Gilly. In a statement issued through Surrey Police, the family said: 'On behalf of the family of Patrick and Gillian Kettyle we would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming amount of kindness and support that has been shown to all of us during this most difficult time. 'Our special thanks also go to the paramedics and police. 'Pat and Gilly were a wonderful couple who loved each other dearly.' They added: 'It is true to say that the light in our world has been dimmed with their loss.' Police say Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each other. Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm. He ran the company from his home, while his wife worked as a facilities manager at Cargill Plc in Cobham, Surrey. Bruzas will appear at the Old Bailey in front of Mr Justice Sweeney on December 19. He has been remanded in custody. Police launched an investigation after the couple were found stabbed to death at The Copse in Fetcham, Surrey, (pictured) shortly after midnight last Thursday.

"A father told last night of his anguish and betrayal after discovering a friend had stolen his wife and his identity... and vanished for 25 years. Martyn Foster was left to bring up his two young children alone when his wife Susan went missing in 1988. The trail remained cold until police took a second look at the missing persons inquiry two years ago and traced Mrs Foster 150 miles away in Kent – where she was found living with Mr Foster’s former friend Michael Evans – a wanted paedophile. Michael Evans was due to stand trial for child sex offences in May 1988, when he ran away . At the time his wife had gone missing, Mr Foster did not realise his friend had also vanished. But he began to wonder whether they could be together and his suspicions were confirmed in 2007 when he found out by chance Evans had applied for a passport in his name. Yesterday, Mr Foster spoke of his ordeal after Evans was finally convicted of the historical sex offences for which he had fled justice. Mr Foster, 59, said: ‘In all those years I never once heard from my wife and neither did my children. We had no idea where she was. ‘All I could do was get on with my life, which was very difficult with two children under six.’ Evans – then known as Michael Kime – fled with Susan in May 1988, three weeks before he was due to stand trial for ten child sex offences. Susan Foster, now Evans, ran off with her best friend's husband and left her two young daughters behind . The pair, both now 61, changed their surnames by deed poll to Evans. Mr Foster, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, told how officials missed an opportunity to bring the couple to justice seven years ago. By then, long after suspecting the pair were together, Mr Foster had remarried for a second time. Susan Evans also took her husband's Gibson SG guitar, which was similar to this one owned by the former Beatles star, George Harrison . He applied for a passport to go on holiday with third wife Carole, 63, but was told a document had already been issued in his name. When officials printed off a picture of the man who obtained the passport, Mr Foster confirmed it was Evans. But it appears Passport Office officials failed to report the matter to police, allowing the couple to remain on the run. Lincoln Crown Court heard last month how Evans – who had abandoned a girlfriend and daughter when he fled – worked on farms in Kent picking fruit. He used Mr Foster’s birth and marriage certificates to obtain a passport to travel to Crete to pick olives. He later also obtained a driving licence in Mr Foster’s name. Mr Foster heard nothing about his former wife until a cold case review tracked her to Margate in 2012. Evans was formally arrested the following year. He stood trial for the historical sex offences last month, after the pair had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice from 1988 to December 2013. They will be sentenced next month. After Evans was arrested, his victim made a fresh statement detailing how she was abused by him from the age of eight. Mr Foster believes his wife met Evans while working at a bar, but said he had no inkling they were having an affair. He said: ‘One night Susan told me she was going to a party. We had a babysitter as I was going out to the pub. When I came home she wasn’t back. 'The next morning I realised some of her clothes were gone. 'Whatever Evans has done, she has gone along with him for the last 25 years. I hope they have a nice time in jail.’ Evans’s daughter described her father as a ‘complete monster’. Toni Charlton, 30, said: ‘I was five when he went missing. All I can remember is he put on his big boots and was gone. 'All I would want would be to ask why. Why did you walk out on us, why did you abuse your victim? He is a bad, bad man.’","Martyn Foster's wife Susan disappeared with his best friend in May 1988 .

"One of Britain’s biggest food manufacturers has threatened to stop working with any suppliers who refuse to pay them an annual charge, in a move likened to ‘blackmail’. Premier Foods – the owner of brands such as Mr Kipling, Ambrosia, Bisto and Oxo – has reportedly asked for millions of pounds from suppliers in return for continuing to work with them. According to BBC’s Newsnight, a letter sent by chief executive Gavin Darby told suppliers the firm would ‘now require you to make an investment payment to support our growth’. Scroll down for video . According to BBC Newsnight, Premier Foods boss Gavin Darby (pictured) sent letters to the company's suppliers demanding an 'investment payment' or risk being 'nominated for de-list' When a supplier raised questions about the payments, another member of Premier’s staff replied: ‘We are looking to obtain an investment payment from our entire supply base and unfortunately those who do not participate will be nominated for de-list.’ One of the company’s suppliers, Bob Horsley – who has had a contract with Ambrosia in Devon for more than ten years – said he was ‘taken aback’ to receive the letter. He added: ‘I really couldn’t see how they could be asking for money … I think it’s like blackmail as what they are saying is unless you pay this money you can’t do the work.’ He has decided not to pay, risking losing the contract, and said: ‘I’m just a layman but I can’t see how that is right.’ Another businessman said Premier had previously asked them for more than £70,000, but added: ‘I’d never pay anyone for work.’ Another said: ‘It’s like a gun held to your head.’ In October, the company reported a worse than expected 4.7 per cent fall in sales for the third quarter of the year, with branded goods down 4.1 per cent. Premier Foods owns popular food brands such as Mr Kipling, Ambrosia, Bisto and Oxo. Supplier Bob Horsley, who has worked for Ambrosia for more than a decade, is refusing to pay up (file image) Mr Darby’s letter to suppliers stated: ‘I understand that this approach may lead to some questions. However, it is important that we take the right steps now to support our future growth.’ Competition law states that in some cases, the so-called ‘pay to stay’ approach can be illegal. But Premier Foods is confident its scheme is within the rules. A spokesman told the BBC: ‘The programme requires our suppliers to make an annual investment to help fund our growth plans. ‘In return, our suppliers benefit from opportunities to secure a larger slice of our current business. They also stand to gain as our business grows in the future. ‘In the current challenging environment, the support of all of our suppliers is crucial and we have had a positive response from many who are actively engaging in building a new partnership with us.’ However, Labour’s business spokesman Toby Perkins said: ‘Where unfair practices emerge, the Government should be willing to take action.’","Food giant demands 'investment payments' from suppliers, it is claimed .

"Vladimir Putin defiantly compared Western powers with Hitler yesterday as he defended his aggressive foreign policy. In a belligerent and provocative state-of-the-nation address, the Russian president accused the West of ‘trying to build a new Iron Curtain’. He claimed Russia was asserting its ‘sovereignty and national pride’ over its dealings with neighbouring Ukraine – and said his country’s survival depended on it. Scroll down for video . In a defiant speech, Russian president Vladimir Putin defended his country's action in Ukraine during his annual state-of-the-nation address at Moscow's Grand Kremlin Palace . With his eyes closed, Russian prime minister Dmitri Medvedev appears to be having a nap during Putin's speech . Hundreds of cabinet ministers, politicians and community leaders gathered to listen to Putin as he outlined his plans for Russia's future . Claiming the West wanted to see a Yugoslav-style ‘collapse and dismemberment’ of Russia, he said: ‘This has not happened. We did not allow it. ‘Hitler also failed when, with his hateful ideas, he was going to destroy Russia, throw us back behind the Urals. Everyone should remember how it ended.’ But while most of his audience looked on adoringly,  Russian prime minister Dmitri Medvedev, appeared to use the occasion to have a little snooze. Medvedev, who as a former president, has given state-of-the-nation speeches himself, was also spotted yawning as Putin insisted he would not change course despite the threat of diplomatic isolation. The comparison with the Nazi leader may have been a reference to David Cameron’s own attempt to compare Mr Putin with Hitler earlier this year. They also follow comments by Prince Charles in May, in which he made comparisons between Hitler and the Russian leader while visiting Second World War veterans in Canada – sparking a furious reaction from the Kremlin. A man watches a broadcast of Putin's defiant speech. The Russian leader insisted his country would not change course despite the threat of diplomatic isolation . The speech was broadcast live across Russia. Putin accused the west of 'pure cynicism' over the Ukraine crisis in apparent reference to sanctions against his country . Yesterday Mr Putin used his address to justify Russia’s dealings with Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea – which he described as ‘our Temple Mount’, a reference to the holy site in Jerusalem sacred to both Jews and Muslims. More than 4,300 people have been killed in the conflict with separatists in eastern Ukraine, which the West and the Ukrainian government say is fuelled by Russian arms and money. But Mr Putin insisted that Russia was merely defending its own existence from foreign aggressors and warned: ‘No one will succeed in defeating Russia militarily.’ He added: ‘If for a number of European countries national pride is a long-forgotten term and sovereignty is too much of a luxury, for Russia real state sovereignty is an absolutely indispensable condition of its existence. ‘I want to stress: either we will be sovereign or we will dissolve in the world. And, of course, other nations must understand this as well.’ Mr Putin then raised the spectre of a new Cold War, saying: ‘We will stand up for the diversity of the world. ‘We will deliver truth to people abroad... And we will do this even in those cases when governments of some countries are trying to build around Russia something next to a new Iron Curtain.’ Despite the Kremlin’s stand-off with the West over Ukraine, Mr Putin said Russia would not be drawn into a costly arms race. He said: ‘Our army is modern and battle-worthy. As they say now, it is polite but menacing. We have quite enough power, will and courage to defend our freedom.’ Striking a more liberal note in the speech, he also announced measures to spur the flagging economy, which has been hit by tough Western sanctions over Russia’s actions in Ukraine and is forecast to go into recession next year. He suggested a series of measures including the temporary lifting of tax checks for companies with a clean record and no taxation on offshore money returning to Russia.","A defiant Putin accused opponents of trying to erect a new Iron Curtain .

"The 'one millionth Chevrolet Corvette', which was sucked into a sinkhole that opened up beneath Kentucky's National Corvette Museum earlier this year, is gearing up for restoration. As many as 25 workers will restore the vehicle over the next six months or 'however long it takes to make sure it's done right', said David Bolognino, director of GM Design Fabrication at the Warren, Michigan facility where the car was displayed on Wednesday. The white vehicle, which was constructed in 1992, was the one millionth Corvette to roll off the assembly line and is worth more than $750,000, according to Car and Driver. It was one of eight luxury cars that plunged into a massive 30-foot sinkhole that opened beneath the museum in Bowling Green in February. Of those, just three can be restored. Getting a makeover: The 1,000,000th Chevrolet Corvette, pictured on Wednesday, is about to undergo pricey restoration after it was sucked into a sinkhole at Kentucky's National Corvette Museum earlier this year . Flashback: The car was one of eight historic vehicles that fell into the 30ft sinkhole in February (pictured) On Wednesday, General Motors and Chevrolet showed off the car at the special facility in Warren ahead of its restoration, which experts hope they can complete by next June. But it won't be an easy task - the 1992 car is just old enough that it will be hard to find or create replacement parts, CNN reported. It is estimated that the car suffered around $30,000 in damage. General Motors will cover the cost of restoring the vehicle. Expert restorers will also be forced to preserve as much as they can of the salvaged car so that it remains as true to its original form as possible to 'preserve as much authenticity as possible'. 'The parts we have a choice on, we will always err on repairing them,' Bolognino said, the Detroit News reported. Challenge: The car, a 1992 model, suffered $30,000 worth of damage in the freak accident . A look inside: The car's windscreen was completely destroyed and it suffered broken lights and fenders . The search is on: The car is just old enough that the  team of 25 workers might struggle to find parts . Some work to do: David Bolognino, the director of the Design Center Fabrication Operations for General Motors, is pictured beside the car, which will take around six months to complete . The car, which is still covered in dirt and gravel, suffered heavy damage to its rear suspension and its front fender and the windshield was completely smashed. It also suffered a broken taillight on the rear of the car and the whole vehicle is covered in scratches. Still, it went relatively unscathed compared to other vehicles that were reduced to metal skeletons. The car is also the most valuable of the three cars that can be saved. Another, a 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil, was recently finished. A third vehicle that can be fixed, a 1962 black Corvette, is too old for General Motors to handle and will handpick a team of specialists to put it back together. Five further cars were completely destroyed and cannot be saved: a 1984 PPG pace car, a 1993 ruby red 40th anniversary Corvette, a 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette, the 2009 white '1.5 millionth Corvette' and a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder. Unbelievable: Of the eight cars that fell into the sinkhole at the Kentucky museum, just three can be salvaged . Massive task: The sinkhole is now being filled and should be completed by July. Since the freak accident, it has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, with the number of visitors rocketing since February . Of those that plunged into the hole, only the 1 Millionth Corvette, the 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil and the 1962 Black Corvette could be saved. As well as the restorations, a team is also working to fill the sinkhole in a $3.2 million project which is set to be completed by July. The hole opened up when the museum was closed, and no one was injured. And despite losing valuable cars, the museum has turned the freak accident into a money maker after a video of the incident was shared on YouTube and viewed millions of times. The sinkhole became a popular attraction. People gawking at the hole revved up attendance and revenue at the museum, an hour north of Nashville, Tennessee. The museum cashed in by selling sinkhole-themed T-shirts, videos, postcards, and jars filled with sinkhole dirt and tiny pieces of car parts. The hole will be filled completely with rock, then workers will drill into it to install steel casings, museum officials said. Crews will pour grout into the casings, creating a steel and concrete pillar to provide additional support under the floor. The museum now plans to memorialize the sinkhole in exhibits. Glory days: The car was the one millionth Corvette to roll of the assembly line and was donated to the National Corvette Museum by General Motors. It has been valued at more than $750,000 .","The car - the one millionth Corvette ever made - fell into a 30ft sinkhole that opened up under Kentucky's National Corvette Museum in February .

"An 11-year-old schoolboy has been left scarred for life after being bit more than ten times by a six-stone Staffie while he played football with his stepbrother. Kyle Rowan was having a kick-about in a children's play area in Earby, Lancashire, when the dog  jumped over a ramshackle barbed wire fence from a nearby garden and pinned him to the ground. The dog, known as Hooch, began mauling the young boy, before viciously biting him on his arms, hands and leg. Kyle Rowan, 11 (left) has been left scarred for life after being mauled by a Staffie called Hooch (right) while he was having a kick-about with his stepbrother in Earby, Lancashire . After hearing the young boy's screams, the dog's 30-year-old owner Steven Hant managed to pull the animal away from Kyle. But the 11-year-old was left with multiple wounds, including bites on his nostrils and right ear and a total of ten puncture wounds to his right shoulder and arm, hand and legs. Kyle was so seriously injured from the attack that he was forced to take four weeks off school. Some of the wounds also became badly infected. Hant has now been banned from keeping a dog for two years after admitting owning a dog dangerously out of control. He was given a 12-month community order with 200 hours unpaid work when he appeaed at Pennine Magistrates' Court, Burnley. He was also ordered to pay Kyle £260 compensation. Today, Kyle's mother Gill Clark, 36, said her son was lucky to be alive but had been left frightened by the attack. The young boy was left with a total of ten wounds to his right shoulder and arm, hand and legs after being savaged by the dog . His injuries, including to his arm (left) and shoulder (right), meant Kyle had to take four weeks off school . She said: 'I think my son is very lucky to be here. He could have died and that is very frightening. If it was someone smaller than Kyle it could have been so much worse. He is very lucky. 'It's been an emotional time for us. He still has to see the doctor and he may need plastic surgery on his right index finger as it goes all tingly and he can't feel it. 'When it happened he wouldn't go to his grandma's who has a dog and when he sees any dog you can see he is fearful.' Ms Clark also criticised Hant for failing to apologise for the incident, saying: 'If that was my dog I would have been over and apologised straight away but we've not had anything at all - I don't think very much of the dog's owner at all. 'He could have prevented this if he had taken precautions and had a secure fence especially living so close to a children's play area. It's about being a responsible dog owner. Kyle sustained the wounds after the Staffie pinned him to the floor. Some of the cuts became infected . The schoolboy had to be rushed to hospital after the attack in September last year . 'You don't expect this to happen on a children's play area where there are so many children playing. 'Kyle has still got the scars and has been really down and withdrawn since it happened and he has only been out to play a few times. Steven Hant, 30, admitted owning a dog dangerously out of control . 'He had to have four weeks off school because of the attack. 'He'd only been out half an hour when it happened and the next thing I knew was all the banging at the door and Kyle was covered in blood. He was in that much shock he couldn't speak - his face was covered in blood.' Speaking about the attack, Kyle addedd: 'I was just playing at the park playing football with my mates and the dog just jumped the fence. 'I saw it running round the corner at the last minute and it just jumped up and stood on two legs and took me to the ground and started biting me. 'I didn't feel any pain just shock. I couldn't scream I was very frightened. My friends tried kicking it. I was trying to kick it and fight it off and trying to run away but it dragged me down. 'I was wearing a bright yellow Brazil shirt and you couldn't see any of the yellow because it was covered in blood. 'The shirt had to be cut off. It was probably the most frightening thing that has happened to me.' During the court case, Dominic Howell told how the victim was playing football at tea-time with friends and his 12-year-old stepbrother when the dog escaped from Hant's aunt house where it was kept in the back yard. He told the court: 'It was a bit of a ramshackle sort of fence. 'The dog either jumped over it, or for whatever reason, got out and mauled the victim. It jumped at him, knocked him to the ground and bit him.' Mr Howell told the court that, when Hant was interviewed, he accepted responsibility for the dog and for the attack. Kyle's mother Gill Clark, 36, said her son was lucky to be alive but criticised Hant for failing to apologise for his dog's actions . Hant said that, when he had been alerted to the incident, he had gone and restrained the dog, the court was told. He admitted the fence was probably inadequate but said the dog had never escaped before. Defending, Graeme Tindall told the court that the incident had come 'completely out of the blue'. Hooch, who has since been put down, broke this this fence while in the back garden at Hant's aunt's house . He said: 'I think it's agreed by everybody that this, regrettably, has come completely out of the blue. 'He had had the dog since it was eight weeks old and it was 14-months-old when the incident happened.' He also told the court that the dog had never shown any aggression towards Hant's 16 nephews and nieces, who are aged between one and 16. He said: 'He has to concede the efforts he made to secure the garden were inadequate. 'The dog having escaped, he did everything right after that. He pulled the dog off and made efforts to make sure it was secure. 'He himself has telephoned the police. He asked them to take the dog away. His understanding is the dog was destroyed on that day.' After the case Hant, a van driver, said: 'I do want to apologise but the police say I shouldn't otherwise I could be accused of intimidation. 'It was me who rang the police to get him put down. We heard screaming on the day but we thought it was kids playing, we heard it again and I ran out. 'I jumped on the dog and told the rest of the kids to take him to his mum's and ring an ambulance and then I shouted to my my aunt to ring the police and I wanted him put down. We did it that day. 'We think Hooch has gone for the ball. I've got nieces and nephews one to 16-years-old and we have never had any problems before. 'He was a big dog, and did bark if you came near the house but he was playful too. We gave him bones from the butchers but never gave him them raw so it's not as if they have had raw food. 'We're not belittling what has happened, we felt that everyone was thinking we didn't give a damn which we did. It's a little kid at the end of the day and for that I'm very sorry.'","Kyle Rowan was playing in the children's play area in Earby, Lancashire .

"A tiny piglet had to be saved from the waves after it escaped onto a beach and swam 150 yards out to sea. The RSPCA was called after the baby pig became stuck at the top of a cliff above Covehithe beach in Suffolk. By the time officers arrived, the three-week old animal had tumbled down to the beach and, when rescuers approached, made a dash into the waves. Saved his bacon: A tiny piglet had to be saved from the waves by RSPCA inspector Jason Finch after it escaped onto a beach and swam 150 yards out to sea . This little piggie went swimming: The RSPCA was called after the baby pig became stuck at the top of a cliff above Covehithe beach in Suffolk, before tumbling down to the shoreline . RSPCA inspector Jason Finch said he made his way down to the beach to try and catch it, but it panicked and turned on its trotters and ran into the sea. He said: 'I couldn't believe it when he darted straight into the sea like that. 'He was completely unfazed by the bubbling surf and started diving up and down among the waves for ages - upwards of 10 minutes. He became a tiny black dot in the distance and at one point I thought he was heading to France. 'I was just wondering whether I would have to dive in myself when he started swimming in the more shallow end of the surf, so I just ran in and grabbed him. 'He was safe and sound and in good health - in fact he did not even seem puffed out. Far fitter than many I know.' The piglet, which weighed around 5lbs, swam out for 150 yards before turning round and heading back to shore as darkness was falling. Ahoy there!: The piglet, which weighed around 5lbs, swam out for 150 yards before turning round and heading back to shore as darkness was falling . Mr Finch was then able wade into the surf and pick it up before returning the porker to staff at Church Farm, Covehithe. The pig escaped from an arc-shaped sty where it was being reared along with its brothers and sisters in a field. It then slipped under an electric wire fence and trotted 200 yards to the cliff where it got stuck before it fell to the beach. Gill Middleditch, the wife of farmer Roger Middleditch, said: 'The piglets normally stay in their arcs with their mothers, but they sometimes climb out. 'They are mischievous little monkeys and on rare occasions they do go on walkabout. They usually stay fairly close to their mothers, but they can slip under the wire fence. 'This one obviously had quite an adventure and we are very grateful to the RSPCA for bringing it back.'","RSPCA called to rescue baby pig from top of a cliff above beach in Suffolk .

"David Moyes insists he is over his sacking by Manchester United and has declared: 'I am ready to return to management.' The Scot lasted less than a year at Old Trafford and was sacked in April with the club lying in seventh place in the Premier League. Having been out of work for six months though, the former Everton manager told the BBC's Football Focus   he wants to get back in the dugout.

Reflecting on his time at United, Moyes reiterated his stance that he was not given enough time in the job. 'I got the job and I expected it to be a six-year plan,' he said.

"A woman died after waiting almost two hours for an ambulance after she collapsed in the street. Seven increasingly desperate 999 calls were made before paramedics arrived to take Aziza Bano Bhatti, 57, to hospital. But by then it was too late. The housewife suffered a heart attack in the ambulance and was pronounced dead shortly after she arrived at hospital – almost two hours after the initial emergency call. Last night it emerged that her family had made a formal complaint to ambulance chiefs amid fears that Mrs Bhatti could have been saved if crews had arrived sooner. Seven desperate 999 calls were made before paramedics arrived to take Aziza Bano Bhatti, 57, to hospital (file picture) An investigation has also been launched into the incident in Liverpool on Sunday evening. At the opening of an inquest into her death yesterday, coroner Andre Rebello was told that Mrs Bhatti was found collapsed close to her home in Wavertree, Liverpool, by a passer-by at around 6.35pm. The helper called for an ambulance twice – firstly at about 6.50pm and secondly because they were worried the paramedics were taking too long. A passing police community support officer, who was on patrol, also came to assist Mrs Bhatti, who was originally from Pakistan and suffered from a serious heart condition and diabetes. The court heard she was put in the recovery position and was semi-conscious and breathing while she waited for help to arrive. The PCSO then called a further five times to the ambulance control room before a rapid response vehicle arrived at 8.02pm. It was another 38 minutes – a full 110 minutes after the first call – that an ambulance finally arrived and took Mrs Bhatti to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. But she suffered a heart attack and never recovered. Coroner Andre Rebello said Mrs Bhatti’s health problems were the ‘probable cause’ of her collapse, but admitted that the family would be worried she could have survived if the ambulance had arrived sooner. Mrs Bhatti was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital (pictured), where she was pronounced dead shortly after arriving . ‘What we don’t know is whether an ambulance arriving earlier could have facilitated appropriate treatment that could have made a difference,’ the coroner said. ‘Heart disease and diabetes could be fatal at any time, but clearly there has to be an investigation to find out why it was given the priority it was. ‘The family will be concerned to find out if an ambulance arriving earlier would have made a difference.’ Ambulance calls are categorised as either red or green, with red being the most serious and having target response times of eight minutes. Green incidents have response targets of between 30 minutes and four hours. A spokesman for the North West Ambulance Service confirmed that an investigation had begun into the incident but said they were unable to comment further.","Aziza Bano Bhatti, 57, got to hospital almost two hours after she collapsed .

"A serial burglar dubbed 'Safari Boy' after being sent on a trip of a lifetime to Africa in a failed bid to stop his offending as a boy was jailed today for his latest offence - breaking into an elderly widower's home. Mark Hook, now 38, was taken on an 88-day safari to Egypt and Kenya at public expense when he was just 17 - sparking a national outcry which included condemnation in the House of Commons by the then prime minister John Major. But it proved to be a waste of taxpayers' money as Hook has continued to offend ever since. Today Gloucester crown court heard that in April this year, he smashed his way into 86-year-old Frederick Talbot's remote home near Dursley, ransacked it and stole property and cash, including photographs of sentimental value. Mark Hook, pictured left in 1995 - shortly after his controversial safari trip by social services - and right, in a police mugshot in 2012. He was jailed today by Gloucester crown court for 22 months after breaking into the home of an 86-year-old widower . Judge William Hart told Hook, from Gloucester: 'You targeted an elderly man's remote home at night after smashing the burglar alarm off the wall. 'Your victim, who has been burgled before, can hardly sleep happily in his bed again under those circumstances. 'You have a chequered criminal history and committed your first burglary when you were only 14 or 15 years of age.' Hook, back row second from left, poses with a group in Egypt at the Temple of Karnak while enjoying the £7,000 safari to try and stop his offending in 1993 . Prosecuting barrister Julian Kesner said: 'The day before Frederick Talbot returned from holiday to his home, the defendant jemmied his way into the property through a bathroom window using a screwdriver. 'An untidy search was made of every room and drawers were left open and cupboards ransacked. 'A bag containing £120 in £2 coins, £26 from the victim's grand-daughter's money box, cheque books, bank cards, a wallet, a watch, Mr Talbot's national service medal, old passports and photographs were taken. 'Tokens for an OAP to use on buses were left behind, but the defendant's fingerprints were found on them. 'The victim is naturally upset and unnerved and fears the burglar will come back again. 'Mr Talbot lives alone as his wife died four years ago after the couple had been married for 59 years. 'Fortunately the old passports and photographs were recovered in a car nearby which the defendant had attempted to hot-wire after the burglary. 'Hook has a large number of previous convictions - more than 100 - including seven burglaries.' Defending solicitor Nicola Colwall said: 'Damage was minimal and my client denies that he brought the screwdriver with him - he says he found it in the garden shed. 'All the items of sentimental value were recovered. Hook's innocent smile as a child gave little indication of the terror he would inflict on his victims over the years . 'He has had a troubled, miserable childhood, was in care from the age of 11 and in custody when he was 16. 'But although he was offending prolifically in his 20s now, at the age of 38, he is beginning to feel the weight of his background. 'His feelings of guilt and remorse are growing, he is tired and ashamed of himself and having nightmares about the things he has done. 'He also has an eight-year-old daughter and needs to feel responsibility for her.' Judge Hart jailed Hook for 22 months. During the safari trip in 1993, Hook visited the Pyramids and the Sphinx, cruised the Nile and went to a big game park. Hook first appeared in court in 1991 when he admitted taking a car without consent. In 1993, he was sent on the 88-day holiday by social services to show him how worse-off people in the world coped without resorting to crime. The trip caused a national furore and was denounced by critics who said it would not reform the teenager. John Major, the then prime minister, told MPs no offenders would be sent on trips abroad again. Referring to the £7,000 trip after a previous hearing, Mr Talbot said: 'Holiday or no holiday he will obviously never change his ways.' Hook claims to be a descendant of Private Henry Hook, who won the Victoria Cross fighting the Zulus at Rorke's Drift in 1879. The battle inspired the film Zulu in which Private Hook, who is buried in Churcham, near Gloucester, was played by James Booth. Ratboy . A notorious criminal who gained the nickname 'Ratboy' for his habit of hiding in ventilation shafts as a child burglar was back behind bars in August 2013 after returning to his old ways. Anthony Kennedy, then 34, made headlines nationwide as a baby-faced schoolboy who terrorised the Byker Wall estate in Newcastle in the 1990s. He would raid homes and then escape police by crawling through heating ducts and stairwells while on the run from council care. A life of crime: Anthony Kennedy, left, was jailed for burglary again, in 2013. He gained the nickname 'Ratboy' for his habit of hiding in ventilation shafts to escape as a young criminal in the 1990s, right . Kennedy had his first police caution at the age of 10. By 13 he had committed 55 offences and run away from care 37 times. In 2007, Kennedy claimed to have given up a life of crime after finding love and religion. He and his partner moved to Blyth, Northumberland, to have a fresh start. He said at the time: 'I believe it’s important to treat others how you would like to be treated yourself and to have respect for other people. 'When I was Ratboy, those were things I didn’t care about.' But Kennedy was jailed again after he admitted committing two burglaries in Blyth in May. He was sentenced to three years in jail at Newcastle Crown Court. 'Demons from hell' Two young brothers dubbed 'demons from hell' after making their neighbours' lives a misery are still getting into trouble with the law nearly a decade later. Ricky and Daniel Oakley were both given anti-social behaviour orders in 2006 when they were just 11 and 12. It was hoped the ASBOs would help put a stop to their loutish behaviour which included throwing knives, starting fires and letting down tyres in their hometown of Park Village in Wolverhampton. Asbros: Ricky (left) and Danny Oakley (right) have both racked up a string of convictions since they were handed ASBOs in 2006 . But fast-forward eight years and it seems not much has changed, with both brothers - who were once nicknamed the 'Asbros' - having racked up a string of criminal convictions. At the age of 20, Daniel Oakley, was sentenced in April to a 12-month probation order at Walsall Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to burglary. He was also ordered to pay £570. It is his fourth criminal conviction to date. Meanwhile his brother Ricky, two years his junior, has been in and out of prison six times since he and his brother were first given two-year ASBOs in 2006. It demanded the pair behave or face five years in a young offenders' institution but both brothers now admit they just saw the ASBOs as badges of honour. 'Demons from hell': Daniel Oakley, 12, and Ricky Oakley, 11, pictured soon after getting their ASBOs in 2006. They are both shown with injuries after Ricky put a can of foam on to a bonfire and it exploded . The boys claim they grew up in a troubled household. Abandoned by their mother at a young age and left in the sole care of their father, they said they became used to committing antisocial behaviour and crime. During their reign of terror in their small community, the brothers often set things alight, which on one occasion resulted in the pair both suffering severe burns after Ricky placed a can of foam on a fire and it exploded. At 10 years old, the boys’ petty crimes escalated to burglaries and robberies. But since 2006, Danny claims he has tried to get his life back on track. He said: 'I’m well known for bad things. I don’t want to be known for that anymore. All I can do is apologise for what I’ve done. 'I’m now just thinking positive. I’m going to get myself somewhere to live and I’m going to get a job and start working.' His brother, however, doesn't share his concerns. Ricky, who was released from Brinsford prison, Wolverhampton, in March, said: 'I’m not bothered about going back [to jail]. It doesn’t bother me because I’m not scared of jail. 'That’s why I go back so many times because I’m not scared.'","Mark Hook was taken on 88-day safari to Egypt and Kenya at public expense when he was 17 .

"These babies rescued from human traffickers have been put up for adoption after being neglected by their parents. The 11 children, including six boys and five girls, were part of a group of 21 saved from traffickers by officials in Kaiyuan in south-western China's Yunnan Province. Only 10 of the group of 21 were re-united with their original parents. Now, four months later, local officials have decided to offer them to foster parents in the hope of giving them a normal life. One of the 11 babies that has been put up for adoption after being rescued from human traffickers in China . An unwanted baby lies in a cot in a nursery in Kaiyuan in south-western China's Yunnan Province . Child trafficking is a deep-rooted problem in China with critics blaming the one-child policy as creating a thriving underground market for buying children, and also women . This baby was rescued from traffickers by officials in Kaiyuan in south-western China's Yunnan Province . The babies' families were allegedly paid up to 10,000 yuan (£1,033), and the infants were in turn sold for at least 10 times that sum, up to 140,000 yuan (£14,505) Child trafficking has been a long-standing problem in China, which critics say is created by the country's sinister one-child policy. The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold, aborted or abandoned. Poverty fuels the trade, while illicit profits tempts traffickers, resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers. In this particular case, police arrested 32 people accused of involvement in the trafficking. They said their suspicions were first aroused in August last year when officers spotted a middle-aged couple with non-local accents preparing to board a train at Kunming, the largest city in the Yunnan Province, with an infant who appeared to be only a few weeks old. After questioning, the couple admitted to buying the baby from traffickers. Police later uncovered a network buying babies from remote villages and transporting them to willing buyers. The babies' families were allegedly paid up to 10,000 yuan (£1,033), and the infants were in turn sold for at least 10 times that sum, up to 140,000 yuan (£14,505). It is unlikely the babies will struggle to find an adopted home given the huge demand for babies in the country. So far, 100 families have applied for a child - which is almost 10 couples for every baby. Child abduction and trafficking is widespread in China, where strict population control rules have encouraged the traditional bias for sons . The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold, aborted or abandoned . There is an underground criminal network in China which deals in kidnapped or bought baby boys, as well as baby girls destined to be brides attracting rich dowries in sparsely populated regions . Despite the criticism levelled at it, China has said it has intensified the crackdown on kidnapping of children . So far, 100 families have applied for a child - which is almost 10 couples for every baby in the nursery . Despite this, China has trumpeted the success of an intensified crackdown on the kidnapping and sale of children recently. In 2011, police said they had rescued more than 13,000 abducted children and 23,000 women over the past two years or so. A year later, Chinese authorities made one of their biggest sweeps and broke up two major child trafficking gangs, arresting more than 800 suspects across the country and freeing 181 children.","11 babies were part of a group of 21 saved from traffickers by officials .

"General Sir Walter Congreve VC. Sir Walter's remarkable letter revealing his reluctance to fraternise with German soldiers during the Christmas Day truce in 1914 is set to go on public display tomorrow . As the artillery fell quiet, Tommies and German troops famously put down their weapons, emerged from the trenches, played football and swapped gifts in no man’s land. But General Sir Walter Congreve, VC, shunned the Christmas Truce of 1914 – because he didn’t trust the Germans to resist shooting an officer of his high rank, a letter he wrote to his wife reveals. Congreve, who led the Rifle Brigade, wrote the letter after visiting troops in a section of trench known as Dead Man’s Alley in northern France on December 25, 1914. He describes what he saw there as ‘an extraordinary state of affairs’ and tells of troops and officers from both sides ‘walking about together all day giving each other cigars and singing songs’. Congreve, then 52, who won his Victoria Cross during the Second Boer War in 1899 and was known as ‘Squibs’, adds: ‘I was invited to go and see the Germans myself but refrained as I thought they might not be able to resist a General.’ The letter came to light during research to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. It was donated to Staffordshire’s archive service by the Congreve family decades ago and was recently unearthed by researchers. In the letter, Congreve, whose parents were from Stafford, shows little sense of lasting Christmas spirit towards the enemy. After being told ‘the best shot in the German army’ was among the cigar smokers enjoying the truce, he tells how he ‘devoutly’ hopes ‘we down him tomorrow’. The letter also illustrates the unofficial nature of the truce and how it was not upheld along the entire Western Front. ‘Next door the two battalions opposite each other were shooting away all day and so I hear it was further north, 1st R.B. playing football with the Germans opposite them – next Regiments shooting each other,’ Congreve wrote. Congreve, who was educated at Harrow School and Oxford University, later lost a hand in action but survived the Great War. He went on to become governor of Malta, where he died in 1927 aged 64. Scroll down for video . British and German troops put down their weapons and mingle in No Man's Land during the Christmas truce of the First World War in 1914 . His son Major William ‘Billy’ la Touche Congreve was honoured with the VC after being killed at the Battle of the Somme in 1916 – making them the only instance of a father and son in the same regiment to be awarded the Army’s highest military honour. Historians say Congreve’s reasons for not joining in the truce were not without foundation. World War One author Alan Cleaver said: ‘Some soldiers died on Christmas Day 1914. They got out of the trench thinking there was a truce and they got shot by Germans who didn’t want a truce. So it was a very courageous thing for them to do.’ Anthony Richards, head of documents and sound at the Imperial War Museum, said: ‘There are various accounts of the Christmas Truce story and this is a particularly interesting addition.’ The letter is being displayed at the council record office in Stafford. ÷ The Advertising Standards Authority said there are no grounds for further investigating the Sainsbury’s Christmas TV advert recreating the 1914 truce which some viewers found ‘distasteful’. The watchdog received 727 complaints, but said ‘the ad is not likely to break the rules surrounding serious harm or offence’. On Christmas Eve, 1914, British and German troops in Flanders, Belgium, put down their weapons for a 48-hour truce. It was part of a series of widespread, unofficial ceasefires that took place along the Western Front. Many soldiers, from both sides, independently ventured into No Man's Land where they mingled, exchanging food and souvenirs. Troops collected their fallen and held joint burial ceremonies. Several meetings also ended in carol-singing. The most famous event of this day was the game of football played between the two sets of soldiers. The match reportedly started when a football was kicked by one of the British troops into No Man's Land. Sadly Christmas Truce of 1914 was never to be repeated. Next year, strongly worded orders came from the high commands of both sides prohibiting troops from fraternising with each other. By 1916, after battles of the Somme and Verdun, warfare had become unprecedentedly bloody and no more truces were sought.

"Homeless anti-war protester Stephen Bicker, 47, (pictured) has apologised  for vandalising two war memorials - spraying one on Remembrance Day . A homeless anti-war protester who vandalised a war memorial on Remembrance Day and another a few days later has said sorry for his 'misguided' protest. Stephen Bicker, 47, of no fixed abode, sprayed 'Sold Ya' on a monument to the Royal East Kent Regiment in Dane John Gardens in Canterbury, Kent on November 11. Officers from Kent Police were called following reports that the war memorial had been spray-painted sometime between 6pm on Saturday November 8 and 8am on Sunday November 9. Bicker was arrested at the time but was released on bail - and two days later he repeated the offence on another memorial in nearby Faversham. Bicker had vandalised the monument shortly before a Remembrance memorial service was about to begin. An elderly lady was forced to try to wipe the graffiti off with her handkerchief before council contractors were called in to clean up the damage. Bicker admitted two counts of criminal damage in Medway Magistrates Court yesterday and described himself as an 'anti-war protester'. He told magistrates in Canterbury: 'I deeply regret offending people, it's not what I wanted. 'I do not believe in armed conflict and I had to get that message across. 'But I realise on reflection that targeting the monument was not the way to go. 'I am sorry for that.' Bicker was given a six-month community order with supervision and alcohol treatment programmes. He was also ordered to pay £180 for each memorial he damaged plus £85 costs.

"Owners of Australia's first Hello Kitty Cafe are in a froth after getting a stern warning from company headquarters in Japan when bosses there noticed they were serving coffees with the bow on the wrong side of the cat-like character. To celebrate the opening of the store in Adelaide, fans were invited to come and sample sweet treats and enjoy a cup of coffee - topped with a motif of Kitty made out of chocolate powder sprinkled through a stencil. One fan shared an image of her cuppa on the cafe's Facebook page and the picture was spotted by executives at Sanrio, who own the Hello Kitty licence, in Tokyo. Scroll down for video . The image of the cup of coffee shared on the Hello Kitty Facebook page shows Kitty's bow on her right ear - it should be on her left . They noticed that because the stencil was used the wrong way, the bow was on Kitty's right ear - and quickly pointed out it should be on the left. 'We got into a lot of trouble from Sanrio,' store owner Jade told Daily Mail Australia. 'Her bow is meant to be on the left hand side but we're not sure why or how that photograph turned out that way.' In August, Sanrio revealed the beloved character is not actually a cat. In fact, she's a real human named Kitty White who lives outside of London, has a twin sister and owns a cat. While her little bow is famously attached to her left ear, her twin sister, Mimmy White wears a yellow bow on her right ear.

"Arrested: Rita Sanders-Campfield, 53, allegedly stabbed Chong Park, 67, because she was practicing witchcraft and needed to be 'perfected', according to her journal . A grandmother allegedly stabbed her roommate to death with a pair of scissors and a butcher knife because she thought she was evil and practiced witchcraft. Teacher Rita Sanders-Campfield has been charged with murder after Chong Park, 67, was found dead inside the apartment they shared in a quiet condominium in North Bethesda, Maryland. The 53-year-old Duke graduate was still lying in her bed when a maintenance worker walked into the property to make a routine repair and discovered the victim's body. Officers reportedly found a pair of scissors covered in blood next to her. She was living with Park through the non-profit organisation Housing Unlimited, which accommodates people with low incomes who have had a history of mental illness. Investigators revealed that the body had been in the property for several days before it was found and they also discovered a journal kept by the suspect. According to the Washington Post, one of the early entries suggested Sanders-Campfield believed Park practiced witchcraft and she needed to be 'perfected'. In a recent video posted on YouTube, Sanders-Campfield described how she had fallen into a deep depression when her husband suddenly died of pancreatic cancer in 1999. She said: 'It happened so quickly. I was in a bad place. I didn’t think that I could continue to live in the same home without him. I was fortunate that my mom allowed my son and I to move in with her.' She spent a year in hospital being treated and when she got out she tried to turn her life around. Thanking the organisation that housed her, Sanders-Campfield said that she had the 'perfect' living arrangement. Scroll down for video .

A social worker said she was in a 'catatonic state' in jail and urged the judge to send her for psychiatric evaluation. She has been charged with first-degree murder. Housing Unlimited's chief executive Abe Schuchman said Park had been living with them since 2006, and that he and his colleagues were deeply saddened by her death, but did not mention Sanders-Campfield in their statement. They said Park was a 'model tenant' who was 'caring, conscientious, warm, friendly, and well-liked by all.' The company added that Park's death is the only of 'this nature' during their 20 years of operation.

"One angry father demands to know why his daughter's biology substitute teacher decided to demonstrate what a body at rest looks like - by sleeping instead of teaching the class. Rob, who has an 11th grader at Olive Branch High School in Memphis, Tennessee said that the teacher slept through most of the 90-minute class.

"Victims of alleged historical child abuse have told Theresa May they are withdrawing support from the Government’s paedophile inquiry. A total of 23 individuals sent the Home Secretary a letter claiming the inquiry was ‘not fit for purpose’. It came ahead of a crunch meeting today between Mrs May and some of the largest groups for child sex abuse victims which could lead to the inquiry being undermined. Victims of alleged historical child abuse have told Theresa May (pictured) they are withdrawing support from the Government’s paedophile inquiry . Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said his organisation had not signed the letter – but insisted it echoed the views of the other abuse survivors. He said Mrs May must pledge to give the beleaguered inquiry extra powers, including granting it statutory powers to compel witnesses to give evidence and to properly consult victims’ groups. ‘At the end of the meeting, if we feel the Home Secretary is not serious about getting the inquiry right, then we will probably walk away, but until then it is too early to say. I believe she is committed to it; now she must show that commitment.’ Baroness Butler-Sloss (pictured) and Fiona Woolf have quit the role amid concerns about their links to figures alleged to be involved in the alleged cover-up . ‘I am not hopeful that we will get what we want.’ The letter to Mrs May said the 23 signatories would not take up an offer to attend the meeting. It said: ‘We, alongside many survivors, have made numerous representations to you regarding our view that the Inquiry as it stands is not fit for purpose. ‘The Home Office seems to be running the inquiry to meet others’ needs rather than those of survivors and the public. ’We therefore have little option but to end engagement with the Inquiry and call on other survivors, whistleblowers, associated professionals and agencies to follow suit.’ Mrs May set up a government inquiry into historical child abuse in the summer amid incendiary claims there was an Establishment cover-up of a murderous paedophile ring around Westminster in the 1980s. But she has struggled to put in place a chairman who retains the confidence of victims’ groups. Baroness Butler-Sloss and Fiona Woolf have quit the role amid concerns about their links to figures alleged to be involved in the alleged cover-up. Mrs May said: ‘I am aware of the letter, I have been speaking to survivors, various groups of survivors and representatives of those groups and listening to the issues they have raised. The issues in the letter have been raised previously and we are looking at them. ‘I am very clear that we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to get to the bottom of this issue and what has happened. 'Why is it that over the years - not just in the past but as we have seen in Rochdale, Rotherham and Greater Manchester that it is happening today – why is it that institutions, parts of governments, agencies including police and local authorities whose duty it is to protect children have been failing in that duty. We need to look into that and learn lessons for the future.’ .","Letter came ahead of a crunch meeting today between Mrs May and some of the largest groups for child sex abuse victims .

"Argiris Asderakis has been cleared of neglect after two patients died after being given kidneys from a rough sleeping alcoholic infected with a deadly parasite . A doctor has been cleared of neglect after two patients died after being given kidneys from a rough sleeping alcoholic infected with a deadly parasite. Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42, and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were given the kidneys at a hospital in Wales. Doctors had believed the alcoholic who donated them had died from meningitis. But an inquest heard it was later discovered the man - referred to as Mr Z - in fact died from the parasitic worm halicephalobus gingivalis. Despite the organs being rejected by surgeons at six hospitals around the UK, consultant surgeon Argiris Asderakis, 51, decided on his own judgement to take a 'calculated risk' and use them when they were accepted by University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. They were turned down elsewhere because of 'poor function' and the unknown cause of death of the donor. An inquest heard the two men died within three weeks of being given the kidney transplants. A coroner yesterday cleared Mr Asderakis of any neglect - and said no one could have predicted the kidneys were infected with a deadly parasitic worm. Coroner Christopher Woolley said: 'There was no gross neglect or failure in accepting the kidneys. 'There is no test for this incredibly rare worm infection. These were the first deaths of this kind. 'Had it not been for the worm infection there is every indication the kidneys would have functioned and there is a likelihood both men would be alive now. 'I find the medical professionals cannot be criticised.' Infections in humans are incredibly rare with only four cases previously discovered worldwide. All have proved fatal. Both retired business developer Mr Stuart and father-of-six Mr Hughes died after contracting the nematode worm - in what was the first human to human transmission. Acting Cardiff coroner Christopher Woolley said there were things that could have been done better by doctors, such as finding out the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor. Father-of-six Darren Hughes, 42 (left), and new grandfather Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67 (right), were kept in the dark by doctors at a Welsh NHS hospital about the lifestyle of their donor, an inquest heard . But he said that it 'remained unclear' whether that would have changed the outcome given that halicephalobus gingivalis is virtually unheard of in the medical profession. The inquest also heard that there was nothing untoward in UHW transplant surgeon Dr Argiris Asderakis accepting kidneys from someone suspected of dying from meningitis. NHS figures show that over the past 10 years there have been 52 patients with undiagnosed meningitis becoming organ donors. In recording a narrative verdict, Mr Woolley said: 'Robert James Stuart ... (and) Darren Hughes died from the unintended consequences of necessary medical intervention.' Mr Woolley added that both Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes had given full consent for the transplants to go ahead and had been told about the donor dying from what was thought to be meningitis. He said both men faced a 'significant risk of dying' on dialysis if they had not undergone the procedures. The transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff . However, relatives of the two dead men said their loved ones had not been in possession of the 'full facts' before agreeing to go ahead with the operation. They were adamant they were not properly told about the meningitis link and the risks. Speaking outside Cardiff Coroner's Court, solicitor Julie Lewis said patients must be more involved in decision-making, and they have to understand the risks and benefits. 'The families are very keen to get across to the public that the underlying issue here is this was an incredibly rare experience. People shouldn't be put off transplantation,' she added. Ms Lewis said she had taken instructions from the families to pursue their cases with the General Medical Council as well investigate possible medical negligence claims. The inquest previously heard that donor Mr Z had a long history of alcoholism - and at one stage was drinking 240 units of alcohol per week. The 39-year-old, who had cirrhosis of the liver, died in late November from a suspected viral infection. His next of kin then agreed for his organs to be donated. A string of hospitals declined the organs, before Cardiff's UHW took up the offer - with Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart getting one kidney each. Family of Robert 'Jim' Stuart arriving at the inquest. The inquest also heard that there was nothing untoward in UHW transplant surgeon Dr Argiris Asderakis accepting kidneys from someone suspected of dying from meningitis . Transplant surgeon Dr Asderakis said it was commonplace in hospitals across the UK to accept organs under the so-called 'fast track' system. 'If you are excluding high-risk donors then you are excluding 11 per cent of all donors in the country - that's 1,500 transplants,' he added. While the donor's cause of death was only given as 'suspected' meningitis or encephalitis, he was confident about taking the organ because Mr Z had undergone a five-day course of antibiotics. The inquest heard that a post-mortem examination had not been carried out on Mr Z - but even if it had, it would have been incredibly unlikely that a test for the rare parasite was carried out. Tests before Mr Z died showed that the meningitis had not been caused by common bacteria or viruses. Added to this, the deceased had not been abroad in the past six months - which reduced his chances of having an exotic virus. However, the inquest heard that Dr Asderakis had not personally accessed the online database transplant surgeons sometimes use - the Electronic Offering System (EOS). Pictured is the family of Darren Hughes. Both retired business developer Mr Stuart and father-of-six Mr Hughes died after contracting the nematode worm - in what was the first human to human transmission . But he said he had been told all the information on the EOS via a telephone conversation with a specialist transplant nurse. It also transpired that the results of a second lumber puncture on the donor had not been placed on the system - although coroner Mr Woolley reiterated that this would not have shed any light on the cause of his brain infection. Both men died - two days apart - in mid-December 2013. For father-of-three Mr Hughes, it was his third transplant, while it was Mr Stuart's first. Mr Stuart's widow, Judith, believed her husband was coping very well on dialysis and would have been happy to stay on it for the rest of his life. However, in his conclusion, Mr Woolley said both men's chances of surviving long term on dialysis given their circumstances would not have been high. A Cambridge professor, who was part of a three-person panel asked to review the case, said that, while he would not have used the organs himself, no-one could have predicted the tragedy. 'I doubt we'll ever see (a case like this) again. No-one could have foreseen it.'","Darren Hughes and Robert Stuart were given kidneys at hospital in Wales .

"Professor Stefan Grimm (pictured) told his fellow academics that university chiefs had treated him poorly . A scientist pioneering a new cancer treatment at world-renowned Imperial College London has been found dead after bosses told him to raise more money. Professor Stefan Grimm apparently gassed himself at home after confiding in fellow academics that university chiefs had treated him ‘like s***’. In a final email, he wrote: ‘What these guys don’t know is that they destroy lives. Well, they certainly destroyed mine. ‘This is not a university anymore but a business, with a very few, up in the hierarchy, profiteering, and the rest of us milked for money.’ The 52-year-old professor of toxicology, who had been researching an ‘anti-cancer gene’, was discovered dead in his house after his bosses told him he was not bringing in enough money from academic grants. Imperial College is ranked in the top ten universities in the world. An email sent by Martin Wilkins, head of experimental medicine, to Prof Grimm earlier this year stated he was ‘struggling’ to meet expectations and needed to win research grants worth £200,000 a year. He wrote: ‘This constitutes the start of informal action in relation to your performance,’ and offered to ‘help’ if Prof Grimm wished to ‘explore opportunities elsewhere’. Prof Grimm sent an email to colleagues entitled ‘How Professors are treated at Imperial College’ claiming that he had been living under the threat of the sack for more than a year. In the email, only discovered since his death on September 25, he wrote: ‘Why does a Professor have to be treated like that? These career scientists up in the hierarchy of this organisation only look at figures to judge their colleagues.’ Saying he had accomplished ‘something exciting’ in the field of anti-cancer genes, he wrote: ‘We have developed something that is probably much more exciting than most other projects, including those that are heavily supported by grants. ‘One of my colleagues here at the College whom I told my story looked at me, there was a silence, and then said: “Yes, they treat us like s***”.’ Imperial College is consistently placed among the top universities in the world, coming 2nd in the 2014/15 QS World University Rankings, and 9th in the 2014/15 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Notable alumni include Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1928. Prof Grimm was unmarried and lived alone in a rented house in Harrow, North-West London, where his next-door neighbour Norma Harrington, 84, said: ‘He was very friendly, polite, gentle and diffident. ‘He went off to work at 7.30am and came home at 10pm – he said he was always working.’ ‘I noticed he had lost weight recently. ‘It is so sad that someone doing such good work should end up like this.’ Imperial College London (pictured) disputed claims Prof Grimm was facing the sack and said the matter had been at an informal stage . Her husband, retired bank worker Jack Harrington, showed the Mail a note from their neighbour apologising over a delay in paying for cleaning of their joint driveway in which Prof Grimm wrote: ‘Sorry for my slow response, it is a bit stressful in my job at the moment.’ Last night a fellow academic at Imperial said: ‘Perhaps what is most shocking is that none of us are actually shocked this has happened. ‘Higher education is like big business these days, and Imperial is absolutely focused on its position in the global rankings. ‘Lots of us thought academia was about ideas and expanding the realms of science, not a business in which the people who do the research are treated as disposable commodities. ‘Guys like Prof Grimm are victims in this. It is brutal and horrible and unfair. Everybody knows a story about someone who has been targeted because they no longer “fit” or are deemed unproductive in some way.’ Imperial College is ranked in the top ten universities in the world, with past alumni that include Sir Alexander Fleming (pictured), who discovered penicillin in 1928 . Writing about Prof Grimm, science blogger Prof David Colquhoun said the problem ‘is by no means limited to Imperial’ and said several other top universities were ‘just as brutal - but in these places nobody has died. Not yet’. Professor Dermot Kelleher, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial, told staff in an email: ‘We are all deeply saddened by Stefan’s death and my thoughts are with all those who knew him.’ He said an obituary being prepared told of ‘a scientific life well lived, a phenomenally hard worker, a leader and inspiration to other scientists and a caring man dedicated to his students.’ An inquest was opened and adjourned at West London District Coroner’s Court on October 8. Yesterday a spokesman for Imperial College London disputed Prof Grimm's claim he had been threatened with the sack, and said the matter had been at an informal stage, adding: 'His line manager met with him on a number of occasions to see how the College could help him to develop more competitive grant applications. 'Discussions included talking about the best place for him to do his science, both inside Imperial and outside, and it is a fact that, with Professor Grimm’s permission, his line manager made enquiries about opportunities on his behalf. 'Stefan Grimm was a valued member of the Faculty of Medicine and news of his death came as a great shock to colleagues.' The university is conducting its own review to see if there were any 'lessons to be drawn'. Professor James Stirling, Provost of Imperial College London, said: 'Imperial seeks to give every member of its community the opportunity to excel and to create a supportive environment in which their careers may flourish. Where we become aware that the College is falling short of this standard of support to its members, we will act.'","Professor Stefan Grimm killed himself after confiding in fellow academics .

"Controversy: Father Dennis Higgins has angered parents by telling children at a school mass that Father Christmas is not real . An elderly priest has been labelled as 'plain mean' after telling primary school children as young as seven that Santa Claus did not exist. Father Dennis Higgins, in his 80s, was attempting to teach pupils the true meaning of Christmas while delivering mass at a school in Buxton, Derbyshire. But his stark words were said to have upset the younger children and angered parents - who accused the clergyman of ruining the 'magic of Christmas'. Other members of the priest's congregation quickly leapt to his defence, setting up a Facebook page called Support Father Higgins and posting a series of kind messages calling him an 'honest' and 'courageous' man. The mass was attended by children from St Anne's primary school and older pupils, aged 11-12, from St Thomas More Catholic School - both in Buxton, Derbyshire. One parent, who did not wish to be identified, said: 'How dare he say such things to such young children? 'To try and take away the magic of Christmas is just plain mean. 'It really saddens me that someone who people should respect and look up to can do something so mean.' When Father Higgins, who is based at St Anne's Catholic Church in Buxton, was asked to explain his comments he launched into a foul-mouthed tirade. But supporters of the priest who rallied to his defence have called him an 'honest' and 'courageous' man on Facebook. His support page reads: 'This page is being set up on behalf of Father Dennis Higgins who has dedicated his life to God and the Church. He has been a pillar of Buxton's community.' When Father Higgins, who is based at St Anne's Catholic Church in Buxton (above), was asked to explain his comments he launched into a foul-mouthed tirade . Sue Burkinshaw wrote: 'Father Higgins is in his 80s, he's a good and decent man, still working when he could have retired long ago bless him. 'Can't see many parents working as hard as he does when they reach that age. Get a grip.' Sheryl Anne Ellison added: 'I know Father Dennis, he keeps it real in every sense, even with regard to the bible and gospel. Defence: Many churchgoers rallied behind the priest - even setting up this Support Father Dennis Higgins Facebook page . 'He is an honest, true, courageous man, who strives for justice, fairness and compassion. 'I have nothing but respect for the man and I think those who spew bile should aim it in another direction, certainly not at him. Reassurance: Brendan Hickey, headmaster at St Thomas More Catholic School, told pupils they could still expect a visit from Father Christmas . 'The school is Catholic, Christmas is a Christian festival celebrating the birth of Christ. If you send your kids - deal with it.' Father Andrew Cole, spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Nottingham, which includes Buxton and the surrounding area, has apologised for Father Higgins' 'intemperate language'. He said: 'Christmas is a wonderful time of the year, especially for our children. 'On the first Christmas Day, God gave us his most precious gift, Jesus, who shows us how to love God and one another. 'We celebrate Jesus' birth in Bethlehem by putting up Christmas trees and decorations, singing carols, sending cards, giving each other presents, and spending time with those we love most. 'Father Christmas is always a welcome visitor in our homes, and we will all be looking forward to his arrival on Christmas Day, including me.' Brendan Hickey, headmaster at St Thomas More Catholic School, has since tried to repair some of the damage and reassure younger children that Father Christmas will soon be paying them a visit. He said: 'I want to reassure all year three pupils at St Anne's, and their parents, that I have personally spoken to Father Christmas and told him about what has happened. 'He was sorry to hear about the confusion and has promised me that he will arrange for his elves to write to each of the children and reassure them that he will definitely be coming to visit them this Christmas.'","Father Dennis Higgins was delivering school mass in Buxton, Derbyshire .

"When a 13-foot, 719 pound alligator menaced a Florida property, a restaurant executive took it upon himself to hunt the beast and serve it up proudly at his establishments. Clark Woodsby works as the senior operating partner for Talk of The Town restaurants and is responsible for picking fresh foods for Orlando restaurants like MoonFish even if it means catching the dish himself. One week ago he and a group of trappers were called to a private property in Polk County where a massive gator was roaming the land. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Hungry for more?: Woodsby along with some trappers managed to hunt this giant reptilian beast . 'I had a crossbow, and I waited until it was 15 yards away; I shot it right in the side, in the shoulder,' Woodsby told Fox. Shooting the gator with a crossbow is how he and the trappers could track the gator. It took 45 minutes from the men to catch the gator who was putting up a strong fight. 'It starts spinning. It starts doing the death roll. There were four of us total, each of us take turns fighting it because our hands were getting torn up from the rope,' Woodsby said of the impressive feat. Woodsby finally managed to hit the gator in the back with a dart. 'I have a harpoon with another dart and was able to get it into the back of the gator,' Woodsby said. After finally conquering the carnivorous reptile, Woodsby processed it and sent it to restaurants like MoonFish.

"Peter Haynes, pictured outside London's High Court, claims he cannot be blamed for causing the six-car motorway pile-up because he was 'sleep driving' at the time . A risk management expert who says he was 'sleep-driving' when he caused a six-car motorway pile-up - seriously injuring a 'bright' student - says he cannot be blamed for the smash. Oil and energy consultant, Peter Haynes, was described as 'steaming past' other motorists at 70mph in his Toyota Land Cruiser, before crashing into the back of a VW Polo. The car was being driven by 'high-achieving' Norwich School A-level student, Simon Green, then aged 19, on a slip road off the A47 in Norwich, on March 1, 2012. Mr Green, now 22, of Hillcrest North, Pickenham Road, Swaffham, suffered permanent brain damage after being trapped in the crash which has had a 'devastating impact' on his life. He is now suing Mr Haynes for massive damages at London's High Court. But Mr Haynes, also an honorary lecturer in risk management at the University of East Anglia, is mounting a unique defence to the claim. His lawyers say he cannot be held responsible for the crash because he passed out at the wheel following a sudden bout of sickness. The businessman, in his 60s, of the Old Vicarage, Metfield, near Harleston, Norfolk, denies that he was too ill to drive and says his blackout was totally unexpected. Stephen Worthington QC, for Mr Haynes, claims he was in a 'state of automatism' - similar to a sleepwalker - when he caused the crash. But Mr Green's lawyers say that defence - even if accepted - should not prevent the student from winning damages as an 'innocent party'. They dispute that Mr Haynes' actions immediately before the crash are capable of supporting the automatism defence. They also insist he should not even have been on the road, as he was 'too ill to drive'. Susan Rodway QC, for Mr Green, told Mr Justice Supperstone: 'It was a very tragic and unusual accident. It is remarkable Mr Green survived. 'He has suffered brain damage of a permanent nature. He was a very high achiever and that has caused a devastating impact on his young life.' Mr Haynes had been attending a work conference on the offshore gas industry, held at the John Innes Centre, in Norwich when he was struck down with illness. After half an hour at the event, suffering symptoms of sickness and diarrhoea, he decided he could not stay. Having obtained an emergency doctor's appointment, he set off on the 50-minute journey to his home. Mr Haynes said he had been driving at between 55 and 60mph when his abdominal pain became more severe and he decided to find somewhere safe to pull over. 'Bright' student Simon Green suffered serious head injuries in the crash and has been left with permanent brain damage . But within three seconds, he felt 'as if his head were deflating' and he blacked out, immediately before crashing into Mr Green's car. However, Mr Green's lawyers dispute that speed after witnesses claimed they saw him overtaking drivers who were going 70mph, in the outside lane. Motorist Matthew Sayer told the court he was able to estimate the speed of Mr Haynes' car as he 'came steaming past'. Mr Green is now suing  Haynes for massive damages at the High Court in London (pictured) Miss Rodway added: 'It is Mr Green's case, quite simply, that if Mr Haynes felt so unwell he could not remain at the conference - which he had presumably paid to attend - then he was probably not in a fit state to drive himself home. 'His judgment and ability would almost certainly have been impaired by reason of his distraction with his illness as well as his pain. 'Having chosen to take the risk of driving, it was incumbent on him to drive as slowly and safely as possible - driving at or over the speed limit and in the outside lane of the dual carriageway, does not constitute slow and safe driving.'

"It's not every day that you sell your house for $1.62 million and get an invite to morning tea with the Prime Minister, but Jean and Tom Cheetham are no ordinary couple. At 100 and 103 years-of-age, Jean and Tom are probably Australia's oldest couple. Until recently, the inseparable pair lived independently in the same Mosman home they bought two days before their wedding in 1938. But all the furore over selling their house has also lead to an invitation to have morning tea with Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Monday to celebrate their centenarian status. The Daily Telegraph reported that three generations of the Cheethams were at the auction to see the family home go under the hammer. The couple recently moved into a retirement home nearby and did not attend on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Tom and Jean Cheetham's Mosman semi will be sold for the first time in 76 years this weekend as the couple move into a nursing home. The semi, which remains unchanged since the Cheethams bought it in 1938, is expected to fetch $1.4million at auction . Tom and Jean's son, Kevin Cheetham, said he's unsure how much his parents paid for the house he was born in, and the property  next-door, all those years ago. He thinks it was around 3000 pounds for both. The average house price in 1938 is thought to have been just 1000 pounds. It was the year Australia hosted the Empire Games (now Commonwealth Games) and celebrated its sesquicentennial, the 150th anniversary of European settlement. Tom Cheetham was working at the Sydney GPO, translating morse code into ­telegrams when he took out a loan to buy the home, where the couple would raise their two children and celebrate their 100th birthdays. The unrenovated 77a Spencer Rd semi will go to auction tomorrow for the first time in 76 years . The kitchen and sunroom, in their orignial condition,  reflects the austere style of the inter-war years in Australia . The Mosman semi enjoys generous sized bedrooms, high period ceilings and original stained windows . The house has not changed much since the day the Cheethams moved in. 'They put a garage in under the front of the home and they filled in the little veranda out the back, they built a workshed for my father and that’s about it,' Kevin Cheetham told the Mosman Daily. Harcourts Real Estate agent Tom Forde says the semi is one of few unrenovated homes in the Mosman area, attracting a lot of interest because it offers a rare 'blank canvas' in one of Sydney's most sought after locations. The home features character details including high, ornate ceilings and a period fireplace. The kitchen, in its original condition, reflects the austere style of the inter-war years in Australia. The semi is a short walk to Cremone shops and the Orpheum movie theatre - a walk Tom Cheethman made every day. After recently moving into the Alexander Campbell House home, Mr Cheetham told the Mosman Daily of his marriage to Jean: 'She keeps me happy. I don't think people stick at marriage any more.' Tom and Jean were also looking forward to meeting the Prime Minister for a special Kirribilli House reception. 'They're just thrilled about it,' their daughter-in-law Ann told Daily Mail Australia. 'Jean is still working out what she's going to wear.' The lounge room retains its 1930s character today .","Tom and Jean Cheetham are in the money after selling the Mosman home they bought when they married in 1938 .

"Confessed paedophile and Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn is likely to have to wear an electronic tag so he can remain on bail. The 59-year-old NSW south coast businessman, nicknamed 'The Big Cheese' controversially avoided being sent immediately to jail last week despite pleading guilty to multiple sexual and indecent assaults on children. And on the condition an electronic bracelet can be organised and his family can secure $700,000 surety, Van Ryn may now also get to spend Christmas with them. His defence counsel, Steven Hodges, said his client was undertaking 'chemical castration' treatment regularly to address his urges and reduce his libido. Scroll down for video . Former Bega Cheese boss Maurice Van Ryn leaves the Downing Center court in Sydney on December 4 . Maurice Van Ryn could spend Christmas at home on bail if he wears an electronic tag . 'I think these conditions would satisfy mitigating the otherwise unacceptable risk that he would flee' prior to being sentenced in February, Judge Rodney Madgwick told Sydney's Downing Local Court on Thursday. He then adjourned the hearing until next week so further inquiries could be made into the logistics of using the device. Earlier, the court was told Van Ryn was a flight risk because he held property leases in a country with which Australia had no extradition treaty. But it was also argued he was unlikely to abandon his family, who are standing by him. The court heard his wife had offered $500,000 surety while his mother was willing to put up $200,000. Maurice Van Ryn appeared in court for a bail hearing . He has pleaded guilty to five counts of indecent assault, five of indecency and one assault with indecency along with the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child . The judge suggested that to lessen Van Ryn's ability to abscond, his liquid assets be frozen. However, defence barrister Steven Hodges said his client did not have access to significant amounts of cash as his money was tied up in property and superannuation. The court also heard he had an income of $15,000 a month but details of this weren't given. The Tathra businessman preyed on children aged between eight and 16 between 2004 and 2014. He has pleaded guilty to five counts of indecent assault, five of indecency and one assault with indecency along with the most serious charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child. Maurice Van Ryn (pictured left) was the former Bega Cheese CEO and was known around town as the 'big cheese' The hearing was told Van Ryn was undergoing chemical castration in an attempt to stop his urges . Mr Hodges said there was 'minimum risk' of him reoffending while on bail. However, the court heard the businessman had done so already. An indecent assault was committed against a teenage boy but was not considered a 'serious offence'. The decision to grant him conditional bail last week led to the intervention of NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard, who said it left him 'extremely concerned'. Van Ryn, who was arrested in September, has been committed for sentence at Bega District Court on February 2. A further hearing will be held on Friday to determine when the case will be heard next week, but Van Ryn will not have to attend.

"Whistleblower Jason Phur, 39, has been awarded £46,000 after an employment tribunal ruled her was unfairly dismissed . A mechanic who was unfairly sacked when he accused garage bosses of overcharging customers for unnecessary work, has been awarded £46,000 in compensation. Whistleblower Jason Phur, 39, told an employment tribunal a whole host of not needed work had been carried out by mechanics at the garage. He claimed one driver was hit with a £2,500 bill after he was told to remove the complete cylinder head on a car when the fault was with the engine control unit. The father-of-three also told the hearing he was ordered to fit a new clutch on a Vauxhall Astra when it did not need replacing. He said he voiced his concerns about the work to company director Nick Sutton who called a staff meeting where a row broke out. Three weeks later disciplinary proceedings were brought against Mr Phur and four days after that he was sacked with a letter accusing him of a 'negative attitude' at work. He took privately-owned Volksline to a tribunal where Mr Sutton claimed the mechanic had thrown a chair at him and worked at a 'substandard' level. But the three-man panel rejected that and said his explanation for starting disciplinary proceedings was 'implausible and inconsistent'. One disgruntled customer also told the hearing he was overcharged for work when he took his car for a service in 2011. Bank worker John Forster said the garage told him he faced a £500 bill to repair an oil leak and replace brake pads. He told the hearing he was 'absolutely flabbergasted' and took his vehicle to a different mechanic who said nothing was wrong with it. The panel, sitting in Ashford, Kent, ruled in Mr Phur's favour and awarded him £46,000 in compensation from the Canterbury-based company. They said: 'A disclosure alleging a criminal offence is in the public interest.' Mr Phur, a father-of-three, 39, from Herne Bay, Kent, said: 'They just didn't like the fact that I spoke up against the regime. 'What they did to me has had a huge emotional and psychological impact upon me. 'They were very worried that this might get into the papers so at one point they tried to arrange an out-of-court settlement, but obviously it came to this instead. 'I haven't yet recovered from the ordeal of going through it all, but at least I have been totally vindicated in pursuing this.' Volksline was founded in 1979 by David Sutton (right), 70, and is run by his son Nick (left). They pair deny they have ever fitted parts that did not need fitting . Volksline (pictured) claims it as an 'honest' firm that has 'never fitted parts that didn't need fitting' Volksline was founded in 1979 by David Sutton, 70, and is run by his son Nick and a team of nine mechanics. After the case Nick Sutton, 51, said: 'We have never fitted parts that didn't need fitting. We are an honest firm which has been operating in Canterbury for 35 years. 'We always treat our employees well. This whole thing feels like a punch in the throat.' Mr Phur's solicitor Mike Arnold said: 'This judgement demonstrates that workers should come forward to complain if they believe that there are wrongdoings that they believe are being committed by their employer and are in the public interest. 'Whether the workers' beliefs are true or not is not the issue. As long as the allegations are made, they must be investigated correctly. 'The worker must not suffer any detriment because they have blown the whistle and certainly must not be dismissed because of it. 'The law protects those who whistle-blow.' Volksline has never been prosecuted for defrauding any customers and the tribunal's remit does not extend to investigating such allegations.","Mechanic Jason Phur has won a legal battle against his former employer .

"Nick Clegg has come under fresh fire for ‘distancing’ his party from the Government over his no-show for the budget. The stinging criticism from former Home Office minister Jeremy Browne came after the deputy leader shunned Wednesday’s Autumn Statement. While Chancellor George Osborne took to his feet in Parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister travelled to Penzance in Cornwall to discuss flood defences. Scroll down for video . Criticism: Nick Clegg has come under fresh fire for ‘distancing’ his party from the Government over his no-show for the budget . The Daily Telegraph reported Mr Browne as saying: ‘My party shouldn’t go to too great a length to distance itself from a winning combination. ‘The danger is we cast ourselves with one foot in government, one foot out. We don’t get support from people who think the Government has done a good job. ‘We should not run away from our record, because we will not get the credit and continue to get the blame. ‘I don’t want us to move from being a party of protest to a party of protest in government.’ The stinging criticism from former Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, above . Mr Clegg yesterday insisted his trip to Cornwall was not a snub to the government, saying it was a ‘nice change to get out of the Westminster bubble and see what this Autumn statement means to people’. When asked by the newspaper if was ‘a bit childish’ of the Lib Dem leader not to turn up for the Autumn Statement, Mr Browne said: ‘I think it is important for the Liberal Democrats to have a distinctive appeal at the general election, to explain to people the relevance and purpose of our party, and why it is necessary to vote for us for the furtherance of the national interest.’ He added: ‘I also think it is important for us that we are unambiguously associated with the Government that we are members of. 'We are just as much part of the Government as the Conservatives are the Government.’ Mr Browne made the criticisms when he appeared on the TaxPayers’ Alliance and Institute of Economic Affairs panel. He added: ‘And I think if you have a big political event in Parliament and one of our Cabinet ministers is unequivocally enthusiastic about it, one of our Cabinet ministers appears to be very unenthusiastic about it and another of our Cabinet ministers is absent, that creates a sense that we are not as unambiguously supportive of the Government that we are members of, which I think we need to be to get the credit we deserve for a lot of the Government’s achievements.’","Jeremy Browne has criticised Nick Clegg for shunning Wednesday's event .

"Foreign aid will cost British taxpayers £1billion more than expected by the end of next year because the national income has risen, it was claimed last night. Included in the Autumn Statement are new figures which suggest the economy’s size has increased in several areas, according to the Financial Times. Therefore so has the UK’s aid commitment, which is to pay 0.7 per cent of GDP. The revelation is expected to trigger anger from Tory backbenchers, who are deeply opposed to increases to the aid budget while Britain is still struggling to pay off the deficit. Scroll down for video . Foreign aid will cost British taxpayers £1billion more than expected by the end of next year because the national income has risen. Pictured, British soldiers  distribute aid packages in Zubayr in southern Iraq, 2003 . While other departments have seen their spending slashed over the past four years, foreign aid has been ring-fenced and was set to hit £12billion by the end of this year. Under the new calculations, it should rise to £12.4billion this year to meet the target – effectively giving the Department for International Development three weeks to spend another £400million. Next year, the aid budget would have to increase by £550million to £12.75billion. The findings come ahead of a vote in the Commons today in which Tory MPs will try to kill off a Bill to enshrine the foreign aid target in law so it must be followed by future governments. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, said: 'It is completely idiotic to be spending so much money abroad when we are borrowing so much money' Last night, David Cameron conceded that the Bill may not get through and instead claimed it was more important that the UK gives this money to poor countries than pass laws about it. It is a remarkable change of tone from the Prime Minister, who declared earlier this year that the massive increase to the foreign aid budget was his ‘proudest achievement’ in government. Cabinet ministers are not expected to attend the Commons vote, which was forced by the Liberal Democrats, although all three parties officially support the Bill. Philip Davies, the MP for Shipley, has tabled dozens of amendments to hold up the debate today. He said: ‘It is completely idiotic to be spending so much money abroad when we are borrowing so much money.’ If time runs out, the Bill will not be passed before the General Election. Even members of the Cabinet do not support the Bill, which Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called ‘bizarre’ when asked about it last month. Figures released by the Office for Budget Responsibility, seen by the Financial Times newspaper, show the UK’s national income is around £60billion higher than expected for this year. According to the newspaper, the OBR figures for 2015 increase the size of several economic sectors by £79billion – meaning an extra £550million in foreign aid, although the final figure is unknown. The budget for DFID has already been set for the next two years and it is understood other spending could be reclassified as ‘international development’. Last night, a Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Autumn Statement confirmed that we will meet the 0.7 per cent aid target in 2014. The amount spent on aid in 2014/15 has not been changed. The 2013 spending round set budgets for 2015/16, including maintaining ODA [official development assistance, a way of measuring aid] funding at 0.7 per cent of GNI [gross national income] in 2015. We are confident that existing spending plans are consistent with our aid commitments.’","Revelation is expected to trigger anger from some Tory backbenchers .

"A 52-year-old grandfather is hoping his tattoo depicting 203 characters from popular cartoon series The Simpsons will win him a Guinness World Record.

The prison officer said he had sat through an eye-watering 130 hours under the needle over the course of a year. Mr Baxter's favourite character was Homer but his tattoo includes all the main characters - including Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Supporting characters - such as Sideshow Bob, the Comic Book Guy, Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner - are littered among the faces that span across Mr Baxter's back.

I love the tattoo, and I know lots of other people, including my grandchildren, do too.' To claim his record, Mr Baxter has to depose New Zealand's Lee Weir who has the 'most tattoos of the same cartoon character tattooed on the body'. Mr Weir has 41 tattoos of Homer Simpson on his left arm. Despite Mr Baxter's tattoo including lots of different characters, he understands that because all the characters are from the same show, he is eligible to make a claim for the record.

A campaign has even launched in the U.S. to persuade The Simpsons producers Matt Groening and James L. Brooks to invite him to appear in animated form on the show. 'I'm recognised everywhere. My friends love it, especially the attention it's now getting. They all think the tattoo's awesome, especially when they see it in the flesh,' Mr Baxter said. 'My wife Sharyn, 50, and daughters Michelle, 31 and Rebecka, 29, love it. My seven-year-old grandson Kohen and my five-year-old granddaughter Milah, think it's fantastic.'

Even Mr Baxter's tattoo artist, Jade Baxter Smith, has been 'overwhelmed' by the attention she has received over her artwork. 'I'm known now as the girl who did ""that Simpsons tattoo"",' she said. When Mr Baxter first approached Ms Smith with the idea, she did not take him seriously. 'Michael came to me and said he wanted all The Simpsons characters on his back. I laughed and thought he was joking,' the tattoo artist, who has been working since she was 18, said. Mr Baxter has volunteered to travel with Ms Smith to tattoo expos since the artwork was completed in 2013. 'I'm happy for Jade to use me to promote her work. We've got the Melbourne expo this week.

"Fatal injuries: The official cause of death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, seen in a 2009 arrest photo, is gunshot wounds and blunt trauma to his head and torso it was revealed on Friday . Boston Marathon bomber suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died from gunshot wounds and blunt trauma to his head and torso, a funeral home revealed today. Worcester funeral home owner Peter Stefan who was holding the body of 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev read the details from his death certificate on Friday. The certificate cites Tsarnaev's 'gunshot wounds of torso and extremities' and lists the time of his death as 1:35 a.m. on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing, Stefan said. It comes as authorities reportedly found explosive residue in the sink, bath tub and kitchen table in the home Tamerlan shared with his wife Katherine Russell. The discovery will fuel speculation over how much she knew about the attacks. Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the United States about a decade ago. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing. Tsarnaev's family on Friday was making arrangements for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured less than a day after his brother's death. However they are apprently having trouble finding a place for the body. 'My problem here is trying to find a gravesite. A lot of people don't want to do it. They don't want to be involved with this,' said Stefan, who said dozens of protesters gathered outside his funeral home, upset with his decision to handle the service. 'I keep bringing up the point of Lee Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh or Ted Bundy. Somebody had to do those, too.' The funeral parlor in Worcester is familiar with Muslim services and said it will handle arrangements for Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whose body was released by the state medical examiner on Thursday night. The body was taken initially to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters. On Friday a woman answering a phone at the funeral parlor said it has since been removed and taken elsewhere, the Los Angeles Times reports.

Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth. Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to a national TV audience. Authorities plan to look at security . procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the massive . New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times .

Deval Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event. 'I think the most important thing is that we got them, and there's investigation continuing about where the other leads may lead,' he said. 'I can tell you, having been thoroughly briefed, that the law enforcement at every level is pursuing everything.' As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities were searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a suburban Boston backyard, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his dormitory room before the FBI searched it. The April 15 bombing, using pressure . cookers packed with explosives, nails, ball bearings and metal shards, . killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the marathon's . finish line. Brothers: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, right, were the first suspects behind the bombing while three more suspects have been since taken into custody . The brothers considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth but decided to carry out the attack sooner when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said. The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained Friday by The Associated Press. The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings. The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated Thursday and came one day after President Barack Obama's administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa. Tazhayakov's lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it. A benefit concert featuring Aerosmith, James Taylor and Jimmy Buffett is scheduled for May 30 at the TD Garden in Boston. The proceeds will go to The One Fund, which has taken in more than $28 million for those injured and the families of those who were killed. The fund's administrator, Kenneth Feinberg, said Friday he plans to hold meetings with victims next week and begin cutting checks by the end of June.","Explosive residue found in home he shared with his wife .

"An outspoken Conservative MP has been arrested on suspicion of rape. Mark Pritchard, 48, went to a police station by appointment and was questioned by Scotland Yard detectives. The backbencher was questioned for four hours over the allegation before being released on bail until next month. His arrest was revealed in an online statement of proceedings at the House of Commons. Mr Pritchard, MP for The Wrekin in Shropshire, was arrested and questioned by police on Tuesday following an allegation that he raped a woman earlier this year . Details of the allegation were unclear but it is understood that the alleged rape was said to have taken place in central London in recent weeks. Mr Pritchard is a prominent member of the Tory Right and a leading Eurosceptic who was secretary of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. He was at the centre of a political storm in 2010 when he told Commons Speaker John Bercow ‘You’re not f****** royalty’ after being told to stand aside in a Westminster corridor. Yesterday, Mr Bercow was responsible for revealing Mr Pritchard’s arrest in the Parliamentary record Hansard under the title ‘Arrest of a member’. The paper read: ‘Copy of a letter addressed to the Speaker … from the Metropolitan Police, relating to the arrest of Mark Pritchard, Member for The Wrekin.’ The disclosure came after police wrote to Mr Bercow to inform him of the arrest but did not say what it was for. The 48-year-old announced last year that he was planning to divorce his U.S-born wife of 15 years, Sondra Spaeth (pictured together in 2005) The short letter, marked ‘Confidential for Speaker only’ and ‘Not for further dissemination’, later emerged in the media. It said: ‘I write to inform you that on 2nd December 2014, Mark Pritchard MP was arrested at 6.14pm at Holborn police station in London. Mr Pritchard was questioned by police and released on bail later the same evening at 10.16pm. The matter is subject to further investigation and is sub judice at the present time.’ Soon after, the Met confirmed that a 48-year-old man had been arrested on a rape charge. Before his arrest, Mr Pritchard – the MP for the Shropshire seat of The Wrekin since 2005 – was in the House taking part in a debate on the peace process in Colombia. The next day his official website published news of his visit to his constituency to boost support for grassroots football. In September, Mr Pritchard said he had been targeted by a journalist in the sting that led to Tory minister Brooks Newmark resigning over explicit selfies. He has apparently withdrawn a complaint to the Independent Press Standards Organisation after agreeing a settlement. Mr Pritchard is unique among Tory MPs in being raised in an orphanage. From the age of five he was cared for by foster parents in a council house. He left state school at 16 with few qualifications and worked as a labourer. But he studied hard to gain a masters degree before earning a six-figure salary as a marketing director. He began his political career as a Tory councillor in Harrow before being elected to Parliament. He is on the joint national security strategy committee, which considers the threat from terrorism, cyber war, global military crises and natural disasters. The arrest was made public on a Commons order paper, which referred to a letter sent to speaker John Bercow by the Metropolitan Police, confirming Mr Pritchard's arrest . The 48-year-old voluntarily attended a police station in north London and was bailed to a date in early January . Mr Pritchard, pictured in his home village of Wenlock, Shropshire, with his dog called Pebbles . Mr Pritchard has called for more working-class MPs to be promoted by David Cameron and said people who ‘went to school in a Morris Minor rather than a Jaguar’ would have avoided the ‘pasty tax’ gaffe in the 2012 Budget – a proposal to put VAT on hot takeaways. But he ended any hopes of a ministerial career in 2011 by publicly accusing Mr Cameron of trying to bully him into dropping his call for a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses. The MP had an acrimonious split from his American-born wife Sondra last year, in which she accused him of dumping her by text after 16 years of marriage. Commons records show he still employs her as his office manager. Mark Pritchard is one of Parliament's most-colourful MPs – a self-made businessman who grew up in an orphanage before entering the Commons in 2005. The Tory backbencher is one of the party's most Eurosceptic MPs and admitted that he came close to joining UKIP earlier this year. Since his election almost a decade ago, Mr Pritchard has been involved in a series of high profile political clashes – including with the Prime Minister. Mr Pritchard has been one of Parliament's most-colourful MPs since entering the commons in 2005 . During the 2005 leadership election he asked David Cameron if he had ever taken a Class A drugs. He was also briefly the toast of the Tory backbenches after taking on Commons speaker John Bercow – shouting at him that he was 'not f****** royalty'. It came after Mr Bercow demanded the MP step out of his way in a Commons corridor. Mr Pritchard was also involved in a bitter public dispute with his wife last year after announcing that he was divorcing her. The Tory MP was accused of telling his wife that he wanted a split by text message. Sondra Pritchard used the MP's Wikipedia page to accuse her husband of 'abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage' even though he claimed to be a 'devout Christian'. Shortly afterwards the damaging entry was deleted and the Pritchards' tit-for-tat Wiki war continued as the account of their split was changed on the MP's profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events. The backbencher (pictured in 2005) is a Eurosceptic and has a close interest in foreign affairs and defence . His friend Tory MP Mark Garnier said: ‘I last saw him on Tuesday when he was arrested. ‘These are incredibly serious allegations. Clearly, he must answer to the rule of law.’ A Tory spokesman said: ‘This is a police matter. It would be inappropriate to comment while an investigation is taking place.’ Mr Pritchard (right) pictured with Sondra Spaeth (left) at Bridgnorth District Council Chairmans Charity Dinner at Davenport House, Worfield . Last year, Mark Pritchard and his estranged wife became embroiled in a row on Wikipedia over who was to blame for the break-up of their marriage. In July 2013, Sondra Pritchard, wife of Mark Pritchard, allegedly used the website to accuse her husband of 'abandoning her by text message after 16 years of marriage' even though he claimed to be a 'devout Christian'. Under 'spouse' it refered to his wife by her maiden name of Sondra Spaeth and added that divorce was pending. Shortly afterwards the entry was deleted. But a tit-for-tat Wiki war ensued as the account of their split was changed on the MP's profile, reflecting conflicting versions of events. Most of the alterations were made from computers traced to the Houses of Parliament where both worked at the time – Mrs Pritchard as her husband's Commons office manager. Even more remarkably, some of the anonymous Wiki entries appeared to involve a code which echoed opera buff Mr Pritchard's role as treasurer of the Parliamentary opera group. One of the entries favourable to him was made by a user known as Figaro2000, after Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. In a statement, he confirmed he had texted her to say he wanted a divorce but claimed he had already informed her 'in person'. He said: 'I informed my ex-wife, in person, that I was going to file for divorce the day I left home. Over subsequent days, I confirmed that decision through another conversation, a legal letter, and by text. 'Since then, friends claim she may have abused the Wiki site to try to cause me embarrassment and make inaccurate claims. I did not edit any item on my Wiki page.' The 'text' claim was added to Mr Pritchard's profile on August 1: 'The couple separated in April 2013, following Mr Pritchard, a devout Christian, abandoning Sondra and the marriage on 29th April by text.' Mr Pritchard's fightback started on August 6, when allegations against him were deleted by Figaro2000. The only mention of his wife of the Wikipedia page now reads: 'In July 2013, Mark Pritchard announced that he was divorcing his wife of 15 years, Sondra, following their separation in April 2013.'

"Buyers snapped up more than £200million worth of property in the hours after George Osborne announced sweeping changes to stamp duty. The Chancellor’s reforms on the transaction tax in his Autumn Statement sparked one of the busiest periods for estate agents in 25 years. One overseas buyer saved £1.4million in stamp duty when contracts on a £30million house in Surrey were exchanged just 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday – after which the new rules applied. Scroll down for video . Books editor Louise Bolotin will pay just £99 in stamp duty following a complete reform of the tax system. The first-time buyer is in the process of buying a spacious £129,950 one-bedroom flat in a Grade II listed converted warehouse in Manchester’s city centre. At 53, Miss Bolotin was only able to buy her own home when she inherited some money. Saving: Books editor Louise Bolotin (left) is in the process of buying a spacious £129,950 one-bedroom flat in a Grade II listed converted warehouse (right) in Manchester’s city centre . She said that now her stamp duty bill had been slashed from £1,290 to just £99, it will make the moving process less painfully expensive. Miss Bolotin, an editor for financial books, said she will use her windfall of almost £1,200 to buy a new bathroom. She said: ‘This has come at the perfect time for me. The offer was agreed two or three weeks ago and I have just started the conveyancing process. ‘I am a massive winner from this. I knew I needed to do up the bathroom but now I can buy more expensive fittings. I’m very happy about the changes, as you might imagine.’ The sale of a second £30million house – in upmarket Hampstead in London – went through at 11.30pm. Estate agents are predicting a property boom in the run-up to Christmas and into the New Year as families raise their offers and first-time buyers realise they could afford to buy sooner. The new system will replace the unpopular ‘slab structure’, that led stamp duty to be labelled ‘the worst designed tax in Britain’, with a gradually increasing rate. The changed rules – said to benefit 98 per cent of buyers – mean the so-called ‘cliff edge’ where the tax was charged on a whole value of a property is replaced by gradually rising charges in a string of bands. It means someone buying an average-priced home worth £273,000 will be about £4,500 better off. Yesterday the switch triggered a flood of calls to solicitors and estate agents as sellers and buyers rushed to capitalise on the change. First-time buyers Chris Pacey and Katie Vincent were delighted to discover they will save £780 after their stamp duty bill was reduced. The couple have had an offer accepted on a £172,000 three-bedroom home in East Leake, Loughborough, and hope to exchange contracts on Monday. Lab technician Miss Vincent, 30, and her boyfriend, a manager of a food store, have been living with her parents for three years to save enough money for a deposit. Bill reduced: First-time buyers Chris Pacey and Katie Vincent were delighted to discover they will save £780 . The couple have had an offer accepted on a £172,000 three-bedroom home in East Leake, Loughborough . But after finding their dream home, a three-bedroom detached house, they felt annoyed about paying a stamp duty bill of £1,720 – 1 per cent of the value of their home. Now, they will pay 2 per cent on only the portion above the threshold of £125,000, which comes to £940. Mr Pacey, 27, said: ‘We can use the extra money on home improvements. I think the new system is much fairer.’ Sellers who had been previously forced to undervalue their home to keep the price below stamp duty bands of £250,000, £500,000 and £1million are hoping to increase the sale price. Nick Riddle, at estate agents Eadon Lockwood and Riddle in Sheffield, said: ‘We have already received calls offering asking prices on 15 properties that had previously received lower offers. New mortgage rules caused a shock slowdown in the housing market, official figures have revealed. The small print of a report issued by the Office for Budget Responsibility describes how home loan regulations introduced in April caused sales to plunge by almost 10 per cent more than expected. Though the OBR does not say why this happened, previously experts have blamed banks and building societies for making it too difficult for borrowers to get a mortgage. Since April, homebuyers have faced a forensic probe into their personal finances before they are allowed to take out a loan. The shake-up, known as the Mortgage Market Review, was supposed to ensure that the irresponsible lending that led to the 2008 crisis was not repeated. But in its economic forecasts, the OBR said: ‘It appears that the regulations have had a larger and more persistent effect than we had assumed.’ Critics say the Mortgage Market Review has gone too far. The changes mean that instead of simply providing three months of bank statements as they did previously, borrowers must now go through a three-hour interview where every aspect of their savings and spending is probed. Brokers have reported borrowers being quizzed about how often they have friends over for dinner and if they ate steak. Banks say they are frightened of falling foul of the new rules. But the FCA has accused lenders of misinterpreting the rules and defying ‘common sense’. ‘Now that buyers aren’t burdened in the same way by outdated stamp duty fees, they are better placed to pay what the property is really worth.’ Kevin Hollinrake, of Hunters estate agents, based in North and East Yorkshire, said: ‘Minutes after the changes were announced we had two or three people on the phone increasing their offers by £5,000 or more because of the stamp duty saving. ‘We were working late last night and received well over 100 calls from clients within the first hour and a half of opening.’ While most buyers will be better off, stamp duty for homes over £937,500 has risen. Lawyers were paid bonus fees of up to £10,000 to get the paperwork finished before midnight to save their clients vast sums of money. Beauchamp Estate Agents said it pushed through sales on homes worth a combined £100million between the delivery of the Autumn Statement and midnight. Those who failed to exchange contracts on their property before midnight now face hefty stamp duty bills. A £2million home will cost £53,000 more than it would have two days ago. One buyer buying a £7.5million home in Knightsbridge faced huge disappointment after attempts to rush through a sale before midnight failed, costing them £288,000, according to Rokstone estate agents. But many more were successful. Mark Pollack, of London’s Aston Chase estate agents, said his team managed to get three multi-million-pound deals through before midnight. He said: ‘The last time I can remember a day of so much anxiety was when interest rates went up to 15 per cent in the 1980s.’ Simon Rose, of Strutt & Parker’s Chelsea office, said it was the busiest night that he could remember for 25 years, rushing through four sales of multi-million homes at the last minute. Trevor Abrahmsohn, of Glentree International, said sales of luxury homes would fall because of the 12 per cent stamp duty on homes over £1.5million. Instead, there would be a ‘boom’ in basement conversions as the rich chose to extend their homes rather than move.

"Jessica Silva  has been found guilty of manslaughter for the stabbing death of her estranged drug-using partner following years of abuse. Ms Silva, from Marrickville in Sydney's inner-west, lay down in the dock and began screaming and crying after the jury delivered their verdict following five days of anxious waiting. Ms Silva was accused of stabbing James Polkinghorne, 28, up to five times outside her family home in Marrickville in Sydney's inner west on Mother's Day in 2012. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva leaving NSW Supreme Court after being found guilty of manslaughter for the stabbing death of her estranged partner following years of abuse . The 24-year-old pleaded not guilty to murder on the basis of self defence, with the Supreme Court hearing she had suffered years of abuse at the hands of her boyfriend of four years. Over the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly broke down as the court was played phone conversations in which her estranged partner abuses and insults her, before threatening to 'cave her face in'. In one text sent to Silva on the day he was stabbed, Mr Polkinghorne wrote: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Ms Silva claims that Mr Polkinghorne attacked her outside her family home, fighting with her brother and father while she ran inside. She claims he punched her and ripped her pants before she retrieved a knife to defend herself with, stabbing him up to five times, reported 9 News. Mr Polkinghorne died later from wounds to the back and shoulder. The court found her not guilty of the murder of Mr Polkinghorne but guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. The 24-year-old pleaded not guilty to murder on the basis of self defence, with the Supreme Court hearing she had suffered years of abuse at the hands of her boyfriend of four years . Minutes before the jury came back into court the 24-year-old was crying and hugging supporters as they became increasingly distressed by the news that a verdict was to be delivered. Ms Silva's father allegedly told Mr Polkinghorne's mother 'I will never forgive you', telling her that she 'could have stopped this'. Silva, who has been on bail throughout the trial and has been sitting next to her lawyer, was then asked to step into the dock for the first time. The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a jury of seven men and five women were not able to reach a unanimous decision on Ms Silva's guilt. Judge Clifton Hoeben gave the jury further instructions before they returned with their verdict for the 24-year-old. After the jury left the room, Justice Clifton Hoeben said he would be considering a large 'spectrum' of sentences for Silva from non-custodial to custodial. 'I have a completely open mind,' he said. He said Silva's bail should be continued before she returns to court for sentencing in February. The crown said the case was 'not a popularity contest' and no matter what Mr Polkinghorne had done while he was alive, disputes were not solved by force. But Silva's barrister, Gregory Scragg, said all she had ever wanted was for Mr Polkinghorne to stop hurting her. At the time of his death, Mr Polkinghorne was the suspect in another murder case, reported The ABC. Evidence from the murder investigation of Nikolas Argiropoulos was used as evidence in Ms Silva's trial. Her trial heard recordings of a series of frantic phone calls she made to her brother Miguel in the hours before Mr Polkinghorne died. Ms Silva arrived at court on Thursday morning after five days of waiting for a jury verdict . , Minutes before the jury came back into court the 24-year-old was crying and hugging supporters as they became increasingly distressed by the news that a verdict was to be delivered . Ms Silva was accused of stabbing James Polkinghorne, 28, up to five times outside her family home in Marrickville in Sydney's inner west on Mother's Day in 2012 . According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Polkinghore texted Ms Silva on Mother's Day calling her a 'f---ing slut', saying she deserved to be raped and threatening to come over to smash up her parents' house. 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now,' Silva says in one call to her brother Miguel. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. When Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside the family home that night, Miguel told the court he was 'screaming and carrying on' and that his sister was afraid for her and her family's life. When Miguel went outside with his sister in an attempt to calm the situation, he alleged Mr Polkinghorne came quickly towards him. 'He tried to punch me. I think when I put my hand up, and he broke my finger,' Miguel added. Jessica Silva reportedly used this knife to stab her ex-boyfriend to death . Mr Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . This image shows the alleged drugs that were on Mr Polkinghorne on the night he died . Moments later, the two men were on the ground with Mr Polkinghorne on top, grabbing Miguel near his throat, the court heard. 'Was he screaming out, `I'm going to get you, you f***ing c*** ... I'm going to kill youse (sic)'?' defence barrister Gregory Scragg asked. 'Yeah,' Miguel replied. It wasn't until their father came outside to help wrestle Mr Polkinghorne to the ground that he saw blood everywhere and noticed the 28-year-old had a gash to his head, the court heard. Miguel said his sister was the only person he saw with a knife that night. She allegedly stabbed him four or five times to the back, shoulder and head and he died on the road while Miguel and Ms Silva's father restrained him. In the weeks before Mr Polkinghorne's death, Miguel told the court the 28-year-old had become increasingly paranoid from the drug 'ice'. 'The drugs had gotten to him really bad.'","Jessica Silva was accused of murdering her estranged partner James Polkinghorne in 2012 by stabbing him up to five times outside her home .

"Stylist to the stars Clare Harries narrowly avoided a prison sentence after admitting twice driving while four times the drink-drive limit . A stylist to the stars  crashed her car while nearly four times the drink-drive limit twice in the same week. Clare Harries, 50, of Tufnell Park, north London, was told she 'could have killed someone' by a judge today, who described the case as one of the worst he had ever seen. The Chelsea School of Art graduate has worked with a celebrity clientele which includes stars Bruce Willis, Daniel Radcliffe, Jude Law, Angelina Jolie and Emma Watson. But she was sentenced to four months imprisonment, suspended for two years, today and disqualified from driving for five years. Hammersmith Magistrates Court District Judge Paul Goldspring said: 'Someone who is this many times over the legal limit is just about as dangerous as anybody on the road. I can't think of a case that ticks as many aggravating boxes.' Described as 'one of the most respected and experienced stylists working in the industry today' Harries specialises in film and TV shoots; photo shoots, award ceremonies, including the Oscars, and is also a style consultant and interior designer. The mother-of-two pleaded guilty to driving her blue Mercedes in Oxford Street on October 15 with 133 microgrammes of alcohol to every 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35. She also admitted driving in Wood Green, north London on October 20 with 141 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. Simon Sherriff, defending, said: 'She is on the surface a woman, who two years ago, was apparently a busy working single-mother. That was a social facade and hidden from virtually everybody, under the ice, there was a slow decline of physical and mental health.' The court heard Harries was involved in a collision in Orchard Street in the West End before driving off and being pulled over in Oxford Street in the first incident. She was then invlved in a second incident, in which she hit a parked car in Hornsey, north London and pulled over in nearby Wood Green after again driving off. When police caught up with her the car was stationary with the engine running, the lights on the front tyre was flat and Harries was gripping the steering wheel and staring blankly ahead. Harris (centre) twice drove off after collisions with other cars, but was pulled over by police and tested . In 2013, Harries - who a son aged fifteen and a daughter aged seventeen - was convicted of being in charge of a vehicle while over the alcohol limit and was fined and given ten penalty points. Mr Sherriff told the court: 'One of her friends tells me you would not believe this is the same woman as two years ago. 'The marriage to her first husband was an unhealthy relationship that led to divorce and after the collapse of her marriage to her second husband she lost the family home in March and is in rented accommodation, which she hopes to get out of.

'It's a difficult case to sentence. The easiest thing in the world would be to send you to prison, but I have considered carefully the effect your behaviour has had on the children.

"Around a third of items bought at last weekend's Black Friday sales stampede may have already been returned, new research claims. Figures suggest millions were swept up by the frenzy into making purchases they did not want simply because goods were cheaper. More than £800million was spent online on Friday and £720 million on so-called Cyber Monday this week during the growing trend for websites and stores to offer pre-Christmas sales. But CollectPlus, a parcel rival to the Post Office, has seen a seen a 30 per cent rise in parcel returns this week compared to an average week. Scroll down for video . There were ugly scenes at shops last Friday as bargain-hungry shoppers fought over discount TVs . The fights came as £810million was spent online - with a similar amount taken by shops and supermarkets . Most appear to be hastily bought items from Black Friday and Cyber Monday, returned quickly by those hoping to get their money back in time to spend on Christmas. The post-Black Friday surge will result in an estimated 31 per cent of online purchases being returned, according to a survey of more than 2,000 adult customers. And it could cost British business up to £505 million in lost productivity and employee absence as the average customer will each spend 52 minutes returning parcels this Christmas, said the research. Almost one in five Britons have taken time off work to return a purchase, said CollectPlus CEO Neil Ashworth. The rush to buy online bargains caused a number of retailers' websites to crash under the strain . This Amazon warehouse in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire had to process millions of orders . Mr Ashworth said: 'With the increased enthusiasm for 'Black Friday' and 'Cyber Monday', we expect to see a sharp returns peak this week. 'Our research tells us that the average shopper is taking valuable time and losing money each year due to complicated or costly returns. 'As such, it is imperative that retailers have a robust model in place to ensure that customers can conveniently return any unwanted items and are quickly reimbursed.' The boom in online shopping has led to a sharp rise in the number of British shoppers returning purchases by post, as opposed to just going into a store for a refund or exchange. Natalie Berg, of research analysts Planet Retail, added: 'The frenzied nature of this year's Black Friday and, to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday events will have resulted in some panic buying. 'Having had time to reflect on whether such purchases are actually worth keeping, or indeed if it they were genuine bargains at all, many shoppers will be looking to return items this week.' But research suggests more than a third of items bought on the day of sales has now been returned .","Online shoppers in the UK spent millions on goods on Black Friday .

"Labour's 50pm income tax rate cost Britain £6.9billion in lost revenue from its wealthiest individuals, figures revealed last night. While some 16,000 workers declared an income in excess of £1million in the 2009/10 tax year to HM Revenue and Customs, that number dropped to just 6,000 after then Prime Minister Gordon Brown brought in the new tax rules. Tax paid by the top earners fell from £13.4billion before the top tax rate came in to £6.5billion in 2010/11. Cut top rate: Ed Miliband (right) claimed new figures showed that 8,000 . people earning more than £1m this year would gain £107,000 each as a . result of George Osborne's (left) budget decision to cut top rate to 45p . for $150,000 earners . It is thought that many of the highest earners moved abroad or reduced their taxable incomes to avoid paying the new levy. Many are said to have avoided paying the new rate either by bringing forward payments or delaying them, by moving earnings abroad or by choosing to work less. Many now appear to be returning to the UK, with the number of £1million plus earners rising again to 10,000 since Chancellor George Osborne announced that the top tax rate would be reduced to 45p from next April as part of the Budget earlier this year. But while Conservatives used the figures to claim that Labour's decision to increase the highest rate of tax actually lost Government revenue, Ed Miliband highlighted separate figures to accuse ministers of handing Britain’s rich a tax break worth more than £100,000 yesterday. The number of people declaring incomes of more than £1 million slumped from 16,000 to 6,000 . Mr Miliband claimed that new figures . showed that 8,000 people earning more than £1 million this year would . gain an average £107,000 each as a result of George Osborne’s budget . decision to cut the top rate to 45p for those earning more than . £150,000. West Worcestershire MP Harriet Baldwin hit out at Labour's 50p top tax rate claiming that it has cost the country billions of pounds. But who is she? Elected at the 2010 General Election following the retirement of Michael Spicer, Harriet Baldwin was Managing Director and Head of Currency Management at the London office of investment bank JP Morgan Chase. She left the company in 2008 with more than 20 years service at the bank under her belt. The 52-year-old mother-of-three has been on the Work and Pensions Select Committee since 2010 and was a member of David Cameron's so-called 'A List' aimed at increasing the number of ethnic minority and female Conservative MPs particularly in safe seats. She made headlines in November last year after saying that jobless families should be banned from claiming benefits for more than four children. Labour had . previously said that earners on more than £1 million stood to gain . £40,000 a year as from the Chancellor’s decision Addressing workers at a . sheet metal factory in Stevenage ahead of next week’s autumn statement . on the economy, Mr Miliband said they were paying the price for the . Government’s decision to stand up for the 'wrong people'. ‘David . Cameron and George Osborne believe the only way to persuade . millionaires to make work harder is to give them more money. But they . also seem to believe that the only way to make you work harder is to . take money away,’ he said. ‘Cut your tax credits, squeeze your living standards, get rid of some of the services on which you rely, and put up VAT. That’s where the money is coming from for the millionaires’ tax cut.’ Mr Miliband faced embarrassment earlier this year after wrongly claiming that all millionaires would receive a £40,000 tax cut. In fact the tax cut relates to earnings, not wealth - and critics pointed out that the Labour leader has assets worth well over £1 million. Tory sources hit back strongly at Mr Miliband’s latest claim, suggesting that the introduction of the 50p rate was an ‘ideological move’, which had cost the country billions of pounds. Tory MP Harriet Baldwin, who uncovered the figures suggesting that the 50p tax rate had seen the number of those claiming to earn more than £1million drop, said: . ‘Labour’s ideological tax hike led to a tax cull of millionaires. Far . from raising funds, it actually cost the UK £7 billion in lost tax . revenue. ‘We have taken tough action to clamp . down on tax avoidance and make sure those with the broadest shoulders . bear the biggest burden. 'That’s why in every single year of this . Government the rich will pay a greater share of our nation’s tax . revenues than in any one of the 13 years that Labour were in office.’ 'Behavioural response': HMRC found that tax rate prompted thousands of wealthy individuals to take action to avoid the new rate, either by bringing forward payments or delaying them, by moving earnings abroad or by choosing to work less . An HMRC report into the tax concluded there was ‘a considerable behavioural response to the rate change, including a substantial amount of forestalling (deferring income to avoid the tax).’ Mr Osborne insisted on slashing the 50p rate, arguing that it made Britain uncompetitive and deterred entrepreneurs from coming to the UK. He had wanted to scrap the top rate entirely for anyone earning more than £150,000 a year, but that move was blocked by the Liberal Democrats. Many Tories believe the cut will lead to higher tax receipts in future, arguing that the wealthy will have less incentive to avoid the lower rate. The Lib Dems also blocked his plan to reduce the top tax rate to its previous level of 40p, claiming that it would send out the wrong signal at a time when the less well off were being asked to contribute more to paying off the deficit. Labour will hold a Parliamentry debate today to criticise the reduction of the top rate with senior coalition figures thrashing out next week's Autumn Statement which sets out Government tax policy for next year. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that two thirds of Britain’s top earners ‘deserted the UK’ after 50p top tax rate was introduced.  We are happy to clarify that millionaires leaving the UK was a minor factor in the fall in tax revenue from the group but a large proportion was lost from people forestalling payments.","The number of people declaring incomes of more than £1m slumped from 16,000 to 6,000 after Gordon Brown introduced the new tax rules in 2010 .

"The family of a British hotelier murdered in St Lucia believes the British government is hampering the investigation in to his death, it has been revealed. The badly burnt body of 38-year-old Oliver Gobat was found on the idyllic Caribbean island in April. He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched. Now a private investigation by his family has revealed that there are several 'persons of interest' in Britain who need to be questioned. The family of murdered Briton Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See) believes the British government is hampering the investigation in to his death . However, because of a diplomatic deadlock involving the UK and St Lucia authorities, they have not been quizzed over the death and Britain has yet to send its own police officers to the island. Mr Gobat’s brother Adam is quoted in The Times as saying: ‘We’re hoping that this new information can persuade the UK government to take action. ‘Inaction is damnable. Inaction is almost tantamount to the government protecting people who may be part of this, or who may have relevant information.’ The Foreign Office is reportedly refusing to accept an invitation from St Lucia authorities for British police to travel to the Commonwealth country to help with the investigation as it wants assurances that the killers will not receive the death penalty. The Times says foreign office minister Hugo Swire told MPs earlier this week that he would look to find a way of overcoming the diplomatic barriers and that he 'pressed the issue' with the island's high commissioner recently. Oliver Gobat, 38, was shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set alight in his Range Rover (pictured) Mr Gobat's parents Theo and Helen Gobat have launched a private investigation into the suspected contract killing. The couple have put up a £60,000 reward in a last ditch attempt to try and find his killers. The manner of Mr Gobat’s death, on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island, has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing. Police sources previously stated Mr Gobat’s death was ‘no ordinary murder’ and it had ‘all the hallmarks of a professional killing’. Paradise: Cap Maison's estate of luxury apartments and hotel in the Caribbean once run by Mr Gobat . The boutique hotel, pictured, is five star and is based on the coast of the island . Cap Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, was created by the Gobats with their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver. Guests, who have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa. Theo Gobat, 75, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt. He and another director successfully took over the company's hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison. His son Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and fitness club in Adelaide, Australia.","Oliver Gobat's family say British government is hampering investigation .

"Lily Cole, pictured at the Costume Institute Gala Benefit in May, is to speak out against squalene use . Sharks are already in demand for their fins and now it has been revealed that their livers are being used to make luxury face cream. Model and animal rights campaigner Lily Cole is to speak out against the use of squalene, an oil extracted from the livers of endangered sharks, at the Hay Festival on Thursday. As one of Britain's most successful models Cole has caliber when it comes to the world of fashion and beauty. She is known for using her fame to promote environmental causes and this latest appeal hits close to home. She will expose one of the beauty trade's . murkier secrets - its reliance on killing sharks to obtain a . key cosmetics ingredient. Cole will be joined on stage by Alannah Weston, creative director of Selfridges, the department store, who will announce it is clearing its shelves of all products containing squalene derived from sharks. Almost all beauty products use a loophole in European labelling regulations to avoid revealing the origin of the substance, reported the Sunday Times. 'Sharks are now among the most . vulnerable species in the ocean,' said Weston. 'The unrestricted killing . of sharks is just another example of human destruction of the ocean and . its creatures.' The substance is made by sharks in their livers to help control their buoyancy in water. The livers of deep sea sharks, living 700-13,000ft below the surface, contain large amounts of the oil, which has made them an increasingly popular target for fishing fleets. Gulper sharks, a group of long and slender dogfish with very large mouths, are regarded as producing the best quality squalene, with their oil fetching up to £18,000 a ton. Some species face extinction in the northeast Atlantic. A recent investigation by Bloom, a French marine conservation charity, suggested that about 3m deep sea sharks were being caught each year for the cosmetics industry, with global demand for shark oil reaching about 2,500 tons in 2010. Poor gulper sharks are likely to suffer 'livering' and are prime targets for the squalene trade . Romain Chabrol, the report's author, said: 'It appears that a distinct phenomenon of ‘livering' exists in which the liver is removed and the carcass thrown back overboard, similar to ‘finning' where sharks have their fins cut off before the injured animals are thrown back, usually still alive.' The ugly way in which squalene is obtained is in strong contrast to its uses. Cosmetic manufacturers prize it for its power as a natural moisturiser, valuable in a wide range of skin products. It also makes for easy labelling because there is no obligation for manufacturers to declare its origin and many people have never heard of it. Some European manufacturers have responded to the concern. The Sunday Times reported that L'Oreal, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever's Dove skincare range used shark-derived squalene in their products, but they have since phased out the material. Unilever says squalene was replaced with plant-derived substitutes two or three years ago. Chabrol said such changes meant the key markets were now in the Far East. 'Japan is the world's leading market for squalene, accounting for 40 per cent of global demand.' Heather Koldewey of ZSL said Britain had already seen the near extinction of the angel shark with several other of its 30 shark, skate and ray species under threat. 'Protecting the areas where they gather to feed, breed or lay eggs is a potentially good strategy. We want the area around the Manacles to be declared a marine conservation zone largely because of its shark life.' Philanthropist Cole, 25, joined other . figures from the fashion world to call on the government to support a . ban on neonicotinoid pesticides linked to declines in bee populations last month. She has also also acted as Body Shop brand activist, speaks out for ethical fashion and recently went on a trip to Acre in north west Brazil as part of her role as ambassador for Sky Rainforest Rescue - Sky and WWF’s partnership to help save one billion trees in the Amazon rainforest.

"A Royal Marine known as 'the commando who refused to die' after suffering 100 injuries in an Afghanistan explosion has had a leg removed - so he can play with his children. Corporal Paul Vice, 31, suffered more than 100 significant wounds during an explosion and 'died' twice as he was airlifted back to Camp Bastion in 2011. The father-of-four, who was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery during two previous incidents, received more than 114 wounds to his torso. Corporal Paul Vice pictured in hospital (left) following the operation to remove his leg, and  undergoing rehabilitation (right) after the surgery . Paul Vice (right), with fellow Invictus Games contestants Robert Cromley-Hawke (left) and John-James Chalmers (left) after they won gold medals in the road cycling event . Remarkably, he had more than 400 pieces of shrapnel and stones removed from his body by surgeons, suffered a broken neck, a damaged left eye, was deafened in one ear and suffered a stroke, a brain injury and paralysis down his right side. After surgery he recovered, and his determined spirit saw him compete at the recent Invictus Games, where he won medals in cycling and archery. But on-going problems with his left leg have stopped him from enjoying life with his wife Tessa and their four children Honey, Alfie, Frankie and Harley. So he made the difficult decision to remove the troublesome limb, which he referred to as 'the wet fish'. Before having the leg removed, he wrote a message on the limb which read: 'Dear leg, thanks for all the misery and admin you have caused over the last three years. See you later pal.' He said: 'The leg is crap - it does not do anything and I call it the wet fish. It does not do anything but cause me gip and pain and it cannot get any worse. 'I have gone through the stage of being depressed about why it happened and I have got over it. 'More importantly this is about my children. I cannot interact with them how I want. I want to be running and playing football with them, but at the moment I have problems just walking after them. Corporal Paul Vice, pictured left and right during his early years with the Royal Marines, was awarded the Military Cross for bravery prior to suffering life-threatening injuries in Afghanistan . Athletes Luke Darlington and Paul Vice (right) pictured during an interview prior to the Invictus Games . 'As a family, we have all agreed that the best way forward for me is to have the leg amputated. 'I live in the here and now and my sole aim is to look after and give my children and family the best life they can get.' Immediately following the 2011 explosion, while suffering from shock, he tried to check that all his limbs were intact, but could not move his head as the blast had broken his neck. He was able to see a pool of blood pouring from his torso, then realised that a life-threatening amount of blood was also streaming from his neck - he had a severed artery. His life was saved when a colleague who had escaped the blast rushed to his aid, and forced his knee into his neck to stop the bleeding. He survived the blast, but suffered a broken neck, a stroke, a damaged left eye, was deafened in one year and suffers from an enduring brain injury which causes paralysis. Mr Vice pictured in action during the Invictus Games, where he won medals for cycling and archery . Paul Vice watches the games (right) during a break in the competition, after having competed in the road cycling event (left). He is now known as 'the commando who refused to die' He was evacuated back to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, and a month later  started his gruelling rehabilitation at Headley Court, the tri-service rehabilitation centre in Surrey. Cpl Vice said: 'I lay there checking myself over to make sure I still had my limbs. I couldn't move my neck because it was broken but I remember seeing a massive pool of blood coming out of me and then felt and heard blood spouting out from my neck like a hose pipe. 'I didn't feel pain, just red hot - I thought I was on fire. 'When I felt the hole in my neck I knew it was an arterial bleed, so I thought that was it. 'That's when Richie came ploughing through the dust and stuck his knee into my neck.' He is now the subject of a documentary, called The Commando Who Refused to Die, which will be broadcast on Friday, December 12, and includes footage of the amputation.","Corporal Paul Vice was injured in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2011 .

"Muslim convert Anthony Small, 33, was arrested in a dramatic dawn swoop yesterday by counter-terrorism detectives . A former British boxing champion is suspected of trying to smuggle jihadists bound for Syria out of Britain in the back of a lorry. Muslim convert Anthony Small, 33, was arrested in a dramatic dawn swoop yesterday by counter-terrorism detectives. They believe he is linked to a failed plot to sneak two men through Dover so they could travel to Syria and fight for Islamic State. Small, who calls himself Abdul Haqq, is an outspoken supporter of Anjem Choudary and has posted provocative videos online. Choudary and nine others were arrested in September during a crackdown on the notorious hate preacher’s inner circle. Their passports were confiscated in a bid to stop them leaving the country. But some of them are now suspected of attempting to flee through the same underworld channels used by illegal immigrants. The two men found hidden in the lorry were sitting alongside more than a dozen migrants and an Eastern European accused of acting as a fixer. They were arrested at gunpoint following the discovery of the vehicle on Sunday. Small and a second man, aged 40, were arrested at their homes in South East London yesterday. The former boxer was held on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism while the second man was held on suspicion of conspiracy to possess and supply fraudulent documents. Three other men were arrested in separate operations in East London and at the port of Dover. The investigation raises questions about the decision of police and the security service to confiscate passports from potential jihadists who want to travel to Syria. They have already uncovered evidence of frustrated extremists turning their sights on domestic targets after being stopped from leaving the country. Choudary has repeatedly said he would like to join Islamic State on the lawless border between Syria and Iraq. Small, who held British and Commonwealth light middleweight titles, ripped up a poppy for the cameras as he announced his intention to stage a 'Hell for Heroes' on Remembrance Sunday in 2011 . Last month one of his henchmen, Siddhartha Dhar, 31, fled with his family after being asked to give up his passport. He has since taunted the authorities by posting a photo of himself online holding an AK-47 rifle and his newborn baby. Small, who held British and Commonwealth light middleweight titles, turned professional in his early 20s under the alias Sugar Ray Clay Jones Jr. He converted to Islam aged 24 but it was not until around 2010 that he began attending marches protesting against the war in Afghanistan. Small later announced he was giving up his sport to ‘take on the fight for Muslims’. In recent months he has posted a series of inflammatory videos online, including one referring to the ‘United Snakes of America’. He said recently: ‘I cannot be a Muslim and a boxer who makes money from a sport that promotes the evils of alcohol, gambling and free mixing of men and women.’ Last night, a Met spokesman said: ‘All seven men remain in custody.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Muslim convert Anthony Small, 33, was arrested in a dramatic dawn swoop .

"A Chinese billionaire is believed to be the mystery purchaser of one of Sydney's most exclusive high end properties. Xu Jianyin, chairman of the real estate group Evergrande, is listed as China's 15th richest man with $7 billion worth of wealth to his name, according to the Hurun Report. The 56-year-old is reported to have paid about $39 million for the Villa del Mare mansion at 63-67 Wolseley Rd Point Piper in Sydney's east, according to Fairfax. Scroll down for video . The Villa del Mare, 63-67 Wolseley Rd Point Piper in Sydney's east, was sold to a mystery buyer on October 7 . The buyer is believed to be Xu Jianyin, the chairman of real estate group Evergrande . Mr Xu is listed as China's 15th richest man with $7 billion worth of wealth, according to Hurun's rich list . Positioned to take full advantage of the panoramic harbour views, the mansion was put on the market by its previous owner, recruitment agent Julia Ross, in August this year before it was snatched up a secret buyer in early October. LJ Hooker's real estate agents in Double Bay refused to reveal information regarding the sale or buyer when questioned by Daily Mail Australia. However, Mr Xu was reported to have been in Sydney around the time that the mansion was sold. The company listed on the Villa del Mare's settlement papers, Golden Fast Foods Pty Ltd, is also believed to be linked to his company Evergrande, according to Fairfax media. Chinese investors were the highest foreign investors in Australian real estate – both commercial and residential – between 2012 and 2013, making up almost $6 billion worth of sales, according to the Foreign Investment Review Board's Annual report. Foreign buyers made up 16.8 per cent of the demand for new residential properties in the third quarter of 2014 while Chinese foreign investors spent almost $6 billion on commercial and residential real estate in Australia between 2012 and 2013 . They were followed by Canada and then the US, whose foreign investors spent just under $5 billion each on the Australian real estate market in this period. Foreign buyers made up 16.8 per cent of the demand for new residential properties in the third quarter of 2014, according to the National Australia Banks' Quarterly Residential Property Survey, with the figure expected to rise by 0.5 per cent in the next year. 'Foreign non-residents or short term visa holders can invest in Australian real estate only if that investment adds to the housing stock. This generally occurs by acquiring new dwellings, off-the-plan properties under construction or yet to be built, or vacant land for development,' Foreign Investment Review Board's website states. Principle agent at Laing and Simmons Double Bay, Danny Doff, told Daily Mail Australia that he estimated Chinese foreign investors made up approximately one in every 20 high-end residential property sales in Vaucluse. 'They tend to go for properties with the best views in town - iconic views of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House and anything of the harbour - and all up on top of the hill, so looking over everything. They like big blocks of land and tend to like new houses,' Mr Doff said. Mr Xu is is believed to have paid about $39 million for the Villa del Mare non-waterfront mansion . The prestigious home is positioned to take full advantage of the panoramic views of Sydney harbour . Its's sweeping courtyards and manicured gardens have been designed with a Mediterranean feel . Mr Doff revealed that in his experience, Chinese foreign investors often bough high end properties for anywhere between $5 million to $30 million and, more often than not, would buy up a property before it even hit the market. 'They prefer to buy things off market because they don't like competing,' Mr Doff said. He said he currently has about three 'really keen' Chinese families in his contact book through a number of Chinese agents that, 'if I found the right property for, they'd buy it in a heartbeat.' 'All the other agents that sell these top end properties probably have a collection of these buyers as well,' Mr Doff said. The home  features six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a number of living areas on 1500 square metres of land . An entertainment bar and an infinity pool are some of the more luxurious features of the home . Two of the more recent properties that Laing and Simmons Double Bay sold to foreign Chinese families include 9 Hillside Ave Vaucluse, which sold for $14 million in June, and 30 Kings Road Vaucluse, which was bought for $11.7 million last month. Paul Pfeiffer, from RT Edgar in Toorak, Victoria, told Daily Mail Australia that he is a strong advocate of Chinese national investment, claiming it leads to the creation of jobs and residential property development. '60 per cent of the properties that I sell over $5 million would be sold to either local Chinese buyers or Chinese nationals in the areas of Stonnington and Boroondara, which consist of suburbs such as Kew, Balwyn, Canterbury, Hawthorn and Toorak,' Mr Pfeiffer said. 'In my 20 years of experience in property, I have never sold a property to a Chinese national that has been left vacant, unless it is only a land purchase, where they are required under the foreign investment legislation to redevelop the property within six months. 'This ensures the creation of jobs for our workforce, which in turn helps stimulate our local economy.' LJ Hooker's real estate agents in Double Bay refused to reveal information regarding the sale or buyer . The previous owner of the property, recruitment agent Julia Ross, is listed as number 20 on BRW's Rich Women list, with an estimated wealth value of $65 million . The prestigious Villa del Mare features six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a number of living areas, a bar and an infinity pool all set on 1500 square metres of land. Its sweeping courtyards and manicured gardens have been designed with a Mediterranean feel while a full view of Sydney's Harbour can be found in almost every room. But despite all its glamour, the property has been on and off the market since 2011, when Ms Ross put it up for sale before hastily taking it down. Ms Ross bought the grand non-waterfront residence for $21.5 million in 2005 before finally committing to part with her home in August of this year. This year, the recruitment queens has moved up a spot to number 20 on BRW's Rich Women list, with an estimated wealth value of $65 million.","Xu Jianyin, the chairman of the real estate group Evergrande, is believed to have bought the Villa del Mare in October .

The pieces are almost exact copies of the real products and are extremely hard to distinguish. But they have not been subjected to the rigorous safety tests required by law and have no warnings or advice on the packaging. Police have seized dangerous fake Christmas toys worth £500,000 bound for stockings across the country . In one business unit, council trading standards officers and police recovered over 7,000 counterfeit Super Mario toys, over 350 fake Samsung and Galaxy mobile phones and 2,000 knock-off Disney Frozen loom band sets. In another, they seized 3,700 counterfeit toys, including 21 boxes of Frozen items, 20 boxes of Disney toys, 12 boxes of Spiderman toys and 10 of Toy Story. Salford's deputy mayor, Coun David Lancaster, said: 'It took officers eight transit van journeys, two combi van journeys and two trips in a people carrier just to remove all the items.

'They were unsafe as well as ripping off legitimate brands. I am delighted we have been able to take them out of circulation.' The goods came from two wholesalers in the Broughton area. Samples will now undergo safety testing. It comes after fake Frozen goods were seized by Nottinghamshire County Council's Trading Standards team  - including children's pyjamas, dolls, fancy-dress costumes, umbrellas,  watches, backpacks and blankets . It is suspected that a number of the items do not conform to EU safety regulations, including pyjamas and fancy-dress costumes that are unlikely to meet flammability guidelines . Due to the size of the seizure, trading standards officers say that prosecution of the companies is likely. It comes after a similar hundreds of 'lethal' fake Frozen toys and clothes were seized and destroyed in Nottinghamshire after concerns they could burst into flames and strangle children. The dodgy Disney items, including counterfeit dolls, umbrellas, watches, backpacks and blankets, were seized at a toy shop last week. Fancy dress costumes and pyjamas did not conform to 'flammability' standards and are likely to catch fire.

"The devastated mother of the millionaire Polish woman allegedly murdered by a British businessman in a Paris hotel room today demanded: 'Why did she have to die? Why didn't they just separate?' Halina Wolf broke her silence about the death of Kinga Legg, whose corpse was found in a bathtub of a £1000-a-night room at the world famous Bristol in May 2009. Ian Griffin, 45, is on trial this week in the French capital for killing the 36-year-old, and faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty. Scroll down for video . Halina Wolf broke her silence about the death of Kinga Legg (pictured), whose corpse was found in a bathtub of a £1000-a-night room at the world famous Bristol in May 2009 . Ian Griffin, 45, is on trial this week in the French capital for killing the 36-year-old, and faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty . Accused of murder: Ian Griffin is pictured with current fiancee Tracey Baker, who appeared on Dragon's Den . But, speaking from her home village of Tlokinia, west Poland, Ms Wolf told MailOnline: 'For the last five years we have been asking why she had to die. Every day we ask why. Why did it have to be her? We just don't understand it.' Wiping tears from her eyes, she said: 'It has been a terrible five years. And now it is all coming back again. All the tragedy and painful memories. We are furious that the trial has taken so long to come about. 'In Poland he (Griffin) would have been held in custody the whole time. But this man has been living freely in Cannes while we suffer here. He has been having his millionaire lifestyle.' Griffin, who denies the charge, fled the scene of the alleged murder, leaving a 'Do Not Disturb' scene on the couple's door, and driving back to England in a Porsche 911 sports car. Ms Legg is pictured here singing carols, aged 10, at her local church in her hometown of Tlokinia . Ms Legg ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year from Poland to major companies such as McDonald's, Tesco and Carrefour . The businessman, who is originally from Warrington, was arrested five days later in woodland outside Macclesfield, where he had been camping in a tent. A long extradition process meant he did not return to France until 2011, where he was initially locked up in some of the country's toughest jails. But – to the fury of Ms Legg's family – Griffin was controversially released on bail with an electronic tag in 2013 after complaining of extreme ill health. He not only moved into a series of luxury homes across France – including a villa in Cannes and a luxury home in a salubrious Paris suburb – but settled down with Tracy Baker, an old flame. Griffin told the Paris Assizes he had regularly slept with Ms Baker, 34, behind Ms Legg's back, and last summer had his first child with her. It is common for murder trials in France to take many years to get to court, but it is practically unheard of for alleged murderers to be allowed home. In response to Griffin's case, which started on Monday, Mrs Wolf said she was deeply unimpressed by the defendant's often repeated claim that he 'can't remember' how her daughter died, but that he guessed it must have been 'an accident'. Griffin told the court he could remember arguing with Ms Legg before her death, but 'blacked out' when they were back in their room in the Bristol.

Honoured: Kinga Legg's gravestone in the village of Tlokinia, central Poland . The accused said he went into 'a black hole' around the time of Ms Legg's death, and suffered 'from memory loss'. 'People can't remember what happened,' said the incredulous Mrs Wolf. 'Witnesses, him, no one.' Mrs Wolf said the couple 'could have separated'. The couple had a tempestuous relationship. The court has heard that a month before she was found dead, Griffin had attacked her. Kinga's friend Jane Carrigan said: 'On one occasion Kinga phoned me to say she had been badly beaten by Ian, and was in the bath trying to recover.' She said Kinga had claimed that Griffin had driven his Mercedes through the front door of their £3m house in Oxshott, Surrey, 'beat her then left'. The court had previously been told that on the night of her death both had argued and that Kinga had allegedly been upset at Griffin's failure to have sex with her. Also, the court heard that Kinga was prone to drunken fits of jealousy that could be 'very, very violent' when she learnt he had been unfaithful. But, when asked why they had not split up, Griffin told the court: 'When you love somebody, and get on really well, and some of it was my fault, you don't.' Ms Legg, who was briefly married to an English civil servant but still sometimes used the surname Woolf, first moved to Britain in 1995. She completed a course in International Trade at the University of Central Lancashire and – according to friends in Poland – always dreamed of marrying an 'English gentleman'. Ms Legg ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year from Poland to major companies such as McDonald's, Tesco and Carrefour. Her company, Vegex, had a UK base at the Oxshott executive mansion she rented with Griffin. The fruits of her massive business success included renting a £10,000-a-month yacht called Overdraft moored at Port Leucate marina in the south of France. This is the £1.2million yacht - Overdraft - Kinga Legg had booked to sail for a month but never set foot on . Mr Griffin, 45, drove his car into the front door of Ms Legg's £3million home  in Oxshott, Surrey, just weeks before she was found dead in a hotel room in the French capital in 2009 . She and Griffin were on their way down to the Riviera to stay on her before the fateful night at the Bristol. Ms Legg first met Griffin in a Cheshire wine bar in the late 90s when – sitting with a friend – the entrepreneur sent over a bottle of champagne. They met again in 2008 in Sandbanks, Bournemouth, and, within a year, were engaged to be married. An ex-boyfriend now working in a hotel in Kalisz, close to where Ms Legg grew up, and who asked to be identified only as Tomek told MailOnline: 'Kinga wasn't really interested in local boys. 'I wouldn't say she looked down on us but coming from the richest family in the area she clearly had her eyes on bigger fish.' At the time of her death, a Polish newspaper reported rumours that she had a secret love child. But a friend of the family rubbished the claims. The local government worker said: 'I can tell you 1000 percent she never had a secret pregnancy or secret baby.' Ms Legg moved to the UK after meeting Peter Legg when he was visiting Poland. Legg was there as a member of the local Town Twinning Committee for Preston Town Hall, which is twinned with Kalisz in west Poland, where Kinga was trying to interest businessmen in market garden produce. After returning to the UK, he and Kinga exchanged romantic letters for six months before she moved over to join him. Ms Legg was found floating in the bathtub of the couple's £1,000-a-night room with almost 100 bruises covering her body (file picture) They married soon afterwards at Blackpool Registry Office but divorced in 2003 after she had a brief fling with Cheshire hairdressing and property tycoon Harry Gaynon. The year before she had also met her next husband, Eric Kilby, the chief executive of Crown Wallpapers, while they were both working for tycoon Trevor Hemmings, whose interests include Littlewoods Pools, Blackpool Tower and CenterParcs. Kinga was working in the marketing department while he was running Crown Wallpapers, as well as being a director of one of Hemmings' finance companies. A married dad of two, he left his wife of 13 years and his two sons, and he and Ms Legg quickly became part of a moneyed crowd on Cheshire's social circuit. They married three years later in 2006 at a 14th century church in the village of Opatowek, Poland, next to where Kinga grew up, and built a house there. This week, locals in her home village said the house had been sold. After meeting Griffin again in 2008, Ms Legg left Mr Kilby broken-hearted by moving in with the smooth-talking entrepreneur who is now in court. Mrs Wolf said that she and Ms Legg's father, Jan Wolf, were asked to attend the Paris trial, but had refused because of his poor health. She said: 'He has a weak heart. He has been having heart problems ever since this happened. 'We were worried that if he went he would have a heart attack because of the stress of having to relive what happened that terrible night. It's very difficult.' Just up the road from the family home where Kinga grew up is the little Roman Catholic church she used to visit as a child, and during her return trips to meet her parents and brother Marek. Fitness fanatic: Mr Griffin posted this picture of himself on a social media site, explaining how he liked to keep in shape . In the small cemetery where she was laid to rest her grave is one of the largest. Nearly 12ft wide the grave has five wreaths and seven glass candle holders. To the left is a small photograph of Ms Legg above a simple inscription from Polish poet Franciszek Dionizy Kniaznin. It read: 'In different ways the heart demands. In different ways the mind thinks. In different ways the world sees. In different ways fortune rules.'

"A hanging 'paradise garden' crossing the Thames, complete with meandering walkways and lined with trees, is another 'Hillsborough disaster in the making', critics have claimed. A vision of London's garden pedestrian bridge, spanning the river between South Bank and Temple, has been granted planning permission by Westminster Council and is now set to be a reality. But critics of the £175 million walkway - designed by Thomas Heatherwick, the creator of the London 2012 Olympic cauldron, and backed by actress Joanna Lumley - have claimed it is an accident of Hillsborough proportions waiting to happen, and warned that people will be forced to 'jump in the Thames' to avoid being crushed. An image of London's £175 million garden pedestrian bridge - complete with avenues lined with trees, flowers and lush greenery - released by Thomas Heatherwick, the creator of the London 2012 Olympic cauldron, is now set to be a reality after it was granted planning permission . The plans were given the go-ahead last night at a packed public meeting. They must now be rubber-stamped by the Mayor of London and, if permission is granted, building will start late next year. The bridge will span the river between the South Bank and Temple station, and is due to open to the public in 2018. But concerns have been raised about visitor numbers around the South Bank, which could see 8,000 people an hour clambering to make their way across the walkway. Michael Ball, director of the Waterloo Community Development Group, told the Guardian: 'It's another Hillsborough disaster in the making. 'They're dropping a tourist attraction, with projected visitor figures second only to Disneyland Paris, into an area that already sees 25 million people a year. The police haven't even been consulted over crowd control. 'The numbers are potentially catastrophic. I can see people jumping into the river to avoid being crushed.' However, critics have raised concerns that the bridge may limit views of St Paul's Cathedral and other landmarks. A report drafted for the committee considering planning permission said there would be 'significant impact' on views and that if the plans were for a commercial development the application would likely be refused. Councillor Robert Davis, deputy leader of Westminster City Council, who chaired the committee, said: 'This is something that is iconic and absolutely unique, and will be recognised right across the world. 'I understand the concerns about potential loss of views, but there is no doubting that this bridge will bring substantial and significant benefits to London.' The bridge will span the river between the South Bank and Temple station, and is due to open to the public in 2018. They must now be rubber-stamped by the Mayor of London and, if permission is granted, building will start late next year . According to the Garden Bridge Trust website, the bridge is designed to be 'somewhere to meet and spend time, with education and volunteering opportunities so people can get their hands dirty, helping with the upkeep of this new community garden'. 'It will also provide a new link between cultural centres and tourist attractions on the north and south banks,' it says. It would be the first new crossing across the Thames since the 'wobbly' Millennium Bridge opened in 2002 and London's answer to New York's High Line, where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park. It is hoped the bridge will create 270 jobs, and provide better access for disabled people and children across the Thames. Of 292 responses to the planning consultation, 279 were in favour of the plans. The mayor's office has already pledged £30 million through Transport for London and another £30 million is due to come from the Treasury. The remainder of the total cost of £175 million will be made up by private donors, with £110 million already pledged. A spokesman for the trust said: 'The Garden Bridge Trust has undertaken a comprehensive transport assessment of demands for the bridge. This has been verified by independent consultants, appointed by South Bank stakeholders. 'The assessment has been subject to scrutiny by both London Borough of Lambeth and Westminster City Council. The Garden Bridge Trust will actively manage and monitor visitor levels and ensure the safety and comfort of those visiting the bridge and those adjacent and the bridge.' A vision of London's garden pedestrian bridge, spanning the river between South Bank and Temple, has been granted planning permission by Westminster Council and is now set to be a reality . But concerns have been raised about visitor numbers around the South Bank, which could see 8,000 people an hour clambering to make their way across the walkway . The Garden Bridge Trust plan to ask for donations from the public next year. Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said: 'I am delighted with the news that Westminster City Council has shown its support for the garden bridge and approved our plans. This iconic new project will create a new green space in the centre of London and will be enjoyed by all.' Concerns have also been raised about plans to ask large groups using the bridge to inform the Trust ahead of time. A spokesman for the Trust said: 'Like other public spaces, the Garden Bridge Trust will need to manage numbers to ensure the comfort and safety of users. 'As is common practice amongst operators of public space, the Trust feels there needs to be a mechanism in place to account for larger groups. 'An initial figure put forward was for groups of greater than eight people. This was an initial discussion point, and the Trust is working with stakeholders and the Local Planning Authority to develop our proposal and confirm the agreed numbers. 'Once this number is confirmed, groups of greater than that size visiting the bridge will be requested to inform the Trust of their visit. This will not be an 'advance booking' but a mechanism to allow the Trust to better manage the number of users. 'It is not about limiting people from using the bridge. It is to ensure those who do visit the bridge have the best and most enjoyable experience possible. 'The Garden Bridge will protect existing views, enhance others and provide new beautiful views up and down the river that are currently not possible.'","£175million bridge planned as an oasis of calm, complete with avenues lined with trees, flowers and lush greenery .

"Decades of illegal gold mining has turned vast swaths of Peruvian rainforest in to pocked, mercury-poisoned, desolate wastelands. In the south-eastern region of Madre de Dios, in the past decade alone, mining has stripped 230 square miles of forest and poisoned the rivers. It has left the area - a popular site for tourists and home to several tribes living in voluntary isolation - ruined and the lands scarred. Scroll down for video . Illegal mining in the Peruvian rainforest has left much of the region looking pocked, desolate and bare . A web of disused tubes lie in the dirt in the deserted wasteland in Peru's Madre de Dios south-east region . Peru is more than 60 per cent rainforest and only Brazil has a larger share of the Amazon jungle. Deforestation accounts for about 40 percent of Peru's greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to global warming. Trees absorb carbon dioxide through their leaves but as there are fewer trees, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat closer to the atmosphere which leads to the gradual rise in the earth's temperature. The South American country has lost an average of 113,000 hectares of forest every year since 2001, when 80,000 hectares were destroyed. Most of the destruction is done by illegal miners from outside the region, though thousands have left in recent months because of a government crackdown. Illegal mining is the second highest cause of deforestation in Peru, after clear-cutting for agriculture. The country has vowed to halt deforestation by 2021. Yet Peru's stewardship of its rainforest has been questioned by environmentalists, and deforestation appears to be on the rise. The issues were raised at the UN climate conference Peru is hosting until December 12. Peru is more than 60 per cent rainforest and only Brazil has a larger share of the Amazon jungle . An estimated 333,000 indigenous people live in the Peruvian rainforest - but their livelihoods are at stake because of the decades of illegal gold mining in the region that has destroyed much of the rainforest . Illegal gold mining has created a deep crater in the Madre de Dios region, which destroys plants and animals . A polluted river trickles from the Madre de Dios area - most of the destruction is done by illegal miners from outside the region . The indigenous groups that occupy the Peruvian Amazon have been hit hard by the deforestation . Peru's glaciers have lost more than one-fifth of their mass in just three decades . Higher alpine temperatures are killing off plant and animal species in cloud forests and scientists predict Pacific fisheries will suffer - indigenous people are also dependent on glacial run-off for hydro-power . Indigenous groups are often hard hit because they lack formal property title and are marginalised from the political and legal systems, unable to fend off encroachment on their land. An estimated 333,000 indigenous people live in the Peruvian Amazon and have campaigned with increasing vigour to protect areas that traditionally belong to them. In September, four leaders from the Ashaninka people were killed while campaigning against deforestation and for land rights.","Peru is 60 per cent rainforest - only Brazil has larger share of the Amazon .

"Almost £15million of public money has been paid out in compensation to immigrants unlawfully detained in the UK, official figures have revealed. The Home Office paid out the vast sum over the past three years alone, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire admitted. Former coalition minister Sarah Teather, who uncovered the figures, accused the Home Office of treating people inhumanely by detaining them indefinitely and costing the taxpayer millions in the process. Sarah Teather is chairing a cross-party inquiry into immigration detention and said evidence from former detainees had revealed the ‘hugely damaging’ cost of being held with no time limit . Ms Teather is chairing a cross-party inquiry into immigration detention and said evidence from former detainees had revealed the ‘hugely damaging’  cost of being held with no time limit. The Liberal Democrat MP said: ‘That the Home Office have had to pay out nearly £15 million over three years for breaking the law when detaining people shows that they are unable to even comply with their own rules. ‘The UK is the only country in the EU that doesn't have a time limit on how long people can be kept in immigration detention but it appears that the Home Office would sometimes rather detain people indefinitely than treat them humanely, even if this ends up costing the taxpayer millions of pounds. ‘But these figures shouldn't obscure the considerable emotional and mental cost that not knowing how long you might be detained for, or if you're going to be deported tomorrow, or moved hundreds of miles away to a different detention centre, has on detainees.' Mr Brokenshire said that in 2011-12  £4.5 million was paid out, with the figure rising to £5 million in 2012-13, before falling again to £4.8 million in 2013-14. The figures follow criticism of the Government's decision last month to allow outsourcing giant Serco to continue running a controversial immigration detention centre for women. Yarl's Wood in in Bedfordshire has faced heavy criticism by human rights campaigners amid reports of sexual misconduct by staff, women being detained for long periods and pregnant detainees being held without justification. After Greece, the UK made the highest use of detention for asylum seekers in Europe in 2013, with more than 30,000 asylum seekers spending some time in detention, with 2,796 detained as at December 31, a report by the Centre Forum think tank claimed last month. A security gguard patrols the corridors of Yarl's Wood, Europe's largest detention centre for asylum seekers . A Moroccan man was awarded damages for unlawful detention at a recent High Court case after the judge ruled eight of the 22 months he was held in immigration detention were unlawful. Mustafa Fardous won the case because the ‘purpose and reasonableness’ of his detention was not reappraised after a year. Mr Fardous had claimed asylum using a false name and falsely claimed that he was from the Western Sahara. He was detained after arriving in the UK in September 2009 and held until July 2011.","Home Office paid out the vast sum over the past three years alone .

"Here’s one home Santa will have no trouble spotting from his airborne sleigh. In fact, with more than 200,000 lights aglow, you can barely see the house at all. The decorations take Alex Goodhind, 30, five weeks to put up and add around £1,000 to the electricity bill at his home in Melksham, Wiltshire. But with the goodwill of his neighbours and visitors, he has used the impressive collection to raise around £15,000 over the years for a local hospice, Dorothy House, which treated his mother. Scroll down for video . Wonder: The amazing Christmas lights display in Melksham, Wiltshire, attracts hundreds of visitors every year . Mr Goodhind uses 1,900ft of electric cable for the display of lights, which have been collected for over a decade, as well as 70 waterproof connection boxes, 2,000 cable ties and 650ft of steel restraining wire. However, this year’s show could be the last. His father Colin said: ‘There’s so much work that goes into it that Alex feels it could be his last year. He takes time off work to do it all, working all day on it for five weeks. It’s such a big job. All the neighbours are very supportive.’ The lights usually go on every day at 5.30pm and off at 10pm ‘out of respect to his neighbours’. His father Colin said 'Alex does it to help the hospice that looked after his mum. There's a sizeable electricity bill afterwards  but it's all worth it' Magical: Mr Goodhind has spent more than £30,000 on his annual lights display over the last 17 years . Mr Goodhind, 30, is one of a number of residents on Longford Road in Melksham, Wiltshire, who decorate their houses for Christmas – often for charity. Speaking two years ago his neighbour Margaret Escott, 69, said: 'We do ours for the air ambulance as it is nice to give something back to the community. 'I think you could see Alex's display from space, there is not a part of that house which isn't covered in lights.' After raising £4,000 for the Dorothy House Hospice in 2009, Mr Goodhind took a two year break before reigniting the tradition in 2012. Inviting: A illumanated gate leans open revealing a path lit up by hundreds of decorations . Every year the electrician spends weeks meticulously creating what is now Britain's biggest Christmas lights display . With more than 200,000 lights hanging from his home and positioned around his garden, Mr Goodhind faces a whopping £1,000 electricity bill by the time the festive season rolls to an end . Despite the coachloads of visitors who flock to the suburban street to catch a glimpse of his display, he claims most neighbours are supportive of his decision to switch on the lights once again. In 2012 he said: 'Some of the neighbours might have been glad when we stopped, but I wanted to do it again, for Dorothy House. 'My mum was in there before she died, so I've always been keen to stick with them. Mr Goodhind has previously had to pay Southern Electricity a considerable sum to lay an industrial strength cable to his home to cope with the drain caused by the display. The lights go on every day from 5.30pm and Mr Goodhind has them switched off at 10pm ‘out of respect to his neighbours’.

"Make up giant Sephora's much-awaited first Australian store opening was overshadowed by a glaring typo on their Facebook page. If they were hoping to attract attention to the store's opening in Sydney on Friday, they certainly did so, but perhaps not in the way they were intending. On the store's 'Countdown to Beauty' hashtag, they missed the essential letter 'o' in count, leaving a particularly bad swear word on the page instead. The slip-up has caused plenty of laughter and no shortage of commentary on social media, with some even suggesting the slip-up was actually a case of 'any publicity is good publicity'. Scroll down for video . Getting your message across?

Mega cosmetics outlet Sephora has stores across the globe, including this one in Dubai . Most people remain unsure if the slip was a deliberate one, with Twitter user Trevor Gosbell writing: 'Come on, #c***downtobeauty has to be deliberate, doesn't it? This will end well'. Somewhat more critical, Keith Walsh tweeted: '#C***downtobeauty makes for an awkward opening for Sephora tomorrow #fail or #genius #notsure'. Many fans of the store simply took the typo into their stride, with some actually thanking the post for brightening up their day. 'Ehehe. This actually makes Sephora's opening even better,' Twitter user, Monkey, wrote. Most people remain unsure if the slip was a deliberate one, with Twitter user Trevor Gosbell tweeting the following . Many fans of the store simply took the typo into their stride, with some actually thanking the post for brightening up their day . 'I cont WAIT for Sephora to open in Sydney! Best fock up ever!!!' Miss Abigail tweeted. The slip was also reported by a wide range of media including Pedestrian TV, which described it as 'unfortunate' and blamed the fail on a 'presumably very recently employed social media manager', adding: 'Welcome to 'Straya, Sephora. We love a good Countdown here.' It wasn't missed on Mumbrella either: 'Whilst cosmetics store Sephora was looking to make a bit of a splash on social media for the opening of its new store in Sydney tomorrow, it probably wasn't banking on a botched hashtag to get the job done. 'Earlier this week the brand launched the #countdowntobeauty hashtag on its Facebook page. Unfortunately someone forgot to spell check it, and missed out the all important 'o' in count. Yep.' The slip-up has caused plenty of laughter and no shortage of commentary on social media . The Sydney store is just hours away from opening - its parent shop in Paris boasts six million visitors each year, more than the Eiffel Tower . But back to the cosmetics; boyfriends and husbands should brace themselves for the opening of a cosmetics vortex, where hours can be lost in a blur of lipsticks, lotions and potion. The store opens at midday on Friday. It will be the largest Sephora store in the Southern Hemisphere, with more expected to follow around Australia. Founded in France more than three decades ago, Sephora is akin to a lolly shop for beauty and cosmetics addicts. The company boasts its Champs-Elysees store in Paris receives six million visitors each year - that's more than the Eiffel Tower. As well as Sephora's own range, the Sydney store will stock brands like Marc Jacobs Beauty, Make Up For Ever and Kat Von D. Von D is in Sydney for the launch and will appear in store on Saturday to meet the first 300 shoppers who buy one of her products. 'This has been years of Australian girls like bitching at me about not being able to get this stuff shipped over here,' she said. Customers are treated to make-up by Sephora staff in the San Francisco store . 'I think people are going to love it. I think the only people who are going to hate it are probably the boyfriends waiting around while the girls spend three hours in there.' When she launched her cosmetics brand seven years ago, it was just four shades of red lipsticks. Now her Studded Kiss lipsticks are the number one sellers in Sephora US. Von D says the best beauty tip she can give people is to be sure of themselves. 'Confidence, to me, is the sexiest attribute you can have,' she said. When she is wearing make-up, Von D pairs her signature red lips (the metallic orange-based red Adora from her collection is her favourite) with a clean, cat eye. Despite the fact the store hasn't opened yet, Sephora Australia has more than 15,000 Instagram followers. Sephora already has about 1900 stores in 29 countries.","When is a countdown not a countdown?

"Women aged 40 to 59 have the highest rate of depression of any group in the US, with one in eight admitting they have suffered from the condition . Depression is most common among middle-aged women, with one in eight admitting they have suffered from the condition, health officials said. Women aged 40 to 59 have the highest rate of depression of any group in the US, but only one third of sufferers sought help from a health professional, according to the report. Researchers from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (CDC) found 9.5 per cent of females and 5.6 per cent of males aged 12 and older had moderate or severe depression. The report also found that 15 per cent of people living in poverty had depression, meaning they were more than twice as likely to have the condition. Laura Pratt, a CDC epidemiologist who led the study, said: 'Not enough people are getting appropriate treatment for depression. 'People with severe depression should be getting psychotherapy. Some might need complicated medication regimens, which psychiatrists are better equipped to do, which makes it even more concerning that only 35 percent of people with severe depression have seen a mental health professional,' she said. Depression is a serious medical condition that can affect people's mood and their cognitive functions, such as concentration and decision-making abilities, and even their physical well-being. Almost 8 per cent of Americans aged 12 and older were moderately to severely depressed during 2009 to 2012, when the research took place. The rate of depression increased with age, with 5.7 per cent of youth ages 12 to 17 reporting symptoms, but 9.8 percent of adults aged 40 to 59 saying they have the condition. Pensioners and those aged over 60 had a lower rate of than other age groups, with 5.4 per cent saying they suffered with depression. Researchers evaluated whether participants had depression by conducting in-person interviews and asking about their symptoms. In the study, nearly 90 per cent of people with severe depressive symptoms reported having difficulty at home, with work or in their social activities. Almost half of the people who had mild depression reported having the same difficulties. Simon Rego, director of psychology training at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was disappointed with the numbers seeking treatment. The report also found that 15 per cent of people living in poverty had depression, meaning they were more than twice as likely to have the condition . 'Much of the information is not new or surprising,' he said. 'What's disappointing, however, is the fact that the rates of treatment have remained so low.' 'This is a problem because more severe depression leads to more serious difficulties in work, home and social activities, and people rarely experience remission without treatment. 'Even for those who manage to recover naturally, we know that the risk of recurrence is higher if mild symptoms remain during the remission and the last episode was severe. 'Clearly much more work needs to be done to educate the public on the symptoms of depression, the major impact it can have on one's functioning, and the benefits of seeking an appropriately trained mental health professional.' The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. But as a general rule, if you are depressed, you feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. Symptoms of depression may include the following: .","One in eight women aged 40 to 59 in the US admitted having depression .

"Former brewery boss Lord Hodgson, pictured, has blamed the increasing size of Britain's Muslim population for the growing rate of pub closures . A Tory peer, who is a former brewery boss, has claimed that the closure of many British pubs is partly due to an increase in the size of the country's Muslim community. Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, who is a former director of pub chain Marston's, said pubs are closing in areas with growing Muslim communities. Speaking in the Lords, Lord Hodgson said: 'Twenty-five years ago, the company of which I was a director would have operated probably a dozen pubs in Kidderminster, the home of the carpet trade. The carpet trade has gone and there are three pubs left. 'In areas of Nottingham, Leicester, Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham the increase in the Muslim population who don't drink leads to many pub closures. 'It is exceptionally hard for a publican who has put 10 years of his life into trying to build up a business to accept the inevitability of these tides of history.' He said the issue was one of the three main reasons pubs were going out of business, along with the 'inexorable rise of regulation' and the availability of low price alcohol in supermarkets. He added: 'The reasons for closure may be portrayed as rapacious owners increasing rent wishing to profit by turning pubs into houses or corner stores, but the tide is running against the ordinary pub.' Lord Hodgson said there was a danger companies would not invest in improving pubs if landlords could opt out of tied arrangements. 'No pub owner is going to invest many thousands of pounds, hundreds of thousands of pounds in some cases, if the tenant can then walk away from supplier agreements,' he said. He said removing the tie would remove the 'ladder' by which many people could become self-employed landlords. Lord Hodgson criticised a Commons decision allowing pub tenants to opt-out of agreements with their landlords to provide beer. He said he was disappointed that the Government will not seek to overturn their Commons defeat. The defeat happened after MPs backed a cross-party amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill. Lord Hodgson said pubs are under threat in areas such as Leeds, Nottingham, Leicester and Birmingham . Business Minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe said the government would accept the principle of the amendment and include it in the legislation in a workable fashion. However, leaders of Britain's Muslim community criticised Lord Hodgson's comments. Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters, an organisation which is inter-faith and anti-extremist, told the Independent: 'It is quite ridiculous to blame Muslims for the closure of pubs when in fact the consumption and marketing of alcohol has also changed over time. What is also clear is that some pubs have been successful and others have not been able to generate customers and clients.' Nasima Begum, of the Muslim Council of Britain added: 'It is surprising and disappointing for Lord Hodgson to scapegoat Muslims for the failure of his business. What next? Muslims to be blamed for a fall in pork scratchings sales? We have come to a stage where it is easy for those in prominent positions to make their points at the expense of Muslims.'","Lord Hodgson said pubs were closing in areas like Leicester and Leeds .

"A median income family will pay an average total of $245,340 to raise a child from birth up until the time they graduate from high school. And a large chunk of that sum will be eaten up by childcare. A study by Child Care Aware - a group that provides resources to parents and caregivers - that was published by CNN Money on Thursday showed that about 15 per cent of a two-parent family's median income will go to daycare. The most affected areas in the United States are in the northeast. On average, a family in Massachusetts are spending $16,549 per child, per year for childcare. Extreme: A new study by Child Care Aware shows that parents are paying more for childcare each year than they are for college tuition . Forever rising: A recent Brookings Institution analysis of consumer price data showed that costs of services continue to rise fast but income levels (dotted line) move much slower. Childcare (blue) was the steepest . Literally through the roof: The cost of childcare has increased so exponentially between 1990 and 2013 that it doesn't even fit on this chart . Families in New York are the hardest hit, paying an average of 16 per cent of their combined yearly income. The situation is understandably worse for families at the poverty line, who can spend up to 85 percent of their income on childcare. Prices are somewhat lower in the south, with Louisiana coming in at the cheapest, devoting only 7 per cent of their income to having their children looked after. The study determined that of the 50 American states, 30 of them are paying more for childcare each year than they are college tuition. The results come after a recent Brookings Institution analysis of consumer price data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which were published by The Huffington Post. A chart from the analysis shows that while income has slowly increased from 1990 to 2013 - taking a minor plunge around 2008 during the GFC - the price of goods and services have risen steeply. The most concerning increase was childcare. Pricey: On average, a family in Massachusetts are spending $16,549 per child, per year for childcare . In one of the charts, the increase was so severe over the last 23 years it did not fit on the graph. However - and thankfully - the childcare on the chart includes elementary, high school and college tuition and fees, as well as child care and nursery school, The HuffPost reported. Not listed on the charts are factors that are cutting into income more than ever, such rent, legal and professional services, and hotel rates. 'These large sectors and the high prices they charge are contributing heavily to the slipping economic position of American households,' the Brookings analysts wrote.","Study by Child Care Aware found people in 30 of the 50 states are paying more in childcare each year than in college tuition .

"In the dark world of George Orwell 1984, the ‘proles’ are forced to read meaningless poetry written by a computer. It might seem like a far-fetched scenario, but Orwell may have touched upon a future trend when he published his novel in 1949. Today, computers can do anything from interact with humans to predict their behaviour – and one could someday become the next poet laureate. The site lets you play a game titled 'bot or not' to see if you can distinguish if a poem was written by a computer or a human . The Bot or Not website, created by Australians Benjamin Laird and Oscar Schwartz, reveals just how adept computers have become at writing poetry. The site lets you play a game titled ‘bot or not’ to see if you can distinguish if a poem was written by a computer or a human. It describes itself as a ‘Turing test for poetry’ and once you select your answer, it will reveal how the chosen poem was created. The site describes itself as a 'Turing test for poetry' and once you select your answer will reveal how the chosen poem was created . In 1950, Alan Turing devised the Turing test as a way of verifying machine intelligence. The Turing test is a proposed a situation in which a human judge talks to both a computer and a human through a computer terminal. The judge cannot see the computer or the human, but can ask them questions via the computer. Based on the answers alone, the human judge has to determine which is which. For instance, more than three-quarters of quiz-takers incorrectly predicted that that Deanna Ferguson’s ‘Cut Opinion’ was written by a machine. ‘Computer generated poetry means different things to different people,’ according to the website. ‘What we mean by “computer-generated poetry” is: text, that is generated through an algorithm, which is executed by a digital, electronic computer, which is intended, by whoever it may be, to be read as poetry.’ Computer-generated poems can be written using a variety of techniques. For instance, developers have created a machine-learning algorithm capable of collaborating with Shakespeare. It isn't just poetry generated in human form that is gaining popularity. In December, Stanford University held its first code poetry slam to reveal the literary side of computer code . The machine-learning software, dubbed ‘Fluency’, analyses the style of Shakespeare's sonnets. Developer Nathan Mathias was then able to write a new sonnet choosing words from the suggestions generated by the algorithm. ‘As might be expected from an artificial intelligence, the result is full of mixed metaphors,’ Mr Matias said, writing in SwiftKey’s blog. As well as using SwiftKey’s engine, Mr Matias also built a visual interface to help in poetry creation and named this project ‘Swift-Speare.’ Using this interface, he was able to co-create poetry in the style of various authors including William Gibson and John Denham.

She then stopped speaking and ran the script, which prompted the computer program to read a stream of words from Psalm 23 out loud three times, each one in a different pre-recorded-computer voice. Ms Wu said the slam proved computers can be poetic, and as the Bot or Not website proves, it’s not always easy to tell the difference between man and machine.","'Bot or Not' site was created by Benjamin Laird and Oscar Schwartz .

"It might be the festive season but the pet hate of most Australians when they're dining out is parents not making sure their children are well behaved, 70 per cent in fact. The dining etiquette of Australians are revealed along, with some rather annoying habits that make other diners see red, in a new survey by Yumtable.com.au.

"Accidents in the hours of darkness on built up roads where there is street lighting have fallen by nearly a fifth . Lives are being put at risk because motorists are increasingly being ‘left in the dark’ by council bosses switching off street lights to save money, a damning report by the AA reveals. The rise in unlit roads is posing an increasing danger to motorists, pedestrians and cyclists, it says highlighting how councils are creating early morning ‘blackouts’ as an economy measure. It said accident rates on blacked-out town and city roads – particularly 40mph zones in bad weather - are getting ‘much worse’ and proving to be ‘a growing menace.’ Discontent is growing so much that the AA predicts a ‘blackout backlash’ at the next election as local residents protests against councils of all political hues. The AA cited Government figures showing that over the past five years, general improvements in road safety has seen accidents in hours of darkness on built-up roads where there is street lighting fall by nearly a fifth (18.6per cent|) overall, and by a quarter (24per cent) in the wet, snow and ice. But where street lights were off or not present, the reduction was just 12per cent overall and 16.7per cent in bad weather. The AA added that the situation was worse on faster roads. Since 2008, night-time accidents on street-lit 40mph sections have dropped 24.1per cent overall and by nearly a third (30.4per cent) in wet, snow or icy conditions. But accidents are down only 10.4per cent on both counts where street lights were off or not present. The AA highlights that since 2009 there have been six fatalities that coroners have ‘partly or wholly blamed on the switching off of street lights.’ The AA report says: ‘Accident rates on unlit town and city roads continue to get worse. This winter, however, discontent with street-light blackouts threatens a backlash in next year’s elections.’ It notes; ‘Evidence is growing of a potential political backlash – particularly to the north and east of London. ‘Discontent with the street light switch-off has provided a rallying point for local political opposition, petitions, and e-petitions, such as the Government’ s website and the Right to Light campaign in Kent.’ The AA said the five worst councils for street lighting in this year's National Highways and Transport Network public satisfaction survey all operate a street light ‘blackout’ during the early hours of the morning. Essex County Council was bottom of a league of 78 councils with a score of 45.1per cent. Hertfordshire County Council was second with 51.7per cent, followed by South Gloucestershire with 56.5per cent , Buckinghamshire County Council with 58per cent, Suffolk County Council with 58.7per cent, Cheshire East (58.9 per cent), Shropshire (59.5 per cent), Leicestershire (60 per cent), Hertforsdshire (61.8 per cent) and Torbay (61.9 per cent). By contrast, Blackpool, which has fitted energy-saving LED street lights through a Community Lighting Partnership, topped the street-light satisfaction league with a score of 75.8per cent . It is followed by Wakefield (73.9 per cent), Derby (73.4 per cent), Sunderland (73.2 per cent), Nottingham (73 per cent), Knowsley (72.7 per cent), Aberdeenshire (72.1 per cent), Middlesbrough72.0per cent), South Tyneside (72.0 per cent), and Darlington (71.3 per cent). AA president Edmund King said: ‘New official road safety statistics show that accident rates on blacked-out town and city roads are not getting better. In fact, on 40mph roads, they are getting much worse - particularly in bad weather. ‘This is the type of road where most of the fatalities, for which coroners blamed street-light switch-offs as a contributory factor, happened.’ Mr King said: ‘You have to wonder if many councils fully appreciate the difficulties and concern their street light blackouts create for their electorates, particularly those who commute or drive early in the morning. The AA report says ‘Accident rates on unlit town and city roads continue to get worse' ‘For instance, Hertfordshire County Council’s policy review found that the first and last trains of the day required travellers to walk to and from the station in the pitch black . Little wonder perhaps that counties on the outskirts of the capital, where workers have to get going very early or late to beat the rush, are seeing such a strong backlash.’ Mr King added: ‘We would ask that, as a priority, the lights go back on along 40mph or faster roads in built-up areas. ‘Crash investigators in inquests have consistently stated that drivers who keep to the speed limit on those roads have little or no chance of missing pedestrians that suddenly appear out of the dark.’ ‘If not, with national and local elections looming, putting cost-savings before road safety hands political opponents a strong populist position to argue on the doorsteps . ‘We will see if Mondeo Man and the bellwether electorate of Basildon make Essex the ‘heart of darkness’ in the electoral battle over councils switching off street lights.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Public safety is our first priority. The department provides advice to local authorities on factors they need to consider in managing street lighting, but they are best placed to decide exactly where it is needed.’","Accidents have fallen by nearly a fifth on built-up roads with street lighting .

"An army veteran who served in Northern Ireland and Bosnia for almost 10 years and became homeless claims he was told he is not on a council's 'priority list' because 'he doesn't have a drink or drug problem'. Matthew Dennis, 39, has already been forced to sleep rough once and is now concerned he could end up having to sleep on the streets again. The former Lance Corporal claims he was told by Bournemouth District Council that as he does not have a drink or drug problem he is not on their 'priority list' for accommodation so has been left homeless. In failing to find him a home the authority also is not following the armed forces covenant, which was introduced by the Ministry of Defence, to ensure service personnel are not disadvantaged by being in the army. Scroll down for video . Army veteran Matthew Dennis has been left homeless after he claims Bournemouth District Council said he was not on a priority list for housing in the area because he does not have a drink or drugs problem . Under the covenant authorities are required to give priority to help former service personnel find housing. Bournemouth District Council claimed this did not apply after veterans had been out of the army for five years - but the Ministry of Defence said there is no time limit on the covenant. Mr Dennis said: 'I do feel let down.' 'I went to the council for help. They said since I don't have any problems with drugs or alcohol, I am not a priority.' Mr Dennis was evicted from his rented flat last week after losing his job as a kitchen fitter which he worked as since leaving the armed forces in 2000. He lost his job after the company went into liquidation. He is currently being put up in a bed and breakfast, at a cost of £95 a week - which is being paid for by Homes4Heroes. David Wood, a co-ordinator for the charity said: 'Matthew spent a few days sleeping rough before coming to us. He doesn't know the benefits system. He has worked all his adult life and has served his country for nine years and this is the first time he has needed help. 'At first a guy in the housing office said there was a place available but he had to go and check with his supervisor. When he came back 10 minutes later he was told he was not a priority case as he was not vulnerable. 'There was no more assistance offered. I was disgusted. David Wood (left) from Homes4Heroes said Bournemouth District Council should help the ex-serviceman . 'The Armed Forces Covenant outlines a duty of care our society owes our armed services, who have represented the country. 'Part of that duty is to ensure they are a priority for housing when they are vulnerable, as they are when they are on the streets exposed to the elements and attacks by others.' Mr Wood said the charity only has limited resources to pay to help ex-servicemen and women with housing. He said he believes Bournemouth District Council should be following the Armed Forces Covenant to help the 39-year-old. Mr Dennis claims he was told he was not a priority for housing by Bournemouth District Council . Bournemouth council claimed Mr Dennis was provided with advice and offered the option of applying for supported housing and refused, although he denies this, saying little useful information was provided. Kelly Ansell, the council's senior strategic housing manager, said the homeless were assessed on a case-by-case basis. She said: 'When specifically dealing with former HM Forces personnel our decisions take account of the military covenant and homelessness legislation which was applied in this case. 'Mr Dennis has the right to request a review of the decision made and we would be happy to re-visit the discussion on his housing options with him.' A spokesman for the council said  the officer has considered vulnerability according to the homelessness legislation, and specifically considered whether the applicant is a ‘Vulnerable former members of the armed forces’. They said he would not have been told he was not considered a priority because of a drink or drug problem.","Matthew Dennis served in army for nine years becoming Lance Corporal .

"Rachael Regan is pictured leaving court today after she was found guilty of child cruelty after carrying out a five month campaign of bullying against a girl . A classroom assistant who taped a seven-year-old girl to a chair locked her in a storeroom and taunted her has been found guilty of child cruelty. But despite carrying out the five month campaign where she 'singled out and bullied' the child, Rachael Regan has been told by a judge she will not go to prison. The 43-year-old carried out a catalogue of bullying against the child which included tying her shoes on with string, hiding her doll and pulling her photograph off a wall before she tore it up. The girl also said she had post it notes put on her thumbs to stop her sucking them. A jury of four men and eight women at Bradford Crown Court took less than four hours to find Regan guilty of child cruelty towards the child, who was a pupil at a school in Calderdale, west Yorkshire. But the judge said as there had been such a long delay in hearing the case about the bullying, which started in 2012, Regan would not go to prison. Deborah McDonald, 41, a teacher at the school, was cleared. Simon Waley, prosecuting, told the court how the school had launched an investigation and police after the child told her mother she had been taped to a chair. Mr Waley said: 'She said that Mrs Regan put it all around the chair and it was hard breathing. She said that she couldn't get out to reach her things. 'She said that the whole class were laughing.' The girl's mother described the moment her daughter told her a teaching assistant had taped her to a chair as 'heartbreaking.' The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the jury the young girl 'clung' to her 'for dear life' with tears streaming down her face after the incident. She said: 'It was just so heartbreaking to see her like that because (she) is so bubbly and outgoing and I have never seen my daughter so upset. She just clung to me for dear life.' She told the court: '(My daughter) said one of the teachers had Sellotaped her to the chair and that all her class friends were laughing at her. She said 'They all thought I was funny. I was the clown. They all laughed at me.''' Mr Waley also told the trial how the girl also told police that Regan had bound string to her legs and feet to keep her pumps on. He said: 'She said it was horrible and that, again, everybody had been laughing.' The bullying took place between September 2012 and January last year. Mr Waley told the court that other staff members at the school told police they had witnessed some of the incidents. A jury at Bradford Crown Court took less than four hours to find Regan guilty of child cruelty . One support assistant said the girl's arms were 'fastened down by her sides with the Sellotape around her more than once' and said she was taped to the chair for around 10 minutes. She said Regan went to another classroom to fetch another teaching assistant to show her what she had done. Deborah McDonald is pictured leaving court today after being cleared of a charge of child cruelty . Mr Waley said Regan told her colleague: 'She'll not get up and wander around the classroom now.' He said Regan pulled a photograph of the girl off the wall and ripped it to pieces in front of her. Regan had told the court that some of the incidents had been well intentioned and a 'bit of fun.' Mr Waley said: 'In relation to some of (the incidents), the defence accept that they occurred but say that they were not malicious but rather well-intentioned and good-humoured incidents in which (the girl) had been a participant in the humour.' Judge Neil Davey QC told Regan, of Illingworth, West Yorkshire, she will not go to prison when she is sentenced on January 8. He said he was concerned about the length of time between the time of the incident and the trial. The judge added that the young girl, who has not been identified and is now nine, had waited 'a quarter of her lifetime' to give evidence about what had happened and that Regan had spent more than a year on bail before she was charged. Judge Davey said that he had decided not to pass a custodial sentence because of the delays. Regan said 'Thank you' to the judge, who gave her bail until the sentencing hearing. McDonald held her head in her hands after she was cleared and the two women hugged after they left the dock. They left the court building together with supporters.","Rachael Regan, teaching assistant, is guilty of child cruelty against pupil .

"Scotland's drink drive limits will change at one minute past midnight tonight with motorists banned from having consumed more than 30mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood (file image) The drink drive limit in Scotland will be significantly lowered tonight while the law in England stays the same. From one minute past midnight tonight, motorists crossing the border must not have more than 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, thirty milligrams less than the limit in England. While the change has been welcomed by anti-drink driving campaigners, an overwhelming majority of drivers said having different limits across the UK was a bad idea. Eighty-one per cent of those polled said they would rather see the same laws apply across Britain, according to the motor services company RAC, with forty per cent calling for the limit in England to be reduced. Almost a quarter of the 2,607 asked suggested a blanket ban on drink-driving as a whole, no matter how much alcohol drivers had consumed, while 92 per cent added having different limits in England and Scotland will be confusing for motorists. Electronic signs and posters have been put up at service stations and on roads across England in a bid to let drivers know about the change. Scotland's Justice Secretary Michael Matheson welcomed the change today. 'Alcohol at any level will impair your ability to drive - even at the new limit you are three times more likely to die in a crash than with no alcohol in your system. 'This will bring Scotland into line with most of Europe. The evidence from the Republic of Ireland, which has brought in the same lower limit, suggests we will see convictions go down, reductions in drink-driving and lower blood alcohol counts. 'We are leading the way across the UK - the new limit has backing from experts, road safety campaigners and the majority of the public north and south of the border. 'When it comes to drinking and driving our advice is simple - it’s just not worth it. Don’t put lives at risk, the best approach is to have no alcohol at all.' Figures released by Transport Scotland earlier this year revealed there had been 440 alcohol related roadside accidents in 2012. More than 500 casualties were a result of such incidents, with 10 people dying in drink-fuelled collisions. Tennent's, Scotland's largest brewer, is supporting the new laws in the run up to Christmas. From tonight motorists crossing the border will face tougher laws on drink drive limits (file image) 'Tennent’s takes its position on alcohol responsibility very, very seriously. 'We’re completely aligned with the Government’s position in terms of drink-driving and the alcohol limits that are being introduced. 'The industry as a whole takes the position with regard to alcohol responsibility very, very seriously. 'In reality we’ve been preparing for this measure over a couple of years. 'You will have seen a growth in the no- and low-alcohol categories, not as a direct consequence of the drink-driving legislation but just in terms of brewers and alcohol producers producing new categories to broaden choice on behalf of consumers.' Last week Sussex and Surrey Police announced they would reveal the details of drivers who failed the 'walk the line' drink drive test on Twitter. Those charged with alcohol related offences will be 'named and shamed' by the forces in a joint campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of driving while under the influence.

"The US birth rate fell to an all-time low in 2013, continuing a downward trend that started six years earlier. According to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American women gave birth to 3,932,181million babies last year, down one percent from 2012 and nine percent from 2007 when birth rates hit a record high. Women ages 15-44 delivered the lowest number of babies last year at a rate of 62.5 births per 1,000. Record low: American women gave birth to 3,932,181million babies last year, down less than one per cent from 2012 and 9 per cent from 2007 . By comparison, 4.32million children were welcomed into the world in the US seven years ago. The government has been tracking US birth rates since 1909, when there were 126.8 births per 1,000 women. As birth rates among women in their 20s continued to decline, for women ages 35 and older 2013 was a banner year marked by the highest number of deliveries in a half century. In 2013, the birth rate for women ages 35-39 reached 49.3 births per 1,000, and 98 births for women ages 30–34. As medical researchers continued to make strides in fertility treatments and gynecology, women in their late 40s have seen an increase in birth rates from 0.7 to 0.8 per 1,000 - a 14 per cent increase from 2012. The birth rate among teenagers plummeted 10 per cent from 2012, hitting 26.5 births per 1,000, and rates also dropped by 3 per cent for women ages 20-24. Women ages 15-44 delivered the lowest number of babies last year at a rate of 62.5 births per 1,000 . The lower birth rates among women under the age of 30 and higher birth rates among women in their 40s could be attributed to the fact 20-somethings are delaying pregnancy to focus on their careers. William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, told the New York Times the fertility rates are tied to the country's economic climate. 'On just about every demographic indicator involving young adults, whether it’s marriage, buying a home or delaying childbearing, it’s all been on hold since the beginning of the recession,' he said. 'I think it’ll come back up, and each time new numbers are coming out, I think maybe this will be the moment.' The year 2013 was also marked by a slight increase in the number of twins born in the US and a 1 per cent decline in the number of premature babies. The Cesarean delivery rate also slid 1 percent from 2012, to 32.7 per cent. C-section births hit an all-time high in 2009 but have been on the decline for the past four years. General fertility rates were down one per cent for African-Americans and 2 per cent for Hispanic women, but inched up for white women.","American women gave birth to 3,932,181million babies last year, down  one per cent from 2012 and 9 per cent from 2007 .

"Construction workers dressed in white hazmat suits and accompanied by bulldozers descended Thursday on a trash-strewn California creek bed in the heart of Silicon Valley to begin clearing away one of the nation's largest homeless camps. About 50 mud-splattered, angry men and women dragged their few worldly possessions out of their tents and ramshackle huts, known collectively as The Jungle, and walked alongside a busy San Jose highway, startling passers-by who slowed down to watch. ‘People drive by and look at us like we're circus animals,’ said a sobbing Nancy Ortega. Tearing down the Jungle: Workers dismantle a dwelling at a Silicon Valley homeless encampment known as The Jungle on December 4 in San Jose, California, in the heart of affluent Silicon Valley . American shantytown: The Jungle had been one of the nation's largest homeless encampments, a cluster of flimsy tents and plywood shelters that once housed more than 200 people . Defiant: Valentine Cortes, a journeyman construction worker pictured with a 6-week-old puppy in his hands, said he had no plans to leave his makeshift shelter . Strong messages: Mercy Wong, left, and Shaunn Cartwright, right, protest the dismantling of the shantytown. The encampment, only a few minutes away from the city's downtown district, was home to people forced out of an overheating rental market . Breaking up the family: Yolanda Gutierrez, a 2-year resident of the homeless encampment, holds a sign in protest . Emotional: One of The Jungle's residents wept as bulldozers moved on the Silicon Valley homeless encampment . Massive undertaking: It will take several days to haul out tons of garbage and debris from the site . More than 30 police officers and dozens of cleanup workers in white hazmat suits joined about 15 social-service workers in the effort to dismantle the filthy, rodent-infested community that at its peak housed as many as 350 people living in squalor just a short drive from tech giants Google, Apple, Yahoo and eBay. Ortega shuddered and clutched her fleece blanket while watching tractors cram couches, tents, blankets, rotten food and pails of excrement into roaring garbage trucks. ‘It's just junk to everyone else but to us, that's home. That's our stuff,’ she said. On a nearby sidewalk, Al Palaces, a former truck driver who settled into the encampment about eight months ago, said he was trying to think of a plan. ‘I just grabbed whatever I could because I don't want to go to jail,’ he said, standing next to an overloaded shopping cart stuffed with dirty plastic bags. For months, social workers have been trying to resettle camp dwellers. And four days earlier, they were warned they had until dawn Thursday to leave or face arrest for trespassing. Still, city officials estimated about 60 people remained at the filthy site when cleanout day came. After a rainy night, skies cleared Thursday, and one person after another in varying states of mental clarity and sobriety hauled away their meagre belongings in suitcases, shopping carts and on bicycles through ankle-deep sludge. Living in squalor: The square-mile camp was strewn with rotten food and pails of excrement, and crawling with rats . Ultimatum: Social workers have been trying to resettle camp dwellers for months. Four days earlier, they were warned they had until dawn Thursday to leave or face arrest for trespassing . What's next: Officials found shelter for about 10 residents Thursday. Many more refused the city's offers, citing concerns about safety at homeless shelters, their need to stay with pets and their dislike of sobriety rules . Displaced persons: One person after another in varying states of mental clarity and sobriety hauled away their meagre belongings in suitcases, shopping carts and on bicycles . Restoring the landscape: Heavy machinery will be used to fill in excavated areas where people had been living underground . Supporters: A few dozen protesters gathered at the site holding signs reading ‘Homeless people matter’ and ‘Stand with The Jungle’ By midmorning, dozens had reached the sidewalk, abandoning most of their possessions. But some still remained in the wooded slum. Valentine Cortes, who said he was a journeyman construction worker, said he had no plans to leave his makeshift shelter built into a steep, muddy slope. ‘I don't know why people got all chaotic today,’ he said. ‘We don't have to go.’ Asked about the warning that he could be jailed, Cortes shrugged, pet a 6-week old puppy in his palm and said, ‘Then I guess I'll be arrested.’ Dogs and cats still roamed the square-mile camp, some of them pets, others wild. Rats scurried through the muck. A few dozen protesters gathered at the site holding signs reading ‘Homeless people matter’ and ‘Stand with The Jungle.’ The encampment stands in stark contrast to the surrounding valley, a region that leads the country in job growth, income and venture capital. Palaces said he liked the Jungle better than the streets because people would bring food and police didn't bother the residents. ‘Even a job wouldn't give me a house’ because housing prices are so high, he said. Officials found shelter for about 10 residents Thursday, said San Jose homelessness response manager Ray Bramson. Many more refused the city's offers, citing concerns about safety at homeless shelters, their need to stay with pets and their dislike of sobriety rules. Several homeless-assistance groups also stepped in to help. HomeFirst, the largest provider to homeless people in Santa Clara County, set aside 27 beds at a nearby shelter. Another 50 beds are open in a separate cold-weather shelter. ‘This feels terrible,’ said Jenny Niklaus, HomeFirst's chief executive officer, her voice breaking. ‘People are up to their calves in the mud dragging their stuff into the street.’ San Jose police tell two-year resident Johnny Valenzuela carrying a water jug to vacate his makeshift dwelling . Strange memento: A mask lies along a path at the camp in San Jose, not far from the headquarters of tech giants . After a rainstorm, residents of the camp walked barefoot in ankle-deep mud, dragging their suitcases and bags from the shantytown . Left with nothing: About 50 mud-splattered, angry men and women dragged their few worldly possessions out of their tents . Keeping the faith: A copy of the Bible sits in a pile of garbage during the massive cleanup operation . His own ten commandments: Enrique Avalos holds up a sign invoking Facebook, Hurricane Katrina and President Obama . San Jose has spent more than $4million over the last year and a half to solve problems at the encampment and has housed some 135 people from the site. But it's become increasingly polluted and dangerous. In the last month, one camp resident tried to strangle someone with a cord of wire. Another was nearly beaten to death with a hammer. And state water regulators are demanding that polluted Coyote Creek, which cuts through the middle, get cleaned out. Personal property confiscated Thursday was to be stored for 90 days before being disposed of in March. The last time officials cleared out the camp was in May 2012, when about 150 people were sent away. But this time Bramson said they will conduct regular patrol to keep anyone from returning. Dismantling the Jungle is a massive job. It will take several days to haul out tons of garbage and debris. Heavy machinery will be used to fill in excavated areas where people had been living underground. For some, the sudden abandonment of so many improvised homes was a boon. Homeless: More than 300 residents of the Silicon Valley shantytown known as 'The Jungle' had been given notices to leave the area by December 4.

Dau Nguyen muttered to himself as he picked through a trash heap, pausing to wash some of the items in an aluminum-foil bin. ‘I wait for somebody to leave,’ Nguyen said, ‘and then everything is mine.’ Jennifer Loving, executive director of Destination Home, who has been working to house homeless people in the area, warned residents they had to get out when she toured the camp last week - even though there was 'nowhere for them to go'. 'We don't have the housing. We can't magically create it.' 'There's nowhere for them to go,' she added. But Scott Wagers, a pastor who runs a support organization for the homeless, said the forced evacuation of what he described as 'a crime syndicate ruled by gangs, where the police do not enter', will lead the evicted to restore their camp elsewhere. He explained 'The Jungle' was developed two years after the evacuation of another slum in San Jose.

He believes San Jose should give land for 'camping legally' and larger neighbors technology groups, including Apple, should donate in order 'to solve the problem for good. ' The city has one of the highest numbers of homeless people in the country and more than 5,000 sleep on the streets, in parks and under freeways in the area. A spokesman for the city of San Jose, David Vossbrink, said an 'urgent' evacuation was necessary, citing sanitation and safety concerns. When the camp is cleared out, a team will go through the hand-built structures and tents looking for cash, IDs or anything else of value. Those items will be sorted and stored for people to claim later.

"Loretta Macpherson, 65, died shortly after she was given a paralyzing agent typically used during surgeries instead of an anti-seizure medication . An Oregon hospital says it administered the wrong medication to a patient, causing her death. Loretta Macpherson, 65, died shortly after she was given a paralyzing agent typically used during surgeries instead of an anti-seizure medication at its hospital in Bend, according to Michel Boileau, chief clinical officer for St. Charles Health System. He said Macpherson, from Oregon, stopped breathing and suffered cardiac arrest and brain damage Wednesday. Macpherson came into the ER two days earlier with medication dosage questions after a recent brain surgery. Her son Mark Macpherson told News 21 his mother was taken off life support and passed away Wednesday. She was recovering after having a brain tumor removed at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle last month. 'Very speedy recovery, she was expected to make a full recovery,' her son said who explained he had move near her to help with her care. 'She was doing very well.' He said she worked as an interior designer for 25 years in Newport and before that, she worked as a clerk in Salem, where her late husband, Gordon Macpherson, had served as a state representative. 'She was the most amazing person on the planet,' Mark McPherson said. 'There wasn't a person that she didn't get along with. Everyone loved her.' Macpherson would not confirm whether he's planning legal action against the hospital, and instead said he wanted to make sure the experience was not repeated for anyone else.

"Three immigration officers are to be investigated after a judge accused them of lying, which led to the collapse of a £1million sham marriages trial. The trial of Reverend Nathan Ntege collapsed in October when Judge Nic Madge said he was 'satisfied' that enforcement officers  had lied on oath and concealed evidence throughout the trial. The vicar, 54, was accused of marrying almost 500 fake couples at a church in Thornton Heath, south east London, so foreign nationals could stay in the UK. The £1million trial of Reverend Nathan Ntege (pictured) collapsed after the judge accused immigration officers of lying  and concealing evidence - The IPCC has now said those officers are being investigated . Before the case collapsed the court heard Rev Ntege oversaw a ‘matrimonial conveyor belt’ of Eastern European brides at his parish. The jury was told the number of weddings at his church went from six a year to up to nine a day – with ‘cattle market’ scenes as brides who did not appear to know their grooms squeezing into  shared wedding dresses in the toilets. But all of the charges against the Uganda-born clergyman were thrown out in extraordinary courtroom scenes - which included the judge accusing two officials of perjury and perverting the course of justice; defence lawyers claiming immigration officers destroyed and tampered with evidence; and five months of evidence vanishing, only to reappear at the last moment. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said today it will examine how the three officers handled evidence during the course of the operation and the trial at Inner London Crown Court. St Jude’s with St Aidan’s Church in  South London (pictured) where  it is claimed sham marriages took place . The Reverend Nathan Ntege shakes hands with members of his congregation after assisting with a service . IPCC Commissioner Jennifer Izekor said: 'We will be conducting a thorough, independent investigation into the serious matters the collapse of this trial has raised. 'We are assessing a substantial amount of material as part of our initial inquiries.' Prior to the collapse of the trial, the jury heard that Ntege was the 'lynchpin' of a group which facilitated the 'matrimonial conveyor belt' at St Jude's with St Aidan Church. Judge Nic Madge (pictured) said he was 'satisfied' that enforcement officers had lied on oath and concealed evidence throughout the trial . But Judge Madge dropped the case against all seven defendants because of 'both bad faith and serious misconduct on the part of the prosecution'. He said at the time: 'I am satisfied that officers at the heart of this prosecution have deliberately concealed important evidence and lied on oath. 'In my judgment, it has tainted the whole case. 'It has tainted the prosecution against all seven defendants.' He added: 'The misconduct of the prosecution, and in particular the officer in the case and the disclosure officer, is so serious that these officers have left me with no option other than to exercise my discretion to stay this prosecution.' He said photographs and video footage as well as diary logs had been purposely held back from the trial. The Home Office referred the judge's claims to the IPCC, which said it is now examining more than 100 boxes of material and trial transcripts as well as considering relevant Home Office policies. All seven defendants denied the immigrations charges against them. A Home Office spokesman said: 'The Home Office has co-operated fully and provided the IPCC complete access to all relevant files but it would be inappropriate to comment further as this is an ongoing investigation.' Before the collapse of the trial the court heard Ntege was accused of carrying out 494 fake marriages, an average of one every other day, between December 2007 and March 2011. He joined St Jude’s with St Aidan’s Church in Thornton Heath, South London, in 2002, after seeking asylum from Uganda.","Case against Rev Nathan Ntege collapsed after judge said officers lied .

"The proportion of women past child-bearing age with just one child is at its highest for almost 40 years, it emerged yesterday. The total of those bringing up so-called ‘little emperors’ compares with the generation of young women whose lives were disrupted by the Second World War. This rapid increase in the number of one-child mothers was brought about by the millions of women pursuing careers and a good salary who have neither the time nor money to have larger families, analysts said. Women who turned 46 this year have had on average 1.92 children, compared to 2.34 children per woman in their mothers’ generation born in the early 1940s . Their youngsters are sometimes referred to as ‘little emperors’ after the Chinese term for the spoilt and demanding behaviour of only children. In a report, the Office for National Statistics said 17 per cent of women who reached 45 last year had just one child. The age is regarded as the point at which a woman is not expected to have more children. The level was just 13 per cent in 2010. The last time there was a similar proportion of one-child mothers at 45 was in 1975 – those who were born in 1930 whose child-bearing years were adversely affected by the Second World War and its aftermath. The proportion of families with one child has increased over time to 17 per cent, a level last seen for the 1932 cohort . When women born in 1983 turned 30 last year, 46 per cent of them were childless, higher than the 42 per cent of those born in 1968 . In 1975, just over one in ten women were childless, compared with 18 per cent last year – a level that means more than a third of women today have no children or just one. ONS officials said the trend towards one-child and childless families followed social changes in the lives of most women. They said the rise in smaller families stemmed from more women going into higher education and careers, the increasing difficulties and delays for many in forming a partnership and getting married, and ‘the desire to establish a career, get on the housing ladder and ensure financial stability before starting a family’. The report said the reasons for not having children include the lower proportion of married women, ‘changes in the perceived costs and benefits of child-rearing versus work and leisure activities, greater social acceptability of the child-free lifestyle’, and the postponement of decisions about whether to have children until it is too late. The rise in one-child mothers comes at a time of unprecedented success for women at work. Official figures on the gender pay gap show women in full-time jobs earn more than men until they are 40, when raising a family takes over for many. Author and family researcher Patricia Morgan said: ‘If you have to juggle work and family, it is very difficult to juggle with more than one child.’ With more women choosing to delay starting a family, the number who have their first child before turning 20 has also dramatically fallen since the 1950s .","Women who were born in 1968 went on to have average of 1.92 children .
For those born in 1941, the figure was 2.34 children, ONS study shows .

The men, who have not been named by police, are accused of handing out leaflets outside schools and mosques in a bid to recruit teenagers to the cause of Islamic State (ISIS), the jihadist group terrorising Syria and Iraq. A neighbour of the three-bedroom home in Paget Street being searched said: 'Officers have been coming in and out all morning carrying stuff. 'There's an Asian family that live there but we've never had any trouble whatsoever.' Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Holland, head of counter terrorism in Wales, said: 'We have made these arrests because we want to prevent people from going to Syria.' She insisted there is no more Islamic extremism in the Welsh capital than anywhere else in the UK, adding: 'The scale of counter terrorism in Wales is minimal compared to the entire UK.

"DNA tests have confirmed that a daughter and an ex-wife of the head of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are indeed being held by Lebanese authorities. There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife. But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader. Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014 . The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday. He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child. 'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said. 'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added. 'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said. The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday . He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi. Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon. Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said. Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front. Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front. The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation. It described her as 'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state. Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra. The soldiers and police were abducted when militants from the two groups briefly overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August. The fighters withdrew after a truce negotiated by clerics, but took 30 hostages, three of whom have been executed.","Saja al-Dulaimi was caught in northern Lebanon with false identification .

"Beryl Hughes, 84, admitted causing the death of Brian Bockmaster, 80, by careless driving . A Judge has told elderly drivers that they must ‘face up to facts’ if they are no longer safe on the roads after sentencing an 84-year-old woman who killed an 80-year-old man in a head-on smash. Judge Stephen Holt also urged families and friends to ‘monitor’ ageing relatives as he imposed a five-year driving ban on Beryl Hughes and a 24-week jail sentence suspended for 12 months. The judge said the fact that Hughes had picked up a speeding conviction in the months before the fatal collision may have indicated that her driving skills were starting to deteriorate. Hughes was also injured when her Audi A3 ploughed into Brian Bockmaster’s Honda Civic on a rural road earlier this year. Mr Bockmaster was flown to hospital with multiple injuries, but died the following day. Judge Holt said: ‘This is a tragic case where there are no winners and all are losers. ‘It demonstrates the importance of older drivers to exercise responsibility and recognise when their driving skills fall off to the extent that they present a danger to other road users. ‘We are seeing an increasing number of older drivers involved in such tragic cases as these in this court.’ He added: ‘It is the responsibility of older drivers and their family and friends to monitor their driving skills and face up to the fact that there will come a time when they are no longer safe to drive. It is perhaps understandable, particularly in rural areas where there is no public transport, that drivers hang on to their licences longer than is safe. ‘But the tragic consequences of this case demonstrate the very real need to face up to the facts.’ Hughes, of Downham Market, Norfolk, admitted causing death by careless driving. Martin Ivory, prosecuting, said she had drifted across the A1122 Downham Road in Stradsett, into the path of her victim’s car. He said Hughes had no recollection of the crash in February and there was no explanation as to why it happened. She had not been drinking and conditions on the road were good, although it was just after 8pm and dark. Mr Ivory said Hughes had been fined for speeding after she was caught doing 56mph in a 30mph zone 11 months before the fatal crash. The tragedy has left Mr Bockmaster’s wife and his family devastated, Norwich Crown Court heard. William Carter, defending, said: ‘She realises that whatever happened it was plainly her fault and she has to live with that. ‘Not a day goes past when she does not think back to that terrible tragedy. She has not driven since that day. She has no intention of ever driving again.’ Judge Stephen Holt issued the warning to elderly drivers at Norwich Crown Court (pictured)","Judge  urged OAP drivers to recognise when they are no longer safe .

"Amancio Ortega has leaped ahead of the Queen’s cousin to top a list of super-rich landowners . The rags-to-riches billionaire behind fashion chain Zara has overtaken the Duke of Westminster to become Britain’s richest property investor. Amancio Ortega has leaped ahead of the Queen’s distant cousin to top a list of super-rich landowners. The reclusive 78-year-old Spaniard sank his huge wealth into bricks and mortar and now has a £4billion global property empire including a large chunk of London’s Mayfair and office blocks in the City. It puts the son of a railway worker, who is worth £35billion but still lunches in the staff canteen, top of an annual rich list of property investors. Mr Ortega, who is the world’s fourth wealthiest man, has invested widely in the last year including £660million in London real estate, according to the Estates Gazette Rich List. He owns Devonshire House, one time residence of the Dukes of Devonshire in the 18th and 19th centuries, located opposite the Ritz hotel in Piccadilly. While the Duke of Westminster’s £2.8billion investment in the UK through his Grosvenor Estates is greater than Mr Ortega’s, his entire wealth is lower at £8.4billion. And that puts him lower in the annual survey, which takes total personal wealth into account when assigning rankings. The Duke has slipped into seventh position after his Grosvenor Group disposed of £240million of prime central London properties in April because of fears the UK residential market was overheating. Both men have built substantial property portfolios but could not have come from more different backgrounds. Almost all of the Duke of Westminster’s wealth is inherited while Mr Ortega started out by selling cheap blouses.

Business empire: One of his Zara clothes shops. Mr Ortega is the world’s fourth wealthiest man . With brother Antonio, he opened their first clothing store in the port city of La Coruna in north-west Spain, and called it Zorba after their favourite movie – the 1964 hit Zorba The Greek. But when the name clashed with a nearby bar, the pair re-used some of the letters from their sign to create Zara. Almost 40 years on, Mr Ortega has grown the firm into Inditex, the world’s largest clothing empire with seven brands including Massimo Dutti, Pull & Bear, Bershka and Stradivarius. It has a mammoth network of 6,460 stores in 88 countries and has grown bigger than British rivals Marks & Spencer and Next. Famous fans include TV fashion expert Trinny Woodall and the Duchess of Cambridge, who wore a £79.99 double-breasted Zara blazer during the Commonwealth Games. A £19.99 choker she wore was also seen on television chef Mary Berry. The firm’s unique ‘fast fashion’ strategy involves refining its ranges throughout a season based on customer feedback. Understated Mr Ortega lives a simple life in a flat in La Coruna with his second wife, Flora Perez. He has three children. Daughter Marta works in the commercial department but has no executive role. Behind Mr Ortega on the list is Joseph Safra, the Brazilian banker worth £9.4billion, who last month paid £726million for London’s Gherkin skyscraper. Sixty of all those on the list inherited their wealth. There are 37 billionaires on the list, and while this year’s number one is worth almost £35billion, you would have needed ‘only’ £7.5billion to top the list just two years ago.","Amancio Ortega has leapt ahead of Duke of Westminster to top the list .

"Sixty Conservative MPs, including Dr Liam Fox, are today backing a campaign to persuade David Cameron to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools. Sixty Conservative MPs are today backing a campaign to persuade David Cameron to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools. Former defence secretary Liam Fox, the chairman of the influential 1922 committee, Graham Brady, and former leadership contender David Davis are among those calling for an end to the ban on new selective state schools. The grassroots Tory group, Conservative Voice, is building support among MPs for a change in policy which it says would be a vote-winner among millions of middle-class parents. At present, the law forbids new grammar schools, whose intake is based on academic ability -- only allowing existing institutions to open ‘satellites’ in new locations. Theresa May, the home secretary, and Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, have broken ranks to back plans for new satellite grammar school campuses in their constituencies. The option is being attempted by Conservative councillors in Kent, where Weald of Kent girls’ grammar school in Tonbridge has applied to open a site nine miles away in Sevenoaks. Mr Cameron has long resisted calls to pledge to expand selective schooling in the Tory manifesto. The architects of the coalition’s school reforms hoped that controversy over grammar schools in the party could be put to rest by focusing specialist academies and free schools. But Dr Fox said: ‘Diversity in the provision of education has been a central theme of this government’s policy and should be extended wherever possible.’ Mr Davis, the former shadow home secretary, said: ‘Grammar schools were probably one of the most transformative public policies of the middle of the 20 century. They took a very large population of working class kids and gave them opportunities that they would never have got any other way.’ Mr Brady said: ‘As most local authorities got rid of their grammar schools, we have seen social mobility take a nosedive and a less cohesive society. ‘We have seen far fewer people from state educated backgrounds in law, the upper reach of the civil service, the judiciary and indeed in politics and we must return to the sense that anybody can get on according to their ability and their efforts – that is what brought me into the Conservative Party.’ A poll last week showed that 54 per cent of voters say that they would support entirely new grammar schools in areas where there was evidence parents wanted them, such as petitions in support. A poll last week showed that 54 per cent of voters say that they would support entirely new grammar schools in areas where there was evidence parents wanted them. File picture . Don Porter, founder of Conservative Voice, the grassroots party pressure group which is behind the new campaign, said 60 MPs had so far offered their support. ‘We want to ensure that in the Conservative Party manifesto there is a clear commitment to reverse the legislation preventing the creation of new grammar schools,’ he added. ‘Our followers are strongly of the opinion that new grammar schools will both enhance social mobility and present parents with choice, both of which lie at the heart of the Conservative Party’s values.’ Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab, a member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘There’s no silver bullet to reviving stagnant social mobility in Britain. But grammar schools are a key piece of the policy jigsaw, creating a ladder of opportunity for talented and hard-working youngsters from council estates and rural backwaters.’ Research for Conservative Voice found 84 per cent of people said that grammar schools are a valuable asset to the British education system. Some 80 per cent believe that grammar schools make the education system fairer. Two thirds of parents say they would enter their child for an 11+ exam and send them to a grammar school if they passed. In the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher - herself a grammar school girl - allowed local councils to decide themselves whether their schools should remain selective grammars when she was the education secretary. It proved to be a political misjudgement, since many councils took the opportunity to end selective state education. There are now around 160 grammar schools left in England, mostly in the home counties.","Grassroots Tory group building support among MPs for a change in policy .

"Rant: Danny Cohen had an unseemly Twitter spat with a reporter . The BBC launched an astonishing attack on its critics yesterday, accusing them of being crazy, lazy, cynical and shoddy. A senior executive lashed out at those who dared to criticise the corporation’s huge salaries or to point out that the Christmas TV schedule was stuffed with repeats. Danny Cohen, who earns £327,800 as director of television, had an unseemly Twitter spat with a reporter who questioned why 62 per cent of the festive output on BBC1 and BBC2 will be old shows. At the same time, the BBC’s communications department attacked The Sun after it questioned executive salaries and whether licence fee payers are getting value for money. Speaking at a preview of the BBC’s festive line-up, Mr Cohen called for opponents of the BBC to tone down their criticism. ‘Perhaps this is time for a little less of the critical friend and a bit more of the friend,’ he said. ‘It would be crazy to damage, undermine or deflate what we have done.’ Mr Cohen accepted that the BBC ‘doesn’t get everything right’ and should be held to account. However, he raised eyebrows with his assertion that the BBC should be treated like a ‘company’. ‘We must avoid undermining this success story, this growth of the UK creative industries, this reputational dividend for UK plc,’ he said. Question posed: MPs have asked Commons leader William Hague for a parliamentary debate on whether the BBC was meeting its public obligations . ‘The BBC is a great British company, not a Government department. We need it to flourish and continue to be the spark that lights a thousand creative fires.’ Mr Cohen’s tone became angrier when he took to Twitter after the event and attacked individual journalists for criticising the BBC. The Corporation is waging war with its critics on social media – tweeting a line-by-line refutation of two scathing editorials published in a newspaper. The editorials were critical of executive salaries, but as part of its aggressive new PR strategy the corporation’s communications department attempted to debunk the claims. Challenging The Sun’s assertion that ‘nothing has changed’ at the top, it said the number of senior managers and the associated pay bill had been driven down by ‘over a third’. However, it neglected to address the fact that the number of managers in the tier below, where the average wage is now £77,308, has risen from 638 to 729. It responded to questions over whether it was worth the licence fee by saying: ‘At just £2.80 a week per household the BBC provides excellent value for money.’ A string of newspapers, including the Daily Mail, held the corporation to account for filling much of its Christmas schedule with old shows. But Mr Cohen dismissed the reports as ‘poor journalism’ and ‘standard, lazy, annually repeated newspaper stories about the BBC’. He added: ‘The real story is the amazing talent on the BBC that week. Cynical, shoddy journalism.’ However, despite the strength of his language, Mr Cohen was unable to dispute the fact that Christmas repeats have soared in recent years. BBC2 is the worst offender, with repeats accounting for 74 per cent of its programming. Overall, the number of repeats shown across BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 is believed to be the highest ever for the Christmas period. The disclosure prompted MPs to ask Commons leader William Hague for a parliamentary debate on whether the BBC was meeting its public obligations. Conservative backbencher Alec Shelbrooke said: ‘Could we please have a debate on the BBC getting back to its remit and charter on public broadcasting instead of lazily repeating more often than a hearty Christmas dinner?’ Mr Hague refused the request but added: ‘I’m sure – well, I hope – they will be listening to what you say in the BBC.’","Senior executive Danny Cohen lashed out in response to storm of criticism .

"There are few people around that would think of putting a snake in their mouth, particularly one that is wrapped around a tarantula. But this is exactly what Arteval Duarte, a man nicknamed the 'Ninja of Serpents' has done while a friend captures his actions on video. Quite why he is so keen to put a snake and spider in his mouth is not clear - and it's not for the faint-hearted - but what a man's gotta do... The bizarre video emerged from Brazil and the footage was captured in the city of Pará earlier this year. Brazilan Duarte, nicknamed the ‘Ninja of Serpents’, is seen handling a banded cat-eyed snake and a pinktoe tarantula before wrapping the snake around the spider and placing them both in his mouth. And look away...NOW! The furry legs of the tarantual wave around inside the man's mouth . He then holds the creatures in his mouth for a few seconds until they gradually fall out. Duarte says he has been charming and training poisonous animals for more than 15 years. According to Duartes a sting from the pinktoe tarantula is not lethal but could cause dermatitis or necrosis. Don't pick me! Duarte begins the process of handling the snake while the tarantula watches . Your turn now: The man dubbed the Ninja of snakes handles the tarantual gently . And in we go.... Duarte pops the wrap into his mouth. Why? Well only he knows the answer to that . Gross out: The spider and snake writhe about in his mouth before gradually falling out . No wonder he wraps it up so carefully inside the snake. Pinktoes don't get as large as your common or garden tarantual, with a leg span of around five inches. Tarantulas are often feature in horro movies, which has given these big, furry spiders an undeserved bad rap. They strike fear in the hearts of arachnophobes everywhere, but in truth, tarantulas are some of the least aggressive and dangerous spiders around. Still, don't try this at home kids.","Brazilian man carefully winds a small snake around a tarantula .

"This is the moment a member of a patriot militia guarding the streets of Ferguson was stripped of his rifle by police - even though residents want him there. The man from the Oath Keepers was told to hand over the weapon and threatened with arrest as police in the Missouri city issued an order for them to stand down. Senior officers claim that that are acting illegally but the Oath Keepers are ignoring the order. They are challenging it in the Missouri courts because they say it is a breach of their constitutional rights - and that Ferguson needs the extra help. The Oath Keepers were thrust into the spotlight when photos of them standing guard on top of buildings in Ferguson to stop them being burned during the recent unrest were published in the national media. Scroll down for video . Order: This is the moment one of the Oath Keepers was stripped of their rifle by police in Ferguson after the riots which left parts of the suburb burning . Face to face: As the police speak to the Oath Keeper other members of the militia can be seen on the roof behind them where they are standing guard . Patrol: Members of the Oath Keepers on the roof of a Ferguson property. Each man is carrying an AR-15 assault rifle as well as handguns . Deterrent: The Oath Keepers say their presence kept looters and rioters away from other buildings. The man on the right is carrying a model 1911 semi-automatic .45 pistol 'cocked and locked' - with the hammer back but the safety catch on. Argument: Police and Oath Keepers disagree on whether the militia can patrol in Ferguson. The disagreement is going to court . They are a pro-constitution group of former and serving soldiers, fireman and cops with a reported membership of 35,000, all of whom are volunteers. They have been courted by the Tea Party, count Glenn Beck among their admirers and are deeply suspicious of the government. One of the pledges in their manifesto reads: 'We will NOT obey orders to disarm the American people.' The dramatic incident was captured last weekend on top of a building the Oath Keepers vowed to protect, they say after seeking permission of all the business owners. Sam Andrews, a defense contractor and head of the St Louis branch of the organisation, told MailOnline: 'They told us to get down off the roof and told us to show them our IDs. 'I told them no, you don't have probable cause. They told us we were violating a city ordinance and we said we were not. Then a two-hour argument began.' Helping: Sam Andrews of the Oath Keepers with a business owner in Ferguson, MO. He told MailOnline the group was going to court to show that they were not violating a city ordinance . Presence: . Mr Andrews said that after his men, who include Army Special Forces soldiers, handed down their rifles they were checked by the officers who had to give them back when they realized the guns were in order and properly licensed. Mr Andrews said: 'In the end they let us stay on the roof. 'It was harassment, plain and simple. They don't like us because we're a pain in the ass, but the people in Ferguson want us here. 'We are here to help people that the government left hanging...these people pay their taxes and they deserve the same level of protection as the governor and his wealthy supporters.' The Oath Keepers were founded in 2008 by Stewart Rhodes, a Yale-educated lawyer and former aide to Republican Senator Ron Paul. Among their members they count Birthers, who believe that President Obama was not born in America and is not entitled to be President. The decision to clear Officer Darren Wilson (right) over the killing of Michael Brown (left) was followed by rioting in Ferguson . Flames: One of the more than a dozen buildings set on fire in the violent protests . Inflamatory:  The riots came after the decision to clear officer Wilson. It was greeted by Michael Brown's stepfather shouting 'let's burn this b**** down' to an angry mob. He has since apologised . A lengthy article in Mother Jones described the Oath Keepers as a disparate group who are united against the over policing of the American people. According to their manifesto, they believe: 'We will NOT obey orders to conduct warrant-less searches of the American people...We will NOT obey orders to impose martial law or a 'state of emergency' on the state.' Mr Andrews said that in his eyes, he was just a 'private citizen helping out a neighbor'. He said: 'When I assembled my team here the Department of Homeland Security told me that I did not have a dog in this fight and you need to pull your guys out. 'They said you need to rely on the professionals, the police. 'I replied that I respect your opinion but you are wrong and that I do have a dog in this fight. I was born and raised here so go f*** yourself.' In a 2008 article for SWAT magazine that has been posted on the Oath Keepers' blog, Mr Rhodes articulated the fears of the group in detail. He described the nightmare scenario if Hillary Clinton, who he called the 'dominatrix in chief', got elected instead of President Obama, a scenario that could come true come 2016. He wrote: 'Imagine that Herr Hitlery is sworn in as president in 2009. 'After a conveniently timed 'domestic terrorism' incident (just a coincidence, of course) or yet another Prozac induced mass shooting, she promptly crams a United Nations mandated, Great Britain style, total ban on the private possession of firearms through a compliant, Democratically controlled Congress. Preparation: Police put on their gas masks after chasing off looters from a business in Ferguson. Aftermath: The National Guard was called in in force the night after the riots to restore order and guard key businesses . 'Dressed in her favorite Chairman Mao signature pantsuit, Hitlery signs the ban into law with the obligatory choir of sell-out police chiefs as backdrop (just like the good ol days when Bill Clinton used the oval office).' Britain does not have such a ban on all firearms, but forbids the private ownership of handguns and automatic weapons, as well as other categories of firearms, and licenses all gun owners. The dispute over the Oath Keepers patrolling Ferguson is over whether or not they need a licence to act as security guards. St Louis police say that they do but the Oath Keepers say they don't because they are volunteers.","Patriot militia called Oath Keepers guarded streets and businesses in Ferguson in wake of riots which tore through town .

"Jenna Bush has confirmed that her first kiss with husband Henry Hager took place on the White House roof and insists that the memorable moment was much more innocent than the world wants it to be. Speaking to the Today show earlier this morning, the 33-year-old mother-of-one took the opportunity to clarify exactly what she meant when she told TV host Andy Cohen that she may have engaged in 'a little hanky panky' on the roof when she was younger. 'OK, first I have to say I was shocked by the question,' she told the Today team. 'But my husband and I did have our first kiss on the White House roof. Is that embarrassing?' Scroll down for video . Confession: Former First Daughter Jenna Bush Hager, now 33 and married to Henry Hager, has admitted that she may have engaged in 'a little hanky panky' on the White House roof when she was 19 . Playing innocent: At first, Jenna remained coy when she was asked if she had ever fooled around in the White House, telling the audience: 'Am I blushing? Listen, a lady never talks!' Jenna, who is the daughter of former US President George W. Bush and his wife, former First Lady Laura Bush, went on to add that the kiss was 'pretty innocent' but that both she and her husband Henry hold the memory very dear. 'I want to say two things,' she said during the phone interview. 'First of all, it is not the Fifty Shades of Grey thing that people want it to be. It was pretty innocent but really lovely and now, you know, 10 years later, here we are with a child, so it's a pretty special thing. 'And then second of all, I think I single-handedly brought back the words hanky panky.' Eager to try and glean as much information as possible from a slightly embarrassed Jenna, Today show hosts Carson Daly and Al Roker immediately pressed for her to describe the romantic scene in a bit more detail. 'I just want to know if the snipers on the roof of the White House gave you any privacy,' Carson, 41, asked. 'Well, I mean, maybe there was no privacy,' Jenna admitted. 'There probably was no privacy, but in our minds we were the only two people there.' All grown up: These days, she is happily married to Henry Hager, with whom she has a one-year-old daughter named Mila . What a laugh: Jenna (R) appeared on the show alongside TV chef Rachael Ray and both of the ladies spent much of the episode in hysterics . Never one to skirt around an issue, co-host Al, jumped in to ask: 'But you did cross into canoodling?' much to the shock of his fellow presenters. 'No, there was no canoodling thank you,' Jenna said. 'There was not heavy petting, there was nothing.' On Wednesday night, Jenna appeared on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live, where the TV host questioned whether or not she had ever 'fooled around' in the White House. At first, Jenna remained coy, telling the audience: 'Am I blushing? Listen, a lady never talks!' But eventually, she confessed: 'Maybe there was a little kiss on the roof.' Jenna implied that the lucky man on that fateful night was her husband-to-be, explaining: 'I was 19 years old when my dad became president... meaning I knew [my husband] for a long time. Tell-all: Andy also asked if she ever romped around in the Lincoln bedroom. 'No, no,' she said, before conceding jokingly: 'Maybe I missed an opportunity there' Family values: Jenna (R) is the younger of former President George Bush's twin daughters . 'And you know, maybe there was a little hanky panky. There was maybe a kiss on the roof,' she revealed with a sly smile. The Today show correspondent, who met her husband during father George W Bush's 2004 campaign, was also asked if she ever romped around in the Lincoln bedroom. 'No, no,' she said, before conceding jokingly: 'Maybe I missed an opportunity there.' Jenna, who welcomed daughter Mila in April 2013, also talked about being 'fiercely protective' of Malia and Sasha Obama, who were recently criticized by a GOP aide for not showing enough 'class'. 'It's not easy, and it's not a job that they wanted. And so it's hard!' said Jenna. 'I mean I, obviously, heh, had a hard time. But it's also a privilege. So I mean... they've done an incredible job.'","The mother-of-one spoke to the Today show to reveal details of the 'innocent' encounter .

"Israel has been hit by its worst ever environmental crisis as millions of litres of crude oil gushed out of a pipeline to flood 200 acres of a desert nature reserve, officials said. More than 80 people have been taken to hospital with breathing difficulties after the oil spill which happened during maintenance work on the Eilat-Ashkelon pipeline, north of the Red Sea resort of Eilat, on Wednesday night. Officials say rehabilitation of the area could take months, even years, as the spill stretched to 'a couple of kilometers long' and reached the Evrona nature reserve, close to the Jordan border. A preliminary investigation indicated that the pipeline burst after a new section was  struck accidentally during maintenance work, according to The Times of Israel. Millions of litres of crude oil have gushed out of a pipeline to flood 200 acres of a desert nature reserve in southern Israel, officials said . Environmental workers inspect damage after an oil spill of thousands of cubic meters close to Beer Oral, just north of the Red Sea resort city of Eilat . Ronen Moshe, from the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company (EAPC) said: 'The leak has been stopped', adding that a full investigation was under way to determine the cause of the spill. Firefighters and environmental groups scrambled to the scene in an attempt to seal the puncture in the pipeline and prevent further contamination, which was described as 'considerable' by Guy Samet, the director of the southern region in the Environmental Protection Ministry. 'This is one of the largest [environmental] events in the history of the country,' Mr Samet said. 'We're talking about thousands of gallons of crude oil, which will endanger local wildlife and the surrounding nature reserve,' he said, adding that rehabilitation could take 'years.' Doron Nissim from Israel's Nature and Parks Authority said the black slick had run and pooled in ravines, but it appears to have spared the 4,250-acre Evrona reserve's rare deer and douma palms. He said there was no doubt that 'insects and other crawling animals have been harmed', but there was little chance of the oil sluicing to Eilat and endangering Red Sea marine life because of the absence of heavy rainfall. The leak was stopped before the torrent of oil could cross the nearby Jordanian border, Israel's Environment Ministry said. An aerial photograph provided by the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection shows a large oil spillage caused by an oil pipeline that breached during maintenace work . The leak was stopped before the torrent of oil could cross the nearby Jordanian border, Israel's Environment Ministry said . Environment Ministry official Guy Samet estimated the spillage at millions of litres, telling Israel Radio: 'Rehabilitation will take months, if not years' Civil defence officials in Amman said several Jordanians had gone to hospital as a precaution after smelling the fumes, but had not required treatment. The main road leading to Eilat from central Israel was closed intermittently and the Environment Ministry advised the town to cancel a triathlon that was due to take athletes through the contaminated area. Mr Nissim said pools of oil would probably be drained with suction equipment, and contaminated earth might also be removed. In Jordan more than 80 people were hospitalised, including 30 workers at Aqaba’s King Hussein International Airport. On the Israeli side, at least three people were treated by paramedics after they inhaled poisonous gases. The pipeline, which stretches between Eilat on the Red Sea to Ashkelon on the Mediterranean, was built in the 1960s to bring Iranian oil from the Persian Gulf to Europe. Since the severing of relations between Iran and Israel after 1979 Islamic Revolution it has been mostly used to move oil within Israel.

"They were hailed as national heroines after footage emerged of them fighting back against men alleged to have sexually harassed them on a bus in India. But a new video of Indian sisters Pooja, 19, and Aarti Kumar, 22, showing them starting a fight with another man has cast doubt on their story, fuelling accusations that they are 'man-beaters'. In a further twist, claims have also been made by female passengers on the bus in Haryana, north India, that the original fight was over seats, not because the young women were sexually harassed. Scroll down for video . A new video showing Indian sisters Pooja and Aarti Kumar starting a fight with a man in a park has emerged just days after the 'national heroines' were praised for fighting off alleged abusers on a bus . Man-beaters? One of the sisters is seen grabbing the unidentified man by the scruff of the neck. They claim he had verbally abused her, however this is clear from the video . Their 'self-defence' on Friday prompted widespread praise and the promise of a cash reward from the government, The Times reported. But the new video shows the women talking to a man sat on a bench in a park, before one of the sisters grabs him by the shirt while the other hits him with her bag. The man, seemingly confused by the attack, backs away and tries to hold one of the sisters' flailing arms as punches and slaps rain down on him. He is left with no option but to turn his back and run while one of the women casually checks her phone, as if nothing has happened. The Kumar sisters claim the man had been verbally harassing them but this is not clear from the video. The footage emerged amid claims by passengers on the same bus as the sisters, who study at Rohtak Government College, that the fight was over seats and that the girls were not sexually harassed, as they have claimed. The man holds back one of the young women's arms as she tried to punch her, but he was eventually forced to flee . Passengers watched as the sisters beat up their three alleged abusers with a belt after no one intervened to help them. But according to the Times of India, one witness, Bimla Devi, said: 'The two sisters were sitting on seat No. 8 which was allotted to an unwell woman passenger. 'When the boys asked the sisters to vacate the seat, the two refused and started fighting.' The sisters claim the men had been touching Aarti and that they grabbed her by the throat after she told them to stop. Coming to her sister's defence, Pooja removed her belt and began hitting, kicking and punching the man holding her sister until he let go. They say they were forced off the bus and were only able to escape the men after throwing a brick at then. Hitting back: Sisters Pooja, 19, left, and Aarti, 22, right, were filmed beating up a group of men who were verbally and physically abusing them on a bus in Rohtak, a district in the northern state of Haryana . The bus incident took place last week, when the Kumar sisters were on their way home from Rohtak Government College, and was filmed by one of the passengers . Speaking to MailOnline earlier this week, Pooja said: ‘We encounter these kinds of incidents on a daily basis. It was only when the boys started misbehaving with a pregnant woman that we resorted to this. ‘We really taught these guys a lesson and beat them up. We wanted to show that we girls are not weak and capable to defending ourselves. We really wanted to kick them. ‘After they got beaten they ran away, otherwise they would have continued to harass us. I am not regretting it. I did the right thing.’ The three men, said to be soldiers-in-training, were arrested over the attack and have been released on bail. The bus conductor and driver were both suspended for allegedly not informing the police about the incident.","'Heroine' Indian sisters filmed starting a fight with a man in a park .

"Just a day earlier, the people of this tiny rural town had gathered together to say goodbye to their favourite son. But on the outskirts of Macksville on Thursday morning, there was little hint of the scale of the tragedy that had rocked them to the core. The only indication of Phillip Hughes’ death at 25 were the bouquets of fresh flowers tied to the fence posts of a field where his prized Angus cows still graze. He had only bought the 93-hectare block in January, part of a retirement plan that friends said he valued even more highly than cricket. Scroll down for video . Flowers encircle a cricket bat outside Phillip Hughes' home on the outskirts of Macksville on the mid-north coast of New South Wales . The farm near Tilly Willy Creek, which runs off the Nambucca River, was purchased by Hughes in January . A ute sits in the garage with the sticker 'Aussies love Angus', beside a quad bike, a box labelled 'Phil's helmets' and an upturned horseshoe for good luck. It is a beautiful property, with well-kept vegetable gardens, chooks and a pet bird. One day the cricketer dreamed of expanding his property by buying the adjacent blocks on either side of the farm. When he retired from cricket, Hughes planned on coming back to his beloved Macksville and building a new home there. Phillip Hughes died last Thursday, two days after he was struck in the neck by a cricket ball at Sydney Cricket Ground . It spans 93 hectares and his Angus stud named 408 are seen enjoying the shade beneath the trees . Hughes' business partner Corey Ireland said the cricketer had hoped to build a home on the property . With the help of his loved ones, his dream will hopefully be realised. Following Hughes' tragic death, his uncle - who lives on the Tilly Willy Creek 408 homestead - will continue to look after the property. But it is not just his homestead that has links to Hughes' Test number of 408. His beloved stud of Angus bulls are named 408 and are seen sitting quietly under the shade of a large tree to escape the hot summer sun of New South Wales' mid-north coast. Many others are on Hughes' business partner and close friend Corey Ireland's stud farm in Wagga Wagga. in New South Wales' south-west. Mr Ireland - who was one of the select few who gave a moving tribute at Hughes' funeral on Wednesday - said the batsman had grand plans for his livestock. He and the tragic cricketer had marked out a ten-year plan, which will now continue with father Greg Hughes in his son's place. 'Luckily his father Greg loves cattle just as much as he does and will help build his farm and his business... we'll have to make a couple of changes [to the plan]. But we'll keep it going,' Mr Ireland told Daily Mail Australia. The 25-year-old was also planning to retire on the property after he had finished his cricketing career . The only evidence of the tragedy is exquisite bunches of flowers lining the fence line at the property . The dirt driveway, surrounded by a green grass, leads to a shed and a house on the Tilly Willy 408 homestead . Following Hughes' tragic death, his uncle - who lives on the Tilly Willy Creek 408 homestead - will continue to look after the property . Hughes had hoped to come back to the farm and expand his property and build a home there . And that's where Mr Ireland's focus is now turned after he paid his last respects to the cricketer, along with thousands from across Australia and the world who descended on the 2,600-strong town. Hughes died two days after he was hit in the neck by a cricket ball at Sydney Cricket Ground during day one of the Sheffield Shield. 'The hurt will always be there but we need to find a way to move forward,' Mr Ireland told Daily Mail Australia. 'Tomorrow is a new day.' But Ireland promises the 25-year-old will never be far from his and his family's thoughts. Mr Ireland's two sons, who adored the cricketer, have been hugely influenced by Hughes and show signs of carrying on his legacy and making his dreams a reality. 'My boys have shown their own interest in farming and cows. They loved their time with Phillip,' Mr Ireland said. Many others are on Hughes' business partner and close friend Corey Ireland's stud farm in Wagga Wagga. in New South Wales' south-west . Mr Ireland said he and Hughes had charted a ten-year plan for the cattle and his farm . The left-hand batsman was loved by all children, including his four young cousins who attended the funeral in their Macksville cricket club shirts, embroidered with 'PH 63 not out' and his baggy green number, 408, on the back. 'All children loved him, he couldn't help himself. Such a big heart,' Mr Ireland said. Phillip Hughes looked forward to the day he would have his own family, according to Mr Ireland. He spoilt Mr Ireland's own children enormously. Thousands attended Hughes' funeral at Macksville High School on Wednesday .

Hughes' brother Jason (left) and father Greg (right) led the pall bearers who carried the cricketer's casket out of the hall at the end of the service . His distraught mother Virginia (centre) was comforted by his sister, Megan, as they watched his casket being loaded into the hearse . When he delivered Hughes' eulogy, Mr Ireland spoke of how Hughes took the children to the Sydney Show and they returned with 26 showbags. 'They've never had 26 showbags and they never will again,' Mr Ireland said with a laugh. The funeral was a difficult day, but a perfect farewell for their beloved 'Boof'. 'Phillip would have loved yesterday. It was sad but a wonderful farewell,' Mr Ireland said. He said he was grateful for the short but special time he had with Hughes. 'I'm happy I had the time with Phillip to talk and make plans. He was a great person and he did as much good for me as I did for him,' Mr Ireland said.","Phillip Hughes bought his 93-hectare block in January to keep his cattle .

"A man said he was 'nearly sick' after he found a live maggot in a cereal bar. Nick Todd, 22, from London, only discovered the  worm after taking a bite out of the Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bar yesterday morning. The horrified project coordinator, who had bought the cereal bar from a supermarket on his way to work, said: 'It was sitting there on top of the bar, wriggling around a bit. 'I can't believe there was something in there, let alone that it was still alive. I was nearly sick.' Kellogg's has now pledged to carry out a full investigation into how the maggot was able to get into the food. The live maggot (pictured) was discovered in the Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bar by Nick Todd only after he had taken a bite out of the cereal breakfast snack . 'Luckily I had only taken a tiny nibble from the corner before I noticed it, but it was quite well camouflaged so it was lucky I was paying attention. 'It doesn't go out of date until next year and I don't how the maggot managed to survive when the packet is supposed to be air tight.' Mr Todd bought the cereal bar from a supermarket on Wednesday with the intention of eating it for breakfast that day. He now says the experience has put him off Kellogg's products for life. 'I'm really disappointed and don't think I'll be eating any of their products again.' Nick said he felt 'horrified' and 'disappointed' by the discovery which had put him off Kellog's products for life . He found the maggot still alive covered in a film on top of the bar. Mr Todd said: 'It looked normal on the inside but I'm a bit concerned I've eaten some eggs or something. I hope my stomach acid will kill them if I have. 'The creature looks like it's shed a skin while it's been in there so it might even be a caterpillar, but whatever it is I'm horrified. 'Kellogg's is such a huge company you just don't expect this kind of thing from them. I've reported it to consumer services so hopefully they'll do something to put it right.' 'I'm really disappointed and don't think I'll be eating any of their products again.' A Kellogg's spokesperson said they were conducting a full and thorough investigation but added it was 'extremely unlikely' the maggot entered the cereal bar in the factory 'because of the high temperatures involved in the production process.' 'We take all complaints of this nature very seriously,' she said. 'This was reported to us yesterday and when we receive the specimen we will carry out a full and thorough investigation.' Kellogg's have now pledged to conduct a full and thorough investigation but said it was 'extremely unlikely' it had entered the bar at their factory .","Nick Todd, from London, bought the Kellogg's Nutri-Grain for breakfast .

"Everyday tasks such as getting dressed, differentiating between red and green lights and watching television can be problematic for the 10 per cent of people who are colour blind. But they could soon be able to see things in television programmes that they could never see before, thanks to new research. Scientists have created software that allows colour blind viewers to better differentiate between red and green and it could be embedded in TV set-top boxes in a matter of months. Scroll down for video . Scientists have created a system that allows colour blind viewers to better differentiate between red and green and it could be embedded in TV set-top boxes in a matter of months. Pictured above is an image that colour blind people would usually see (left) and after the technology is applied (right) Colour blindness affects 250 million worldwide. The condition means that those affected cannot see images, including TV, with as much clarity as those with normal vision. The ‘Eyeteq’ technology, developed by researchers at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, allows colour blind people to see details they previously could not with minimal impact on the picture for ‘colour normals’ – people who do not have colour blindness. The idea is that people with and without colour blindness could watch TV together – an activity, which can currently be difficult, especially if viewers are fans of cookery shows or snooker, for example. The ‘Eyeteq’ technology, developed by researchers at the University of East Anglia, Norwich, allows colour blind people to see details they previously could not with minimal impact on the picture for ‘colour normals’ – people who do not have colour blindness. Here reds and greens are enhanced to stand out from each other . Around five per cent of the global population is colour blind - 10 per cent of men. That works out at around 10 people in a cinema and 7,000 supporters in a football stadium. Red-green colour blindness is the most common kind and its most common form is deuteranomaly, which is cause by a mutation to tiny cones in the eye, which are less sensitive to green light. Protanomaly is the next most common form of colour blindness, affecting 1.3 per cent of men. Cones are shifted to the left and are less sensitive to red light. Around 1.3 per cent of men have a form of colour blindness called protanopia and are unable to distinguish between green, yellow and red, while blue-yellow colour blindness is much less common. The Eyetech technology is designed to support most forms. Based on research from UEA’s school of Computer Sciences, Eyeteq uses mathematical perception models to modify image colours, so that both still and moving images are improved. The scientists have made their innovation available to TV manufacturers and it’s hoped that they will choose to embed it in sets and set-top boxes in coming months. ‘This image-enhancement technology will help to improve the viewing experience for colour blind people,’ said Professor Graham Finlayson from the university’s School of Computing Sciences. ‘With Eyeteq enabled, content streamed to a set top box is enhanced on a frame-by-frame basis before being transmitted to the TV screen. ‘It would be available to users as an option in the accessibility menu. Programmes which contain a large amount of red and green in their images such as sports, cookery and nature, would be particularly enhanced.’ Christopher Cytera, managing director of Spectral Edge, the spin-out company taking the research to market, said: ‘Our Eyeteq technology has been proven to enhance the still image viewing experience for colour-blind people, and we are now extending this to TV and video content. ‘Service providers and set top box manufacturers can see the benefits in increasing accessibility to colour blind viewers and Eyeteq provides the perfect solution for the living room TV screen. ‘Our trials have proved the concept, and it is now ready for integration into prime time consumer technology to transform how colour blind people, and their families, watch TV.’ The Eyetech software could be embedded into a TV set-top box in the coming months because it is available to TV manufacturers. It's designed so that people with and without colour blindness can enjoy the same programmes at the same time . Improving images for colour blind people is an old problem and while dedicated maps, signs and websites exist, for example, videos and tv programmes can be a problem. A well-known technique to solve the problem is daltonization, which works by substituting colours that are invisible to colour blind observers with other colours, without considering the overall appearance of pictures. But the scientists found the method boots visibility, it generates pictures that are disliked by people without colour blindness. Eyeteq uses a different tact and gently modifies colour in images in a way that’s useful to colour blind viewers and bystanders. ‘With careful design using mathematical perception models, we are able to remap colours to maximise discrimination for colour blind people, at the same as minimising the strength of the effect for non-colour blind people,’ the company said. ‘In mathematics we call this a perceptually-weighted regularised joint optimisation methodology operating on local scale.’ So while people with colour blindness enjoy enhanced details, non-colour blind people don't mind or at times prefer the resulting images.","‘Eyeteq’ technology was created by computer scientists at UEA, Norwich .

"The Russian firm behind the world's most widely used assault rifle has unveiled a plan for world domination – in fashion. Siberian arms maker Kalashnikov wants to expand business beyond its AK-47 rifles into a lifestyle brand as recognised and valuable as Apple computers. And even its most-famous product - arguably the world's most widely used weapon of war - has been caught in the slick corporate makeover and rebranded a 'weapon of peace'. Three brands: The company sells military, hunting and sport rifles under different names . Just like CK: Investors watch at a corporate event to unveil the new corporate rebrand of Kalashnikov . Shoppers will soon be able to buy Kalashnikov-branded jumpers, trousers and sportswear as the firm struggles with a dip in Russian military spending. It has also been hit hard by US and EU sanctions that have affected the whole of the Russian defence industry. Kalashnikov Concern, the new name for the firm, unveiled a new red-and-black ‘CK’ logo yesterday. The firm said: ‘The idea is that weapons should help keep the peace, uphold justice, dignity and the right to life. ‘Weapons make a man courageous, alert and create high sense of responsibility. Weapons protect the weak from the strong. ‘With a weapon in hands, people can ensure a peaceful future for their families, the nation and the country.’ 'Weapon of peace': The bizarre new slogan was adopted as part of the plan to be as big as Apple computers . Guns: Kalashnikov director Alexey Krivoruchko said that the company will also produce hunting accessories . The company aims to increase revenue by a factor of four and expand production volumes of all items to 300,000 units per year. Sergey Chemezov, head of Rostec, the Russian state-owned tech giant that holds a controlling stake in the company, said Kalashnikov will make ‘clothing for shooting sports and hunting’. Kalashnikov director general Alexey Krivoruchko said that the company will also produce hunting accessories, including knives. Mr Chemezov told RIA Novosti: 'A brand is a considerable asset for any leading company, although we have a long way to go to Apple’s $100billion brand. I hope Kalashnikov will become as recognised and valuable.' And Mr Krivorucko was quoted by The Guardian as saying: 'The new brand will reflect our main principles: reliability, responsibility and technological efficiency.' High tech: Kalashnikov's inexpensive rifles have been used in some of the world's most brutal wars . The firm was started by the late Mikhail Kalashnikov, a former Red Army tank commander during the Second World War. He drew up the design for the AK-47 rifle while recovering from a wound in hospital after reflecting on problems fellow soldiers had with their antiquated and unreliable rifles that jammed in action. It is one of the most reliable and widely used rifles in the world with 80 per cent of Kalashnikov’s civilian weapons typically exported.","Siberian arms maker to branch out into jumpers, trousers and sportswear .

"A mentally ill woman living rough in a city graveyard has admitted burying her newborn baby alive. Latvian Elita Amantova, 39, was living off berries and bread left out for the birds in Tooting, south-west London, before she gave birth to the child in 2012, a court heard. The tragic death was discovered after a fox dug up the baby on Tooting Common and dumped body parts in a nearby tractor yard. The tragic death was discovered after a fox dug up the baby on Tooting Common (file picture) and dumped body parts in a nearby tractor yard . At a hearing at the Old Bailey, Amantova admitted infanticide and was sentenced to a hospital order. The court heard she had been diagnosed with a schizophrenia-type mental condition in Latvia in her 30s but it was exacerbated by childbirth. Outlining the facts of the case, prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC told how the defendant had an 'appalling experience' after she came to the UK around 2008. After losing her job, she found herself in the company of organised criminals in Norfolk who set her to work as a prostitute. In August 2012, she fled to London where she was found sleeping rough in a burial ground off Garratt Lane in Tooting. The court heard that by then she was heavily pregnant, living off berries and bread left out for birds, sleeping on grave stones and wearing a blonde wig. A member of the public, Verity Verster, became concerned about her condition and alerted authorities, Ms Johnson said. As a result, a police constable tried to persuade her to go into suitable accommodation but she refused help and officers decided there was nothing more they could do. Ms Johnson said the body parts were found on September 10, 2012 on the ground at the tractor yard at Doctor Johnson Avenue next to Tooting Common. The Old Bailey (pictured) heard how Latvian Elita Amantova, 39, was living off berries and bread left out for the birds in Tooting, south-west London, before she gave birth to the child in 2012 . She said: 'Later, a fox expert was called to the yard and discovered a fox entrance. A fox is likely to have found those body parts on Tooting Common and brought the parts into the yard.' DNA testing identified the mother as Amantova, who had given birth without any assistance. On September 17 2012, she was found sitting on her haunches outside Sainsbury's in Garratt Lane watching people coming and going saying it was a 'nice day'. She was arrested but could not be interviewed until the following February because of her serious mental illness. She told police in a prepared statement that she gave birth to a child in August 2012 and she buried it in a park on the same day. She said she thought she knew who the father was but had no contact with him and he was unaware of all the events. The defendant told police she found the birth 'too traumatic' to answer questions about it. She refused to tell police whether the baby was alive or dead before she buried it, but during an interview in April 2013, she admitted to a doctor that the child had in fact been alive and she was charged with murder. However, at today's hearing the prosecution accepted her plea of not guilty to murder but guilty to infanticide. Handing her a hospital order, judge Paul Worsley QC said infanticide was a 'rare offence' and while 'the court must always mark the serious fact a life has been taken', a hospital order was appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The judge said that due to the enduring illness the defendant was suffering, she would probably need lifelong treatment and care.","Mentally ill Elita Amantova was living in a graveyard in Tooting, London .

"A cosmic constant known as the ‘golden ratio’ is said to be found in the shape of hurricanes, elephant tusks and even in galaxies. Now researchers say this ratio is also seen in the topology of space-time, affecting the entire universe as a whole. And they say this number can be used to link everything in the universe together, from space-time to chemistry to biology. South African researchers have claimed that the universe is governed by a 'golden ratio'. They say space-time itself is defined by this mathematical constant. The ratio - 1.618 - is found across nature in plants, hurricanes and more (shown). But the researchers say it is also ever-present in the universe . The research was carried out by Dr Jan Boeyens at the University of Pretoria and Dr Francis Thackeray of the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa. They say the golden ratio - 1.618 - can be seen ‘related not only to aspects of mathematics but also to physics, chemistry, biology and the topology of space-time.’ And it may dictate how certain things in the universe take shape. Fans of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code will remember when the protagonist Professor Langton explains how mathematics and art collide via the 'golden ratio.' For those who haven't read the populist thriller, it is the number 1.618 which has been plucked from the famous Fibonacci sequence. In this sequence each number is the sum of the previous two, so it beings 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34. If you take two successive numbers their ratio is very close to 1.618. This isn't that impressive on its own. Until you realise that this ratio is the key to everything from encrypting computer data, to the numbers of spirals on a sunflower head, our own limbs and why the Mona Lisa is so pleasing to the eye. Some have argued that because the sequence seems to grow in an 'organic' way, the golden ratio may play a part in nature. The ratio of 1.618 has already been found externally all over the human body. It usually marks the proportion of your hand to your forearm as well as the distance between your three knuckles on each finger. The spiral numbers in a sunflower will always total a Fibonacci number, while dividing those pointing right and left will give you two consecutive Fibonacci numbers linked by the ratio 1.68. These spiral patterns are also found in pineapples, cauliflowers and pine cones. The golden ratio, represented by the Greek letter 'phi', is said to be is a mathematical connection between two aspects of an object. It can be artificially used – for example, some 20th century artists used it for the rectangular shape of their portraits from the long side to the short side. They believed that the ratio created an aesthetically pleasing appearance. But the ratio is not just artificially created – it is apparently found through nature in the stems of plants, skeletons of animals and so on. And the shape of spirals also seem to follow the golden ratio. This suggests that geometric shapes in the universe ultimately succumb to this mathematical property. ‘A convincing case for assuming a cosmic character of the golden ratio can be made based on the ubiquity of logarithmic spirals,’ the researchers write. ‘Spectacular examples include the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51), ammonites, the shape of Nautilus shells, Hurricane Katrina and the distribution of planets, moons, asteroids and rings in the solar system.’ The researchers suggest that the reason that this ratio is so ubiquitous is that it is actually a property of space-time. ‘The argument that this amazing consilience (self-similarity) arises from a common environmental constraint, which can only be an intrinsic feature of curved space-time, is compelling,’ they write. ‘The time has come to recognise that relativity and quantum theories can be integrated, and linked numerically to the value of a mathematical constant - whether in the context of space-time or biology’ Quite why the universe follows this rule, however, is not known. Some think that our fine-tuned universe is simply a lucky coincidence and, under the multiverse theory, there are an infinite number of other universes that were not quite so lucky. The researchers say the golden ratio might make up space-time itself. Some have suggested our universe may have been the only one in the multiverse theory to have this ratio that allowed it to form.

"A Seattle teacher surrendered his teaching license after, police say, he gave marijuana to a student. After 18 years as a 'star' teacher in Seattle Public Schools, Dan Richman, 63, quietly resigned from his position in July when allegations surfaced that he had unprofessional conduct with a student. Richman, who reportedly shared a video on social media praising gang involvement, allegedly bought marijuana for an 18-year-old during an after-hours meeting. Marijuana: Dan Richman (bottom right) is accused of giving marijuana to one of his juvenile detention students during an after-hours meeting (Richman is photographed here with other Seattle Public Schools staff members) Authorities say that Richman called the 18-year-old woman and arranged to meet with her, according to a report by seattlepi.com. Then he took her and another student to a medical marijuana clinic where he purchased the marijuana and gave it to the students. At the time, investigators say, Richman was a language arts teacher with Interagency Academy, a network of small, 'alternative' high schools around Seattle for the city's most vulnerable teens. Richman was put on leave when the allegations surfaced in May, and was reportedly teaching through the Academy at the King County Youth Services Center . Video: The beloved teacher befriended many of his students on Facebook and is said to have posted a video to the social media site praising gang membership . School: At the time Richman was placed on leave, he was teaching at the King County Youth Services Center . Richman was a well-liked teacher in the schools, he even befriended many of his students on Facebook. After being placed on leave in May, investigators told Richman of their findings regarding his alleged misconduct and, just two weeks later, Richman resigned. A spokesman for Seattle Public Schools said Richman resigned for, what he described as, 'personal reasons.' However, when Richman voluntarily gave up his teaching license in November, he ended the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction's investigation into the claims against him, according to Seattlepi. The OSPI only has authority over licensed teachers, Richman giving up his license closed the OSPI's investigation. Though the action ended the investigation, in doing so, Richman became ineligible to teach at public and private schools in Seattle.","Seattle teacher Dan Richman, 63, is accused of taking two of his juvenile detention students to a medical marijuana clinic and buying one marijuana .

"After more than five years away from television, Judy Finnigan returned to our screens yesterday – and stepped straight into controversy. The veteran broadcaster sparked fury during her debut as a Loose Women panellist when she suggested a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was ‘drunk’ and the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’. But after a huge public backlash in which hundreds complained online about the ‘disgusting’ and ‘damaging’ remarks, she was eventually forced to ‘apologise unreservedly’ for the offence she had caused. Scroll down for video . Judy Finnigan has provoked outrage after suggesting that a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed back to his club, because the attack 'wasn't violent and the victim was drunk'. She said: 'He didn't cause any bodily harm to the person' Speaking on her Loose Women debut, the veteran broadcaster was discussing allowing rapist Ched Evans to return to play for his former club Sheffield United . Her comments came during a discussion on the ITV lunchtime chat show about whether disgraced footballer Ched Evans should be allowed to return to Sheffield United. The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire, but will be released from jail within days. So far his former club, which cancelled his contract, has refused to comment on whether he will be offered a new one. But on the show, Miss Finnigan – who presented ITV’s This Morning with husband Richard Madeley from 1988 to 2001 – said: ‘He’s served his time. The rape – and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent. He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person. Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence. More than 100,000 people have signed petition to prevent Evans from returning to play . ‘It was unpleasant, in a hotel room, I believe, and she was – she had far too much to drink. And you know, that is reprehensible, but he has been convicted and he has served his time. Now when he comes out, what are we supposed to do? Just actually refuse to let him do his job even though he has already been punished?’ But before the programme had even finished, hundreds of viewers had taken to social media to express their outrage. Women’s rights campaigner Jean Hatchet – who has set up a petition calling for Evans to be banned – told the Daily Mail she was ‘stunned’ by Miss Finnigan’s comments, adding: ‘Drunk women don’t cause rape. Rapists do. 'Evans had sex with a woman without her consent. That is a violent act. [Miss Finnigan] is guilty of such internalised misogyny that I don’t think she was even aware of how hurtful and damaging her comments were.’ Hundreds of viewers also expressed their anger on Twitter. Last night Miss Finnigan, 66, said: ‘I absolutely wasn’t suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and, as I said on the programme, I was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result. ‘The point I was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time? I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used.’ Broadcasting regulator Ofcom said that it had received one complaint about Miss Finnigan’s comments. ITV said it had received no formal complaints. The former Richard & Judy star was signed up to join the show as a regular panellist in an effort to stop a fall in viewing figures - despite vowing to never return to television . As they were: Ms Finnigan made her name as one half of Richard&Judy. The couple, who wed in 1986, worked together side by side for two decades . A petition urging Sheffield United not to reinstate Ched Evans once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people. So far the club, which signed Evans for £3million in 2009, has refused to say whether it will take him back. Women’s rights campaigner Jean Hatchet set up the petition on the website Change.org, calling on the club’s chairman Kevin McCabe and part-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Musa’ad Bin Abdul Aziz to make it clear that Evans – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome. In an open letter to the pair, she said: ‘I’m sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. Unfortunately, he still hasn’t acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd resign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans. ‘They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.’ During the trial in 2012, Evans admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, but denied rape. Evans’ girlfriend Natasha Massey and Professional Footballers’ Association chief Gordon Taylor have backed his return. Sheffield United did not respond to a request for comment yesterday. The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction .","Evans, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman .

"The wait is over. On Thursday, it was officially announced at Buckinghamshire's Pinewood Studios that Daniel Craig would be reprising his role as super-spy 007 in Spectre, the latest film in the saga, which will be directed by Sam Mendes. As well as the veteran bond hero, the latest installment of the action film franchise will see other cast members making a return to the film, including Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw as Q and Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner. However, a new film means a new Bond Girl and this one is perhaps the most illusive we are yet to see. French actress Lea Seydoux will be taking on the role of femme fatale, she'll play the part of Madeline Swann alongside Monica Belluci who at 50, is the oldest Bond girl to ever grace our screens. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Femme fatale: Lea Seydoux was announced as the latest Bond girl in October this year playing the part of Madeline Swann . At 29, some might imagine that Lea lacks the experience of her co-star Monica however the French actress is in no need of practice when it comes to playing the role of an on-screen siren. Lea is perhaps best known for her part in the sexually explicit lesbian drama, Blue is the Warmest Colour. The role saw the actress take part in a seven-minute long sex scene with co-star Adele Exarchopoulos that left very little to the imagination. So when it comes to the sexpectations of a Bond girl,  Lea is unlikely to be camera shy. In fact, some of her required scenes in the Bond film will seem like light relief for Lea - she and Adele openly criticised the director behind the cult gay film, Abdellatif Kechiche, for his over-demanding sex scenes. Cult film: Lea (right) is most famous for starring alongside Adele Exarchopoulos (left) in the 2013 film Blue is the Warmest Colour, which followed the story of two lesbian lovers . Both girls said that despite the film's success - it won top prize at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival - they will never work with Abdellatif Kechiche again, with the Adele adding that most directors would have 'more respect' than to ask what he asked of them. Despite her convincing performance in the film, Lea disappointed many of her legions of fans when she revealed that she was actually in a serious relationship with a man. Although she did admit that months of preparing for the part had left her questioning her sexuality at times. She told the Evening Standard earlier this year: 'Of course I did. Me as a person, as a human being…’ ‘It’s not nothing, making those scenes. Of course I question myself. But…I did not have any revelations.’ Lea guards her love life furiously though and has so far refused to mention her boyfriend's name in any interviews. Controversial: Although her most famous role, Lea revealed that she would never work with the director of the film again because of his demanding attitudes towards the infamous sex scenes . Award winning: Despite the conflict that came with Blue is the Warmest Colour, the film won top prize at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival . While Lea doesn't have the same fame status as some of the previous bond girl alumni, she has been rubbing shoulders with the stars in Hollywood blockbusters for years. In 2009, she made an appearance as Charlotte LaPadite in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds and in 201, she offered Owen Wilson a shoulder to cry on in Woody Allen's 'Midnight in Paris' as Gabrielle, the French girl who shares his love of the songwriter Cole Porter. She has also earned her stripes in the fighting department - it is common knowledge that every Bond girl can kick as well as they can kiss and Lea's triumphs in the film industry have already seen her get in a fair bit of practice. She first tried her hand at spy films when she starred in 2011's 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' as a knife-carrying assassin, sure to come in handy in the 007 flick which is due to be released in November 2015. Haven't we seen you before? Lea appeared alongside Owen Wilson in Woody Allen's 2011 film, Midnight in Paris . She gets about! Lea also made a cameo appearance in Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel where she played a maid (in background) And this role of Madeline Swann should come as quite a triumph for Lea who has been pining after a strong female lead since auditioning for the role of Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She has previously spoken of her disappointment at learning the part had been given to actress Rooney Mara. In an interview with Esquire magazine, she said: 'I got upset, but I don't think I'd be able to do anything to get that part. It was totally against my nature. I worked hard, but Lisbeth was almost anorexic. I wasn't like that.' And the 29-year-old has remained true to her ethics on whether women should change themselves too much for a role. Speaking about the weight of expectation for a Bond girl, she insisted: 'You have to get rid of the pressure, you just have to invent something new.' Fashionable friends: Lea's father is best friends with Christian Louboutin who designed Lea her first pair of designer shoes at the age of 12 . So stylish: Lea has been noted for her good taste in clothing and has landed several fashion campaigns . Trend setter: Lea makes an effort to keep abreast of latest fashions, often seen attending fashion shows such as the Miu Miu Resort Collection 15 (left) She is often spotted wearing Miu Miu, one of her favourite brands (right) One aspect of the Bond girl image that Lea unquestionably fits the bill for, is her penchant for style. The Parisian actress has been turning heads on the red carpet with her bold style choices for the last few years, something that has been influenced by her childhood. Ahead of the release of Blue is the Warmest Colour last summer, Lea revealed told the Evening Standard that her childhood had involved one very stylish perk. In the interview she revealed that her summers as a child were spent with her father's best friend, Christian Louboutin. Sje said: 'He used to come to our holiday house in Brittany, on an island called Bréhat, and draw shoes, shoes, shoes.' His influence saw Lea acquiring expensive taste from a young age when the shoe designer, famous for his red soles, made her sister her first Louboutins when she was 14 and Lea received her first pair at the age of 12. As well as fashionable friends, Lea has grown up surrounded by a family who were blessed with success and style which are no doubt an influence on the young actress' good eye for clothing. Her mother, Valérie Schlumberger, is an actress turned philanthropist and her father is a businessman who runs the French wireless company Parrot. But the family have a long history in film and television - her grandfather Jerome Seydoux is the chairman of the film company Pathé and her granduncle Nicholas is the chairman of Gaumont Film Company. Meanwhile, her older sister Camille is now a stylist who dresses Lea and Bérénice Bejo, star of The Artist. Lea has also dabbled in fashion herself, appearing in a campaign for clothing brand Rag and Bone along side American actor Michael Pitt for their AW13 collection. She also appeared in Miu Miu's 2014 resort campaign with Blue is the Warmest Colour co-star Adele Exarchopoulos and is currently the face of Prada's fragrance, Candy. Lea continued her stylish successes yesterday as she arrived at the announcement of the film's much anticipated title in a fitted black Miu Miu dress, with matching belt and shoes. Filming for the new flick begins on Monday and so far Lea has given little away as to what we can expect from her character. She said: 'I've read the script but it only becomes real when you start. For now it's kind of abstract.' Meanwhile, leading man Daniel was slightly more telling, describing the script for Spectre as 'better than we had last time'. Here come the girls: Lea will star alongside Monica Bellucci (left) and Naomie Harris (right) in Spectre, which is due to start filming on Monday . Optimistic: Daniel Craig (centre) said of the latest Bond film 'We've got an amazing cast and, I think, a better script than we had last time' The 46-year-old actor expects the movie to be superior to the 2012 hit Skyfall, which made more than $1.1 billion (£701million) at the worldwide box office. Although the actor did not speak specifically about Lea, the 46-year-old said that he though his co-stars were 'amazing.' 'We've got an amazing cast and, I think, a better script than we had last time.' The title of the new Sam Mendes-directed film relates to the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE), which is led by iconic evil genius Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the scarred super-villain whose organisation played a prominent part in the Dr. No and Thunderball movies. Plot details of the new movie - which sees Ralph Fiennes replace Dame Judi Dench as M, the head of the MI6 intelligence service - read: 'A cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation. 'While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre. We may not know her name yet but if the phenomenal success of Skyfall, the last James Bond picture, is anything to go by, Seydoux will soon be a global star.","The title of the latest James Bond film, Spectre, was released yesterday .

"Just a stepping stone... A woman models Google Glass, which is being trialled across the U.S. Google hopes one day to use microchips in users' brains . Online advertising giant Google's new wearable accessories are merely a stepping stone to its ultimate ambition - a microchip which can be embedded in users' brains. The company, which uses its search, email and other services to funnel personalised advertising to users, is currently trialling prototypes of its Glass device, which is worn like a pair of glasses. But Google is staking its future on a new service which will use the information it holds on registered users to automatically predict their search needs and present them with the data they want. The ultimate ambition is to literally get inside users' heads: using search queries to read their thoughts and then fulfilling their data needs by sending results directly to microchips implanted into people's brains. Ben Gomes, Google's Vice-President of Search told The Independent that the sinister-sounding vision is far from a sci-fi fantasy and that research had already begun with such chips to help disabled people steer their wheelchairs. 'They are getting a few senses of direction with the wheelchair but getting from there to actual words is a long ways off,' he said. 'We have to do this in the brain a lot better to make that interaction possible. We have impatience for that to happen but the pieces of technology have to develop.' But standing in the way of this ambition is a major civil liberties backlash over claims that Google has conspired with U.S. authorities to open a 'back door' to data it holds on its hundreds of millions of users, allowing spies to monitor their online activities. The company, whose 'Don't be evil' motto has long attracted derision from privacy campaigners, is alleged to have allowed analysts from the National Security Agency to 'mine' the terabytes of personal information it holds. In the so-called PRISM programme, revealed last month in a series of articles in The Guardian, Google and a host of other Silicon Valley firms are alleged to have colluded with the U.S. domestic intelligence agency. As well as Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube, Skype, AOL, and Yahoo are alleged to have allowed agents access to their data to conduct surveillance on users without court orders. Tainted by scandal: Google faces a civil . liberties backlash over claims that it and other internet firms have . conspired with U.S. authorities to give spies a 'back door' to data it . holds on its hundreds of millions of users . Web-users who want to protect their privacy have been switching to a small unheard of search engine in the wake of the 'Prism' revelations. DuckDuckGo, the little known U.S. company, sets itself aside from its giant competitors such as Google and Yahoo, by not sharing any of its clients' data with searched websites. This means no targeted advertising and no skewed search results. Aside from the reduced ads, this unbiased and private approach to using the internet is appealing to users angered at the news that U.S. and UK governments (the National Security Agency (NSA) in the U.S. and GCHQ in the UK), have direct access to the servers of big search engine companies, allowing them to 'watch' users. Within just two weeks of the NSA's operations being leaked by former employee Edward Snowden, DuckDuckGo's traffic had doubled - from serving . 1.7million searches a day, to 3million.'We started seeing an increase right when the story broke, before we were covered in the press,' said Gabriel Weinberg, founder and CEO, speaking to The Guardian. Although strenuously denied by Google, the accusations contained in leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden have provoked a crisis of trust in the company, as web users look for ways to surf the internet without being tracked. Nevertheless, Google sees its future in leveraging the the wealth of information it holds on its users to present them with ever more personalised services. Glass is merely a part of the company's wider information ecosystem, which it intends to exploit with a new service called Google Now, which will present users with a series of bespoke 'cards' as they log on. They will tell users the local weather, any problems they might face on their commute to work, details of meetings harvested from their Gmail accounts, their favourite sports teams latest results, and so on. The service is based on what Google calls its Knowledge Graph, a vast store of information which, The Independent reports, is growing at an 'exponential rate'. Just a year after the project's launch, Knowledge Graph is said to hold 18billion facts on around 570million subjects. The next step, Mr Gomes explained, is for this knowledge to be 'present everywhere'. Scott Huffman, Google's engineering director, continued the explanation. 'Fast forward a bit and… I think there is going to be a device in the ceiling with microphones, and it will be in my glasses or my wristwatch or my shirt,' he said.","Google faces major backlash over claims it colluded with U.S. authorities to open a 'back door' to users' personal information .

"Michelle Obama, her daughters and her mother plan a week-long solo visit to China this month that includes meetings with China's first lady and high school and university students - and that will likely cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars. President Obama and his family have come under heavy scrutiny for the unprecedented high travel costs during his time in office - and a week-long trip to China for four members of the First Family, members of the Secret Service and other members of the White House staff will likely cost several millions of dollars. The president's pricey travels have become so controversial that Judicial Watch was forced to sue the Secret Service and Defense Department to get them to turn over records on the amount of taxpayer money used to fly the First Family all over the world - in many cases for vacations or fundraisers - over the last two years of his administration. Far East: Michelle Obama and her daughters Sasha (left) and Malia (center) will travel to China this month . What the records show was startling. According to Judicial Watch, it cost more than $11 million for the president and his wife to travel to Africa to attend Nelson Mandela's funeral in December of last year. According to the New York Daily News, the Obamas were only in Africa for 'less than 13 hours.' But that trip was nothing compared to a 2013 visit the Obamas made to the Dark Continent, which reportedly cost tax payer more than $100 million. On the 2013 trip, some of the reported expenditures include the stationing of a Navy aircraft carrier off the coast of Africa equipped with a fully staffed medical trauma center, military cargo planes to fly a fleet of 56 support vehicles to transport the Obamas - complete with 14 limousines and three trucks carrying bulletproof glass to cover the windows of the hotels where the Obamas were to stay - and fighter jets that flew in shifts to provide coverage over the president's airspace for the entire trip. In June, the first lady went to Ireland for a two-day trip. The cost to taxpayers: $5 million. Michelle Obama reportedly stayed at a $3,300-per-night hotel in Dublin, and needed to book 30 rooms at the posh Shelbourne Hotel for her staff and security detail. Expensive: Travel expenses for the First Family have cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two years alone . For two vacations the Obamas took in 2013 - one to Hawaii and one to Martha's Vineyard - records show that it cost taxpayers a whopping $7,396,531 in flight expenses alone. That figure also includes travel expenses for the president's trip to California to file the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. During an August trip to California, during which Obama attended a party held by Democratic fundraiser Jeffrey Katzenberg and again appeared on the Tonight Show, taxpayers paid more than $2 million in travel expenses for the president and his security detail. The president will not be joining his family on what will be the first lady's first visit to the Asian economic powerhouse. In an announcement Monday on the White House blog, the first lady says a China visit is important because it is the most populous country in the world, with more than 1.3 billion people, and is an important world actor. Mrs. Obama will travel from March 19-26, spending several days in the capital of Beijing before stops in the central city of Xian and the southwestern city of Chengdu, the White House said. Her schedule includes a meeting with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tonight: Taxpayers footed the more than $2 million bill so Obama could appear on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno . Mrs. Obama missed meeting China's first lady last June when the newly installed Xi, accompanied by his wife, traveled to Southern California for a summit with President Barack Obama. The presidential-level meetings were around the time of Sasha Obama's 12th birthday, and the White House said Mrs. Obama stayed in Washington with family. She wrote a letter to Peng Liyuan welcoming her to the U.S. and expressing hope that they would meet soon in China, the White House said. In China, Mrs. Obama will focus on the power and importance of education, including in her own life, during visits to a high school and a university in Beijing, and a high school in Chengdu. She recently began an effort to encourage America's young people, including some of the most economically disadvantaged, to pursue a college education. On past trips outside the U.S., she also has made the same point to students from the host country. Mrs. Obama grew up in a poor Chicago family, but earned degrees from two of America's best universities. Africa: It cost taxpayers $11 million when the Obamas went to Africa for Nelson Mandela's funeral. They were there for 13 hours . In China, she will be accompanied by daughters, Malia and Sasha, and her mother, Marian Robinson, who lives at the White House. President Obama will not be on the trip; he is scheduled to depart the U.S. later that week for stops in the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Saudi Arabia. Mrs. Obama is encouraging American students to follow her trip on social media and the White House website, where she will post a daily travel blog. In preparation for the trip, she scheduled a visit Tuesday to a Washington charter elementary school with a Chinese-immersion, international baccalaureate program. In her blog post, the first lady said countries today are no longer isolated and face many of the same challenges, whether it is to provide students with a good education, combat hunger, poverty and disease or address threats like climate change. 'These issues affect every last one of us, so it's critically important that young people like you learn about what's going on not just here in America, but around the world,' Mrs. Obama said. 'Because when it comes to the challenges we face, soon, all of you will be leading the way.' 'That's why everywhere I go, whether it's here in the U.S. or abroad, I meet with young people to hear about your challenges, hopes and dreams — and that's what I'll be doing in China as well,' she said. 'I'll be focusing on the power and importance of education, both in my own life and in the lives of young people in both of our countries.' History: First families going back to Richard Nixon have visited China on diplomatic trips, including the family of Bill Clinton, seen here . Among recent first ladies, Laura Bush traveled to China with President George W. Bush, and Beijing was the place where Hillary Rodham Clinton made her now famous declaration at a United Nations women's conference in 1995 that 'women's rights are human rights.' Mrs. Obama's trip will be a highly visible endeavor, but the fact that she's taking the rest of her family suggests 'she's not going in search of a crusade of one sort or another,' said Jonathan D. Pollack, a senior fellow in the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. 'The clear intent here is not to touch any particular hot buttons.' Mrs. Obama's previous solo travels outside the U.S. as first lady were to Mexico in 2010, and Botswana and South Africa in 2011.","The trip will likely cost taxpayers several millions of dollars .

"Millions of us spend our days slaving over a keyboard. But lurking between the keys, hidden on the mouse and nestled in your phone lies more than 10 million bacteria - 400 times more than on the average toilet seat. Unhygienic working conditions are a 'key contributor' to the 131 million working days lost each year in the UK and millions more around the world, to illnesses including colds and flu. Bacteria and viruses can multiply on hard surfaces, remaining infectious for up to 24 hours, hygiene expert and visiting professor at the University of Salford, Dr Lisa Ackerley told MailOnline. She said the average desk is a prime breeding ground for infections, before urging people to disinfect their desks, telephones, keyboards and computer mice. She added that better cleaning and hygiene measures could result in 'significantly fewer sick days'. Now, a new infographic lays bare the stark reality of how important it is to detox your desk. It shows one in five workers fail to clean their workspace before eating, while two in three eat lunch at their desk. Twenty per cent of people never clean their computer mouse, while around 80 per cent of common infections are transmitted by touch. Scroll down for video . A new infographic reveals the typical office worker comes into contact with 10 million bacteria at their desks each day, with the average keyboard harbouring 7,500 bacteria and 20 per cent of all workers never cleaning their computer mouse . 'Our hands are a germ motorway,' Dr Ackerley told MailOnline. 'The slightest cough or sneeze into our hands and the germs start their journey through the office. 'And if somebody doesn't wash their hands the bacteria or viruses can get on your hands, even if you.' She said if one member of the office fails to wash their hands, their colleagues can pick up their bacteria by touching the same door handles and surfaces. Those organisms then risk being transferred when people touch their eyes or mouths, causing colds, coughs, flu, norovirus and food poisoning. 'Any surfaces your hands come into contact with are potential breeding grounds for bacteria and viruses,' Dr Ackerley said. 'From the moment you touch the toilet flush and cubicle door handle, you are at risk of picking up bacteria. 'Even the soap dispenser can pose a threat. Even if you thoroughly wash your hands, if you touch the door handle on the way out, and it's been touched by someone who hasn't washed their hands you will pick up any residue bacteria. 'These organisms are completely invisible. That is why it is so important everyone takes responsibility for their own personal hand hygiene. It is really important to wash your hands.' She said a recent survey found nearly 50 per cent of office workers don't wash their hands after going to the toilet. 'There is no excuse,' she said. 'Those people bypassing the sink are spreading germs all around the office. 'Their refusal to wash their hands means someone else is likely to pick up that bacteria, and risk passing it into their bodies when touching their eyes, mouths or faces. 'Cleaning in offices should really focus on any surfaces that come into contact with anyone's hands. It is important to mop the floors, but really it is desks, sinks, handles, anywhere we put our hands - they are the surfaces that are likely to be really dirty. 'We have all got a responsibility.' Dr Ackerley said past studies have found more than 3,000 organisms per square inch on a keyboard, and more than 1,600 on a computer mouse. She said 16 per cent of people carry norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhoea, but show no symptoms. 'So you may feel perfectly fine and well, but you're carrying around the virus and spreading it around the office,' Dr Ackerley said. Hygiene expert Dr Lisa Ackerley, a visiting professor at Salford University, told MailOnline 'our hands are a germ motorway' picking up harmful organisms which cause colds, flu and norovirus, and spreading them around their desk. Pictured in green is bacteria on a desk . She said washing your hands is key to cutting down on sick days caused by common colds picked up from your desk, and an anti-bacterial disinfectant spray is ideal to kill off the bacteria and viruses, that can live for up to 24 hours on hard surfaces . She recommended using a hand sanitiser after leaving the bathroom, and over the course of the day. And advised using anti-bacterial disinfectant sprays to clean your desk. 'Simple hygiene measures can make a marked difference to reducing the spread of bacteria and viruses in the work-place,' she told MailOnline. 'Employees should wash their hands when arriving at work, particularly if they have been on public transport. 'Office equipment such as telephone handsets, computer keyboards and desks, which are hotspots for viruses and bacteria, and other hard surfaces in regular contact with hands should be cleaned and disinfected regularly using anti-viral and anti-bacterial products such as Dettol Disinfectant Spray which will help to reduce the risk of picking up colds and flu.' But, she said, one of the most effective ways to stop infection is as simple as washing hands. Dr Ackerley said around half of illnesses can be reduced by people religiously washing their hands during the day, not just after going to the toilet, but also before eating. And just 20 seconds of hand washing can stop the journey of the germ. Ensuring the hands are thoroughly dry after a wash is important too, she added.","More than 10 million bacteria lurk on the average office desk with 7,500 organisms hidden in your keyboard .

"Lady Gaga is known for her love of outlandish fashion and her outfits never fail to grab headlines. But the eccentric fashionista went one step further this week with a staggering 16 outfit changes. The 28-year-old changed up to five times each day as she promoted her new album with Tony Bennett. Scroll down for video . Dress to impress: Lady Gaga's outfits yesterday included this stunning red sequin gown and a ballgown skirt with tank top . Transformation: The singer also wore a blue jumpsuit and a fluffy pumps, left, as well as fur coat, in New York yesterday . But how many clothes can one woman need? With an album with Tony Bennett and H&M collaboration to promote, the queen of pop has been keen to turn heads at every opportunity. She put her fashion phonebook to good use yesterday as she stepped out in a number of outfits throughout the day while in New York. At one point, the limelight-seeking singer, who is dating actor Taylor Kinney, showed off her curves in a plunging off the shoulder red gown adorned with sequins. It came after an earlier outing in a peach vest and black skirt. Prior to that, she was pictured in a blue ribbed retro jumpsuit, and then a fur trimmed coat. The singer teamed her ensemble with retro-style sunglasses with her hair in a high bun and a thick fringe which was later slicked back when she pulled on her evening dresses.

"A Russian newspaper has made a series of outlandish claims regarding the MH17 disaster, including that the plane was shot down  in a botched bid by the Ukrainian air force to assassinate Vladimir Putin on the orders of a billionaire oligarch. Pro-Kremlin outlets have long blamed MH17 on Ukraine, and have now taken it one step further and named a Ukranian army pilot they say is guilty of shooting down the plane. A Russian newspaper and TV station claim oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi believed Putin would fly the route in his private jet, and ordered that the Russian President be assassinated by the Ukranian army. Scroll down for video . Complicated claims: The Russian media is claiming that Anna Petrenko, an air traffic controllerin charge of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 flight at the time of the crash, has 'fled' to Dubai with the Ukranian army pilot who 'shot down MH17 on order of Ukranian billionaire oligarch' The ludicrous claims are 'proven' by the fact that the pilot disappeared to Dubai with a glamorous air traffic controller after the MH17 disaster, the Russian news outlets claim. The 'Moment of Truth' programme and Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper say both went on an 'extended holiday' immediately after the Boeing 777 was downed on 17 July, killing all  298 people on board. This 'investigation' also makes the surprising claim that a Ukrainian billionaire - known as an enemy of Putin - masterminded the attack by the air force. It claims that oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi received intelligence that the Kremlin president's aircraft, known as Plane Number One, was due to overfly the region and land at Rostov-on-Don, and ordered what was to become the shooting down of the MH17. This Russian city is close to the crash site. But, it is claimed, Putin's route was changed and the last minute and he landed instead in Moscow. The Pro-Kremlin paper and TV station say oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi believed Putin would fly the same route as MH17 in his private jet, and ordered that the Russian President be assassinated by the Ukranian army . The reports also alleged that the cockpit of the aircraft was hit by a 30mm cannon shot from a Su-25 plane, which they say was piloted by Lt Col Dmitro Yakatsuts of elite 299 squadron in the Ukrainian air force . The reports allege that Lt Col Dmitro Yakatsuts of elite 299 squadron in the Ukrainian air force piloted an Su-25 aircraft tailing MH17 but that he has since disappeared to Dubai. They claim that air traffic controller Anna Petrenko, based in Dnepropetrovsk, was in charge of the Malaysian Airlines flight at the time of the crash, and that she has vanished to the same location. 'No-one is searching for them. It is the first case in the world that an air traffic controller that was in charge of the crashed plane is urgently sent on holiday. She wasn't even interrogated,' claimed Karaulov. The reports also alleged that the cockpit of the aircraft was hit by a 30mm cannon shot from the Su-25 plane. Gone girl: The paper claims air traffic controler Anna Petrenko 'was sent on holiday' after  crash . Pieces of 30mm rounds were found in the bodies of the pilots, and that evidence of such a strike is visible in the nose fuselage of the Boeing, it was suggested. The silhouettes of Putin's Ilyushin and the Boeing were said to be similar. One military expert Aleksandr Shirokorad even alleged the Boeing was hit twice - first by a rocket fired by the Su-25, and then with a surface-to-air missile from the Ukrainian side. 'In my opinion, in the attack on the Boeing together by a (ground fired) anti-aircraft missile also involved an Su-25 military aircraft,' he said. Such attacks were used by the Soviet military machine, claimed Shirokorad, a doctor of military sciences. 'It is a pure criminal story, it is the biggest military crime of the 21st century,' alleged TV presenter Andrey Karaulov, claiming the pair's exact whereabouts are now unknown. It was not immediately possible to verify the claims, and Western experts have warned about Russian efforts to mask the true cause of the downing of the plane bound from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Putin was flying back from a trip to Latin America on the day when the aircraft crashed in a region of Ukraine controlled by pro-Moscow separatist rebels. It was previously stated that the flight paths of MH17 and Putin's aircraft crossed over Poland - but 37 minutes apart. There was no independent verification of any change in the president's flight plan, or a routing involving Rostov-on-Don. A Dutch-led probe into the calamity is expected to report next year but Western governments have claimed the plane was downed by rebels using a ground-based BUK missile system. US sources have alleged the rebels were seeking to target a Ukrainian military aircraft but hit MH17 by mistake.","Pro-Kremlin news claim MH17 was a botched assassination of Putin .

"Police in Connecticut have appealed for witnesses to the brutal murder of a promising Yale student exactly 16 years after she was killed. The body of Suzanne Jovin, a 21-year-old political science major from Goettingen, Germany, was found  slumped on a curb with 17 stab wounds in the East Rock neighborhood on December 4 1998. Investigators never caught her murderer but say they still have not given up hope that the culprit will one day be snared and brought to justice. Cold case: Yale student Suzanne Jovin was brutally stabbed to death 17 times on December 4, 1998 . At the time of the killing, several witnesses said they heard a man and a woman rowing loudly outside the Eli Whitney Luxury Apartments, about 20 minutes before the 911 call reporting that Jovin had been stabbed, Jack Edwards, chief investigator on the case for the Connecticut Chief State's Attorney, told CBS' 48 Hours' Crimesider. He said police want to speak with a couple spotted leaving the building and walking past them. While detectives say they have no new leads, they are hoping to use the 16th anniversary of Jovin's death to bring the case back into the public eye and jog the memories of anyone who was in the area that night. 'We're trying to find out if any of those people may remember that night,' Edwards said. 'It's a little bit vague - it would be important for us to locate any of these people.' The Political Science major, an American born in Germany, was fluent in four languages, sang in the Bach Society Orchestra, had co-founded Yale's German club and invested her time volunteering with programs to tutor inner-city students and help mentally challenged adults. On that fateful Friday, Suzanne Jovin had spent much of the night organizing a social event for Best Buddies, an organization that pairs college students with mentally disabled adults. She had been volunteering with the group since her freshman year. Serene: The bloodied body of the 21-year-old Yale student was found on the corner of Edgehill and East Rock Road in New Haven, Conn. (pictured November 2007) After the event wrapped up, she returned to her apartment at around 8:45pm. Friends had seen Jovin in her room at that time and invited her to join them for a movie but she had declined saying she needed to hit the books. But at 9:25pm, she was spotted leaving the campus near Phelps Gate, the main entrance to Yale. Less than an hour later, at 9:55pm her bloodied body was discovered by residents in a quiet neighborhood near campus. Though the young woman was killed in an upscale area, relatively early in the evening, there were no witnesses to the crime and no significant clues that have led police to a prime suspect. Area residents said they heard a man and woman arguing shortly before they heard a woman screaming. Minutes later Jovin's body was discovered. Investigators have said they believe the student knew her killer, who most likely approached the girl from behind. The killer, who they believe to be male, forcefully stabbed Jovin 17-times, thrusting the knife into her skull so severely that the tip of the knife broke off and was lodged in her head. The killer also slit her throat. 'We have lights on every single street here. … It's not secluded. I just couldn't imagine that anything like that could happen, number one in the neighborhood and then certainly not there,' LaJeune Oxley, a resident who lives at the corner of Edgehill and East Rock Roads where Jovin's body was found, told Vanity Fair in 2007.","Suzanne Jovin, 21, was a political science major from Goettingen, Germany .

"Tommy Wright insisted that Dundee United rival Jackie McNamara will not risk fielding wonderkids Ryan Gauld and John Souttar in Saturday’s William Hill Scottish Cup Final. Wright started the cup final mind games by boldly predicting how United will line up and combating claims his St Johnstone side are the more experienced team. Gauld and Souttar have earned rave reviews this season - and plenty of transfer attention - but Wright argued neither youngster has performed well when facing his St Johnstone side. Honour: Tommy Wright's St Johnstone side will face Dundee United in the Scottish Cup final . ‘Dundee United have got experience. In Gavin Gunning, John Rankin, Sean Dillon, Paul Paton,’ Wright said. ‘He (Jackie) won’t play his young players. John Souttar and Ryan Gauld won’t play. Andrew Robertson will be the only player without a lot of experience in his team. ‘Gary Mackay-Steven has a lot of experience and so does Stuart Armstrong. ‘So I don’t buy into that “young and inexperienced” stuff. They’ve got a good team of players who have got experience in the league and we think we’ve got experience and a blend of youth as well that we can call upon.’ Wright is comfortable his team are the underdogs – despite beating their Tayside rivals three times this season in the league. Some of United’s younger players have been outmuscled in those defeats, prompting Wright to add bullishly: ‘I just feel Gauld and Souttar won’t play. Inexperienced: Wright doesn't believe Dundee will field youngsters such as Ryan Gauld, centre . ‘When you look at it, Souttar hasn’t done particularly well against us or Stevie May. I feel he won’t play him. ‘Ryan Dow normally does okay against us so I think he’ll go with Dow in there instead of Gauld and bring him on later.’ Saints will miss Tim Clancy for the final after the full-back ruptured his Achilles tendon. ‘From my point of view it’s disappointing, but for someone to miss out on a cup final this late, I can’t imagine how he’s feeling,’ said Wright. ‘The players will know the team on Friday. I’ll tell the subs on Saturday morning because there’s one or two I’ll probably have to leave out.’ McNamara expects to tell his squad his starting side later on Friday once the fitness of a couple of key players becomes clearer. ‘(Gary) Mackay-Steven and (John) Souttar both didn’t start last week because of the flu,’ he revealed. ‘They trained on Tuesday and still looked a bit tired. They trained yesterday and we will see how they are. ‘I sort of know the team. Certain things have changed over the last couple of weeks. 'I have not entirely picked it yet, there are still one or two positions that we are still looking at.’ Undecided: McNamara says that he hasn't finalised his complete line-up for the final yet .","St Johnstone boss believes Dundee United will stick to experienced players .

"The Obamas and Bidens spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on three separate vacation trips during last year's President's Day weekend, records show. The total tab for he U.S. Secret Service  came to at least $295,437. President Barack Obama spent that weekend golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida with Tiger Woods' former coach, and appeared briefly with the golf superstar. The first lady and the Obamas' daughters took their annual three-day weekend jaunt to the Colorado ski resort town of Aspen, where they might have bumped into Vice President and Mrs. Biden – who were there on a separate vacation trip. The watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained records from the Secret Service through a Freedom of Information Act request, learning that the cost of protecting the president that weekend came to $98,135.79. That total included $32,406.50 for flights, $16,466.25 for rental cars and $48,490 for hotel rooms. President Obama played golf for three days in Florida while Secret Service agents kept watch and blocked traffic for his motorcade -- all at a steep price . The first lady and the Obama children hti the slopes in Aspen, billing the taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars in related security expenses . The U.S. Secret Service protects current and past presidents, vice presidents and their families year-round, whether they're at work in Washington or just vacationing on a golf course somewhere . 'The Obamas and Vice President Biden are oblivious to the costs to taxpayers for their vacation travel,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. Michelle Obama's trip cost the government at least $81,523.64 to keep her, Sasha and Malia safe, including $13,221.30 for flights, $3,925 for rental cars and a whopping $64,377.34 in weekend hotel bills. Not to be outdone, the Bidens' ski weekend cost the most in hard dollars: $115,777.61. The vice presidential family's security detail spent $92,596 on lodging, $17,866.61 on car rentals and $5,315 on flights. President Obama's trip also carried another substantial cost: Air Force One is among the world's most expensive aircraft to operate. The president's private Boeing 747 costs taxpayers $179,750 per hour to fly, according to government estimates published in 2012. First lady Michelle Obama schussed down hills at the Buttermilk ski area in Aspen, trailed by Secret Service the whole way . Actual size: Air Force One costs nearly $180,000 PER HOUR to operate . Who, me? -- Michelle Obama's security detail for a three-day ski trip last year set taxpayers back more than $81,000 . The Obama administration has come under fire for the expenses it incurs on personal travel and parties. There have been no estimates yet on the cost of Mrs. Obama's 50th birthday soiree at the White House. ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl caught White House Press Secretary Jay Carney off guard on Thursday by asking what the final price tag was. Carney referred him to the East Wing, where Mrs. Obama's office is located, for the answer.

In talks: Thirty-year-old Prince Harry speaks to a veteran during a visit to the Field of Remembrance . Following that he visited the plots of poppies, meeting veterans from past and more recent conflicts. The Prince stopped to chat to Lisa McKinlay, whose husband Lance Corporal Jonathan McKinlay, 32, was shot dead on a patrol in Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2011 whilst serving with 1st Battalion The Rifles. Designed by Belgian architect Piet Blanckaert, the garden at Wellington Barracks in central London was inspired by the design of the First World War memorials. Philippe, King of the Belgians, lays a wreath at the memorial garden today . The site carries the insignia of all the seven guards regiments whose members sacrificed their lives on the battlefields. It features levels of soil designed to replicate the final resting place of fallen soldiers, as well as a central circular bed and an inscription from John McCrae's In Flanders Fields. It also includes a bench made from Flemish bluestone and trees indigenous to the battlefields. Major General Edward Smyth-Osbourne, general officer commanding the Household Division and Headquarters London District, said: ‘The foot guards regiments are made up of Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards and Welsh Guards and so represent all four nations of the United Kingdom. ‘Taken with the two mounted regiments from the Household Cavalry, the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, they also represent both cavalry and infantry. ‘In the same way that these 70 sandbags of soil represent all the battlefields of Flanders, these seven regiments represent all the British expeditionary forces who gave their lives for our freedom.’ William and his brother Prince Harry were due to hold a royal reception for 300 guests who helped create the memorial to the war dead. Mrs McKinlay, 35, had planted a wooden cross with a poppy and a photograph of her husband of 10 months at the front of the Afghanistan war dead section of the Field of Remembrance, one of 100,000 crosses placed there by friends and families of individual servicemen and women who died serving their country. She said: ‘Harry was saying how nice it was to see the names on all the crosses. He knows about The Rifles and everything they do, and was saying how much support they give to their families. ‘He said you have to strike a balance between spending your time remembering what has happened and moving forward with your job and family. ‘I was a little bit nervous about meeting him but I like attending these events because it is Jon’s name that I am able to remember and I want his name remembered for as long as possible.’ Lance Corporal McKinlay, of Garstang, Lancashire, had a stepdaughter with his wife and a daughter and stepson from a previous relationship. ‘I have planted my cross here today and I was able to show it to Prince Harry, which was really special,’ said Mrs McKinlay. ‘He is lovely and I have a lot of respect for him because he works in the forces.’ The Prince, wearing the No.1 dress uniform of the Blues and Royals with a poppy on his hat band, planted his own wooden cross, with his personal insignia on it, in a large cross made of poppies before the Last Post was sounded by a Bandsman of the Welsh Guards. Among the war veterans he chatted to was Don Sheppard, 94, who landed on Juno Beach on D-Day in 1944 as a Sapper with the Royal Engineers. Mr Sheppard, who was representing the Normandy Veterans’ Association, said: ‘The Prince was asking me about our plot and how long it took to do. ‘It’s so important to do this to so that the younger generation can see what we have done.’ Former Warrant Officer Douglas Radcliffe, 91, who completed 21 operations as a Wireless Operator in Wellington Bombers during the Second World War and was representing the Bomber Command Association, joked with Prince Harry about his walking frame, which has a seat built into it. ‘He asked me what it was and I told him I hadn’t nicked it from the supermarket. I also told him I wished he wasn’t so tall because I really had to look up at him.’ Among the current service personnel at the Field, which is now in its 86th year, was Corporal Louise Sheppard-Clayton, 30, of the Army Air Corps, with which the Prince flew Apache helicopters during his second tour of Afghanistan. She said: ‘I wanted to ask him whether he hopes to come back to us but I didn’t get the chance. ‘He was asking me about the plot and I said it was going to take a long time to put all the crosses out because sadly we have lost so many people since the Corps was formed in 1957.’ The Field of Remembrance, organised each year by the Royal British Legion, began in 1928, when just two crosses were planted, but has grown in popularity over the decades and is now an integral part of the nation’s annual acts of remembrance. It is the second time that Harry, 30, has visited the Field of Remembrance. His Royal Highness accompanied The Duke of Edinburgh in 2013. The first Field of Remembrance was held in the grounds of Westminster Abbey in November 1928. That year only two Remembrance Tribute Crosses were planted. But it began a tradition that took root and has grown and grown over the decades. Each Remembrance Tribute carries a personal message to someone who lost his or her life in the Service of the country. Joining Harry in taking part in remembrance-themed events in London today was The Queen. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duke of Cambridge, she was joined by the King of the Belgians for the opening of the Flanders Fields Memorial Garden at Wellington Barracks in London. The garden has been created with soil taken from 70 battlefield cemeteries in Flanders. The ‘sacred soil’ for the new garden was gathered last year by more than a thousand Belgian and British school children, a handful of whom attended today’s opening event. The service of dedication was accompanied by music from the Band of the Grenadier Guards and the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry.

After prayers the Queen and King Philippe laid wreaths in the garden, followed by wreaths laid by representatives of the seven Guards Regiments of the Household Division. Immediately after the ceremony, the Major General of the Household Division, Major General Edward Smyth-Osbourne, escorted the Royal party into the Guards Chapel where the Queen and the Duke were each given a silver reliquary of soil from the cemeteries. The garden replaces a pond which was described by Andrew Wallis, the curator of the Guards Museum, as ‘miserable’. As the Duke of Cambridge joked at reception afterwards, ‘no self-respecting duck would be seen on that pond.’ Designed by a Belgian architect, Piet Blanckaert, the garden is inspired by the design of the First World War memorials and carries the insignia of all the seven Guards Regiments which fought on the battlefields of Flanders. The design of the garden – intended to be a quiet place of reflection and contemplation – includes a central circular bed which holds the sacred soil and is inscribed with the words of John McCrae’s poem: ‘In Flanders Fields’. The soil was brought to London after an Armistice Day ceremony last year at the Menin Gate in Ypres attended by the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Laurent of Belgium. A gun carriage of the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery was laden with 70 First World War-style sandbags, each filled with soil from a specific cemetery. The garden also has a bench made from Flemish Bluestone and trees indigenous to the battlefields of Flanders.","Harry visits Field Of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey while Queen attends Flanders Fields Memorial Garden .

"A woman whose boyfriend confessed he was actually born a girl has opened up about their relationship and rubbished claims that they are in a gay relationship. Charlotte Urie, 20, has been dating Kieran Moloney, who used to be called Ciara, for two years. For years, 23-year-old Kieran kept his sex-swap a secret, until he met Charlotte in 2012. Speaking about meeting Kieran and finding out the truth on This Morning, Charlotte said: 'When we first met, it was boy meets girl. But then as the relationship went on, Kieran told me that he was born a female.' Speaking out: Charlotte Urie, 20, has been dating Kieran Moloney, who was born a girl called Ciara, for two years. Today, they appeared on This Morning and spoke about their relationship . She continued: 'He obviously had some reservations about telling me, as you can imagine. 'But I was relieved that he wanted to carry on the relationship with me because I'd fallen in love with him for who he was.' The couple have now been together for two years and are hoping to marry and start a family using Kieran's best friend as a sperm donor. Kieran, originally from New Zealand, but now living in London, opened up about revealing his secret. He said: 'It (happened after) about three weeks. We weren't ""together"" yet, (so) it was the deciding moment. 'It was so scary because it is something that is completely out of the norm and a lot of people don't know enough about it, so they judge you on it. It was scary, this is a girl I really cared for. 'There's two people in a relationship - there's someone that deserves to know and someone (who wants you) to fall in love with them for them.' Opening up: For years, 23-year-old Kieran kept his sex-swap a secret, until he met Charlotte in 2012 and the pair fell in love. They are now planning on having a family . Final steps: He explains that he has only had top surgery and not lower surgery because he feels it isn't advanced enough yet. 'For me, it has to be perfect,' he added . Growing up: Kieran was born as girl called Ciara (right), but since the age of four he was unhappy with his gender . Kieran, who works as a barista, had been unhappy with his gender since he was four years old. He had no interest in girly things and cried if his mother put him in a dress and when he started primary school, he became a target for bullies. He said: 'From the moment I could think and make decisions for myself, I knew I was different. I knew I wanted to be a boy. I didn't just like females, I knew I wanted to be a boy.' Kieran credits his family with being 'amazing' when he told them about his decision. His mother Bronagh Moloney, 49, a nurse, began calling him her son. 'Ive been through so many hard times. My family were amazing. They knew before me, they knew straight away. Instead of Barbie dolls, it was trucks,' he said. 'A lot of people asked me how I was going to tell my family but it wasn't asking them, it was more a case of ""this is what I'm doing are you with me or are you not?"" They were with me.' Support system: Charlotte said that if the surgery became more advanced and that's what Kieran really wanted to do, of course she would support him . Kieran has been living as a man for seven years. He cut his hair into a short spiky bob and wore sports bras and baggy tops to hide his feminine figure, then after seeing a counselor aged 16, Kieran was finally diagnosed as transgender. By 17, fine hairs started to grow on Kieran's face and with a rigorous gym workout, his body started transforming into a man's. He began binding his breasts with sports tape, spending £20 a week in his quest to hide any hint of being a woman. Gradually, his cup size dropped from a B to an A. In November 2009, aged 18, Kieran started monthly testosterone injections and, two years later, had a £5,000 double mastectomy that was paid for by his mum. Kieran is yet to have full gender reassignment surgery. In his teens, Kieran began binding his breasts with sports tape, spending £20 a week in his quest to hide any hint of being a woman. At 18, he had a £5,000 double mastectomy . He explains that he has only had top surgery and not lower surgery because he feels it isn't advanced enough yet. 'For me, it has to be perfect,' he added. When asked about their sex life, Charlotte said: 'I believe what happens behind closed doors with a couple, happens behind closed doors. 'I am a straight girl with a straight boy and that's the way it is.'

"Wounded: John Wood claimed he was injured in an attempted mugging, but that was untrue . A pub landlord who became a local hero after claiming he single-handedly fought off four muggers made the whole thing up, it has emerged. John Wood has been fined for lying to police over the amazing story, which made national headlines. At the time of the alleged attack, he proudly showed off the stomach wound he said they had given him - but now the origins of the injury are a total mystery. The 37-year-old told police and reporters that he had been attacked by four men outside a takeaway in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, but managed to fight them off without even dropping the chips he had bought. But after officers started investigating the story in an attempt to prosecute the muggers, it quickly unravelled as they discovered there was no CCTV footage of the incident and concluded that the attack never took place at all. Now Wood has been issued with an £80 fixed penalty notice for wasting police time after apparently admitting he had fabricated . After the incident earlier this month he was hospitalised with a serious stomach wound which required 18 stitches, and it is now unclear how the damage was sustained. He denies lying to police, and told the Wisbech Standard that the only reason he accepted the fine was 'just to get this bloody matter finished'. Dave Murphy, of Cambridgeshire Police, said today: 'This man not only wasted police time, but he also raised the fear of crime in the local community. 'I hope this serves as a lesson to anyone who thinks they can lie to the police and get away with it.' Brave: Pub landlord Wood, pictured with his fiancée Claire Upton, became a local hero after the fabricated tale of his exploits in fighting off his attackers spread . Scene: The incident allegedly happened shortly after Mr Wood left Frank's Fish & Chip shop in Wisbech . At the time Wood said he had put martial arts training from when he was a teenager into good use to fend off his attackers. He said: 'The men stopped me and demanded my phone and wallet. I told them that if they wanted it they'd have to come and get it. Tough? Mr Wood shows his bruised knuckles outside his pub, The Marshland Arms . 'They . all came at me at once, I kicked two of them in the leg. I used to do a . little bit of aikido and I remembered to go for the knees. They fell to . the floor and couldn't get up. 'As . I did that another clipped me in the face. I turned around and hit him . and he fell. I turned around again and the other one came at me with . what I thought was a knife. 'He . just lunged and I felt a sharp twang in my side. I grabbed his hands so . he couldn't bring it out and stab again. I pulled it out myself, . disarmed him and then hit him. I think he was knocked out. 'Then I just got in my car and left, I didn't even drop the chips.' Wood, . who owns the Marshland Arms in Marshland St James, then supposedly . drove back to fiancée Claire Upton's house with their food. When his wound wouldn't stop bleeding, . Wood went to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn several hours . later where he needed 15 internal and three external stitches. Doctors said at the time that his injuries looked like they had been inflicted with a sharpened screwdriver. Wood said: 'The screwdriver deflected off my ribs apparently, it was a millimetre away from going into my lung. If it had gone through that it would have hit my liver, I was very lucky. 'If it had been a couple of inches over it could have been me lying in the alleyway. I dread to think what would have happened if it was somebody else in that situation. 'My fiancée was going to go for the fish and chips but I said it was too dangerous. I would never have forgiven myself if I had let her go and she'd been attacked.'","John Wood said he was attacked as he left a takeaway and fought muggers .

"Tragic: Lucia Rodrigo, 16, was found dead along with her horse in what police have ruled is a 'suspicious death' A 16-year-old horse rider has been found dead along with her horse in what police have ruled is a 'suspicious death.' The body of Lucia Rodrigo, 16, was discovered on a riding path in Southwest Ranches, Broward County, Florida, on Thursday afternoon. Police were called to incident at 4:03 p.m. and found the teenager's body near that of her horse Brownie. Sgt. Ed Smith said the circumstances surrounding the death remain unknown, and police are investigating the incident as a 'suspicious death.' Witnesses said just after 4 p.m. they saw the girl, a junior at Cypress Bay High, on the quarter-horse galloping past them. The witnesses said the duo was going at a high rate of speed, comparing it to that of a race horse. A woman who helped teach Lucia how to ride, told CBS4 she believes the horse may have suffered an aneurysm and died on the spoy, throwing Lucia off. The woman, who did not want to be identified, said the horse was well known in the area and did not have any known health problems. She also said the Lucia was an experienced rider who had ridden Brownie previously. Investigation: The teen was found on a riding path in Southwest Ranches, Broward County, Florida on Thursday afternoon. She was found near her horse Brownie (pictured) 'Everybody loves her, she loves riding horses,' said family friend Terri Shure. 'She was a great kid.' She said the teenager was riding her sister's 18-year-old horse. Davie Police said the horse will be taken to the University of Florida to undergo a necropsy to determine a cause of death. 'It's a traumatic and tragic occurrence and unfortunately a young adult was killed,' said Southwest Ranches Mayor Jeff Nelson, who was on the scene late Thursday night. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends.'","Lucia Rodrigo, 16, was found on a riding path in Florida on Thursday .

"A 12-year-old boy has killed himself after schoolmates bullied him for being a cheerleader, according to friends. Ronin Shimizu, a former student at Folsom Middle School in Folsom, California, took his life on Wednesday afternoon but police are not releasing any further details about his death. The school district has confirmed that the boy's parents, who also have a younger son, complained on multiple occasions that he was being bullied and officials said that they followed protocol. But friends say that the taunting continued. He recently left Folsom Middle School to be home schooled. Tragedy: Ronin Shimizu, 12, took his life on Wednesday after friends say he was bullied for being the only male cheerleader on his middle school's team (right). His parents had previously complained to the school . Joy: Friends said that bullies called him 'gay' for cheerleading but that he loved being part of the team . Shock: Some friends say they were stunned he was so unhappy because he always had a smile on his face . On Thursday night, friends and their parents gathered outside the Shimizu home to hold a quiet candle light vigil. 'I heard that people called him gay because he was a cheerleader,' one of his teammates told CBS Sacramento at the vigil. Ronin was the only male cheerleader with the Vista Junior Eagles Cheer Team. 'Bullying him because of cheerleading… it's not right,' 11-year-old Mia Kleinbardt told Fox40. 'It's what he loves to do.' Other friends expressed their shock, saying Ronin never revealed how much he was hurting. 'He was always so passionate like he didn't care what a lot of people said,' Hunter Reed, a friend from drama club, told Fox40. 'He just kept going on with life. He was always so happy, like the happiest person I've ever met.' Tragedy: Ronin, who had a little brother, had recently left the middle school to be home schooled . Loss: Ronin was remembered as a friendly student who loved drama and making his own clothes . Folsom Cordova School District added that they have a comprehensive anti-bullying campaign. 'I heard that somebody called the bullies and told them that he passed away and they were like shocked,' another child, Riley Coleman, said. They 'learned their lesson on how words can hurt.' Daniel Thigpen with the Folsom Cordova School District said that officials were looking into the complaints made by the boy's family. 'Any allegations bullying related to this specific incident, we're certainly reviewing how we responded to those and we'll use that as an opportunity to always take a look at how we respond to future allegations,' he said. Grief counselors are at the school to help students and staff. The Vista Jr Eagles, the team Ronin had cheered for, also released a statement as they shared photos of the young, grinning boy in his cheer uniform. Remembered: Friends and parents gathered for a candle-lit vigil outside his house on Thursday . 'Tragically, we lost one of our own yesterday, Ronin Shimizu,' it read.

"Slumped on her knees in the freezing cold snow and unable to contain her grief, a devastated Ukrainian woman weeps beside the body of her father after he was killed by a stray shell. Vladimir Churilov, aged 58, had been returning home with his wife after they went to pick up their pensions when the shells landed in the city of Donetsk, spraying them with shrapnel. But while his wife was injured and taken to hospital, the man was killed and his body left bleeding in the snow. Scroll down for video . Galina Bayeva is slumped on her knees in the snow as she and her son cry over the body of her father Vladimir Churilov, who was killed by a stray shell in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine . Mr Churilov was sprayed the shrapnel from the shell as he and his wife were returning home from collecting their pension. His wife was injured and is being treated in hospital . Mrs Bayeva is unable to contain her grief after the death of her father as her son also holds his head in is hands, while her husband speaks on his mobile phone . The man was discovered by his daughter Galina Bayeva who fell to the floor on seeing her father slumped on the ground and covered her mouth with her hands as she began to cry. Her son was also clearly devastated by the discovery of his grandfather and could also be seen holding his hands to his face while her husband made a call on his mobile phone. Mrs Bayeva said: 'Dad's been killed. Mum's in hospital. They didn't make it home. They'd gone to get their pensions. 'Dad is lying here. He's full of holes, full of sharpnel.' Clashes in east Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist rebels are fighting Kiev government troops, have continued despite the signing of a ceasefire three months ago, and the death toll has risen to more than 4,300 since mid-April. Despite a ceasefire being agreed three months ago, shelling has continued in Donetsk with many houses, such as the one pictured, being damaged on the attacks . The prolonged fighting in Ukraine has also destroyed infrastructure and homes in the east of the country, with many fearing the oncoming winter . A man walks past a partially destroyed house after more shelling in Donetsk, as clashes continue in eastern Ukraine . The prolonged fighting has destroyed infrastructure and homes in the east of the country, leaving many residents without warmth or safe shelter for the winter. Galina Zarubina's house, a street away from where the couple were attacked, was also damaged in today's shelling. She said: 'I can't stand it. How do I live? No bread, no money. Somebody - save us.' Meanwhile in Kiev, the army said six soldiers had been killed and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours in clashes with separatists. Spokesman Andriy Lysenko explained separatist forces had also suffered 'big losses' in three concerted attempts to break through Ukrainian positions, including at the international airport in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, but had been beaten back. A Ukrainian forces armoured vehicle patrols the streets of a residential area in Donetsk, despite he ceasefire . A Ukrainian soldiers shows off a damaged tank which was also targeted during clashes despite the three-month ceasefire . Ukrainian and separatist leaders have officially said they will observe a supplementary truce on an agreed 'Day of Silence' on Tuesday to prepare the way for creation of a non-militarised buffer zone. But it is far from clear if the latest of many peace efforts will succeed. It comes as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov criticised Western nations today for constantly attempting to blame his country for the crisis in Ukraine. Mr Lavrov reiterated Moscow's calls for Kiev to hold direct talks with pro-Russian rebels fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine, saying it 'makes no sense' to seek ways out of the conflict without the separatists' involvement. He said: 'Our Western colleagues, some European countries but Americans first and foremost ... if they want to try to present us as the main culprits, which is what they are constantly doing ... this is not right, this won't work.' The West says Russia provides arms and troops to the rebels to destabilise Ukraine and stall its drive towards mainstream Europe. Moscow denies being part of the armed conflict. He also called on Kiev's Western backers, including France and Germany, to press Ukraine to carry out constitutional reform, which Moscow has said must give the Russian-speaking eastern regions wide autonomy.

Meanwhile French president Francois Hollande urged Russian leader Vladimir Putin to look to the future rather than the past to help ease tensions in Ukraine. In a policy speech yesterday, Mr Putin evoked the lessons of history to shift the blame for many of Russia's problems on to the West, accusing 'enemies of yesterday' of trying to bring a new Iron Curtain down around Russia. But today Mr Hollande said: 'As for the declaration by Mr Putin, who went back to the past in his speech, we should concentrate on the future - while not forgetting the lessons of the past. 'The tension, the pressure at the moment can in no way serve as a solution to problems,' he added, suggesting that he, Mr Putin, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and German Chancellor Angela Merkel should 'start the process of reducing tension' together.","Vladimir Churilov had been to pick up his pension along with his wife .

"Thomas Pfeiffer, 44, was charged with abortion, strangulation and assault . An anesthesiologist allegedly choked a woman and forced her to swallow a pill that could cause an abortion after she told him she was pregnant. Police responded on Wednesday night to a 'no voice' 911 call from a home in the town of Rosendale, 60 miles south of Albany, New York, according to the Ulster County Sheriff's Office. On arrival, deputies learned that 44-year-old Thomas Pfeiffer, of Red Hook, had choked the woman and forced her to swallow a pill that could cause an abortion.

Police said that Pfeiffer allegedly tried to force the woman to take Plan B - an emergency contraceptive pill. Pfeiffer was charged with strangulation, abortion and assault. Police reported that more charges are pending. He's being held on Friday in the county jail on $50,000 cash bail. It couldn't immediately be determined if he has a lawyer.

"A multi billion-dollar  lawsuit, which has been ten years in the making, could be in jeopardy. Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market, and only earlier this week lawyers claimed the firm had deliberately deleted rivals' songs from iPods. But, the tech giant has launched an eleventh-hour challenge after presenting new evidence suggesting the women named as claimants may not have bought models covered by the suit - making the claims invalid. Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market. Earlier this week, lawyers claimed it had deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods from 2007 to 2009. But, the tech giant has challenged the suit after presenting evidence suggesting the plaintiffs' models of iPod may be invalid . If true, this could derail the long-running, class-action case over the tech giant's use of restrictive software that kept iPods from playing digital music sold by competitors to its iTunes store. The case went to trial in California this week, after being filed a decade ago. On Wednesday, the prosecution told the court that for at least two years, Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores. Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings. Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market, and only earlier this week lawyers claimed the firm deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods. The case went to trial in California this week, after being filed a decade ago. Plaintiffs are claiming that Apple's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed Apple to sell iPods at inflated prices. They are seeking $350 million (£224m) in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds Apple broke federal anti-trust law. Apple stopped using the particular software in question in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers iPod models bought between September 2006 and March 2009.

Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings. And the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' But Apple insisted the move was a legitimate security measure. Now, Apple has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought iPod models covered by the lawsuit. And the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' Attorney Patrick Coughlin said: 'You guys decided to give them the worst possible experience and blow up' a user's music library.' But Apple insisted that the move was a legitimate security measure. Security director Augustin Farrugia said in court that his company was protecting users from hackers and malware by removing MP3s downloaded from outside of iTunes. Now, Apple has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought iPod models covered by the lawsuit. Plaintiffs are claiming Apple's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed Apple to sell iPods at inflated prices. They are seeking $350 million (£224m) in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds Apple broke federal anti-trust law. Apple stopped using the particular software in question in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers iPod models bought between September 2006 and March 2009. This means the colourful iPod Nano, released in September 2009, and later generations of the devices are not covered. After plaintiff Marianna Rosen gave evidence, Apple lawyers said they checked the serial number on her iPod Touch and found it was purchased in July 2009. In a letter sent to the court late on Wednesday night, Apple lawyer William Isaacson said it appears the other plaintiff, Melanie Wilson, bought iPods outside the relevant time frame or, in one instance, purchased a model that did not have the specific version of software at issue in the case. Opposing lawyers are not ready to give up the case, but US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers told both sides to file written arguments on whether the trial should proceed because she wants to begin considering the issue. 'I am concerned that I don't have a plaintiff. That's a problem,' the judge said at the end of the trial's third day of evidence in Oakland. Mr Isaacson, who suggested the lawsuit could not proceed without a claimant, said he was asked for proof that either woman had purchased an iPod covered by the case. Claimants say Apple's (co-founder Steve Job is pictured) restrictive software froze out competitors. Apple stopped using the software in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers models bought until March 2009. But serial numbers show plaintiff Marianna Rosen's iPod was bought in July 2009 . Plaintiffs' lawyer Bonny Sweeney said her side was checking for other receipts. She conceded that Ms Wilson's iPods may not be covered, but also noted that an estimated eight million owners were believed to have bought the affected iPods. This isn't the first time Apple has been in trouble for controlling music on devices. Earlier this year, the firm automatically added U2's Songs of Innocence album to millions of iOS devices without permission. In total, the album was added to iTunes Store customers in 119 countries. Users took to Twitter and Facebook to express outrage at the plans and many moaned the album was difficult to remove from their devices. In response, the tech giant  now created a dedicated page that lets users remove the album by signing in with their Apple ID . Reports claim Apple paid the band $100 million as part of the deal. The judge appeared irked at the last-minute hitch in a case that was originally filed nearly 10 years ago. She said she was not ready to decide without further briefing, but indicated she did not want to leave the issue unresolved indefinitely. Apple declined to comment on legal proceedings.

"Knowing the best cuts of meat, your prosciutto from your carpaccio and what wine to have with your meal determines whether you are a foodie, a study has revealed. A true foodie shops for local food, never dines out at chain restaurants and often asks to speak to the chef after a good meal. They also know restaurant recommendations off the top of their head and have access to a cupboard full of fresh herbs and spices, the poll of 2,000 adults found. High standards: Foodies are quick to complain when served a bad meal, the survey of 2,000 people found . Expert knowledge: Asking the butcher to prepare meat a specific way is a sign of a true foodie . Four in ten adults considered themselves a foodie whilst 55 per cent said food is one of the most important aspects of their lifestyle. Forty-three percent said that 'real' foodies knows all the best restaurants whilst 35 per cent think a foodie would confidently use terms such as terrine, carpaccio and prosciutto in a conversation. They also know the best cuts of meat and which wine goes with which meal - and will always write a review of a restaurant on returning home. And it seems having a foodie friend would be educational as almost three in ten said they would expect one to know where their food comes from, as well as the nutritional content.

She said: 'Food from all cultures is easily and readily available to us these days, and Britons can explore and experiment more than ever. 'Whilst some people think the only convenient option is to go to a chain restaurant, they'd be surprised how easy it is to find a new or independent restaurant. 'With this in mind it's no surprise that more and more people consider themselves ""foodies"". 'And it has its advantages – meeting and knowing foodies means you'll never eat a bad meal again.' According to 15 per cent, a foodie would snub chain-diners in fear of a bad meal, choosing instead to support local, independent eateries. They would also have knowledge of hidden gem restaurants and be able to recommend them off the top of their head. More than half said they were a foodie because, when faced with a menu, they are not averse to trying something new. A confident 41 per cent said their interest in going out to eat has given them an expert knowledge in food. Whilst a further 32 per cent claimed they deserved the name because they prefer to eat locally-sourced food rather than grab a bite of fast food.","Poll by Zomato UK showed one in four consider themselves foodies .

Bisciotti also stated that those who spoke with ESPN's Outside the Lines were 'sources [who] work for Ray,' and that much of the information they gave was 'manufactured.' He believes Rice is using his friends to talk to the media in hopes of building up a case for reinstatement. ESPN reported last week that the Ravens head of security Darren Sanders was told about the incident, and video, involving Rice and his then-fiancée Janay Palmer by a local police officer just hours after it happened, and then immediately described the event in detail to team executives. They also said these claims had been corroborated by team officials, current and former league officials, NFL Players' Association representatives and associates, and advisers and friends of Rice. In their statement released today, the Ravens disputed all of these facts. Sanders said that he did not see the tape, and actually had to ask the Atlantic City Police Department for a copy days after the incident. After they refused to send him a tape, one officer did describe to him the events happening in the elevator, but not as they were later seen when the tape was released to the public earlier this month. 'As he described it, Janay appeared to initiate the altercation, but they both spit at and struck each other, resulting in Janay falling and hitting her head against the wall railing,' said Sanders. 'The officer could not tell from the video whether Ray slapped or punched her, but Ray told me very clearly that he did not punch her.' Denied: Bisciotti (second from left) also shot down claims he asked NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (second from right, presenting Bisciotti with the Lombardi Trophy in 2013) to go easy on Rice following the incident . They next took on claims that Goodell went easy on Rice as a favor to his close friend Bisciotti. 'I did not ask Roger Goodell to give Ray Rice no more than a two-game suspension,' said Bisciotti. 'I did not make any request for a ""favor"" or any particular outcome.' He then stated of his relationship with Goodell, 'The two of us have spent very little time together - as I recall, one round of golf and one dinner several years ago.' He did however admit that team executives did fail when they did not push harder to get a copy of the tape. Later in the day, during a news conference, Bisciotti said, ""The majority of the sources [from the report] are people that work for Ray. Almost everything in there is anonymous, but it's clear from the subject matter that it's Ray's attorney, it's Ray's agent, it's Ray's friends.' According to ESPN, he then said that a significant amount of the information in the story was 'manufactured' by members of Rice's camp. Josh Krulewitz, ESPN's vice president of communications, went on Twitter this afternoon following the Ravens statement and Bisciotti's news conference to say, 'We stand by our reporting.'","Ray Rice got a little good news today when Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said he would possibly rehire the football star 'down the line'

"Former Oklahoma running back Brennan Clay is continuing to publicly accuse his wife of cheating on him with college teammate and Dallas Cowboys star DeMarco Murray, now posting what he claims are intimate text messages between the two to Twitter. And he says there are more are to come. Clay, 22, played alongside Murray, 26, for the University of Oklahoma Sooners in the 2010 season, but announced to the world this week that his wife of just five months, Gina D'Agostini, is having an affair with Murray. Taking it a step further Thursday night, Clay revealed explicit texts he allegedly found in his wife's phone, including one about the two having sex in his own bed, according to Gawker. Scroll down for video . Love triangle: Dallas Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray (right) has been accused of having an affair with Dallas fitness instructor Gina D'Agostini -- who also happens to be the wife of his former college teammate, Brennan Clay. Clay has now posted to Twitter explicit texts apparently exchanged between the pair . Left in the cold? Ex Oklahoma Sooners running back Brennan Clay (pictured in 2013) has publicly claimed his wife of just five months is cheating on him with Cowboys star player DeMarco Murray . Clay said the text conversation happened on October 5, once he left to go to training for the San Diego Chargers. After saying goodbye to Clay at the airport, D'Agostini appears to text Murray, saying that her 'roomate(sic)' has gone. Clay claims his wife disguised Murray's number in her phone by saving it under 'Spray Tan'. 'So I can f--- u in your bed now?' Murray allegedly wrote back. 'Is that where you want to f--- me? And yes,' D'Agonstini allegedly replied. To further prove his point, Clay also posted another screen shot of his wife's phone, showing the 'Spray Tan' number to have an area code of Las Vegas, where Murray is from. His online rant first started on Sunday, saying he found more than 50 'inappropriate' texts. 'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote  to his nearly 25,000 followers. Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended. However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong. '1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller. Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just five months according to a Facebook profile that appears to belong to Clay. Clay did not fail to convey how he feels about the alleged breach of trust, however. 'I'm disgusted...' Clay wrote, before heading off for some spiritual consolation.

"Disney has announced the latest in a long line of merchandise inspired by its hit animated movie Frozen - a range of Princess Elsa and Anna beauty products. The make-up collection includes an eyeshadow palette - complete with separate Elsa and Anna color schemes - three lipsticks, four nail polishes, and a set of rollerball eye pigments, however, much to the dismay of Frozen fans everywhere, the products can only be purchased at Disney's US-based theme parks in Orlando and Anaheim. Unsurprisingly, each of the different items has been given a suitably wintry moniker, with shades such as 'Spiraling Snow' and 'Frozen Queen' among some of the names included. Scroll down for video . The perfect stocking filler for Frozen fans: Disney recently announced the launch of a beauty range based on the hit animated movie . Sell-out success: It is hoped that the Frozen make-up collection, which is only available to buy at Disney theme parks, will prove to be as profitable as the film's other merchandise . The collection joins an already-impressive array of Frozen merchandise already offered by Disney, most of which has sold out in anticipation of the approaching Christmas period. Last week it was revealed that Frozen has become the most profitable animated Disney movie of all time, with profits now estimated at more than $1.1 billion, a number which is continuing to increase at a rapid rate, despite the fact that the film was released more than a year ago. But this latest range of Frozen-themed products is believed to be aimed at a slightly older audience than those sell-out items that have proved so successful with children around the world. According to Yahoo, the make-up launch signifies Disney's attempt to 'reach out to grown-up fans' of the animated musical by enabling them to recreate their favorite look worn by the central characters in the film. For the powerful Princess Elsa, that means cool-toned purples and sparkling silver shades, while the younger Anna has been given a much warmer palette of browns, golds and pinks. Are you an Elsa or an Anna? The range includes an eyeshadow palette which can be used to create two looks, based on the movie's central characters. For Elsa (L) that means cool purple tones, while the colors for Anna (R) are much warmer . Christmas favorites: MNof Disney's most popular merchandise . The launch of the beauty range has come at the perfect time for Disney, which is eagerly capitalizing on the continued success of its big-screen hit at every available opportunity. Twelve months after its release, and with the festive season fast approaching, Frozen hysteria has reached fever-pitch, with dozens of big name stores, from Target to Toys 'R' Us, reporting that they have sold out of almost every Frozen toy, with the most popular Elsa and Anna dolls selling out months ago, as parents attempted to get in ahead of the Christmas rush. As early as March, Disney had shifted half a million Anna and Elsa dolls at $94 each. Two months later they had sold out of dolls altogether, only for desperate parents to discover them re-appearing on eBay, being auctioned for four times their retail price. Last month, the company revealed that it had sole more than 3 million Frozen princess costumes this year alone, with many designs still sold out. Child psychologist Dr Amanda Gummer told the Daily Mail's Antonia Hoyle that little girls' desire to emulate their friends is helping fuel the demand for more Frozen goodies. 'Peer pressure and pester power hit their peak at six or seven,' she said. 'Children want to fit in, and having the popular toy becomes important.'","The beauty products are only available to buy at Disneyland and Walt Disney World .

"Around 400 soldiers who were among the last British troops to leave Afghanistan have been presented with campaign medals by the Countess of Wessex. Sophie, looking smart and chic in a navy coat and purple hat, presented the servicemen and women of 5th Battalion, The Rifles with the accolades to mark their safe return from Helmand Province during Operation Herrick 20. The Countess, 49, who is the Royal Colonel of the battalion, flew to Alanbrooke Barracks in Paderborn, Germany, to meet the troops. The Countess of Wessex is the Royal Colonel of 5th Battalion, The Rifles. She presented around 400 soldiers with medals for work in Afghanistan on the parade square at Alanbrooke barracks, at their base in Paderborn, Germany where 5 Rifles are receiving their Operation . Several hundred of the soldiers' families braved the cold, alongside local civic dignitaries, to watch the battalion parade behind The Band of the Scots Guards. After presenting the medals, the Countess addressed the soldiers, praising them for their work in Afghanistan. She said: 'It is two and half years since my last medals parade and I had the opportunity to formally congratulate my battalion for a very successful tour of duty in Afghanistan. 'Then the campaign was still in full flow and we did not know when and if we would be called upon to go out there again. 'I now stand here today to congratulate you once more. This time however, in the knowledge that your job is done and the battle has been handed over to the Afghan National Army.' Several hundred of the soldiers' families braved the cold, alongside local civic dignitaries, to watch the battalion parade behind The Band of the Scots Guards and Sophie, who was dressed smartly for the occasion . After presenting the medals, the Countess addressed the soldiers, praising them for their work in Afghanistan . She continued: 'Naturally, the end of the campaign causes us to reflect and we will never forget those that made the ultimate sacrifice or those whose lives have been changed forever by injury and of course we continue to support the families who have been left to carry on. 'With this in mind, it is worth reminding ourselves that your actions have constructively affected the lives of countless Afghans, allowing children the chance of an education and opportunities for work, as well as freedom of movement around the country for so many - all things to be proud of. 'I hope that during this last tour you saw for yourselves first-hand the many positive changes that have been affected by the efforts of our troops since you were last there.' The Countess of Wessex shares a joke with Ilisapeci Mataika, aged three (right) and Phoebe Tyson, aged three (centre) after a Rifles parade at Alanbrooke barracks, at their base in Paderborn, Germany . The Countess added: 'To all of you on parade today, on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen, thank you for your commitment, your drive and your professionalism. 'I am honoured to be here to recognise your efforts, your dedication to your battalion, your regiment, your country and your Queen.' She then met with several of the soldiers' families and spent time talking to their partners and their children. Speaking after the medals parade, Stefanie Potter, 28, whose husband Russell is a serjeant in the battalion, spoke of her pride in meeting the Countess. 'I was really looking forward to meeting the Countess of Wessex,' Mrs Potter, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire said. 'She was just asking how we were and how we enjoyed Germany and she asked the children about missing school.' The Royal met with several of the soldiers' families and spent time talking to their partners and their children . Speaking to the men, she said: 'I am honoured to be here to recognise your efforts, your dedication to your battalion, your regiment, your country and your Queen' Mrs Potter added: 'The parade was good and I know they have been working hard to get it right.

Her husband, who has been in the Army for nearly 12 years, said the next few years would see a lot of change for the battalion as it moves to Wiltshire as part of Army 2020 reforms. Serjeant Potter, 27, who is also from Worksop said: 'I think there is a bit of disappointment that we are moving from Germany because it is such a fantastic place to live, especially for the new recruits who maybe haven't been abroad before. 'But Salisbury Plain is an excellent place. Being in the UK means we will be able to see our families more but at the same time I joined the Army to go and see the world.

"Women around the world are carrying out a practice which not only leaves them in pain but at increased risk of HIV. 'Dry sex' involves women reducing moisture in their vaginas in order to make intercourse more pleasurable for men. This can can lead to cuts, sores and inflammation in the vagina, and increases the chance of a condom breaking,  journalist Wendy Syfret reports for VICE.com. These factors in turn increase the chance of the women contracting sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. Women in developing countries are putting their health at risk by carrying out a practice known as 'dry sex'. This involves drying out the vagina using substances from sand to pulverized rock to bleach, in order to make sex more pleasurable for men . Dry sex is known to be carried out in South and Central Africa, and Indonesia. It is borne out of a cultural belief that men find sex more pleasurable if a woman's vagina is dry, and that men will reject women whose vaginas have been ‘stretched out’ by sex. To achieve dryness, women insert, chalk, sand, pulverized rock, herbs, paper or sponges before sex, according to journalist Ms Syfret, who has reported on the practice in South Africa. They also douse their vaginas in detergents, antiseptics, alcohol and bleach. Women in Java, Indonesia, even 'smoke out' their vaginas by standing over burning herbs, LoveMatters reports. In other areas of Indonesia it is common to insert a cigar-shaped stick made of a plant root. While World Health Organization consultation papers show global health officials are aware the problem exists, most of the research on it is decades old and there are no broad figures on its prevalence. A 2009 study looking at how dry sex spreads HIV in Zambian women found knowledge of the practice was widespread. Around two-thirds of the 812 women polled had used  traditional dry sex medicines at some point in their lives, and about half were currently using them. But a reluctance to discuss sexual health meant the practice was not debated. The researchers concluded: 'Most of the available information has been anecdotal, speculative or inadequate - mainly because of cultural reluctance to discuss or investigate personal sexual issues.' Dry sex is a practice where women reduce moisture in their vaginas in order to make intercourse more pleasurable for men. It is borne out of a cultural belief that men find sex more pleasurable if a woman's vagina is dry, and that men will reject women whose vaginas have been ‘stretched out’ by sex. To achieve dryness, women insert, chalk, sand, pulverized rock, herbs, paper or sponges before sex. They also douse their vaginas in detergents, antiseptics, alcohol and bleach. Women in Java, Indonesia, even 'smoke out' their vaginas by standing over burning herbs. In other areas of Indonesia, it is common to insert a cigar-shaped stick made of a plant root into the vagina. Not only is this practice extremely painful for the women involved, it can lead to cuts, sores and inflammation in the vagina, and increases the chance of a condom breaking. These factors increase the chance of the women contracting HIV. The practice is known to be carried out in South and Central Africa, and Indonesia. Similarly, a sexual health clinician and campaigner in South Africa told VICE most people are aware of the problem but it is not talked about, and hasn't received enough attention from the country's Government for policies to be drafted. Dr Marlene Wa​sserman, commonly known in South Africa as Dr Eve, said the continued practice of dry sex shows the lack of education relating to equality and women's rights in the area. 'It's definitely a class issue,' she told VICE. 'Basically, a woman's reputation depends on the size of her vagina. 'Among women who are less informed and less educated, there's an unbelievable ignorance around the idea the vagina adapts to the penis.' She explained that both men and women fail to understand that the vagina is capable of expanding during sex - and then back to its usual size afterwards. There is also an incorrect cultural belief that if a woman has a partner with a large penis, her vagina will remain permanently 'stretched' - and future partners will think she is promiscuous. The practice is ingrained in culture, passed between generations of women, she added. She continued: 'Men aren't saying to women, ""Put Dettol in your vagina"".' Instead, they insinuate a woman is promiscuous due to the state of her genitalia, she explained. For women dependent on their boyfriends or husbands, attaining commitment and pleasing them is extremely important. The idea that pain is normal or acceptable during sex has taken hold, she adds, and most women in South Africa would not think of sexual pleasure as something they necessarily have a right to. Dr Wasserman said: 'I've been part of a task force with the World Association of Sexual Health, and we've launched the declaration of sexual rights - the right to pleasure - and we've been really pushing that. The practice of dry sex can cause sores and cuts in the vagina, and can make it more likely a condom will break during sex. These factors increase compound the spread of HIV. Here, the virus is pictured under the microscope . 'Women are surprised that's one of their rights. 'We know 33 percent of women have and tolerate painful penetration. That becomes part of what they expect from sex.' Dr Wasserman has a radio show which attempts to dispel myths about sexual health. She also hosts seminars for young adults and parents in order to educate people about healthy sexual practices. 'It's about educating people and trying to raise awareness,' she said. 'The conversation began when we realized HIV was impacting more heterosexual women in South Africa than gay men. 'There was a drive then to say to women: ""Don't put Dettol in your vagina; don't dry your vagina out. This is dangerous."" But the conversation hasn't gotten going, and women are suffering.' She draws similarities between the practice of dry sex in developing countries and the vaginoplasty operations Western women undergo in order to tighten their vagina. 'They're having their own genital mutilation,' she said of the women who opt for these procedures. 'It's just a little more advanced and expensive than putting creams in your vagina. 'But isn't the principal the same? It's incredibly unhealthy as well to go have your vagina tightened because you want to have a honeymoon experience or have your partner think you're youthful.'","Practice of 'dry sex' involves drying out the vagina to increase friction .

"Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has urged FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to take the threat of the Ebola virus seriously with the Africa Cup of Nations just three months away. The spread of the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people across west Africa, has put the tournament  in doubt, with the host nation Morocco requesting the finals be moved or postponed. CAF refused the request and a series of qualifiers took place across the continent over the past week, with Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring twice in Gabon's 2-0 win over Burkina Faso last Saturday. Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp is adamant that the Ebola virus outbreak must be taken seriously . Klopp, though, insists that the priority must be people's safety, and not whether football matches go ahead. 'I don't know whether the players think about it [Ebola], but I think a lot about it,' the Dortmund boss was quoted as saying on Goal.com. 'I spoke a lot with 'Auba' [Aubameyang] about it, tried to sensitise him of the problem as he was away with his national team. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored against Arsenal last month, played for Gabon in Libreville on Saturday . Klopp said he  spoke in depth to the striker about the threat of the Ebola outbreak before he flew to Africa . 'Young people are green; they don't think that much about such things. 'I don't really understand how FIFA or whoever is responsible for that can assume that of all things the borders in Africa are safe enough that no Ebola-infected person can travel to another country. Even here [in Europe], we aren't able to do that. 'If there is one country in Africa which has the feeling that it can't host the Cup safely then this has to be the priority, not the tournament. 'You have to take this seriously and can't shut your eyes. There will be a lot people from all over Africa in Morocco to watch the games and only a few of them would have undergone the best medical checks.'","Jurgen Klopp has urged FIFA and CAF to take the Ebola outbreak seriously .

"Brooklyn is the least-affordable housing market in America, where residents would need to spend 98 per cent of the average income to buy a median-priced home of $615,000. One in five U.S. housing markets are now less affordable than they were more than a decade ago, according to a recent study, and Brooklyn is the the most unaffordable, followed by San Francisco and Manhatten.

Brooklyn, pictured above, is the least-affordable housing market in America, where residents would need to spent 98 per cent of the average income to buy a median-priced home of $615,000 . Investors and foreign buyers are being blamed for the price-rise which has kept residents in rental properties where costs have also been rising. The median rent in Brooklyn was $2,858 in October, up almost 6 per cent from a year earlier. Bloomberg reports that prices in 20 U.S. cities climbed 4.9 per cent in the year through September while values gained 25 per cent since their February 2012 crash. Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac said incomes had not grown 'nearly as fast as home prices'. He said the 'disconnected' had been driven by buyers who were not 'as constrained by income', resulting in homes now being out of reach for traditional buyers. Los Angeles and Orange County in California and the Houston, Dallas and Boston regions are among the 98 areas where homes were now less affordable. Manhatten was the second most unaffordable place to buy, though New Yorkers being priced out of the area were being blamed for driving up prices in Brooklyn . Just last month a renovated 1890s townhouse in Brooklyn's Park Slope section sold for $10.78 million - a record for the neighborhood and Brooklyn's third-most-expensive purchase . To calculate affordability, RealtyTrac worked out what the median household income needed to make a monthly payment on a median-priced home. They also factored in a 10 per cent down deposit and put the mortgage over a 30-year period. Just 12 per cent of the countries studied have a higher median home price than the peak of the 2005-2008 property bubble. In Brooklyn, the median sale price climbed to a record $587,515 in the third quarter, as New Yorkers priced out of Manhattan looked for affordable homes there. Just last month a renovated 1890s townhouse in the Park Slope section sold for $10.78 million - a record for the neighborhood and Brooklyn's third-most-expensive purchase. Of all the counties analyzed by RealtyTrac, buying a median-priced home in October required on average 26 per cent of the median income. During the housing bubble it required 41 per cent in each of the country.","Brooklyn is the most unafforable market, followed by Manhattan .

"Many have long suspected that the male and female brains are very different. Now, researchers at Cambridge University have revealed just what those differences are. By studying over 20 years of neuroscience research, they were able to create a map showing just how the sexes differ. What makes us different: This brain, shown from above and below, shows the differences in grey matter volume. Areas of larger volumes in women are in red and areas of larger volume in men are in blue . Males on average had larger volumes and higher tissue densities in the left amygdala, hippocampus, insular cortex, putamen; higher densities in the right VI lobe of the cerebellum and in the left claustrum; and larger volumes in the bilateral anterior parahippocampal gyri, posterior cingulate gyri, precuneus, temporal poles, and cerebellum, areas in the left posterior and anterior cingulate gyri, and in the right amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen. By contrast, females on average had higher density in the left frontal pole, and larger volumes in the right frontal pole, inferior and middle frontal gyri, pars triangularis, planum temporale/parietal operculum, anterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and Heschl’s gyrus; bilateral thalami and precuneus; the left parahippocampal gyrus, and lateral occipital cortex. 'For the first time we can look across the vast literature and confirm that brain size and structure are different in males and females,' said Amber Ruigrok, who led the study. 'We should no longer ignore sex in neuroscience research, especially when investigating psychiatric conditions that are more prevalent in either males or females.' The research, published this week in the prestigious journal Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, took in 218 different studies. It found that males on average have larger total brain volumes than women, by 8-13%. On average, males also had larger absolute volumes than females in the intracranial space (12%; >14,000 brains), total brain (11%; 2,523 brains), cerebrum (10%; 1,851 brains), grey matter (9%; 7,934 brains), white matter (13%; 7,515 brains), regions filled with cerebrospinal fluid (11.5%; 4,484 brains), and cerebellum (9%; 1,842 brains). Looking more closely, researchers found the differences in volume between the sexes were located in several regions. These included parts of the limbic system, which deals with emotion, and the language system. The team, led by doctoral candidate Amber Ruigrok and Professors John Suckling and Simon Baron-Cohen in the Department of Psychiatry, performed a quantitative review of the brain imaging literature testing overall sex differences in total and regional brain volumes. The research could have major implications for research into autism and depression. In these images areas of larger volume in females (red) including (b) the right inferior and middle frontal gyri, pars triangularis and planum temporale; (c) thalamus and right anterior cingulate gyrus; and (f) left and right thalamus; and areas of larger volume in males (blue), including (c) the anterior cingulate gyrus; (d) bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus and left cerebellum; (e) anterior and posterior cingulate gyri; and (f) left and right amygdalae, hippocampi and parahippocampal gyri. 'The sex differences in the limbic system include areas often implicated in psychiatric conditions with biased sex ratios such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression,' Professor Suckling said. 'This new study may therefore help us understand not just typical sex differences but also sex-linked psychiatric conditions.' Professor Baron-Cohen said: 'Although these very clear sex differences in brain structure may reflect an environmental or social factor, from other studies we know that biological influences are also important, including prenatal sex steroid hormones (such as foetal testosterone) as well as sex chromosome effects. 'Such influences need to be teased out, one by one.'Dr Meng-Chuan Lai, another member of the team, called for further research. 'We need more research exploring brain development over the entire lifespan, especially in the early, formative years,' she said. The team searched all articles published between 1990 and 2013. A total of 126 articles were included in the study, covering brains from individuals as young as birth to 80 years old.","Cambridge researchers reviewed 20 years of research .

"A California man was arrested Wednesday on multiple counts of child molestation in what, authorities say, is the largest number of victims by a single predator they can recall in Santa Ana. Edwin Echeverria, 22, lured boys to his Santa Ana apartment, selling them chips, soda, and other items, KTLA reports. Echeverria's apartment is located near a middle and elementary school. After gaining their trust, Echeverria would reportedly convince boys -- aged as young as 10 -- to engage in sexual activities with him. Largest: (photographed) Edwin Echeverria, 22, was arrested Wednesday on multiple counts of child molestation in what, authorities say, is the largest number of victims by a single predator they can recall in Santa Ana . 'The number of victims involved [in] this case is extraordinary,' the Santa Ana Police Department's news release stated. 'Detectives are not aware of any other Santa Ana cases involving a single suspect targeting such a large number of victims within memory.' Lured: Echeverria lured boys as young as 10 to his Santa Ana apartment (photographed) selling them chips, soda, and other items; after gaining their trust, he would convince them to engage in sexual activities . Nephew: One man recalled seeing Echeverria giving his nephew and young girls money . Echeverria was arrested at around 12.30am while leaving his job in Costa Mesa, according to a Santa Ana Police Department news release. Police were alerted after a mother of one of the alleged victims found evidence of an inappropriate relationship between her son and an unknown person on social media. After interviewing the child and investigating the matter, authorities identified the person as Echeverria and within 48 hours found eight more victims, according to the SAPD. Inappropriate: Anthony Bertagna, Santa Ana police corporal, (photogroaphed) said police were alerted after one of the victim's mothers saw evidence of an inappropriate relationship between her son and another person . Police are tracking down three additional victims to interview, bringing the total to 1. Authorities believe there may be more, according to KTLA. Investigators say Echeverria's inappropriate relationships with young boys began in August 2012 and the most recent incident known occurred two weeks ago, the Orange County Register reports. In an interview with KABC, one man recalled Echeverria approaching his nephew. The man said Echeverria attempted to give money to young boys and girls. Echeverria was due in court Thursday and was being held on $1 million bail, according to KTLA.","Edwin Echeverria, 22, was arrested Wednesday on multiple counts of child molestation in what, authorities say, is the largest number of victims by a single predator they can recall in Santa Ana .

"The mother of two members of the Oxford child sex abuse gang has blamed the schoolgirls for the ordeal they suffered, saying ‘they were having sex at the age of ten instead of playing with toys’. She defended her sons – Akhtar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31 – and claimed they were innocent after they were found guilty of a catalogue of vile offences last week. Mrs Dogar, believed to be called Bashira, accused the police, social services and the girls themselves of being complicit in creating Britain’s ‘grooming culture’. The mother of two brothers who were part of the Oxford sex grooming gang has said 'no one pressurised' one of the victims . Akhtar Dogar (left) and Anjum Dogar (right) were among a group of seven men who were found guilty at the Old Bailey last week of a catalogue of offences including conspiracy to rape, child prostitution and trafficking over an eight-year period . The two brothers were part of a group of mainly Asian men who groomed . girls as young as 11 before giving them drugs and carrying out . humiliating attacks, then hiring them out for sex with others. But Mrs Dogar told the Daily Star: ‘These girls should be playing with toys. If they start [having sex] at ten, by 15 they are proper ladies.’ Speaking from her home in Oxford, the Dogars’ mother said they were . innocent. She said one of the girls was looking for a boy at a station . in London and no one had pressured her into having sex. She added: ‘On the news they say the girls went from Oxford to London on . the train. Are they not old enough then?

"Asses' milk became the ultimate symbol of luxury when Cleopatra bathed in it to keep her skin soft. And now the famously frugal Pope Francis has revealed that he too is an aficionado of donkey milk. Francis was presented with the two donkeys, named Thea and Noah, as an unusual early Christmas present, by a company that produces donkey milk for babies that are allergic to other milks. After thanking Pierluigi Christophe Orunesu, of donkey farming cooperative Eurolactis Italia, for the curious gift, a delighted Francis revealed that he too as a baby was fed donkey milk. Ass Christmas: Francis was presented with the two donkeys, named Thea and Noah, as an unusual early Christmas present, by a company that produces donkey milk for babies that are allergic to other milks . Mr Orunesu said the pope was ‘very happy'. ‘I told him he will have two friends for life,’ he told Dairy Reporter website. ‘Pope Francis told me that his mother regularly gave him donkey’s milk where she could not provide enough breast milk or later on when he was a child,’ he said. The company also donated 21 gallons of donkey’s milk to the pediatric hospital in Rome. Scientists are becoming increasingly interested in asses’ milk for its similarities to human mothers' milk. Its proteins are easier to digest than cows’ milk and it contains less harmful fats present in other milks, the farmers claim. It can be given increasing number of children who are allergic to the proteins in traditional milks. Baby milk: After thanking Pierluigi Christophe Orunesu, of donkey farming cooperative Eurolactis Italia, for the curious gift, a delighted Francis revealed that he too as a baby was fed donkey milk . Happy life: The donkeys will now go to live at the pope’s farm at the papal summer palace of Castel Gandolfo 30 miles outside Rome . The donkeys will now go to live at the pope’s farm at the papal summer palace of Castel Gandolfo 30 miles outside Rome. The company said in a statement 'This gift of two very friendly young donkeys, Thea and Noah, is less surprising than it might first seem; the Holy Father chose to take the forename of Saint Francis of Assisi, who considered animals to be God’s living creations and elevated them to the status of brothers to mankind. 'The donkey also holds a prominent place in the bible. This was the animal that kept Jesus warm in his manger in Bethlehem.' Two years ago Pope Benedict claimed that donkeys were not part of the Nativity. Who, me? Two years ago Pope Benedict claimed that donkeys were not part of the Nativity . He wrote in his book about the childhood of Jesus that the presence of animals like cattle and donkeys in traditional Nativity scenes is based on little more than a myth and was probably inspired by pre-Christian traditions. ‘There is no mention of animals in the Gospels,’ he wrote. Francis has said that animals do, after all, go to heaven. In his weekly audience in St Peter's, last week Francis quoted the apostle Paul who comforted a child who was crying after his dog died. ‘One day we will see our animals again in eternity of Christ’, Francis quoted Paul as saying. The Pope added: ‘Paradise is open to all God’s creatures.’ His position is markedly different from that of Pope Benedict XVI said that the other animals ‘are not called to the eternal life’.","Pope was given donkeys Thea and Noah by a donkey farming cooperative .

Bale's raw potential eventually became realised at Spurs during his six seasons at the club. Initally bought as a left back, Bale grew into a maurading left winger that saw Spanish giants Real Madrid sign him in record-breaking £85m where he won the Champions league in his debut season. However Jol told talkSPORT, Bale's outcome at Spurs could have a lot different. 'Spurs saw Bale as a left back, but he probably wasn’t the best left-back in the world,' he said.

"The families of missing Utah mother Susan Powell are fighting over whether to declare she is now legally dead, five years after she vanished. The mother-of-two Susan Powell, 28, disappeared from her home in West Valley City in December 2009 and she has never been found. Josh Powell claimed that his wife was at home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip in Utah's West Desert. Battle: The families of missing Utah mother Susan Powell are fighting over whether to declare she is now legally dead, five years after she vanished. Susan Powell, pictured with her two sons . Mystery: Susan's husband Josh Powell killed himself and his two sons - 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden - in 2012. He was long considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was never charged . He was long considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was never charged in the case. In 2012 Josh Powell attacked the couple's two young sons with a hatchet and then burned down his Graham, Washington home, with him and the boys inside. Utah law says that someone 'who is absent for a continuous period of five years' is presumed to be dead and Saturday will mark five years since she vanished. But her parents, Chuck and Judy Cox, who have long campaigned for justice, are now locked in a legal battle with Terrica and Alina Powell - Josh Powell’s mother and sister, respectively. In Utah the date of death is considered to be the end of the time period 'unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier,' the statute says. Chuck and Judy Cox do not want to request a death declaration from a judge. Grief: Chuck and Judy Cox, right, the parents of missing Utah mother Susan Cox Powell, are joined by Susan's sister Denise Cox, left, and her fiance, Andrew Olsen, to remember the tragedy in 2013 . Murder: Josh Powell killed himself and his two sons in 2012 after attacking them with a hatchet and blowing up their home . Heartbreaking: Braden, left, and Charlie Powell. The boys were killed along with their father, Josh Powell . 'They have hope that maybe she'll be found or she's alive somewhere,' said Evan Bariault, a Seattle attorney for the Coxes, told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'I just don't think they're ready for a court to make that determination.' They are arguing over whether a judge should find Susan died sometime prior to May 10, 2013 - which is what Terrica and Alina Powell have requested. That is the date Chuck Cox made changes to the legal trust belonging to his daughter and Josh - hw was allowed to make the alterations as he was a trustee appointed if Josh and Susan were dead or incapacitated. His changes eliminated his late son-in-law's family as beneficiaries. In September, Utah 3rd District Judge L.A. Dever ruled the amendments to the trust did not comply with procedures outlined by the trust, including a requirement that he obtain opinions from two doctors saying Susan was incapacitated. But he upheld the changes because the Powells did not object in time, although the Powells have appealed the ruling. Earlier this week it emerged that Steven Powell, the father-in-law of the missing mother has been sent back to jail for refusing to get sexual deviancy treatment as he awaits child porn charges. The Cox family claims that Steven Powell has information about his missing daughter-in-law. It . A Washington state judge ruled that the 64-year-old, who is from Tacoma, must go back to jail for at least 40 days, RadarOnline reported. Saturday will mark five years since his daughter-in-law Susan vanished in Utah, which means she will be declared legally dead. In 2012, authorities searched a home he had previously shared with his father, Steven Powell, and allegedly found that the elder Powell had child pornography in his possession. Back to jail: Steven Powell, seen in an old mug shot, is serving 40 days in jail for failing to get treatment . In May 2012 he was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism for taking photos of two young neighbor girls in the bathroom and was sentenced to serve two-and-a-half years in June 2012. He got out of Washington State prison in March after finishing up his sentence. But last month, prosecutors refiled a charge of possession of child pornography against him after an appeals court determined that the charge was wrongly dismissed during his original trial. On his release from prison, Powell was ordered to complete a sexual deviancy treatment program and undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation. He was also ordered to stay away from places where juveniles are typically found such as pools, parks, playgrounds and schools. In July, police found Powell in a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors, according to police reports. In August, Powell's counselor 'terminated treatment' because Powell refused to cooperate with the psychosexual evaluation, according to the report. His parole officer determined he was being 'manipulative,' and he was sentenced to three days in jail. Powell again refused to answer questions about his sexual behavior during treatment in October, according to the report. His parole officer recently asked the judge to sentence him to another 60 days behind bars, saying that he poses a 'continued risk to the community' for failing to undergo the treatment. Thousands of images of Susan Powell were seized from the home that Steve Powell was sharing with his son in 2011 by police serving a search warrant. The images - some sexually suggestive - showed the missing Utah mother walking in public, doing the laundry or sitting in her car, apparently unaware that someone was taking her picture. Steve Powell has never been charged with any crimes related to images of Susan Powell. The Weekend of December 6 and 7, 2009 - Susan Powell, then 28, is last seen at the West Valley City, Utah, home she shares with her husband Josh and their two sons. Josh Powell tells police that he decided to take his boys on an impromptu camping trip that night in the middle of a blizzard but returns home to find his wife gone. December 24, 2009 - After two weeks of investigations during which Braden and Charlie confirm the camping trip, Josh Powell is named a person of interest in his wife's disappearance. Josh's father, Steve, tells the media he thinks Susan skipped town with a man from St. George, Utah, who also vanished from a party the same night she was last seen. January 2010 - Josh Powell decides to move with his two sons to Puyallup, Washington, which is where he and Susan grew up. He has now begun to tell the media his wife was 'extremely unstable' and was mentally ill. August 18, 2011 - Investigators working on a lead travel to abandoned mine shafts in Ely, Nevada, 200 miles away from West Valley. However, nothing is found.

"Hundreds of ethnic Kurds have turned out for the burial of three brave resistance fighters who died battling militants from the Islamic State in Kobane. The funerals of two men and a woman barely out her teens were held in the Turkish village of Suruc, within clear sight of the Kurdish fighters' besieged hometown over the border in Syria. The three Kurdish fighters were members of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and died in fierce clashes in Kobane, which has been under assault by ISIS extremists since mid-September. ISIS still surrounds the town and holds parts of it despite being forced to retreat in recent days by the brave Kurdish resistance and sustained airstrikes by a coalition of American and Arab warplanes.

Clashes: The three Kurdish fighters were members of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and died in fierce clashes in Kobane, which has been under assault by ISIS extremists since mid-September . The graves of 20-year-old Hanim Dabaan 30-year-old Idris Ahmad and 25-year-old Mohammed Mustafa are pictured in Suruc . With her family absent, the Kurdish flag-draped coffin bearing the body of 20-year-old Hanim Dabaan was carried to her grave yesterday by women who didn't know her but wanted to show their support. 30-year-old Idris Ahmad and 25-year-old Mohammed Mustafa were laid to rest beside her, also carried by volunteers. In the chaos of Syria's multifaceted war, with a multitude of groups fighting each other as well as President Bashar al-Assad's forces, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and it is not always possible to locate the families of those killed in fighting. Turkey alone has seen an estimated 1.6 million refugees cross its borders in the four years of the Syrian war, according to UN officials. Tragic: With her family absent, the Kurdish flag-draped coffin bearing the body of 20-year-old Hanim Dabaan was carried to her grave yesterday by people who didn't know her but wanted to show their support . Bereaved: It isn't clear where the families of Dabaan, Ahmad and Mustafa were - or even whether they knew their loved ones were dead . At one point a rumor rippled through the crowd that the young woman's parents were on their way. But if they were, they never made it . 'Our house has been demolished in Kobane and we are living in tents. ... At least we can support our martyrs and we will accompany them to their graves,' said Fatma Muslim, one of dozens of women who turned up at the Suruc hospital morgue for the funeral procession to the nearby cemetery. It was volunteers - rather than family members, as is the Islamic tradition - who helped wash and shroud the fighters' bodies in preparation for burial. 'There is nobody to wash them,' said Akeed Hamad, 21, who came to the morgue with a friend and offered to help. 'There is only one doctor who can wash them, and the rest are volunteers.' It wasn't immediately clear where the families of Dabaan, Ahmad and Mustafa were - or even whether they knew their loved ones were dead.

Strangers: Out of about 30 graves in the section of Suruc cemetery given over to Kurds who died fighting in Kobane, only five of them have known families. Nonetheless ethnic Kurds supportive of the battle against the Islamic State mourn for those they did not know . At one point a rumor rippled through the crowd that the young woman's parents were on their way. But if they were, they never made it. Yet in Suruc's cemetery, in a part set aside for Syrian Kurds killed across the border, they are not the only ones buried without their relatives. Out of about 30 graves there so far, only five of them have known families, said Wahida Kushta, one of the volunteers who helped prepare Dabaan's body for burial. 'I do it to help. Let's support them now at least.'","Three brave resistance soldiers were killed fighting militants from the Islamic State in the besieged Syrian city .

"Authorities across the country are on high alert this week following the death of Melbourne teenager Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police after he stabbed two officers. Haider was known to police, had been seen in his local area brandishing an ISIS flag and recently had his passport cancelled over security concerns. A spokesperson for Victoria police told Daily Mail Australia 13,000 officers received a message from Chief Commissioner Ken Lay on Tuesday night. Scroll down for video . Police across the country are on high alert following the death of Numan Haider, who was shot by police after he stabbed two officers . Officers were urged to 'exercise caution throughout their shift' in light of the attack on two counter terrorism officers outside Endeavour Hills station in Melbourne's south-east on Tuesday evening. The note warned police to be on the lookout and prepared for any situation. NSW Police also sent a message to all of their staff urging them to remain vigilant following the incident. Released via the internal communications system, officers were warned in the memo to be on alert and cautious following events in the last week - which also included the country's largest ever terror raids. Haider recently had his passport cancelled by police and was said to have been seen in his local area brandishing an ISIS flag . This comes as it was announced officers in Queensland could soon be able to take weapons home with them, as part of new safety measures being implemented to protect the force. 'If the risk is there, we'll be very sympathetic to requests,' Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said, according to the Daily Telegraph. In additional to extra measures being in placed for authorities, security at this weekend's AFL grand-final will be increased with scores of undercover police attending the game. The match will take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday, and Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Ken Lay has asked people to be reassured by the beefed-up police presence rather that frightened by it. Commissioner Lay said recent events should not be detterent for people who were planning to attend the game and that he hopes people will 'enjoy this weekend as Victorians have always celebrated their grand final footy' The Australian reported.

"A disc-shaped stone has to be tossed at an angle of 20 degrees to achieve the maximum number of bounces across water. Inspired by English scientist Barnes Wallis, who invented the bouncing bomb, researchers have described the complicated physics behind the water-skipping behaviour in stones, toys and even cannonballs. Naval gunners as far back as the 18th century bounced cannonballs as a military tactic - removing the launch angle as a variable in sinking enemy ships. Scroll down for video . What's the best way to skim a stone? A Utah researcher has worked out that you should throw it towards the water at an angle of about 20 degrees (illustration shown) to get the best number of bounces. For heavier objects, though, this angle needs to be lessened . Professor Tadd Truscott, Brigham Young University, Utah, and his colleagues said: 'Barnes Wallis recaptured the variable-reducing military advantage during World War II with his bouncing bomb. 'Designed to breach German dams, the weapon skipped over the water surface to avoid undersea torpedo nets.' Writing on the blog Fatherly, New York architect Ben Pell explained there are three different types of fort - tunnel forts, buttress forts and compound forts. He believes that many children manage to trap themselves inside forts and should instead build the exterior first. 'Kids, left to their own devices, pile up pillows and then figure out how to get inside,' he said. 'Or, they’ll build it around themselves and then they can’t leave without destroying it.' Mr Pell, who in his day job works for Pell Overton, urged children to think like an architect. He warned prospective builders should first sort the available pillows based on which ones are best for walls and which ones are a good for laying on inside the finished fort. Writing in Physics Today, they say water skipping has returned to more docile roots of late with toy balls that make it much easier to achieve multiple hops. The researchers said: 'Those spheres are made of an elastic material whose high compliance - or ability to readily deform - introduces some interesting changes to the skipping phenomenon.' But, with a side throw and flick of the wrist, people young and old have been skipping stones across water for thousands of years with the object of getting as many bounces as possible. The world record, according to the Guinness Book of Records, is 88 skips set this year by an American called Kurt Steiner. Professor Truscott said the skill depends on what angle the thrower chooses to hurl an object at, with the optimal for disc-shaped stones close to 20°. But the heavier the object, the flatter this should be. He said: 'Spheres are generally harder to skip than discs. In fact, previous research suggests an upper bound on the initial course angle 18°. 'Thus for steel cannonballs, skipping can only occur for angles shallower than seven degrees.' Naval gunners as far back as the 18th century bounced cannonballs as a military tactic (stock image shown) - removing the launch angle as a variable in sinking enemy ships. To get the best bounce on the surface of the water in this instance, Proffesor Truscott said the angle should be less than seven degrees . The world record for skimming stones, according to the Guinness Book of Records, is 88 skips set this year by an American called Kurt Steiner. Professor Truscott said the skill depends on what angle the thrower chooses to hurl an object at (stock image shown) An alternative method involves imparting a great deal of backspin to a rounded stone so it dives under the surface and then pops up and out of the water. Proffesor Truscott said: 'The technique does not yield many skips but it's impressive nonetheless. 'To pull it off you need to throw the stone at the water surface at a much higher course angle than for the usual disc skipping.'","A Utah researcher has investigated how objects skip on water .

"Mocking hecklers is part of the job for stand-up comedians. But this comic was somewhat lost for words when an NYPD officer shouted 'shut the f*** up' from the back of the room. The cop was one of four who interrupted Adam Newman's set with flashlights to arrest a homeless man allegedly masturbating in the audience. And it seemed they couldn't resist joining in on the show.

But the next joke was cut off when four police officers barged into the room with flashlights. True to form, the stand-up tried to make the event part of his show. 'Well this is the first time this has happened,' he joked, as the audience fell about laughing. He continues: 'Guys, this is part of the act, I do this every show.'

"It is the iconic festival made famous by American author Ernest Hemingway, but the running of the bulls has been rocked by negative publicity in recent years. So these Spanish locals have come up with an unusual solution that will prevent any potential harm or stress to animals. The town of Mataelpino, just north of Madrid, is staging an annual event in which locals can race through the streets chased by a giant white ball. The running of the balls has been held for the past three years and it is known in the region as boloencierro. During the video the residents run down the street excitedly as a group of men push the giant ball behind them. It may lack the excitement of of an angry bull breathing down their necks, but these locals seem to enjoy the celebration just as much. And there is less risk of injury. During the famous Pamplona San Fermin festival this year, a number of both holidaymakers and locals were gored during the running of the bulls. Since records began in 1924, as many as 15 people have been killed while taking part in the dangerous activity. Twist: Residents and visitors in Mataelpino near Madrid participate in the third running of the balls . It's coming: The participants look behind them as the ball approaches in Mataelpino during the event . While bullfighting is banned in Catalonia, it is still a common practice in other parts of Spain. However, there are some other interesting alternatives. Instead off fighting the bulls, agile men known as 'recortadors' perform daring stunts with the bulls in some areas of the country. As the animal charge, the men leap over their and dive out of their way, showing off their agility. The bull remains unharmed and is not killed at thee end of the fight. Cruel: Crowds of people run from a bull at the Running of the Bulls event at the nine day San Fermin festival . Dangerous: A man falls over as a bull approaches during the Running of the Bulls event in Pamplona .

"FIFA's opposition to all things British includes having no representative from the Home Nations on the technical study group that analyses all 64 matches of the World Cup. Instead the 13-strong group, whose report after the tournament always has much importance attached to it, includes representatives from football outposts such as Sudan and Hong Kong who have never been near a World Cup finals. Other countries whose delegates will be running the rule over England’s methods in training as well as games include El Salvador, New  Zealand, Romania, Japan, Nigeria and Jamaica. Thinker: Roy Hodgson was due to take part in UEFA's TSG for Euro 2012 . Former Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh had been a long-time member of FIFA’s TSG at six previous World Cups while England boss manager Roy Hodgson helped compile the technical report for the 2006 World Cup and was due to be part of UEFA’s TSG for Euro 2012 until taking over the national team beforehand. However, the only member of the 2014 report team with any allegiance to English football is France’s Gerard Houllier, the former Liverpool manager. Asked about the conspicuous absence of a . British representative, a FIFA spokeswoman said: ‘The TSG members are . alternating from World Cup to World Cup. This time there is no British . as other countries are represented.’ Running the rule: Former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier is among the 13-man group . lt has taken only one day for the police-escorted England commute from Rio hotel to training base to take longer than the time considered acceptable. That was 30 to 40 minutes and after a 39-minute trip on Monday, the route took 45 minutes on Tuesday. The FA blamed the police outriders turning up late and a spokesman said: ‘The manager is happy with the journey, which is the most important thing.’ Pele, interviewed by Gary Lineker for Tuesday night’s BBC documentary The Beautiful Game, said it would be no surprise to see England in the World Cup final because of their experience. However, this is the same Pele who had Nicky Butt as player of the tournament in 2002 before England’s quarter-final exit. Looking tidy: The FA are looking to extend their kit deal with Nike . The FA are planning to start talks about a new kit deal with Nike well in advance of the Euro 2016 finals despite the contract running until 2018. And the FA will want far more control in future following concern inside Wembley at how they copped the blame for the £90 replica kit, including the wrath of Prime Minister David Cameron, rather than the kit suppliers. All signs are pointing to the 2014 World Cup being the most shambolic tournament in FIFA history. FA delegates, including chairman Greg Dyke, took up to four hours to travel from Sao Paulo airport to the FIFA congress location outside the gridlocked city with others taking even longer. The gift of a Longines watch and a  Brazuca football will not compensate. And a mass demonstration by more than 100,000 locals — disgruntled at the cost of the World Cup — is due to take place in Rio on Thursday to coincide with the opening game. Delayed: Greg Dyke was among those held up in Sao Paulo . No wonder FIFA officials are keeping their passes out of sight, VIP transport has no FIFA branding and president Sepp Blatter has a huge security detail around him. The chaos is summed up by Helio Gurovitz, the editor of local weekly magazine Epoca: ‘We are the country of winging it. We plan poorly, monitor even worse, leave everything to the last hour and believe it will work out in the end. Until, one day, it doesn’t.’ The odious Ricardo Teixeira, English-hating former overlord of Brazilian football who severed all connections from the game in 2012 under the weight of corruption scandals, is understood to have used what remains of his influence to shore up his daughter Joana’s executive director position on the World Cup’s local organising committee. Her place was under threat following her rash Twitter comment — especially given her father’s situation — about World Cup money being ‘stolen’.","No British representative in 13-strong study group for Brazil .

"Since The Bridge disappeared from our screens in February in a flurry of betrayal, dead bodies and elaborate plot twists, it's been a frustrating time for fans of Scandi Noir. What was in the files that Danish detective Martin Rohde saw that related to the childhood of his blunt-speaking Swedish colleague Saga Noren? Is Martin himself guilty of murder? And does the temperature ever rise above freezing in this corner of Scandinavia? Scandinavian drama The Bridge takes its name from the five-mile bridge across the Oresund, linking Copenhagen in Denmark and Malmo in Sweden . The good news is that we won't have to wait too much longer to find out. Filming for a third series of the BBC4 hit is under way, so there was only one thing to do - head to the scene of the crime. The drama takes its name from the five-mile bridge across the Oresund, linking Copenhagen and Malmo. In the first series, a body is found at the point on the bridge where Denmark and Sweden meet, which is why detectives from both countries are brought together to solve the case. Our base for the night is a 1960s motel, the Scandic Segevang, just outside Malmo - it's where Martin stays when his wife kicks him out after discovering he has been unfaithful. Those who sign up to The Bridge tour visit the Copenhagen's colourful harbour of Nyhavn . In The Bridge, it's a symphony of misery, augmented by depressing decor, despair and Martin's haunting visions in the subterranean swimming pool. In reality, it's a clever, chic budget hotel, filled with thoughtful Scandi furniture and views of the forest. In the morning, happy families tuck into a generous breakfast buffet before heading out into the sunshine. BBC4 drama Wallander was  adapted from the Swedish novelist Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander novels . Once in Copenhagen, visitors on the tour are able to visit popular tourist sights such as the Royal Palace . By and large, there's a lot of rain, snow and sleet in The Bridge, and the drama certainly doesn't showcase the architecture of the two cities. This is mostly by design, according to scriptwriter Hans Rosenfeldt, when I track him down in Malmo. We meet in the Ribersborg, a cafe at the end of a pier which is the site of a pivotal scene in the first series when Martin realises just who might be responsible for a series of murders. Over coffee and cinnamon buns, I subject Hans to a police-style interrogation. What's happened to cuddly Martin? Will Saga, his glamorous but decidedly non-cuddly colleague, ever get a boyfriend, or even master the art of small talk? Malmo's city centre includes Lilla Torg, a square filled with half-timbered houses, bars . Will we be seeing more of Saga's vintage mustard-coloured Porsche and leather trousers? The next series will apparently be about responsibility and notions of family while also delving into Saga's childhood. I hoover up the dramatic crumbs as eagerly as I've been devouring the tasty cinnamon buns. Then it's time for a tour designed for Bridge obsessives. We start in Malmo, a powerhouse during medieval times, when its wealth was built on the herring trade. The gorgeous city centre includes Lilla Torg, a square filled with half-timbered houses, bars and happy Swedes celebrating the weekend in the early autumn sun. Malmo is Sweden's most multi-cultural city, a legacy of its ship-building days. That industry may have dwindled away, but now it's also a showcase of cutting-edge, sustainable architecture, especially the Western Harbour. It's apparently where Saga lives (alone). Our bus takes us past some of the buildings that feature in the second series, including the site of the Malmo police station that is actually part of a hospital, and has a exterior that's dark grey/blue. 'The designer is very into this colour,' says our guide, as we head off to a street in the same muted palette. Then it's time for the highlight - a trip across the bridge itself. Malmo is Sweden's most multi-cultural city and is a key destination on the tour offered to fans of Scandinavian drama, The Bridge . There's a slow incline as we head out from Malmo, and before we reach the central area we pick up a key bit of information with which we can share with less informed devotees back home: the actual border is a few hundred yards further along, and a simple sign denotes we have now reached Denmark. Once in Copenhagen, we eschew such commonplace tourist sights as the Royal Palace and colourful harbour of Nyhavn in favour of the modernist architecture of the Copenhagen police headquarters and the trendy harbourside building that serves as the home of IT entrepreneur Julian Christensen in series two. Most of The Bridge is actually filmed along the Swedish coast in Ystad. This cute town - population around 20,000 - regularly sees some of the darkest fictional deeds unfold in its streets. Most of The Bridge is actually filmed along the Swedish coast in the town of Ystad . The real police investigate one murder a year here on average, but thanks to Henning Mankell, the creator of local detective Kurt Wallander, dozens of fictional ones have taken place in its cobbled streets. The tourist board has a handy map with blood splashes to denote the area. And the body count is set to rise alarmingly. From this month, Kenneth Branagh will be dusting down his weariest expression to film Wallander in one studio, with Saga striding around in The Bridge in the next one, while both will make regular forays into the Ystad and Malmo and nearby countryside for location shoots. The locals are pretty blasé about these incursions - many of them have acted as extras and don't bat an eye at one of the full-scale Bollywood film productions that regularly turn up here either. The Wallander industry is kept low-key, largely because Henning Mankell has refused to allow commercialism. A Ystad cafe that features as the diabetic detective's favourite tried to introduce a Wallander cake. Mankell refused, but you can find it today - a family called Wallander gave the cafe permission to name it after them. A conspiracy of sugar, cream and Scandinavian baking excellence, it would have been a crime not to experience it. Double rooms at the Scandic Segevang (scandichotels.com) start at £75 per night.

"Crystal Palace and Manchester United are thrashing out a deal to make Wilfried Zaha's loan deal a permanent one. Zaha is keen on a full-time return to his old team and the two clubs are at the negotiating table now. Palace are keen to pay around £6million,inclusive of add-ons, but United are understood to want closer to £10m for a player that cost them £15m just two years ago. Winger Wilfried Zaha could cost Crystal Palace £10m to make his loan deal permanent . Crystal Palace are interested in bringing Zaha (left) back to Selhurst Park after impressing on loan . That would mean the south London club would write off the remaining £4m owed to them by United after Zaha's move to Old Trafford. Zaha's loan is set to run until the end of the season but if the two clubs can come to an agreement over the transfer fee it could go through on Monday with a new five-and-a-half-year contract. The 22-year-old recently claimed he felt back at home playing back at Selhurst Park where he became a fans' favourite before leaving for Manchester United. Zaha failed to make an impact following his £15m move to Manchester United in January 2013 . Zaha, tipped as one of English football's brightest prospects at the time, was signed under former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013. But he was loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and did not arrive at Old Trafford until the following summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. However, Zaha is rejuvenated back at Palace and manager Alan Pardew hopes he can keep the talented winger, especially as he doesn't fall into Louis van Gaal's United plans.","Wilfried Zaha signed for Manchester United in 2013 for £15m .

"The family of a married couple murdered by the delusional death row inmate Scott Panetti say they are 'devastated' his execution has been stayed. Minnie Ybarbo, the daughter of Joe and Amanda Alvarado who were gunned down by the 56-year-old schizophrenic in 1992, says she and her son Junior Herrera, were hoping for 'some kind of closure' and claim the murderer is not as 'crazy' as people believe. They were on their way to Huntsville in Texas on Wednesday to witness Panetti's execution, 19 years after he was put on death row. But around 100 miles before they reached the prison and with just hours to spare, representatives from the attorney general's office told them it would not be going ahead. Scroll down for videos . Devastated: Minnie Ybarbo, the daughter of Joe and Amanda Alvarado who were gunned down by death row inmate Panetti in 1992, says she and her son Junior Herrera, were looking for 'some kind of closure' Victims: Joe and Amanda Alvarado, the parents of the death row inmate's estranged wife Sonja, were shot and killed at their home in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1992 . The family claimed that the execution should have happened long ago. The average stay for an inmate on Texas death row is 11 years before he is killed. The condemned killer was due to be put to death at 6pm (CST) on Wedneday. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia some 14 years before shooting dead his estranged wife Sonja Alvarado's parents in front of her and their three-year-old daughter in Fredericksburg, Texas, in 1992. At his 1995 capital murder trial, Panetti acted as his own attorney, testified as alternate personality 'Sarge' to describe the Alvarado slayings and tried to subpoena Jesus Christ, the pope and the late President John F. Kennedy. Panetti wore a purple cowboy outfit, including a big cowboy hat, and largely ignored a standby attorney the judge appointed to assist him. The judgement from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas ordered that the execution be halted 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions'. Describing harrowing accounts of the slayings, Mrs Ybarbo told KENS 5: 'My sister said that my mom just looked in his eyes and looked at Scott, and she knew she was going to be next, and he shot her too. 'It was very devastating because I guess I was looking forward to just having some type of closure.' Mr Herrera, the victim's grandson, said: 'It (execution) should have happened long ago. Years ago, and to me he's just finding a way to use the system to his advantage. Halt: Panetti was scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas stopped it 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions' 'He's not as crazy as they think he is. He's not as insane as they say he is.' Even though Panetti's death was postponed, the pair believed he will still be executed, it is just a matter of when. State attorneys contended Panetti's condition 'has not markedly changed' and he should not be given a reprieve from lethal injection. No court has ruled Panetti mentally incompetent or insane. He had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before fatally shooting Joe and Amanda Alvarado at their home in the Texas Hill Country in 1992. Their daughter Sonja, who was married to Panetti, and her three-year-old daughter, Amanda Lea, had moved in with them and she obtained a court order to keep Panetti away. Ms Alvarado filed for divorce because of her husband's drinking and she said he was obsessed with the notion that the devil lived in their house. He buried furniture and nailed the curtains shut. Panetti was also having hallucinations that the devil lived in the walls of the house and began washing the walls, believing that they were running with blood. On the morning of September 8, 1992, Panetti armed himself with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and knives, dressed in camouflage clothing and broke into his estranged wife's parents' home in Fredericksburg, about 60 miles north of San Antonio. Booking photos: Following the slayings, Panetti left his estranged wife's parents house, dressed in a suit and handed himself in to police . Panetti had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for schizophrenia in the decade before he shot dead his wife's parents. He was allowed to act as his own lawyer at trial and characterized himself as a cowboy. Pictured, is one of the inmate's recent sketches . Both Joe and Amanda Alvarado were shot at close range in front of his wife and daughter, before Panetti allowed them to leave. He later changed into a suit and handed himself into the police. In a sworn affidavit in 1999, Ms Alvarado said that although she hated what her ex-husband did, he was a good man who suffered mental illness and should not be put to death. In 1986, the high court ruled states may not execute killers whose insanity means they can't understand why they're being put to death. In 2002, the justices prohibited the execution of the mentally impaired. Five years later, ruling on an appeal from Panetti, the court said mentally ill condemned prisoners could be put to death if they have a factual and rational understanding of why they're being punished. Panetti has insisted Satan is working through Texas prison officials to execute him to keep him from preaching the Gospel.","Minnie Ybarabo's parents Joe and Amanda Alvarado were killed by Panetti .

"A mass exodus of senior staff has taken place today at The New Republic after the Facebook billionaire owner vowed to create a 'digital medial company' and overhaul the vision of a magazine built over a century. Top editor Franklin Foer, and literary editor, Leon Wieseltier, who has been at the Washington D.C.-based magazine for three decades, resigned on Thursday and were quickly followed by ranks of their senior staff. The digital media editor, Hillary Kelly, resigned while on honeymoon in Africa. The exits, a total of 48 staff and contributing editors, came after a deep divide in opinion over the U-turn planned for the title by  owner Chris Hughes. The Silicon Valley wunderkind, 31, who made billions alongside Mark Zuckerberg as a founding member of Facebook, took over as publisher in 2012. Chris Hughes (left), publisher of The New Republic and CEO Guy Vidra (right). Hughes, a 31-year-old Facebook billionaire, purchased TNR two years ago and today sees a mass exodus of senior staff concerned with the direction of the esteemed publication into a 'digital media company'. Vidra riled employees with his apparent lack of respect for the magazine's past and his intent on 'breaking s***' Institution: The majority of senior editorial staff at The New Republic handed in their resignations this week over the direction that the magazine was taking . Since buying the magazine, while it was financial dire straits, Hughes made clear that he was building a 'digital media company', while his chief executive Guy Vidra, formerly of Yahoo!, told staff in recent meetings that he wanted to 'break s***'. One senior TNR editor, Julia Ioffe, posted a lengthy message on Facebook on Friday where she spoke of her devastation at leaving The New Republic and the reason why she was doing so. She posted: 'The narrative you're going to see Chris and Guy put out there is that I and the rest of my colleagues who quit today were dinosaurs, who think that the Internet is scary and that Buzzfeed is a slur. 'Don't believe them. The staff at TNR has always been faithful to the magazine's founding mission to experiment, and nowhere have I been so encouraged to do so. 'There was no opposition in the editorial ranks to expanding TNR's web presence, to innovating digitally.' According to Politico, Foer found out that Bloomberg Media editor Gabriel Snyder was lined up to replace him before he abruptly stepped down. Among the other departures included senior editors Jonathan Cohn, Isaac Chotiner, Alec MacGillis, Adam Kirsch, John Judis, Noam Scheiber, Judith Shulevitz and Jason Zengerle. Top editor Franklin Foer (pictured left) and literary editor, Leon Wieseltier (right) speaking at the New Republic Centennial in November. Both abruptly resigned on Thursday over a split in vision with new management . Poetry editor Henri Cole also resigned along with dance editor Jennifer Homans and music writer David Hajdu. The staff were joined by a long list of writers who regularly contributed to the magazine. Hughes responded to his staff walkout with a statement on Friday, which read: 'I am saddened by the loss of such great talent @tnr, many of whom have played an important role in making The New Republic so successful.' 'It has been a privilege to work with them, and I wish them only the best. This is a time of transition, but I am excited to work with our team – both new and old alike – as we pave a new way forward. 'The singular importance of The New Republic as an institution can and will be preserved, because it’s bigger than any one of us.' Rumblings of trouble in the TNR newsroom have been growing since Hughes took over in 2012. Rifts appeared to have deepened as the magazine approached its centennial celebrations. The New York Times reported that soon after Guy Vidra joined as CEO in October, he gathered staff to tell them he 'there were peacetime chief executives and wartime chief executives, and he was the latter'. Mr Vidra also said he planned to 'break s***', a popular phrase in Silicon Valley, for upending the status quo. Staff were also concerned over the new CEO's apparent focus on driving web traffic. The New Republic publisher Chris Hughes, who bought the magazine in 2012, with his Facebook fortune, posted this message on Twitter on Friday as the majority of the old guard left the magazine . Billionaire Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, publisher of The New Republic, with his partner Sean Eldridge . At the black-tie centennial gala in November to celebrate the magazine's long history, the schism was apparent from the speeches on stage. While editors Foer and Wieseltier celebrated the magazine's liberal history and commentary on arts and politics, Hughes and Vidra spoke of the future in remarks littered with tech buzzwords. On Thursday, both Mr Foer and Mr Wieseltier resigned. According to Politico, Mr Wieseltier said, through tears, that his 31 years at the magazine was 'the best thing I’ve done in my little life'. Gabriel Snyder, who was previously in charge at Gawker and The Wire, and most recently at Bloomberg Media, will take over at the helm as editor-in-chief. The New Republic will drop down from 20 issues a year to ten and become, according to the NY Times quoting Mr Vidra, 'a vertically integrated digital media company'.","A total of 48 senior staff members resigned this week from The New Republic including editor, Franklin Foer, and literary editor, Leon Wieseltier .

"The England squad took almost twice the time that was originally envisaged in travelling to their first day of training in Rio de Janeiro. When the FA elected to twin the Urca military fort training camp with their Royal Tulip hotel base in San Conrado 12 kilometres away, their optimistic officials were confident the journey would take 20 minutes with the police escort laid on for all teams in the competition. But such is the traffic chaos that the trip, even with the outriders ensuring priority through a logjam tunnel on route, took 39 minutes. Delay: England's commute to their training base from their hotel took twice as long as the FA had expected . Security: The FA had hoped that the military escort would speed up their journey to training . The FA were relaxed as they had received a transport update briefing the night before that increased the estimated time to between 30 and 40 minutes and the England bus had kept within that time frame, albeit by one minute. And the players enjoyed the super scenic route via Ipanema and Copacabana beaches. The England party will only be concerned about the journey time if the trip takes over 40 minutes on a regular basis. But it doesn’t help that traffic starts building up on the main road outside the team hotel from 5.30 every morning. Scenic: England train for the first time at their base overlooking Sugar Loaf Mountain . The UEFA delegates who meet as a group ahead of the FIFA Congress are expected to have the organisation’s dysfunctional governance under president Sepp Blatter at the top of their agenda. And the slippery Blatter doesn’t look as though he can win on 2022 Qatar vote corruption whatever findings investigator Michael Garcia delivers next month. If Garcia calls for a revote, Blatter’s FIFA presidency would be untenable, while any whitewash also makes a mockery of FIFA........................................................................... FA chairman Greg Dyke may have made that infamous cut-throat gesture about England’s chances in Brazil after the World Cup draw. But Dyke, who has been criticised for trying to fit his FA duties around his many other business interests, is nevertheless expected to be at the tournament for most of England’s stay, starting with the FIFA Congress today before flying to Manaus for the Italy game. FA vice-president David Gill is also travelling from the Congress to the Amazon city to watch England, although he is not part of the official FA delegation. .......................................................................... It looks as though the FA made a wise decision in moving from the Windsor Atlantica hotel on Copacabana Beach to the more secluded Royal Tulip. A huge fans’ area, complete with giant screens and beer tents, is being constructed directly outside the Windsor, where hundreds of thousands of fans are expected to watch the games. All mod cons for Roy . England are certainly World Cup contenders when it comes to the detailed preparation for the squad’s stay in Brazil. Roy Hodgson’s players arrived in Rio on Sunday to find all their leisure areas, including a games room with table tennis and pool tables, had been fitted out by FA staff in the 24 hours since the rooms were handed over. The training ground pitch at the Urca military fort, prepared by Yorkshire-based Sports Turf Research Institute, also bears no resemblance to the divot-strewn bumpy surface seen there last December, although it still cuts up quickly. And certainly no other federation would have spent so much time and effort preparing such lavish media facilities inside one of the fort buildings. The cost is understood to be around £80,000, of which team sponsors Vauxhall have paid £30,000 for their branding. However, despite such a welcoming environment, FA spin-doctors stopped players talking about Italy. Home from home: England's hotel in Rio was all kitted out for their arrival from Miami . World Cup favourites Brazil wanted English-based security firm Hans Global to guard the team during the tournament before it was insisted at high Government level that Brazilians should do the job. HG, who look after St George’s Park and also sent a group to bolster security around the England team in Miami, provide that service for the Brazil side on their world tours of friendly matches in the World Cup build-up. And HG were in line to carry on their guard duty for the hosts until the politicians intervened.","England squad took almost twice as long to reach training base from hotel than was originally planned .

"Paul Scholes believes Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard should stick to playing in front of the back four rather than in a more advanced role. The Anfield skipper has struggled to find his best form this campaign having missed out the Premier League title last season. And Scholes also expects Gerrard to see out his career at Liverpool. Steven Gerrard has struggled to capture his best form this season after missing out on the title in May . Gerrard did manage to get on the scoresheet in Liverpool's win over Leicester on Tuesday . Writing in his Independent column, he said: 'For all the debate over where Steven Gerrard plays out his days at Liverpool, I do not see his role as anything other than a holding midfielder. 'Playing in that No 10 playmaker role can be very difficult in your thirties. There is always a danger the game can pass you by, especially if the midfield behind you are not at the very top of their game. 'It seems natural to me that Gerrard would stay at Liverpool for the rest of his career. The time to move, if ever, was a decade ago when he would have had a better chance of winning a league title elsewhere, most likely Chelsea.' Liverpool have struggled both at home and abroad this season after their brilliant campaign last year . Liverpool youngsters train ahead of Sunderland's visit to Anfield on Saturday . Manager Brendan Rodgers (left) has found himself under pressure this season . Scholes' view differs from that of former Liverpool assistant Steve Clark, however. He told talkSPORT: 'Gerrard is a top player. 'He is not in the same condition he was 10 years ago but he still has the quality to influence a game and the position he played against Leicester, a little bit closer to the striker, is probably the position he enjoys the most and he'll always score goals from that position. 'He still has the legs to play in that position and I think that's where he enjoys playing the most. 'Liverpool were a different team last year with (Luis) Suarez and (Daniel) Sturridge up front and they could afford to drop Gerrard a little deeper, but they've got a different team now and I think they'll get more out of him by playing him a bit further forward.'","Steven Gerrard has struggled to find his best form for Liverpool .

"Belgium's former Queen Fabiola has died at the age of 86 at Stuyvenbergh Castle. A statement from the palace today said: 'Their majesties the King and Queen and the members of the royal family announce with great sadness the death of Her Majesty Queen Fabiola in Brussels this evening.' Foreign minister Didier Reynders said all Belgians would mourn her passing. 'A page in our country's history has turned,' he told Belgium's RTL television. King Philippe of Belgium said he was left with 'great sadness' when he heard of the death of his aunt. Scroll down for video . Passed away: Belgium's former Queen Fabiola, pictured in 2008, has died at the age of 86 at Stuyvenbergh Castle, the palace has announced . Customary: A flag flies at half mast at the Royal Palace of Brussels to signal a state of mourning . Although her exact cause of death has not been confirmed, Queen Fabiola, the childless widow of King Baudouin, had been suffering from osteoporosis for years, and had never fully recovered from pneumonia in 2009. The former queen, who used a wheelchair, had looked increasingly frail over the past month as she increasingly limited her public appearances. Fabiola was born in 1928 as Fabiola de Mora y Aragón into an aristocratic family in Madrid, Spain. Her godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain. She became queen of Belgium when she married King Baudouin in 1960. Tribute: Floral tributes are placed at the gates of the Royal Palace . Sad day: A woman brings flowers to the gate of the palace in memory of Fabiola as a police officer looks on . Fabiola remained Queen Consort for 33 years - until Baudouin's death on July 31 1993. He died of heart failure in the Villa Astrida in the south of Spain. After Baudouin's death, Fabiola moved out of the Royal Palace of Laeken to take up residence at Stuyvenbergh Castle. As the couple had no children, the crown passed on to Baudoin's younger brother, King Albert II, who abdicated the throne in 2013 citing health reasons. He was succeeded by his son, now King Phillippe, on 21 July 2013. Nephew: King Philippe of Belgium, pictured today with Queen Mathilde Ronse in East Flanders, Belgium, said he was left with 'great sadness' when he heard of the death of his aunt .

Fabiola, a devout Roman Catholic, was generally regarded to be a popular monarch, known for her tireless charity work. In 2001, she was awarded the Ceres Medal in recognition of her work to help rural women in developing countries. Tragically, Fabiola suffered five miscarriages during the course of her marriage to Baudoin. She openly spoke about this in 2008, stating: 'You know, I myself lost five children. 'You learn something from that experience. I had problems with all my pregnancies, but you know, in the end I think life is beautiful.'

Fabiola's bout of ill health commenced in January 2009 when she was hospitalised with pneumonia and spent 15 days there, with her condition being described as 'serious'. She subsequently recovered. In July 2009, alarming anonymous death threats were published by newspapers which stated Queen Fabiola was to be assassinated with a crossbow. She swiftly responded to the death threats during the Belgian national holiday celebrations later that month when she jokingly waved an apple to the crowd. The provocative gesture, a reference to Swiss folk hero William Tell who shot an apple off the head of his son, won her much praise.

"A newborn baby has been returned to his family in Indiana following a frightening kidnapping ordeal involving a pregnant teenager early this morning. Police say Desarai Kemp, 18, who is nine-months pregnant, abducted the three-week-old boy from his home in Indianapolis around 4:24 am Friday. She allegedly tried to set fire to the apartment on the city's Northwestside. Kemp then made off in a car she stole from the parking lot of the apartment block. Arrested: Indianapolis police detectives say 18-year-old Desarai Kemp stole a three-week old baby and a car from an apartment where she had been staying, and tried to set the place on fire . Scene: Desiree Kemp was arrested at this Indianapolis home early Friday morning after allegedly abducting a baby, trying to set fire to the boy's mother's apartment and stealing a car . The incident occurred at the Cross Creek Apartments near West 59th Street and Georgetown Road. Fortunately police were able to track down Kemp, according to Fox 59. She was found in a house about eight blocks away. Kemp was arrested around 5:35 am in the 2500 block of Rader Street. The baby boy, William, appeared fine and was taken to Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health as a precaution. He checked out fine. The baby's aunt, Maria Flores, said Kemp was a family friend who had staying at the apartment for the last couple of days. Distraught: The baby's aunt, Maria Flores, is seen crying at the scene after the little boy was rescued . 'Mental': Mrs Flores says the teenager must have had some mental issues to do what she allegedly did . The mother of William and other family members live there. Flores told the station that Kemp waited until everyone was sleeping before taking William. On her way out she tried to set fire to the carpet near the front door, as well as a section near a couch where a woman was sleeping. How the carpet did not catch. Flores added that Kemp must be dealing with some 'mental' issues. There was no word on what charges Kemp might face. She is being held by police.","Desarai Kemp, 18, is nine-months pregnant .

"Wilfried Zaha is once again playing with a smile after what has been a frustrating few years for the Crystal Palace loanee. Two years ago the winger's outstanding displays in south London led Manchester United to come calling, paying a fee which could reach up to £15million. Zaha remained with the Eagles for the remainder of 2012/13 campaign, playing an integral role in their promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs. Wilfried Zaha applauds the travelling Crystal Palace supporters who witnessed the 3-2 win at Southampton . Zaha runs to celebrate with Crystal Palace team-mates during the 3-2 FA Cup win over Southampton . Things then began to go awry, though. Sir Alex Ferguson's last ever signing barely got a look-in under successor David Moyes, leading the 22-year-old to end the season on loan at Cardiff. Zaha again departed Old Trafford temporarily in the summer, returning to his south London roots to rejoin Palace on a season-long loan. It offered him a chance to relaunch his career and, after an inconsistent start, he is beginning to regularly show glimpses of the skill which led to the chant 'He's just too good for you.' Matt Tarrgett of Southampton attempts to dispossess Crystal Palace loanee Zaha at St Mary's on Saturday . 'Obviously there was a period where I thought ""What's going on here?''' Zaha said. 'As a footballer it is important not to think that way and remain professional. 'I knew that if I got the chance I needed to take it and not dwell on the past and I am not one to dwell on the past and it was up to me to take it. 'I have a smile on my face because I am back on the pitch. I enjoy playing football, so when I am on the pitch I am happy. 'It is about having trust in me. This gaffer has put trust in me and I am trying to give it back and performing for the team.' Marouane Chamakh runs alongside the Palace away support after netting his second, and Palace's third . Zaha is enjoying life under new manager Alan Pardew, who on Saturday oversaw his fourth straight win since replacing Neil Warnock. The England international was impressive in the latest victory, causing havoc as Palace progressed to the FA Cup fifth-round with a 3-2 win at Southampton. 'I said to myself that if I got minutes on the pitch, then I would get better and better,' Zaha said. 'To find a manager that has got trust in me and get me on the pitch. I am going to lose the ball. I will do tricks and lose the ball, but if I get the chance I will either try to score or set up a chance.' Zaha celebrates with fellow loanee Yaya Sanogo as Crystal Palace made it through to the FA Cup fifth-round . Zaha's improvement bodes well for both Palace and parent club Manchester United. The winger looks unlikely to taste relegation for the second successive season given the Eagles' recent improvements, while United manager Louis van Gaal will no doubt be pleased to see he has kick-started his career. 'I cannot keep that in my head all the time because I could have another move, but Crystal Palace is my home,' Zaha said. 'When I am here I feel more confident. I have lived in South London all my life and my family is here.'","22-year-old signed for Manchester United in £15m deal in January 2013 .

"A man jailed for killing Baby P has been released from prison three months early and been given a new identity funded by the taxpayer despite still being considered a danger to the public. Jason Owen received a six year jail sentence for allowing the toddler to die at his home in Tottenham, north London on August 3, 2007. Owen received a six-year jail term and had been earlier released on licence in 2011 but was recalled to prison after breaching the terms of the agreement. Jason Owen, left,  changed his name upon his release from prison and is currently in a bail hostel, Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly, right, has also changed her name following her release in November 2013 . A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'The independent Parole Board will direct the re-release of recalled offenders only once the Board are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community. 'Serious offenders on licence are subject to a strict set of conditions which can include restrictions on their movements, as well as frequent meetings with their offender manager. 'When released from prison, offenders managed through Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) will be risk assessed, monitored and supervised by Probation, Police and other agencies.' It is understood that Owen is living in a bail hostel in the south of England under an assumed name. However, he will be moving into a taxpayer funded bedsit in the coming weeks. The 42-year-old criminal was under constant threat from fellow inmates in prison because of the nature of his conviction. Peter Connelly, (Baby P), suffered 50 separate injuries before his death in August 2007 . Stephen Barker, pictured is the only one of Baby P's killers to still be in prison serving a 12-year sentence . Owen was addicted to crack cocaine and had previous convictions for arson. At the time of Peter Connelly's death, Owen was living at the house with his brother Stephen Barker and the baby's mother Tracey Connelly. Criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher told the Sunday Mirror: 'The reason he was let out early was not because he is no longer a danger or for leniency but so he can be supervised. 'Probation officers will monitor him closely for the coming weeks to try to minimise the risk of reoffending. The 17-month-old toddler received more than 50 separate injuries including a broken back. His body was recovered from a blood spattered cot. His mother Tracey Connelly was released from prison in November 2013. She tried to secure an anonymity order similar to the one secured by Maxine Carr, Robert Thompson, Jon Venables and Mary Bell. Stephen Barker was sentenced to 12 years in prison for killing Baby P.

"Islamic State  group militants have lined up and executed at least another 85 tribesmen in Iraq's Anbar province after accusing the tribe of retaliating against them. Mass killings have become a near daily occurrence across the swathes of Syria and Iraq controlled by ISIS as it seeks to impose a brutal form of sharia law across the region. The shooting, confirmed by Iraqi officials, occurred late Friday in the village of Ras al-Maa, north of the provincial captial Ramadi. Militants from the Islamic State (pictured) have intensified attacks in Anbar province recently . ISIS had accused the Al Bu Nimr tribe of retaliating against them after being displaced from their homes when the militants seized the town of Hit last month. It comes just days after the bodies of another 220 Al Bu Nimr tribesmen were found in two separate graves, bringing the total number of people from the tribe executed around 300. Faleh al-Issawi, a councillor of the Anbar region, said: 'These killings are taking place almost on a daily basis now in the areas under the control of the Islamic State group and they will continue unless this terrorist group is stopped.' The Islamic State group has overrun a large part of Anbar province in its push to expand its territory, which currently stands at about one-third of both Iraq and Syria. Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the U.S.-led coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key in the fight against the Islamic State group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to airstrikes and ground forces. Pictured are the bodies of 30 men from the Anbar province, west of Baghdad, who were executed on Thursday . Massacre: Young men use mobile phones to take pictures of the dead bodies inside Hit . The Anbar faction of ISIS is led by Abu Waheeb (centre) whose notoriety stems from the filmed murder of a group of Syrian lorry drivers in Iraq last summer. His band of militants are known as the 'Al Anbar Lions' More than 150 members of the Sunni Albu Nimr tribe were found in a mass grave near Ramadi in Anbar province on Thursday, while the corpses of another 48 members were discovered near Hit. In a further frightening development ISIS militants massacred 30 men in broad daylight in the centre of Hit, which is also in Anbar, parading them through the streets and using loudspeakers to declare them apostates. The murdered men were thought to be local tribesmen who had allied with the Iraqi government and were helping to organise anti-ISIS operations throughout the province. Meanwhile, the United Nations mission in Baghdad said that at least 1,273 Iraqis were killed in violence in October a slight increase compared to last month amid the Islamic State group's assault. However, the figures do not take into account casualties in Anbar province or some other militant-held parts of Iraq. The UN report said violence killed 856 civilians and 417 members of Iraq's security forces, while attacks wounded 2,010 Iraqis. The worst-hit city was Baghdad, with 379 civilians killed. The UN has said September's death toll was 1,119 Iraqis killed.","Another 85 tribesmen and women executed by ISIS militants seeking revenge .

"Jamie Vardy's team won 5-3 on this day four years ago as well, but the circumstances could hardly be more contrasting. He was playing for FC Halifax Town at the time in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League, the seventh tier of English football, and that night 658 hardy souls saw the Shaymen beat Vardy's former club, Stocksbridge Park Steels. Their Bracken Moor ground, with its weather-worn stands and grass bank behind one goal, is a million miles away from where Vardy is now, putting Manchester United to the sword in one of the most remarkable results in the Premier League era. Jamie Vardy played a role in all five of Leicester City's goals as they put Manchester United to the sword . Chris Smalling (foreground) and Marcos Rojo reflect as the goals roll in for Leicester . Tyler Blackett conceded a penalty and received a red card for this foul on Vardy . Blackett can't quite believe he's been sent off as Leicester piled on the misery at the King Power Stadium . Forget Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, this was the Vardy show as he ran United's atrocious defence ragged, exposing the fundamental flaw in Louis Van Gaal's thrill-a-minute football masterplan. Vardy was irrepressible, playing a role in all five of Leicester's goals. He crossed for Leonardo Ulloa to head home the first and was fouled by Rafael Da Silva to win a penalty for the second. He inadvertently blocked a shot to tee up Esteban Cambiasso for their third, then broke clear to calmly roll home the fourth. Finally, all for good measure, he bamboozled Tyler Blackett to win a penalty for the fifth, the foul prompting referee Mark Clattenburg to send off the youngster. It was the final indignity on an afternoon in which United simply imploded. So it was Vardy, a man who was playing non-league football as recently as May 2012, who ruthlessly exposed United's glaring defensive failings. Proof, as if it were needed, that you should always expect the glorious unexpected in football. Vardy is bundled over by Rafael Da Silva, leading to a penalty and Leicester's second goal . Jonny Evans limped off injured, adding to Man United's crisis at the back . Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs (left) look miserable on the bench as the result gets worse . United's attacking football was magnificent - Di Maria was mesmerising, Falcao dangerous, Van Persie clinical - but they spent the second half at sixes and sevens in defence. In the end, those numbers could well have been Leicester's goal tally, perhaps even more. United weren't helped by Clattenburg's incorrect decision not to penalise Vardy for barging Rafael over in the lead-up to the first penalty, nor earlier on when Jonny Evans, arguably the one member of the back line who looks competent, succumbed to injury on the half-hour. He was replaced by Chris Smalling, himself returning from an injury lay-off. But most of Leicester's other profitable moments going forward were the result of a defensive horror show. Van Gaal spent £16m on Marcos Rojo and will be alarmed at how susceptible he looked. Vardy tied the Argentine in knots, notably when he skinned him to cross for Ulloa to get Leicester back in the game at 1-2. It also his poor pass in the 79th minute that enabled Ritchie De Laet, a United reject, to mug Juan Mata and play Vardy through for the fourth goal. Evans returned to watch the second half from the bench, wearing a protective boot . Chris Smalling struggles to get a grip of Vardy during the second-half . Rojo is meant to be more comfortable at left-back than in the middle but that wasn't apparent here. He looked totally stunned by the pace of Premier League football, an accident waiting to happen. Blackett is just 20 and has much to learn and with United's defensive injury problems continuing, he'll have to educate himself quickly. First though, he'll have to serve a suspension. He made one excellent last-ditch tackle to thwart Vardy when clean through but was reckless in bringing down the striker to concede a penalty and earn himself a red card. Blackett is still meek, he hasn't yet developed the command and authority needed to operate at centre-half and would have benefitted greatly from a few games alongside Nemanja Vidic or Rio Ferdinand. United were hasty in letting them go. The years of experience they could bring to the back line is painfully missing. Evans, who sat on the bench in a protective leg brace and left the King Power Stadium on crutches, is the closest United now have. It looks like he'll be absent for quite a few weeks. Wayne Rooney shouts at his defence as another Leicester goal goes in . Rooney (left), Blackett (centre) and Daley Blind after Leicester went into the lead at 4-3 . United could have done with the authority and experience of Rio Ferdinand, who went to QPR over the summer . They play West Ham next weekend but have tougher assignments against Everton, Chelsea and Manchester City on the horizon. The title contenders would have watched Vardy's performance with glee. If a newly-promoted team can rip United open at will, then they'll have a field day. Rafael, equally, looks a liability. He was out of position when Ulloa headed in and allowed himself to be pushed over by Vardy when trying to usher the ball out. His resultant foul on the Leicester man inside the box was beyond stupidity with Blackett covering. Daley Blind and Ander Herrera were exclusively concerned with pushing forward, they felt it wasn't their business to track back and provide cover. As a result, the space Leicester were able to exploit on the counter-attack was astonishing. This would never have happened under Sir Alex Ferguson and probably not even under David Moyes. This result has ruthlessly highlighted the flaw in Van Gaal's summer transfer policy. David de Gea looks astonished as Leonardo Ulloa heads the ball past him for Leicester's first goal . United were linked with Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels over the summer . Overloading the team with some of the world's best attacking talent is all well and good but defensively, United are still short of two world class defenders. They are imbalanced and how it showed. Luke Shaw has yet to figure and Rojo yet to impress. It certainly would have been handy to have a Mats Hummels or Thomas Vermaelen figure ready to step in but United went for style over substance. Captain Wayne Rooney spent much of the second half screaming at his defence. The fury and frustration in his eyes and voice clear for everyone to see. It could become a familiar sight this season at this rate.","Jamie Vardy had a hand in all five goals as Leicester City came from 3-1 down to beat Manchester United 5-3 .

"Fearing a slew of Republican victories on Election Day, Democrats are relying on racially-charged campaign advertisements to turn blacks out to vote next Tuesday. With the U.S. Senate and more than a dozen governors' mansions up for grabs, Democrats are hoping to relight a fire in the bellies of the president's most loyal supporters. Republicans say the ads go too far, though, and have slammed the ads over the top race-bating. One mailer in Georgia features two black children on the cover and tells the recipient to vote 'if you want to prevent another Ferguson in their future. This flyer is being circulated by the Georgia Democratic Party ahead of Tuesday's election. Republicans have slammed it as race-baiting . Another flier created by the Georgia Democratic Party says, 'It’s up to us to vote to protect the legacy of the first African-American president,' And the New York Times reports that progressive group Color of Changer has littered Arkansas mailboxes with mailers that say, 'Enough! Republicans are targeting our kids, silencing our voices and even trying to impeach our president.' In North Carolina, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's Senate Majority PAC is running radio ads that ding Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis for his support for the type of gun laws that 'caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.' 'It’s not race-baiting; it’s actually happening,' Jaymes Powell Jr., a leader of the North Carolina Democratic Party’s African-American Caucus told the New York Times, referring to a plethora of laws black feel unfairly target them, such as voter identification laws. 'I can’t catch a fish unless there’s a worm on the hook,' he said. While the race-based ads have predominately appeared in southern states, the Democratic Party of Maryland is also circulating a pamphlet invoking segregation and 'birtherism,' according to the Washington Times. Those flyers were paid for by the Maryland Democratic Party, the Washington times said, and are meant to drum up votes for Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who is locked in a tight race for Republican Larry Hogan. 'Vote for Anthony Brown as Maryland’s first African-American Governor,' of the ads reportedly says. 'History is watching to see if we vote.' Ads like the one above are running in southern states as part of the Democratic Party's attempt to get African-American voters to the polls . It also includes images of sign for a 'colored waiting room,' a 'Must Show ID to Vote' sign and a photo of a white protester holding a sign that says, 'Go Back to Africa Negroes,' according to the Washington Times, which did not publish photos of the mailers along with its story. On another page of the flyer real estate mogul Donald Trump is pictured in front of a billboard that says, 'Where’s the birth certificate.' Trump has long been a skeptic of the origin of Obama's birth and even made a wager with the president to release the long form version. Asked about the pamphlet by the Washington Times, the head of the Prince George's Country, Maryland, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter, Bob Ross told the Washington Times: 'I can’t control the Democratic Party. They shouldn’t do that. Ross said he had not seen the alleged ads, but said if the Democratic Party 'should just let it go on the issues.' That said, Ross argued that 'it’s a free democracy, if that’s what they choose to do.' 'I guess everybody tries to exploit voters in one fashion or another,' he added. Former Lt. Gov. of Maryland and the former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said it's clear what Democrats are trying to accomplish with racially-tinged ads. 'They have been playing on this nerve in the black community that if you even so much as look at a Republican, churches will start to burn, your civil rights will be taken away and young black men like Trayvon Martin will die,' Steele told the New York Times. 'The reality of it is, the Democrats realize that their most loyal constituency is not as loyal as they once were.' Likewise, a current RNC spokesman, Raffi Williams, told MailOnline that 'he RNC’s relationship and community based approach to black voter engagement is now focused on activating and mobilizing supporters that we’ve reclaimed and recruited to the Republican Party. 'Meanwhile, Democrats are relying on racially divisive rhetoric to gin up unenthusiastic voters and distract from talking about their policies that have failed black communities,' Williams said. Democratic National Committee Communications Director Mo Elleithee refused to condemn or officially condone the ads in Georgia when confronted about them by MSNBC host Craig Melvin yesterday afternoon. 'Look do, I think it's appropriate to constantly remind people how important it is to vote, how important it is to make your voice heard, how important it is to remain engaged, and how if you don't, you lose your voice?' he said. 'Absolutely I think that's important to keep doing.' 'But can you not do that without trotting out the images of dead black teenagers?' Melvin, who is black, asked him. Elleithee responded with more talking points until the clock ran out on the segment a few moments later. With the U.S. Senate and more than a dozen governors' mansions up for grabs, Democrats are hoping that this ad, running in Georgia, will relight a fire in the bellies of the president's most loyal supporters . African-Americans, who make up a significant part of the Democratic Party's voting bloc, do not traditionally turn out to vote in midterm elections as frequently as they do when the presidency is on the line. An analysis of African Americans' voting habits conducted by the Associated Press shows that roughly four of 10 African Americans adults voted in recent congressional elections in non-presidential years. That number jumped to six in 10 both years Obama was on the ballot. Recognizing the peril his party faces if blacks don't come to his rescue once again, President Barack Obama has taken to the airwaves in areas heavily populated by African Americans to stump for Democratic candidates. 'I’ll bet there are whole bunch of folks listening to your show who may not even know that there’s an election going on. I need everybody to go vote,' Obama said recently on the Atlanta, Georgia, based Rickey Smiley Morning Show. Obama has also appeared on civil rights leader Al Sharpton's radio show to make his case, as well as a handful of other shows that are popular with black audiences. While the president clearly believes that a personal plea from him to voters will help boost Democratic candidates' numbers in the south, embattled southern senators aren't so sure. Obama is not particularly popular there, or anywhere, for that matter. Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, who is neck and neck with challenger Republican opponent, Tom Cotton, told Fox News today that Obama 'has been a drag' on his reelection chances. 'I’m just going to be honest about that.' 'People here know that I have had my fair share of disagreements with him and you can look at, you know, gun control issues. You can look at Keystone pipeline. You know, I never supported one of his budgets,' Pryor said, making a last-ditch effort to retain his seat in the federal legislature. 'The reality of it is, the Democrats realize that their most loyal constituency is not as loyal as they once were,' Republican National Committee spokesman Raffi Williams said of the mailers . Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu said yesterday in an interview that while she thinks Obama has likability problems in her state because of his energy policies, the anti-Obama sentiment there cuts deeper than his policies. 'To be very, very honest with you, the South has not always been the friendliest place to African-Americans,' she told MSNBC's Chuck Todd on Thursday. 'It’s been a difficult time for the president to present himself in a positive light as a leader. She went on to say, 'It’s not always been a good place for women to be able to present ourselves, it’s more of a conservative place.' Landrieu's opponent in the race, Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, fired back at her on Fox News later that evening. 'I wish she would focus more on policies instead of insulting,' Cassidy told Fox's Megyn Kelly. 'We’re going through the political process to have a change – how our Constitution prescribes how you do it – and we’re called racist. 'We’re not racist, we just have common sense,' he added.","The U.S. Senate and more than a dozen governors' mansions up for grabs .

The divorce was finalized in June 1999 and just two years later Zehaf-Bibeau was arrested for assault causing actual bodily harm in his first criminal offence, paving the way for his later radicalization. He would have been just 16 at the time and his parents' split wrenched him away from his family life, his friends and his school. Even today the wounds appear to be raw. Susan Bibeau, now one of Canada's top immigration officials, has admitted that she has not seen her son for the past five years as he became increasingly radicalized and drifted across Canada, his only mark on society being his growing list of crimes. His life reached its terrifying conclusion on Wednesday when he shot dead Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, 24, as he was standing guard at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, walked a short distance to Parliament and unleashed an estimated 50 rounds from his Winchester.30 caliber rifle before being shot dead. It was one of the most brazen terrorist attacks on a Western country in the last few years - but now investigators are trying to work out why Zehaf-Bibeau did it. He came from a middle class family and grew up in Laval, a suburb of Montreal in Quebec and seemed to have the world at his feet. Former classmates described him as 'smiley' and somebody who 'fitted in'. The 2000 yearbook (photo provided by CBC) from his senior year at Ecole Secondaire Saint Maxime in Laval said that he 'will go far in life' and that he is a 'sociable and intelligent guy'. But the year before that his life was turned upside down when his parents split up. Zehaf-bibeau's Libyan father wrote in an affidavit that Susan Bibeau 'confessed' what she did to him and that afterwards he could not be with her any more. In the resulting acrimony, Zehaf-Bibeau was removed from College Laval, an exclusive private school where students have to take an entrance exam, in the middle of the 1998/1999 academic year. Former classmate Vito Garofalo said that during his time at College Laval Bibeau would have had no opportunity to get involved in criminality because the regime was so strict. The 31-year-old realtor said: 'We had to wear a suit all year, even in the summer. It was like being in the Army and it was very strict. Terror and death: Surveillance cameras capture Zehaf-Bibeau on Wednesday's murderous rampage . 'We had a merit system and we started the year with 25 points. If you did something wrong you lost points, so if you got in a fight you lost 10 points, and if you didn't do your homework you lost two points. 'Anyone who had zero points was expelled. It was a tough place'. Zehaf-Bibeau was put into Saint Maxime which has been known for pupils fighting with other students from local schools. As he adjusted to his new life, papers filed at the Montreal Justice Palace show that painful mediation was ongoing over his parents' divorce. His mother, already a successful official in the Canadian immigration service, paid his father $40,000 for his share of the smart three-bedroom house so she could keep it, and Zehaf-Bibeau appears to have lived there with her. In a sign that perhaps she accepted blame for the breakup, she did not ask for child support even though under Quebec law she was entitled to it. Zehaf kept his Ford Crown 89 and his Porsche 944 whilst she kept the Mazda MX-3. He kept the cafe that he ran, though it later closed down. In one of his statements Zahaf says that, as of the age of 16, Zehaf-Bibeau had no criminal record and had never appeared before a youth court. The family had also not been investigated by social services. But that all changed soon after. Zehaf-Bibeau's first conviction was in 2001 when he was 19 – the assault during an incident in Montreal. That same year he was convicted of possessing a false credit card and impaired driving. Over the next 13 years he racked up 13 offences in Quebec including his most serious crime, a 2003 robbery, for which he was jailed for two years and put on probation for three. Zehaf-Bibeau drifted between jobs and traveled to Vancouver, where he briefly worked as a laborer and developed a crack cocaine drug addiction. At some point during these turbulent years he converted from Catholicism to Islam. A mosque in Vancouver, British Columbia, kicked him out. 'His behaviour was not normal,’ said David Ali, vice-president of Masjid Al-Salaam mosque in nearby Burnaby. He said: 'We try to be open to everyone. But people on drugs don't behave normally.' In 2011, Zehaf-Bibeau tried to rob a McDonald's restaurant in the city so he could get clean from his addiction while in jail. A psychiatrist deemed him fit to stand trial and after being convicted he was sentenced to time served, which was 66 days in jail. A transcript of the hearing reveals he was by then deeply troubled. Victim: Father-of-one Cpl Nathan Cirillo was shot in the back by Zehaf-Bibeau. He died of his injuries later . Ominous: Responders frantically tried reviving Cirillo at the base of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Wasted life: Cpl Cirillo's mother, Kathy, weeps behind the young soldier's coffin as it is walked out to the hearse in his hometown of Hamilton, Canada, on Friday . Honor: Crowds of well-wishers pay their respects as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo's casket is transported by hearse from Ottawa to Hamilton via the Highway of Heroes in Ottawa . He says: 'My plan is...I'm a crack addict, and at the same time I'm a religious person. I want to sacrifice freedom and good things, for a year maybe, so when I come out I'll appreciate things of life more, and be clean, or maybe get a therapy like a detox, if you guys could send me to one.' Zehaf-Bibeau's last known home was a homeless shelter in Ottawa where he vacillated between preaching and doing drugs. But by then, according to CNN, he had already developed 'connections' to Canadian jihadists, including one who had gone to Syria to fight and is currently on the run. The extent of their influence on him is something that investigators will be working out. Among those who have spoken out in support of Zehaf-Bibeau has been his aunt Monique, although when visited by MailOnline she refused to come to the door. A fierce husky dog on a chain prowled the driveway of her picturesque lakeside home in the mountain resort of Mont Tremblant. Monique Bibeau has been told not to talk about her nephew's visit by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), according to a neighbor. The neighbor said: 'The Mounties were here this morning. They told Monique not to talk about Michael's visit. She is very upset. He would often come here when he was young.' Mrs Bideau has described how her bearded nephew turned up at her remote mountain home 'out of the blue' the night before the terrorist attack. She told La Presse: 'He just turned up (on Tuesday night). He said he wanted to pay me a visit. It had been a long time since we'd seen each other. 'I hardly recognized him. He had changed. He had long hair and a beard. He was no longer my little nephew. But in ten years you change.' She added that had spent several years in the west of Canada working in the oil industry as he drifted around. Monique Bibeau said: 'He said vaguely that he had plans to return. I am totally against what he did but he is still my nephew and always will be. He was like any other kid.' Court records also seen by MailOnline show that Zehaf's first marriage before he met Susan Bibeau ended badly too.. He wed Susan Simmons in January 1984 but in November the following year they divorced. In his affidavit Zehaf states: 'The reason for the divorce was physical cruelty and mental cruelty'. Neither party saw any chance of reconciliation. Loved: People sign a  Canadian flag at a makeshift memorial to Cirillo outside of The Lieutenant-Colonel John Weir Foote Armoury in Hamilton, Ontario on Thursday . Zehaf has been described as a businessman who appears to have fought in Libya in 2011 for the rebels. He also made numerous trips to Libya over the previous decade and Bibeau is said to have joined him on some. Zehaf-Bibeau had traveled to Ottawa to apply for a Libyan passport because he wanted to go to the country to study Islam, but was rejected for undisclosed reasons. But it has been reported that he had also told his mother he wanted to go to Syria - where ISIS is currently running rampage. His passport had been seized but he was not among the dozens of Islamic radicals being watched by Canadian intelligence. In a joint statement Susan Bibeau and Zehaf spoke of their horror at what their son has done. Susan Bibeau said: 'If I’m crying, it's for the people (killed and hurt). Not for my son.'","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's mother Susan admitted she had an affair when she divorced Libyan Bulgasem Zehaf in 1999 .

"A Navy veteran has been fired and branded a terrorist for posting Facebook pictures of Homeland Security SUVs parked at a hotel where he works near Ferguson. Mark Paffrath, who worked for the Drury hotel chain, took photos and a video of dozens of vehicles marked with the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Protection Services which arrived in the parking lot of Chesterfield’s Drury Plaza Hotel  last week. The vehicles are parked about a 30-minute drive from Ferguson, Missouri. Scroll down for video . Mark Paffrath, a hotel worker, was fired and called 'a terrorist' after taking photos (pictured) of Homeland Security vehicles in hotel parking lot near Ferguson . Paffrath (seen left now and right during his time in the military) said he was offended by the comment that he was a terrorist as he served three years in the military, including overseas stints before he was honorably discharged . 'You know, it surprised me, and I was rather shocked that they were there,' he said, reports CNN. 'So I took a short video and a picture of the vehicles. I didn't give any location out.' He posted the photos on Facebook on Thursday and wrote: 'Why are all these vehicles here, I wonder if it has anything to do with Ferguson? #Ferguson, #No justice, no peace.' Paffrath, a Navy veteran, took photos (pictured) of dozens of vehicles marked with the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Protection Services which were in his employer's parking lot and arrived last week . Paffrath says he was also told by his superiors that he put a $150, 000 contract with the Department of Homeland Security in jeopardy for the hotel . The next day his boss called him in and told him to take down the pictures, which he removed from his page and he continued to work for the rest of the day. But on Saturday he was again called to the General Manager's office where he was fired from the job he had for approximately a year and a half. 'The head of security for Drury was in there, and he pretty much called me a terrorist, saying that I dishonorably served my country for posting those pictures and videos on Facebook,' Paffrath said.

Paffrath said he was offended by the comment as he  served three years in the military, including overseas stints,  before he was honorably discharged. He told Argus News Now he pleaded for his job with Jim Bohner, Director of Security for Drury Hotels, saying he 'never put the location down on the post'. But he claims Bohner told him: 'All they have to do is click on your name and see where you work'. Paffrath says he was also told by his superiors that he put the hotel's $150,000 contract with the Department of Homeland Security in jeopardy. He claimed Bohnert ended the conversation with 'if you repost the photos and video you will have the federal government knocking on your door and you will be incarcerated'. Paffrath says the staff should have been told previously of the confidential nature of the visit and insists a message board telling staff of their stay only went up a day after he posted the photo. The hotel where Paffrath worked said it was not authorized to comment on the case, but Joseph Pereles, a Drury Hotels' vice president, sent this statement to CNN: 'We do not publicly discuss confidential personnel matters. 'The safety and privacy of our guests and our team members has always been and will remain our top priority.'

"ISIS have clearly heard that an army marches on its stomach. In a bid to keep their fighters well-nourished and ready for battle insurgents have launched their own cookbook. Aimed at the wives of the jihadists the recipes are said to be made-up of simple ingredients that can be found in the homes of most militants. The latest recipe is for pancakes and is made with egg, sugar, oil, salt, milk and flour, reported Vocativ. Ingredients: four tablespoons of flour, one egg, teaspoon of salt and a cup of milk . The recipe instructs cooks to put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir them well . Cooks are then told to pour a little oil into the pan and warm to a medium hear, before pouring in the pancake mixture. When the pancake starts bubbling it should be flipped over . Once brown on both sides the pancake is ready to be served. Militants suggest dishing it up with maple syrup or honey . The instructions specify how the energy and calorie packed treats should be prepared and served. It even suggests dishing them up with maple syrup and honey. The first instruction released were for 'date balls,' made by mixing dates, flour and butter together. Militants are told that the date balls are best eaten during an 'intermission in battle' with coffee or water. 'They contain significant calories, and will extend the power and strength of the Mujahideen, God willing,' the post says. The cookbook was published  by the Zora Foundation, an arm of ISIS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq. Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far. The ingredients needed for power and strength increasing 'date balls' include dates, butter and flour . Terrorist wives  are told to take the pips out of the dates and melt the butter . Take the remains of the dates and add the butter.  Then combine with the flour . Cooks then need to role the mixture into the tiny balls before they are ready for their fighter husbands . ISIS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'. Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further. It is not known exactly how many women have joined ISIS, but it is common for men signing up to take their wives to fight alongside them. There are two all-female brigades operating in the de-facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria, including al-Khanssaa, which is thought to be lead by Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British female jihadi. The brigade, whose job is to patrol the streets of Raqqa enforcing strict Sharia law, is thought to include up to sixty female radicals from the UK.

"A group of demonstrators have interrupted a performance of the St. Louis Symphony to protest the shooting of Michael Brown. Several dozen people, all said to have tickets, held up banners and sang to draw attention to the death of the 18-year-old who was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri in July.

"Finding: Police have announced that MI6 spy Gareth Williams probably locked himself in the holdall where he was found dead in August 2010 . Police today admitted that they are unable to explain the death of an MI6 spy whose body was found locked in a holdall bag. Gareth Williams' mysterious death has been the subject of fierce speculation since he was found dead in his Central London flat three years ago. Following a year-long investigation by Scotland Yard, officers today announced that they believe his death was accidental and that no one else was involved, although they concluded that it is impossible to reach a definite verdict on the case. The finding contravenes the verdict of a coroner who last year ruled that Mr Williams had 'probably' been killed by someone else. Scotland Yard detectives said that since it was possible for the codebreaker to climb in to the bag and lock it unaided, it is not necessary to posit any outside involvement. They added that there was no evidence of anyone else in his flat at the time of his death, and no sign that the home had undergone a 'deep clean' to avoid incriminating a third party. However, the review also found traces of DNA in the flat from 10 to 15 different people, none of whom they were able to identify. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said: 'With the conclusion of the investigation, the Metropolitan Police's position is that, on balance, it is a more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died. 'But the reality is that for both hypotheses, there exist evidential contradictions and gaps in our understanding.' Although he said that Mr Williams' death was 'most probably' an accident, he admitted: 'No evidence has been identified to establish the full circumstances of Gareth's death beyond all reasonable doubt.' Mystery: The body of Gareth Williams lay undiscovered in a red holdall in the bath of his Pimlico flat for a week before security service bosses raised the alarm . However, the family of the . 31-year-old disagree with the verdict, and continue . to support the coroner's theory that he was unlawfully killed. They . said in a statement: 'We are naturally disappointed that it is still . not possible to state with certainty how Gareth died and the fact that . the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief. 'We . consider that on the basis of the facts known at present the coroner's . verdict accurately reflects the circumstances of Gareth's death.' Mr Hewitt admitted that the police and MI6 had failed to co-operate fully, but said it was 'beyond credibility' that his investigation had been deliberately deceived by anyone trying to hide the truth about Mr Williams' death. 'I do not believe that I have had the wool pulled over my eyes,' he said. 'I believe that what we are dealing with is a tragic unexplained death.' Reconstruction: A yoga expert tried to climb into a similar holdall in a video shown at Mr Williams' inquest . Home: The scene inside the spy's flat in Pimlico, Central London, where he was found dead . Following the inquest, police were given access to the codebreaker's personnel and vetting files, but found that there was 'no evidence to support the theory that Gareth's death was in any way related to his work'. Mr Hewitt went on: 'Three years of extensive investigative activity have developed a very clear profile of Gareth. He was, without doubt, a private person who was very close to his family and had few other close friends. 'That said, the universal view of colleagues was of a conscientious and decent man with a few well-known hobbies such as his cycling and climbing. There is no evidence of any animosity towards Gareth, and it has not been possible to identify anyone with a motive for causing him harm.' Mr Williams, who was found dead inside . the locked bag in the bath of his flat in Pimlico in August 2010, is . known to have had an interest in escapology. He once had to be rescued by his landlady after he apparently tied himself to his bed wearing only boxer shorts and was unable to free himself. Last image: Mr Williams pictured on CCTV at a Tube station shortly before his death . MI6 failed to raise the alarm about his disappearance for more than a week after he failed to turn up for work at the agency's headquarters in Vauxhall. His family said: 'We still remain . very disappointed over the failure of his employers at MI6 to take even . the most basic inquiries concerning Gareth's welfare when he failed to . attend for work on August 16 2010. 'We . believe that if proper steps had been taken in the same manner as any . reasonable employer would have undertaken, further information relating . to the cause of his death might have become apparent and not have been . lost due to the length of time before Gareth's body was found. 'This . lack of concern for Gareth's wellbeing remains an overriding feature of . our thoughts following the death of a dear son and brother.' Coroner Fiona Wilcox ruled in May last year . that the spy would not have been able to lock himself in the bag and was . therefore likely to have died at somebody else's hands. She . concluded: 'The cause of his death was unnatural and likely to have . been criminally mediated. I am therefore satisfied that on the balance . of probabilities that Gareth was killed unlawfully.' Bag: Mr Williams was found locked inside a red North Face holdall similar to this one . Family: Mr Williams' parents, Ellen and Ian, at the inquest into his death in April last year. They stand by a coroner's ruling that the brilliant codebreaker was probably killed unlawfully . But . within days of the verdict investigators claimed that it was in fact . possible for a skilled escapologist to climb in to the red North Face . holdall and lock it from the inside. Police launched a review of the case following the inquest, over concerns that some evidence had been handled improperly. The . investigation included interviews with 27 officials from both . MI6 and GCHQ, from where Mr Williams, who was originally from Anglesey, had been seconded. Police said that Dr Wilcox has accepted their findings, but decided that there is insufficient new evidence to justify re-opening the inquest. Theories: Many possible explanations for Mr Williams' death have previously been suggested but rejected by police . The Metropolitan Police's conclusion that the Gareth Williams' death was nothing more than a tragic accident could put to rest the various theories which have attached themselves to the case. It has long been suspected that Mr Williams could have been targeted by foreign agents because of his highly sensitive MI6 work. He was said to be a mathematical prodigy, sent by GCHQ to work at MI6 for a year thanks to his exceptional skills as a codebreaker. Another theory was that the Russian mafia assassinated him in a bid to stop him investigating money-laundering networks. Others suspected that his death might have been the result of a sex game gone wrong, after it was claimed that he had close links with London's drag and bondage scenes. A collection of women's designer clothes and shoes worth £15,000 was found in his closed, raising the possibility that he may have been a cross-dresser, although friends insisted that he had bought the clothes as gifts for others. Mr Williams' relatives have previously suggested that incriminating items were planted in his flat after his death to cast doubt on his character. Police issued e-fit images of a couple who were apparently seen visiting the spy shortly before he died, amidst suggestions they could hold the answer to the mystery. Today's finding that Mr Williams's death was probably accidental has failed to satisfy not only his family, but dozens of members of the public who took to Twitter to express scepticism about Scotland Yard's verdict. Many people continue to insist that it would have been impossible for the 31-year-old to lock himself inside the holdall without leaving any traces of DNA on the padlock. Despite the Metropolitan Police's conclusion that the death of Gareth Williams was probably an accident, a number of questions surrounding the mystery remain unanswered. Scotland Yard claims that no one else was present in the spy's flat when he died, but investigators were unable to identify the DNA of 10 to 15 people which was found at the property. By contrast, there were no traces of Mr Williams' own DNA on the padlock of the bag he was found in, nor were his palm prints found on the bathtub which held the bag. The central heating was turned on in the Central London flat where the spy was living, even though it was August, a mystery not explained by the police investigation. Moreover, it remains unclear why MI6 failed to report Mr Williams missing for a week after he repeatedly failed to turn up to work, a failing for which his manager publicly apologised during his inquest. Attention initially focussed on a Mediterranean-looking couple believed to have visited the spy's home around the time of his death, but they have never been found or identified.","Gareth Williams found dead in his Central London flat in August 2010 .

"Kurdish and Hezbollah fighters have been killed in suicide bombings and border clashes with ISIS militants as they fight to stop the extremists from extending their influence across the region. Funerals were held in Turkey today for Kurdish fighters who were killed in battle near the northern Syria border town of Kobane. The town and its surrounding areas were the scene of heavy fighting this week after ISIS attempted to seize control of the Kurdish-run stronghold. And Hezbollah has also buried its dead in recent days after numerous fighters were killed defending the loosely patrolled Lebanon-Syria border from ISIS fighters - clashes which left at least eight Hezbollah fighters and dozens of jihadists and Syrian rebels dead. Villagers accompany the coffins of three Kurdish fighters killed while battling ISIS militants near the border town of Kobane, Syria . Mourners watch on as the bodies of the three fighters, in Suruc, Turkey, are laid to rest . The fighters were killed in clashes with ISIS in northern Syria earlier this week. The area has been the scene of fierce fighting in recent days . Locals in Suruc, Turkey, mourn the deaths of the three fighters killed despite US-led airstrikes targeting the region in recent days . Islamic State militants captured part of a strategic hill overlooking the southern entrance to the besieged Kurdish town of Kobane on Syria's border with Turkey, despite what appeared to be the most intense airstrikes yet on jihadist forces around the town, by the US-led coalition formed to fight the militants . At least 30 people have also been killed in two suicide attacks on checkpoints run by Kurdish fighters in Syria's northeastern city of Hasakah. The northeastern province of Hasakah, which borders Iraq and Turkey, has a population of over one million, 70 per cent Kurd and 30 per cent Arab. Kurds compose around 10 per cent of Syria's 23 million population. They are mainly Sunnis. 'The attacks targeted checkpoints run by Kurdish fighters on the western entrance of the city. They occurred within minutes of each other,' Rami Abdelrahman from the Observatory for Human Rights said. For more than three weeks, Syria's Kurds have been engaged in heavy fighting with fighters from the Islamic State group which is trying to seize the border town of Kobani after taking large parts of Syria and Iraq. On Monday, the radical group raised its black flag on a building on the outskirts of Kobani. At least another 30 people were killed in two suicide attacks on two checkpoints run by Kurdish fighters in Syria's northeastern city of Hasakah on Monday. Pictured are locals in Suruc, Turkey, at the funerals of killed fighters . Villagers dig the graves of the three men killed in the clashes with Syrian jihadists and ISIS militants . A coffin holding one of the dead Kurdish fighters is carried over the heads of mourners attending the funeral . Meanwhile, two rockets have also hit Lebanon in a border region where the country's Hezbollah movement clashed with Syrian jihadists last week. The missiles landed near the eastern Lebanese town of Brital, but did not cause any casualties or injuries. Lebanon's border with Syria is not officially defined and much of it is porous and unpatrolled, with local residents, smugglers and others moving freely across it. Hezbollah maintains several military posts along the border and its fighters are also battling jihadists and other Syrian opposition fighters in Syria in a bid to bolster President Bashar al-Assad. The conflict in Syria has regularly spilled into Lebanon, and raised tensions between Lebanese Sunnis who largely back the uprising and Shiites who tend to support Assad's regime. Hezbollah's role in the conflict has further stoked tensions, and the group and its strongholds in Lebanon have been targeted in attacks by jihadists on several occasions. The attack against Hezbollah on Sunday was reportedly launched from around the Assal al-Ward region of Syria's Qalamun region. Hezbollah sources and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor reported today that jihadists and rebels had launched several attacks against regime forces in Assal al-Ward in the last two days. 'The situation in the Qalamun mountains is calm now after the failure of all attempts by armed groups,' a Hezbollah source on the group said. The source said a series of attacks against Assal al-Ward and surrounding areas by rebel groups had been repelled by and 'at least 15 (rebel) gunmen killed.' The funerals (pictured) were held in Turkey today after the men were killed in clashes with jihadists. Another 30 Kurds died in suicide attacks on Monday . The three fighters are laid to rest during the service in Suruc, Turkey.

"Jose Mourinho has taken a swipe at Newcastle by claiming they look like they are playing friendlies against other teams compared to when they face Chelsea. The Portuguese has never won at St James’ Park in both his spells in charge at Stamford Bridge and takes his unbeaten side there for Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off. Newcastle have won their last two home matches against Chelsea and Mourinho believes they raise their game when they take on his team.

Nemanja Matic will miss Chelsea's trip to Newcastle after picking up his fifth yellow card against Tottenham . Alan Pardew celebrates a Newcastle goal during his team's 2-0 win against Chelsea last season . ‘When they play against other teams they look like they’re playing friendlies,’ Mourinho insisted. ‘Maybe this is because Chelsea, in the last decade, became a strong team that everybody wants to beat. ‘It’s a difficult stadium to play at. There are a few stadiums in this country where, clearly, when they see the Chelsea shirts, they play the game of their lives. ‘It’s a normal challenge for us, the same as another match. A difficult opponent and stadium, and one of the opponents we really feel that Chelsea is special for them, because they don’t play every game the same way. ‘It’s not only them. There are other clubs who have different ways of playing. Something that, with Chelsea, I try not to do. With my players I try to make them have always the same focus, ambition and commitment whoever they play.

Mourinho's side equaled a club record 23-game unbeaten run with the 3-0 win against Tottenham . ‘But clearly there are some opponents in the Premier League for whom Chelsea are special, so we know this is going to be a tough match.’ Mourinho learnt all about Newcastle from Sir Bobby Robson when the pair were at Barcelona. But he has not let his barren run at St James’ Park turn him off playing against them. ‘Newcastle is a big club,’ he added. ‘I knew that since I worked with Mr Robson. People live for football, for the club, for the moment. They have a match at home, big passion, big club, unbelievable they don’t have a trophy for so many years. But they are a big club and I like very much to play there.’ Mourinho will set a club record of 24 matches unbeaten if his team win or draw on Saturday but he insisted he is not concerned with breaking records. ‘I’m looking for points,’ he explained. ‘And, if possible, at the end of the season, titles. ‘I’m not looking for records. The only thing that matters for me in the Premier League is that I won the title twice.’","Jose Mourinho claims Newcastle raise their game to play against Chelsea .

"Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen will have to wait a few more days yet before discovering their fate with McLaren. A McLaren spokesperson has confirmed the team will not be making any driver selection announcements until next week at the earliest. It means 15-season veteran Button and young Dane Magnussen continue to be left in limbo by McLaren group chief executive Ron Dennis as they wait to discover which one of them will partner Fernando Alonso in 2015. McLaren pair Jenson Button (left) and Kevin Magnussen address the crowds at Edinburgh on Thursday .

Dennis though is calling the shots and is not prepared to be rushed despite the anger being expressed by many fans over how they feel both drivers have been treated. Button expressed his frustration on Thursday. 'I just want to get it done,' he said. 'I want to hear the decision - as we all do - so we can all move on in whatever direction.' The 34-year-old made clear, however, that although his preference is to remain in F1, he has other irons in the fire which he is more than happy with.

'New challenges are exciting, whether it's in Formula One with McLaren alongside an exciting team-mate, or whether it's elsewhere.'

"Angel Di Maria is determined to guide Manchester United back into the Champions League, admitting that he misses playing in Europe's grandest competition. The Argentine superstar helped Real Madrid to European glory this year before moving to United and the Premier League in a £60million deal back in August. With United absent from the Champions League this season for the first time since 1995-96, Di Maria knows they need to finish in the top four to preserve their status as one of the continent's elite clubs. Angel Di Maria has vowed to return Manchester United to the Champions League next season . The Argentine star says he has adapted to everything about life in Manchester - except the cold weather . United sit fourth in the Premier League table at present, good enough for a Champions League spot . 'Yes, I do miss Champions League football,' he said in an interview with Sport magazine. 'We will have to do our best this season so that we qualify for next year's tournament. 'It won't be easy. But some weeks ago we were seventh or eighth in the table, and now we are fourth. So we have to keep on working. 'The thing we aim for the most is qualifying for the Champions League, which is what this club deserves. I also want to win titles, but I am aware that we will have to go step-by-step since the manager and some of the players are new.' It appears Louis van Gaal's methods are slowly taking effect with four consecutive wins carrying United into a Champions League spot ahead of Monday night's trip to Southampton.

Di Maria will miss the match after suffering a small tear in his hamstring in Saturday's 3-0 win over Hull City but this is just a minor setback in a positive start to life at United. The 26-year-old has scored three times in the Premier League and laid on six assists for others. That is undoubtedly Di Maria's main strength - he has contributed 20 league assists in 2014, more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues. But Di Maria still feels he can contribute more to the cause as he settles fully into life at United. 'I must adapt to my team-mates because there are still moments in the game in which I feel I am not fully adapted yet,' he said. Di Maria will miss United's trip to Southampton on Monday after sustaining a hamstring injury against Hull . Di Maria - who is nicknamed 'noodle' - will have to become used to the physical nature of the Premier League . 'The language barrier has also made it a bit harder, but I am trying to overcome that as soon as possible so I can communicate with everyone.' Di Maria was given the nickname 'Fideo' - which translates as 'noodle' - by his former Real team-mate Fernando Gago but despite his wiry frame, he is not fazed by the physical nature of English football. 'It's true, the defenders are big and strong here,' he said. 'But I never have any fear. If they have to hit me, then so be it. That's part of the game. I will always try to play my way, no matter how big the defenders are.' On living in Manchester, he added: 'It's much colder here and it gets dark a lot earlier than in Spain. I have no problem with the food or anything - there is not much difference between what I had in Spain and what I have here. My only problem is with the cold temperature.'","Di Maria has admitted he misses Champions League football .

"UEFA launched its new Nations League this week, promising to shake up the international calendar and replace pointless friendlies with meaningful competition. The inaugural tournament will take place in 2018 and 2019, helpfully filling the gap between the World Cup and European Championship. But what is the Nations League and how will it work? We answer all the key questions for you. England will be one of the 54 UEFA countries to take part in the Nations League, to be launched in 2018 . How has this Nations League come about? UEFA and its members have long wanted to find a way of spicing up those largely meaningless friendlies that fill the international calendar. You only have to look at pictures of a half-empty Wembley for their September friendly with Norway to understand why England and other countries are in favour of introducing more competitive matches that generate more interest and shift tickets. This idea has been on the agenda at UEFA committee meetings since 2011 and, on Thursday, UEFA finally unveiled the finer details of the new Nations League. England line up to play Norway in a September friendly in front of a sparse Wembley crowd . So what's the format? The Nations League will be comprised of four Divisions (A-D). Each of these is then sub-divided into four groups of either three or four teams (numbered 1-4). UEFA's 54 nations will be split between the four divisions, according to their position in the rankings as they stand in November 2017. Division A will include the top-ranked European nations, like Germany, Spain, England, France and Italy. Division D will contain the minnows like San Marino, Luxembourg and Gibraltar. Divisions A and B will consist of four groups of three teams. Division C will comprise two groups of three teams and two groups of four teams. Division D will feature four groups of four teams. The nations in each group then play each other home and away across the double-header international weeks in September, October and November 2018. The format of the UEFA Nations League, which features four Divisions sub-divided into four groups each . World champions Germany will be one of the favourites for the Nations League when it launches . The teams that finish top of the four groups within Division A - the top one - then progress to a Final Four competition to be staged in June 2019. They will play in a knockout format with semi-finals and then a final at neutral venues to determine the UEFA Nations League champions. There is also promotion and relegation between each of the Divisions with four teams moving in each direction for the next running of the competition. How does this affect Euro 2020 qualifying? UEFA claim the new system will make the European Championship qualifying more streamlined. The qualifying tournament will take place as usual but will take less time, being held between March and November 2019. The winners and runners-up from the 10 qualifying groups advance automatically to the finals as is the case now. The remaining four places at the finals will come from Nations League play-offs. Within each of the four divisions, the four group winners will advance into the play-offs, to be played in March 2020. They will then play semi-finals and a final to determine which four nations reach the tournament. If the group winners have already booked their place at Euro 2020, their place will be allocated to the next best ranked team in their particular division. So this is a fall-back for nations who haven't reached Euro 2020 via the usual qualifying route. A graphic showing how the Nations League fits into the Euro 2020 qualifying tournament . The Nations League should ensure more exciting matches for England fans at Wembley . What are the advantages? The main beneficiaries of the change will be Europe's smaller nations. Those minnows placed in Division D will have an equal chance to reach Euro 2020 because of the play-off system, which is designed so they're drawn against a nation of similar ability rather than a big gun. For the fans, it means a big increase in the amount of competitive football on offer and more attractive fixtures to go and watch. Won't it mean a more crowded calendar? No, it shouldn't do. The international weeks will remain at roughly the same time of year as they are now. UEFA even say the demands on players will be less because the games will all be in Europe, meaning shorter flight times. Is this the end of friendly matches? No, there will still be room in the calendar for friendly games against nations from outside of Europe. The new competition offers hope that minnows like Gibraltar can qualify for the European Championships . Talk me through this then... Ok, let's take England. Now as one of Europe's foremost nations, they will be drawn in Division A with the other top-ranked countries. Let's say they're drawn with Holland and Russia in one of the three-team groups. So between September and November 2018, England will play both of them home and away, meaning four matches in total. England beat Holland and Russia at Wembley and draw both their away matches, meaning they finish in first place. This means they advance to the Nations League Final four and have a semi-final with, say, Germany in June 2019. It will be held at a neutral venue determined by UEFA. If they win, they'll make the final, again on neutral territory. Lose, and they're out. At the same time, England will be playing through their Euro 2020 qualifying group as is the case now. This will take place between March and November 2019. UEFA President Michel Platini has decided Euro 2020 will be staged right across Europe . If England finish first or second, they qualify for Euro 2020 automatically. But say they have a bit of a disaster and only finish third in their group. Their performance in the Nations League could save them. Because they beat Holland and Russia to finish first, they'll advance to the play-offs in March 2020. There, they will face the next highest-ranked nation who have not already secured their place at Euro 2020 in a play-off semi-final. Win that and then the final and they will sneak into Euro 2020 as one of four teams who have qualified through the Nations League play-off route.","UEFA announced plans for its new Nations League this week .

"Manchester United are preparing to spend another £150million next summer to complete Louis van Gaal's revolution at Old Trafford. The club have already splashed out £216.4m on additions to their squad since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in the summer of 2013. And their Dutch manager will be handed another war chest in the New Year, with potential 'Gaal-actico' recruits including Roma's Kevin Strootman, Atletico Madrid defender Diego Godin, Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels, Barcelona's Dani Alves and Arjen Robben of Bayern Munich. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: Manchester United will always have to pay more . Louis van Gaal has his sights on another crop of expensive signings in the January transfer window . Roma's Kevin Strootman is among United's top targets for the January transfer window . Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels is another player wanted by Van Gaal as he tries to strengthen . Van Gaal also plans to clear the decks by selling fringe members of his squad including the likes of Javier Hernandez, Wilfried Zaha, Tom Cleverley, Nani and Nick Powell, who are currently out on loan. Players out of contract in the next year of two - including Darren Fletcher, Robin van Persie, Ashley Young, Rafael Da Silva, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones - could also be culled. We take a look at United's expensive acquisitions since Ferguson retired and assess how they have performed. Marouane Fellaini (Everton, September 2013, £27.5m) When David Moyes arrived as Ferguson's successor in the summer of 2013, he wanted to make a statement in the transfer market. Unfortunately, the eleventh-hour signing of Marouane Fellaini from his old club Everton was pretty underwhelming for United fans given the top names they were linked to. The mop-haired Belgian struggled and became a convenient scapegoat for the United fans as the club slumped to a seventh-place finish in the Premier League and bombed out of the cups. Fellaini has shown signs of returning to his old combative self since Van Gaal arrived, with his all-action performance in the draw with Chelsea the most impressive so far. Marouane Fellaini is finally starting to show some form at United after struggling in his first season . Juan Mata (Chelsea, January 2014, £37.1m) With United struggling to stand the pace in the Premier League title race, Moyes splashed out £37m to bring in Mata in the January window. The Spaniard quickly made a positive impression with his incisive passing and intelligent movement and he scored six goals. Since Van Gaal's arrival, Mata has been in and out of the starting line-up, but has impressed when he's been involved. He has scored in matches against Sunderland, Queens Park Rangers, Crystal Palace and Stoke City, suggesting he has an important role to play in the side. Juan Mata has been consistently excellent for United since joining from Chelsea last January . Ander Herrera (Athletic Bilbao, June 2014, £29m) Knowing they had to recover lost ground and qualify again for the Champions League, United wasted little time in strengthening their squad in the summer. The signing of Herrera, who had been strongly linked with the club 12 months earlier, was completed for £29m prior to the World Cup. The Spanish midfielder has shown his class in spells so far this season, either side of a fractured rib that forced him out of a few games, and he was particularly influential against Stoke this week. United paid Athletic Bilbao just under £30m for Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera . Luke Shaw (Southampton, June 2014, £27m) United were very keen to buy Southampton left back Shaw and paid a pretty penny to bring the teenager to Manchester. His start to life at Old Trafford wasn't the best, suffering a hamstring injury which ruled him out of the first three Premier League matches of the campaign. And he struggled a little to get up to the pace of United's play initially but has in some matches started to demonstrate the class and capability that has him earmarked as a potentially world class talent. Unfortunately, his momentum has again been stalled by an ankle ligament injury suffered against Arsenal that will keep him out for up to six weeks. Luke Shaw has struggled with injuries since his arrival from Southampton in the summer . Marcos Rojo (Sporting Lisbon, August 2014, £16m) Knowing United were in desperate need of some steel at the back, Van Gaal brought in Argentina's versatile defender Rojo from Sporting Lisbon late in the transfer window. At first, he looked to be a bit of a liability, struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the Premier League. The same could be said of United's defence as a whole in certain games. Rojo dislocated his shoulder in the Manchester derby but returned after missing two games and United are slowly starting to look more composed at the back. It's undeniable that United are still in need of an experienced centre half to replace Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, who both left in the summer, in the long-term. Marcos Rojo was brought in from Sporting Lisbon to provide more steel in United's defence . Angel di Maria (Real Madrid, August 2014, £60m) The marquee signing of United's summer, prizing Di Maria away from European champions Real Madrid represented a real coup - though they had to pay a British record £60m to get him. The Argentine has adapted superbly to the demands of the Premier League, contributing three goals and six assists in his 11 appearances to date. Some of the trickery and passing produced by Di Maria has been mesmerising and it's easy to see why Cristiano Ronaldo was so upset when he learned he was leaving Real. Di Maria looks like being a mainstay at Old Trafford for many years to come and is integral to their recovery. Angel Di Maria has looked impressive since his British record signing from Real Madrid in the summer . Daley Blind (Ajax, September 2014, £13.8m) Having worked with Blind during his time as Holland manager, Van Gaal was eager to sign him after arriving at Old Trafford. Far more than a defensive midfielder, Blind offers not only protection for the back line but also plenty of gas going forward. But just as he was starting to find his feet, Blind fell victim to United's injury curse. He damaged knee ligaments in Holland's Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia and will be out for a few weeks yet. Daley Blind celebrates his goal in United's 2-2 draw at West Brom back in October . Radamel Falcao (Monaco, September 2014, £6m loan fee) The most unexpected signing of United's summer, Falcao arrived on a season-long loan from Monaco on transfer deadline day after they had seen off interest from Man City. United, who paid a £6m loan fee, have the option to sign permanently for another £43.5m at the end of the season. However, this is now in doubt as United have serious concerns about Falcao's fitness - he had just returned from a long lay-off with knee problems - and form (he has scored just once since joining). Radamel Falcao has scored just once for United since joining on loan from Monaco on deadline day .","Manchester United will spend another £150m on signing in summer .

Excerpts from recorded conversations between 37-year-old David Robert, Pierre-Cedric Bonin, 32, and Marc Dubois, the 58-year-old captain of the plane, reveal that two of them were asleep when the plane got into difficulty in a tropical storm. Referring to Bonin, a 'Company Baby' on the Rio de Janeiro-Paris flight, the piece reads: 'With most of the weather still lying ahead and an anxious junior pilot at the controls, Dubois decided it was time to get some sleep.' Chief investigator Alain Bouillard is quoted as saying: 'If the captain had stayed in position through the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone, it would have delayed his sleep by no more than 15 minutes, and because of his experience, maybe the story would have ended differently. 'But I do not believe it was fatigue that caused him to leave. It was more like customary behavior, part of the piloting culture within Air France. 'And his leaving was not against the rules. Still, it is surprising. If you are responsible for the outcome, you do not go on vacation during the main event.' The Airbus 330 crashed after suffering a loss of lift - or a 'stall'. But instead of lowering the plane's nose to deal with the stall, as they should have done according to normal procedures, the pilots raised it (stock image) Victims: Irish doctors Jane Deasy (left) and  Aisling Butler (right) were among the 228 victims on board the doomed flight . Michael and Anne Harris (both pictured) were the two Americans among the 228 victims who died in the plane . Briton Graham Gardner (seen right at a weddnig) was also killed when their plane went down shortly after taking off from Rio de Janeiro . Up until now it was known that Dubois was sleeping off a night in Rio with his girlfriend, an off-duty hostess and opera singer who was on the doomed flight. 'I didn't sleep enough last night. One hour - it's not enough,' said Dubois, before he went to sleep. Referring to 'the flight-rest compartment, a small cabin containing two berths just behind the cockpit', the piece describes how Robert was also 'dozing there'. The article continues: 'On the night of May 31, 2009, the pilots of Flight 447 certainly did not serve their passengers well.' The plane was suffering from a loss of lift - or a 'stall' - and its airspeed sensors had malfunctioned. But instead of lowering the plane's nose to deal with the stall, as they should have done according to normal procedures, they raised it. Dubois finally entered the cockpit 1 minute and 38 seconds after the pitot tubes malfunctioned, but by that time panic was setting in. Anguish: Relatives and friends arrive at Tom Jobim airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 01 June 2009, to receive information about the crash . Long search: It took two years to retrieve bodies from the bottom of the sea, along with essential records such as the flight's voice recorder . Robert said: 'F***, we're going to crash! It's not true! But what's happening?' Soon after, either Robert or Bonin are heard to say: 'F***, we're dead' before - 4 hours and 15 minutes into the flight - it crashes into the Atlantic. It took two years to retrieve bodies from the bottom of the sea, along with essential records such as the flight's voice recorder. Air France has denied that its pilots were incompetent, but has since improved training, concentrating on how to fly a plane manually when there is a stall. Both Air France and Airbus are facing manslaughter charges, with a judicial investigation led by Paris judges under way.","Air France 447 crashed into Atlantic on May 31 2009 killing all 288 people .

"He had it all to lose: Jose Mourinho put his reputation and popularity at Chelsea on the line ahead of his second coming, as three words prayed on his mind: never go back. Mourinho could have looked through the history and run a mile when Chelsea made their move again. He would have seen plenty of examples, flashing like warning lights, of managers who fell way short when returning with ambition of recapturing former glories. No matter how much you think it will be as it was before, things never go to plan. I first realised that when I was a 12-year-old staunch Evertonian and Howard Kendall returned to Goodison Park in 1990. Howard Kendall struggled on his return to Everton, pictured in a 4-0 defeat at Arsenal in 1998 during his third stint, and a 4-1 loss to Crystal Palace (right) at Wembley . As far as I was concerned, Kendall had the Midas touch. He and Everton were the perfect match. I was adamant those days out at Wembley and the trophies of his first reign would be on the agenda once more. What could go wrong? Plenty, as it turned out. His second spell fell way short of expectations, while his third, in 1997-98, saw Everton avoid relegation on the final day of the season. He never got near another trophy. I played under Kenny Dalglish when he had his second attempt at managing Liverpool. He was unfortunate to lose his job, particularly after we won the League Cup and reached the FA Cup final in 2012, but the difficulties we experienced in the Barclays Premier League put things in context. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher pictured with Kenny Dalglish after Liverpool's FA Cup final loss . Dalglish was eventually replaced by former Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers at the end of the 2012 season . Many supporters looked at Kenny standing in the dugout and expected to see his team play breath-taking football as Liverpool did in 1987-88. Time moves on and it could never have been as good as it had been before. We finished eighth. Kenny’s situation, though, was not unique. Take Fabio Capello. An architect of the great AC Milan side that ruled in the early 1990s, where his successes included an astonishing 4-0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final, he returned to the San Siro in 1997. His impact was minimal. Milan lost the Italian Cup final, finished 10th in Serie A and Capello called it the 'worst mistake he had ever made'. Similarly, Louis van Gaal’s return to Barcelona in 2002-03 was awful. He was sacked within five months with the club languishing in 12th place. Fabio Capello and Marcel Desailly celebrate after AC Milan won their fifth European Cup in some style . Newcastle supporters championed for the return of Kevin Keegan in 2008 after his successful first stint . But Keegan resigned in September 2008 after just eight months back in charge of the club . Louis van Gaal's return to Barcelona in 2002 was a disaster and he was sacked after only five months . The romance, the adulation and memories are a powerful mix. Kevin Keegan hoped he would rekindle it with Newcastle in 2008, Rafa Benitez has wanted to go back to Liverpool ever since he left in 2010. Emotion makes you think there will be no difference second time around. Reality, however, tells you something different. So while Chelsea appointed the biggest managerial name in the world, there was no guarantee that there would be a sudden transformation in their fortunes. So what Mourinho has done over the last 18 months is shining example of why he is a serial winner, a demonstration of his talent. Chelsea, it needs pointing out, hadn’t been in a title race since they won it under Carlo Ancelotti in 2010, finishing second, nine points adrift (10-11), sixth (11-12) and third (12-13). The championship had become the city of Manchester’s property, with Liverpool getting closer than anybody to wrestling it away. The main action at the end of the campaign had been going on without Chelsea. Jose Mourinho appeared in high spirits during his pre-match Chelsea press conference on Friday . Chelsea are unbeaten in all competitions this season and their last defeat came back in April . We won’t be saying that next May. Manchester City are the only ones who can halt Mourinho’s juggernaut. He went into the season knowing his job would be on the line if he failed to win anything but no other manager can deliver so impressively under such pressure. Mourinho, of course, has a luxury that some managers don’t. Chelsea are a wealthy club and have the capacity to pay big fees and wages. That was also the case in 2004. But English football has changed in the last decade and Chelsea no longer have the transfer market all their own way. Their position at the top of the table, however, is not based purely on a chequebook, as the net spends since Mourinho returned of United (£179.9million), City (£113.8m), Arsenal (£86.3m) and Liverpool (£64.4m) show. Chelsea’s net spend in the last three windows, for contrast, is £65.4m. True, he won’t baulk at paying a big transfer fee but, whenever he does, Mourinho gets it right. Look at Cesc Fabregas, who has fitted in with ease. Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho calls 'a giant', is another, as is Diego Costa. With Costa last season, Chelsea would have been champions. Cesc Fabregas, in action against Spurs in Chelsea's 3-0 win on Wednesday, has been a revelation this term . Nemanja Matic was brought back in January and Diego Costa a summer arrival from Atletico Madrid . Part of Mourinho’s magic is the ability to get more out of players who are already at the club when he arrives. John Terry, Frank Lampard and Eidur Gudjohnson were the first examples, Cesar Azpilicueta and Eden Hazard providing the evidence this time. He also has them playing a completely different brand. Who would have expected Mourinho to include players like Hazard, Fabregas and Oscar in the same team? Chelsea are still physically strong but now they move the ball with style and at speed. What makes this transition even more impressive is that he has been able phase out key figures such as Petr Cech, Lampard and Ashley Cole, with minimal fuss and no disruption to results. It has been so seamless, it is like he has never been away. Mourinho has constructed a complete team, one that could go through the season unbeaten, and his influence means they are the only English club with a chance of winning the Champions League this year. Given his record in the heavyweight games, it would be a brave man to bet against him. Top players find fast track to dugout . It was interesting to see Arsene Wenger make the statement that Thierry Henry will certainly return to Arsenal to work in the future. Brendan Rodgers also said something similar about Steven Gerrard having a role on the coaching staff at Liverpool one day and it left me thinking: is this the only way to keep top players in the game once their playing careers are over? It looks like that is now the reality. In the past, there would have been an apprenticeship to serve when you started out as a coach. You would work your way up through the lower leagues, as Alex Ferguson did. Now what Wenger and Rodgers are suggesting seems a great way to learn, rather than dropping down. Thierry Henry has been touted for another return to Arsenal on the coaching staff . After spending his entire playing career with Liverpool, will Steven Gerrard continue as a coach? I am not being elitist saying that. I used to wonder how I would cope if I started out managing at a lower-league club that I knew nothing about. Who would you buy? Would you have an assistant who knew that level of the game? How long would you get in the job? That is why this assistant role will be attractive to Henry and Gerrard, as it has been for Ryan Giggs. They would have chance to learn away from the firing line, dealing with good players at a club they know and have instant respect. But once in the role — or when thinking about the offer — there is a big question, as Wenger highlighted: Are you prepared to sacrifice your life for the job? The truth is that the wealth in the game means players are not being forced into roles after playing. They can pick and choose. This week I'm looking forward to: Watching Jagielka and Distin try to stop super Sergio . There is no harder task for a defender in the Barclays Premier League at present than trying to shackle Sergio Aguero. He is in a run of form like the one Luis Suarez enjoyed last season and he looks like scoring every time he steps on the pitch, so Everton’s defenders will have their work cut out trying to contain the striker of the moment. Sylvain Distin (centre) looks bemused after Everton concede a costly goal against Hull at Goodison . Sergio Aguero (right) wheels away after scoring against Sunderland during his virtuoso outing on Wearside . Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin have been stalwarts at Goodison Park and shared an excellent partnership for more than five years but, this season, Everton have been conceding more goals than normal and their performances have come under scrutiny. The best Everton performances in recent times have come on the back of them being difficult to break down and if Roberto Martinez’s side are going to leave the Etihad Stadium with a positive result, then Jagielka and Distin will have to be back to their old selves.","It needs pointing out that Chelsea have not been in a title race since 2010 .
As in 2004, Chelsea have the luxury of wealth, but English football has changed and they no longer have the transfer market all their own way .
And whenever Mourinho gets the chequebook out he gets it right... just look at the signings of Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa .

"RAF officers flew spying missions over the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, it was revealed yesterday. After decades of secrecy, the CIA declassified documents that show British pilots were involved in the U-2 flights in 1959 and 1960. They gathered vital intelligence which the head of the American agency said he regarded as worth ‘a million dollars’. Classified: A U-2 plane successor to those flown in the Cold War . Until now the Ministry of Defence has neither confirmed nor denied the participation of the RAF in the controversial missions, a position it will no longer be able to maintain. The first U-2 flights over the Soviet Union started in July 1956, but despite the valuable information gathered, President Dwight Eisenhower was concerned about the ramifications of such a flagrant breach of Russian air space if they were discovered. Unfortunately for the Americans, even though the hi-tech  U-2s flew at more than 70,000ft, the Russians were able to track  the planes. Shot down: Pilot Gary Powers was captured in 1960 in the Soviet Union . The Soviets sent a strongly-worded protest to Eisenhower, who developed cold feet about the missions and suspended such flights in December 1956. However, the CIA was very keen for the spying missions to continue and looked for ways, in the words of the newly released document, ‘to increase the possibility of plausible denial’. The solution was to use British pilots for the sensitive missions. During the spring of 1957, negotiations took place between the CIA and the chief of MI6, Sir Dick White, who saw the obvious intelligence benefits for Britain. By the summer of 1958, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had given his authorisation, and four RAF officers, Squadron Leader Christopher Walker and Flight Lieutenants Michael Bradley, John MacArthur and David Dowling – all of whom were in their twenties and single – were sent to train in Texas. But flying the U-2s was not without risk, and on July 8, 1958, Walker was killed when his plane crashed. The cause was never definitively established, but it is thought the aircraft disintegrated at high altitude. He was immediately replaced by Wing Commander Robert ‘Robbie’ Robinson. By January 1959 all four men had finished their training and were sent to a secret air base in Turkey, from where they would launch their flights over the Soviet Union and the Middle East. In order to emphasise American denials of the operation, the U-2 planes were formally transferred on paper to the British government. Eisenhower wrote a top-secret letter to Macmillan stating: ‘British missions are carried out on your authority and are your responsibility.’ And the flights remained a secret in Britain, too. The pilots were no longer paid by the RAF, but by MI6, and the public was told the men were engaging  in ‘high-altitude weather-sampling missions’. The first mission was flown by Robbie Robinson on December 6, 1959, over the Kapustin Yar missile test range and a squadron of long-range bombers in the Ukraine. Sensitive missions: Until now the Ministry of Defence has neither confirmed nor denied the participation of the RAF . It was a huge success and proved the Soviets did not have as many bombers as they claimed – a vital piece of intelligence at the height of the Cold War. The head of the CIA called Robinson’s bomber picture ‘a million-dollar photo’. The second British U-2 mission over the Soviet Union was flown by John MacArthur the following month. Although his brief was to look for missile sites around the Aral Sea, he ended up uncovering a new type of Soviet bomber called the Tupolev Tu-22 at Kazan. The Americans later resumed their involvement in the U-2  missions, but this came to an abrupt end in the wake of the Soviets shooting down and imprisoning US pilot Gary Powers in May 1960. The British ordered the RAF officers to leave Turkey immediately. The following year, all four British pilots received the Air Force Cross, although their citations in the London Gazette did not mention exactly why. Only now, after more than 50 years, has the truth been revealed.","British pilots were involved in the U-2 flights in 1959 and 1960 .
They were used in sensitive missions after an agreement between the CIA and the head of MI6, who saw intelligence benefits for Britain ."
"Islamic State (ISIS) group extremists have lined up and shot dead at least 50 tribesmen, women and children in Iraq's Anbar province, officials said, in the latest mass killing committed by the group. The attack was the latest against an Anbar Sunni tribe and took place in the village of Ras al-Maa, north of Ramadi. There, the militant group killed at least 40 men, six women and four children, lining them up and publicly killing them one by one, Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud, a senior figure in the targeted Al Bu Nimr tribe, said. Another 17 people were kidnapped by the militant group, he added. Scroll down for video . Militants from the Islamic State (pictured) have killed at least 40 men, six women and four children, lining them up and publicly killing them one by one in the Iraqi village of Ras al-Maa . An official with the Anbar governor's office corroborated the account. It is estimated that more than 300 members of the tribe have now been executed by ISIS in recent days. The militant group killed another 50 members of the Al Bu Nimr tribe late on Friday, and at least 48 people on Thursday, according to various officials. The militant Islamist group has overrun a large part of Anbar province in its push to expand its territory across Iraq and Syria. Officials with the Iraqi government, as well as officials with the US-led coalition targeting the extremists, repeatedly have said that Iraqi tribes are key elements in the fight against the IS group since they are able to penetrate areas inaccessible to air strikes and ground forces. Massacre: Young men use mobile phones to take pictures of the dead bodies inside Hit . Pictured are the bodies of 30 men from the Anbar province, west of Baghdad, who were executed on Thursday . A number of Iraq's Sunni tribes have been fundamental in stalling IS's advance, taking up arms and fighting alongside Iraqi security forces. But other tribes have not been won over, and have allied themselves with the militant group as a means for contesting the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. The United Nations mission in Baghdad said Saturday that at least 1,273 Iraqis were killed in violence in October, a slight increase compared to last month amid the Islamic State group's assault. Clash: Free Syrian Army fighters run during clashes with forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad at the Karam Barre frontline beside Al-Maysar neighbourhood of Aleppo today . Meanwhile, the United Nations mission in Baghdad said that at least 1,273 Iraqis were killed in violence in October a slight increase compared to last month amid the Islamic State group's assault. However, the figures do not take into account casualties in Anbar province or some other militant-held parts of Iraq. The UN report said violence killed 856 civilians and 417 members of Iraq's security forces, while attacks wounded 2,010 Iraqis. The worst-hit city was Baghdad, with 379 civilians killed. The UN has said September's death toll was 1,119 Iraqis killed.","The victims were Sunni tribesmen in village of Ras al-Maa .
