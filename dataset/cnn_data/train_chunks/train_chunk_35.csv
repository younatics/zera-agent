"(CNN) --   The World Health Organization announced Tuesday it is still considering increasing its pandemic alert level to phase 6 because of growing worldwide cases of the H1N1 virus, or swine flu. WHO considers raising the pandemic alert level to 6 as cases of H1N1 increase worldwide. ""Globally, we are at phase 5, but we are nearing phase 6,"" said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, WHO's Assistant Director General. ""As this continues to spread internationally, some countries are moving from isolated to sustained community spread."" Phase 6 is a declaration that many member countries have long feared could mean economic disaster. It is the highest on the WHO's pandemic alert system, and is described by the organization as a global pandemic. Fukuda was quick to remind journalists that the designation does not reflect the severity of the disease, but how widespread it is. ""Our overall assessment of severity is moderate,"" he said, ""because although the overall number of serious and fatal cases is relatively limited ... we really don't have a full handle on the number of people with serious illness."" Fukuda said nearly 19,000 cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported in 64 countries, resulting in 117 deaths.","World Health Organization considers increasing pandemic alert level to phase 6 .

"(CNN) -- A sharp increase in the number of reported cases of the H1N1 virus in Australia may prompt the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the first global pandemic in over forty years. Australian rugby league star Karmichael Hunt is one of several players being tested for the H1N1 virus. The number of Australian cases of the virus, commonly known as swine flu, has reached more than 1,200, with state and federal medical officers set to hold an emergency meeting in Sydney to review the country's swine flu protection measures. ""We will take each decision along the way in response to the expert medical advice,"" Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). On Wednesday it was announced that the entire Brisbane Broncos rugby league squad had been placed into quarantine after one of their players was suspected of having the virus. The Queensland club confirmed on its Web site that full-back Karmichael Hunt was being tested for the virus, while the sport's governing body, the National Rugby League (NRL), said Hunt had tested positive for the common flu, influenza A. With over 26,000 H1N1 cases worldwide, the WHO could move to Phase 6, the highest on its pandemic alert system. ""It's really a matter of making sure that countries are prepared as possible. We do not want people to overly panic,"" Keiji Fukuda, WHO's Assistant Director General, told ABC. In a statement a day earlier, Fukuda said the WHO had been working extremely hard preparing countries for what a potential move to a global pandemic would entail. ""I want to point out that by going to Phase 6 the activity has become established in at least two regions of the world,"" he said. ""It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased and that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than they are right now.""","Australian cases of the H1N1 virus reach more than 1,200 .

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- The son of a Philippines provincial governor is voluntarily turning himself in for questioning in the massacre of at least 57 unarmed civilians, a CNN affiliate reported Thursday. Andal Ampatuan Jr. -- who is the mayor of Datu Unsay and the son of Maguindanao Governor Andal Ampatuan -- has agreed to face questioning, reported Patricia Evangelista of ABS-CBN. Ampatuan was not identified by authorities as a suspect in the killings in the southern Philippines, though victims' survivors and local media reports had done so. Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ""is enraged by these barbaric acts,"" spokesman Cerge Remonde said. ""She has literally thrown the full force of the law and has mobilized the security and police forces of the state to go after the perpetrators."" Philippines authorities had disbanded a paramilitary force in the southern Philippines suspected of playing a role in the massacre, the country's state-run media reported Wednesday. Remonde said the deaths were the result of a political clan war, not Muslim secessionism in that troubled region of the country. ""So far as this case is concerned, this is a limited clan political rivalry, which has been going on for some time now,"" Remonde said. The death toll grew Wednesday after 11 more bodies were recovered from a rural area of Mindanao and buried. Arroyo has declared Wednesday a national day of mourning. Arroyo's government is under intense pressure to find those responsible for planning and carrying out the abduction and killing of the group of about 60 politicians, lawyers and journalists -- and reportedly some bystanders. Suspicion has fallen on the Ampatuan family, key allies of the Arroyo administration in the Maguindanao region of the southern Mindanao province. Ampatuan family members have not commented on the slaying allegations. Remonde appeared to blame the Ampatuan clan, adding: ""There is, however, a move now by the administration party to expel the suspected clan."" Those killed include the wife and two sisters of a local politician who plans to run for the spot vacated next year by Maguindanao's governor, Andal Ampatuan. While the investigation is ongoing, a spokesman for the country's national police has said that Andal Ampatuan Jr. has been linked to the crime, according to local media reports. ""According to the initial reports, those who were abducted and murdered at Saniag were initially stopped by a group led by the mayor of Datu Unsay,"" National Police spokesman Chief Superintendent Leonardo Espina said, according to ABS-CBN News. The massacre is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippines history. On Monday morning, in daylight, a group of about 100 gunmen stopped a convoy carrying supporters and family members of local politician Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, witnesses and officials say. Mangudadatu had sent his wife and sisters to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao in May after he had been threatened and told not to file the papers himself. He said the threats came from allies of Governor Ampatuan. The number of people kidnapped and killed was still unclear, as recovery continued at the mass grave site in Maguindanao. A car traveling behind the convoy was mistaken for being a part of the politician's contingent, a local official told the Philippines GMA News Network. The car was instead heading to a hospital, according to Tom Robles, head of the Tacurong City Employees Union, who spoke to GMA News. The driver and four passengers -- including a government employee who had suffered a mild stroke and his wife -- were rounded up and killed along with the members of the convoy ahead of them, Robles said. A police official confirmed that the car and the bodies of three of the passengers were among those recovered at the grave site, GMA reported. The state-run Philippines News Agency said the ruling Lakas-Kampi-CMD (Christian, Muslim, Democrats) was to meet Wednesday to discuss whether to remove the Ampatuan clan members in Mindanao from the party as a result of the killings. ""In our opinion, they were not able to fulfill their obligations to the party,"" said former Defense Secretary Gilberto ""Gibo"" Teodoro, Lakas-Kampi-CMD national president and the party's standard bearer in the 2010 elections, in a radio interview, according to PNA. Ampatuans hold leadership positions in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, including governor of the region, governor of Maguindanao and mayor of Datu Unsay. ""Like many others, I am appalled and outraged by it, and I join the rising chorus of indignation against it,"" Arroyo said. ""This is not a simple election feud between opposing clans; this is a supreme act of inhumanity that is a blight on our nation. The perpetrators will not escape justice. The law will haunt them until they are caught.""","NEW: Authorities did not identify Ampatuan as a suspect .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tables set in apple green, ruby and gold with arrangements of roses, hydrangeas and sweet peas awaited guests to Tuesday's White House state dinner. The place settings in fine china from three previous administrations -- Eisenhower, Clinton and George W. Bush -- are flanked by crystal glasses and five pieces of silverware. Place cards are handwritten, including two that read ""The President"" and ""Mrs. Obama."" The first state dinner of Barack Obama's presidency, in honor of visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, will take place in a tent set up on the White House South Lawn, with a view of the Washington Monument. Guests will sit at round tables for 10, with the floral arrangements intended to pay homage to the state bird of India, the Indian peacock, and the dinner featuring a seasonal menu reflecting American and Indian flavors, according to the White House. The first course will be a potato and eggplant salad made with White House-grown arugula and accompanied by an onion-seed vinaigrette. Red lentil soup with fresh cheese follows, and then a choice of entrees: roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, chickpeas and okra for vegetarians, or green curry prawns and caramelized salsify with smoked collard greens. Dessert will be pumpkin pie tart or pear tatin with whipped cream and caramel sauce. Each course is paired with its own wine, all of American vintage. Michelle Obama worked with guest chef Marcus Samuelsson and White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford to ""create a menu that reflects the best of American cuisine, continues this White House's commitment to serving fresh, sustainable and regional food, and honors the culinary excellence and flavors that are present in Indian cuisine,"" the White House said. The herbs and lettuces were harvested from the White House Kitchen Garden started by the first lady, and honey from the White House beehive is being used to poach the dessert pears.","Dinner in honor of Indian premier will take place on White House South Lawn .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- The high school honor student and the NFL's highest-paid defensive back stroll down the destitute streets of Skid Row. ""I can sell you something right quick,"" a drug dealer hisses. Another shouts, ""Gonna whoop your ass!"" More expletives are hurled. Seventeen-year-old Kenneth Chancey is giving a tour to Nnamdi Asomugha, showing the NFL star the streets that he and his sister used to walk to get to school while living in a Skid Row homeless shelter. Prostitutes, addicts and drug dealers scatter. ""Camera! Camera!"" they shout. The two make it safely past the park, one of the roughest areas of Los Angeles. An orange soda whizzes through the air, nearly hitting the teen and the Oakland Raiders' All-Pro cornerback worth $45 million. ""Wow,"" the teen says. ""I'm sure they watch you every Sunday, and they don't even recognize who you are."" It is Kenneth's inner strength and his love for education that have brought together this high school class president and NFL star. ""The thing I took away is how fearless he is,"" Asomugha said later. ""The things he's been through are so big and so severe -- they were threatening our lives and throwing things at us on Skid Row. But it doesn't bother him. ""His potential meter is at 1,000 right now."" Escaping through education . Even while Kenneth lived on Skid Row, he dreamed of attending Harvard to become a neurosurgeon. When Asomugha saw Kenneth's story on CNN, he wanted to help. He runs a foundation, the Asomugha College Tour for Scholars, that takes talented inner-city kids on tours of college campuses they otherwise would never be able to see. He's helped get 25 teens into college over the last four years. On this day, he's come to tell Kenneth that he will be among the 16 students traveling in the spring to visit schools in Washington, D.C. ""I'm thankful to be able to give back,"" Asomugha said. Hours before the Skid Row tour, Asomugha traveled to Hollywood's Helen Bernstein High School, where Kenneth is a starting running back in his senior year. They met at the school's football stadium, where Asomugha told Kenneth in person. ""This smile on my face,"" Kenneth said, ""is a freaking good thing. This is awesome!"" Asomugha leaned closer. ""You know who we're working on now?"" ""Obama?"" Kenneth asked nervously. ""We have to,"" the NFL star replied. Kenneth's fever-pitched excitement reached a crescendo, ""Oh my gosh!"" His father, Gordon Costello, joined in and handed a folded paper to Asomugha. The proud dad didn't show off football awards or his son's athletic achievements. Instead, it's Kenneth's latest report card, straight A's. ""He might overqualify for the tour,"" Asomugha said as he studied the report card. ""This shows someone with a lot of drive and ambition. These are some great grades."" ""I'm at a loss for words,"" the teen said. ""Stuff like this doesn't happen every day."" Asomugha came from a family where education was stressed from day one. He remembers asking his mom as a boy, ""Can I have some ice cream?"" ""No,"" she responded. ""You haven't finished your homework."" ""I'd say, 'but I'm 3!' "" Asomugha's sister is a pediatrician, his mother holds a doctorate. Two other siblings have secondary degrees. ""I am the least educated in my family,"" Asomugha said. ""I catch a lot of heat from my family."" The football star, who is the highest-paid defensive back in NFL history, has a degree in finance from the University of California-Berkeley. Kenneth is energized. ""I'm going to be the first one in my family to get a secondary education,"" he told Asomugha. ""And everyone will follow you,"" his father added. Kenneth spent his sixth-grade year living in a van with his mother and stepfather. His sister once was beaten up by someone who wanted her shirt. Kenneth was held up at gunpoint for his laptop. He refused to hand it over because his grandmother bought it for him. ""If you're going to shoot me, shoot me now,"" he told the would-be thief. ""He said, 'I ain't gonna kill no little kid.' "" Mantra: Always keep your head up . From February to August of this year, Kenneth lived at the Union Rescue Mission homeless shelter along Skid Row with his father and sister. After the CNN piece aired, his friend invited him and his sister, Stephanie, to stay with his family, while Kenneth's father looked for work. Outside Kenneth's earshot, the NFL star talked about how the teen is an inspiration, doing all the right things to achieve greatness in life. ""You don't hear about guys like Kenneth,"" Asomugha said. ""When you have your back against the wall and you're trying to fight and there are so many things -- so many obstacles -- against you but you're still keeping your head above the water like he's doing ... the sky's the limit."" Kenneth says he constantly thought about dropping out to get a job to help his father financially. His dad would have none of it. ""Your education will pay off in the long run,"" his father always told him. On the tour at Skid Row, Kenneth took Asomugha to the shelter's rooftop. It's a million-dollar view of the Los Angeles skyline. It's where Kenneth studied. It's also where he learned his biggest lesson: to always keep his head up. The student and the football player leaned over the building's ledge. Down below, drug deals were being made. ""Anytime you look down over the ledge, you start to see the negative,"" Asomugha said. ""When you keep your head up, you're seeing all the positive. Was that your mantra?"" The teen smiled. ""That's how you do it in life,"" Kenneth said. ""I just try to keep my head up, to look into the future."" Five years from now, he'll be graduating from college. The hell of Skid Row will be a distant memory. ""Once I succeed,"" he said, ""I will be able to help other people.""

"(CNN)  -- Six-year-old Makayla Sitton didn't get to act in The Nutcracker Ballet. The night before she was to go on stage, she was shot to death with three others in a home in Jupiter, Florida. ""I do not know how we're ever going to recover from this, but we know where she is. She is in heaven,"" her father, Jim Sitton, told CNN affiliate WPTV-TV of West Palm Beach, Florida. ""God has blessed us with this beautiful girl, and he just took her home a little bit earlier than we wanted,"" he said, struggling to hold back tears. Police were searching Friday for a suspect in the deaths of Makayla and three others: twins Carla Merhige and Lisa Knight, 33, and Raymonde Joseph, 76, police said. Patrick Knight and Clifford Gebara were wounded in the shooting, police said. Officers were looking for Paul Michael Merhige, 35, who is thought to have left the area armed, said Jupiter police Sgt. Scott Pascarella. The dead were Merhige's twin sisters, his aunt and 6-year-old cousin. Interviews with family members suggest that Merhige ""had ongoing resentment"" for some of his relatives, said Sally Collins-Ortiz, a spokeswoman for Jupiter police. One of the victims -- Knight -- was pregnant, Collins-Ortiz said Friday. The U.S. Marshals have joined the search for Merhige, she said. The shooting occurred about 10 p.m. ET Thursday. Pascarella said he did not know the motive. Merhige is thought to have driven away in a blue 2007 Toyota Camry with Florida license plate number W42 7JT, the officer said.

"New York (CNN) -- Three years ago I began research on a book dedicated to the national pastimes: shopping and buying. The plan was to devote the first half of the story to what I called the ""sell side"": the retailers, marketers and consumer researchers who have their sights trained on us. The second half would be about us, the ""buy side."" I would explore all that attracts us -- bees to nectar-- to specific stores and products, why some of us are cheapskates and others have holes in our pockets. Then, a not-so-funny thing happened. Between the time I started my reporting and the time I handed in my finished manuscript, both the sell and the buy sides had cratered. Home prices crashed. Credit markets collapsed. The government tried feverishly to glue broken banks back together. Unemployment went up and up and up. The result: consumer spending -- as in that which drives 70 percent of the U.S. economy -- was running on fumes. Department store sales sank by double-digits. ""The golden age of spending for the American consumer has ended and a new age of thrift likely has begun,"" said a Wall Street analyst. ""Sixty percent off is the new black,"" quipped a magazine fashion writer. Gone, seemingly overnight, were the throngs of buyers from Europe and Asia who had been dragging their wheelies down Fifth Avenue in New York, loading up on shoes and handbags and leaving us American shoppers feeling, even then, like poor country cousins. Word spread that we were now living in ""the Wal-Mart moment,"" which was likely to be rather drawn out. Our longstanding fetish for bigger, faster, flashier, pricier was no more.. With the most hyped shopping day on the calendar -- Black Friday! -- upon us, we all might take a deep breath and focus, not just on where to find the best door-busters, but on more important questions: What is going on out there? In the buying and selling universe, are we witnessing a permanent change in values? Have we all turned forever frugal? The fact is, nobody's quite sure right now. Over the past several months, there have been small signs of recovery. Consumer confidence surveys offer a glimmer of hope. On the ""sell side"" retailers are viewing the holiday selling season with slightly more optimism than when they put in their holiday purchase orders six months ago. And it seems reasonable to hope that we've at least touched bottom and that the consumer escalator is on the way up again, however fitfully. But on the buy side -- our side -- things have changed dramatically, and in some ways for the better. We're shopping more with our heads, not just our hearts; we're thinking about the things we buy. A woman in Boston -- affluent, accomplished, largely unscathed by the financial collapse -- told me that when she now looks back on the expensive shoes and clothes she bought routinely just a few years ago, she ""just can't believe what I was doing."" The Internet is now a daily, indispensable tool we use to search for better prices and seek counsel from others with firsthand knowledge of brands and stores we might be considering. The result: Up and down the socioeconomic ladder we're shopping more prudently. We're paying down credit card balances and placing greater value not just on the new and novel, the cool and the trendy, but also on value itself. Does it work? Is the price fair? Will it last? And yes, we're also splurging now and then -- on impulse purchases that can make a day all the more sweet: a new hairstyle, a brightly colored this-or-that for spring, an electronic gadget that performs amazing tricks, some useful, some just diverting. There are those who would tell us that purchases like this -- ""unnecessary!"" ""juvenile!"" etc. -- are signs of character weakness, that we are routinely ""conned"" into buying useless things by manipulative Mad Men, but I think it's more complicated. Because if there's one thing I learned after three years of watching folks shop and buy -- in good times, then bad -- it isn't that we buy that's been our problem, it's how we bought that was the issue: recklessly, and with little more than a piece of plastic or phantom home equity. But that was then. This is now, and a little self-reward -- a from-me-to-me purchase here, an I-love-you purchase there -- are hardly crimes in my book. Assuming, of course, they don't bring down the house -- this holiday season and beyond. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lee Eisenberg .","Lee Eisenberg says a down economy has turned American spenders into scrimpers .

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government turned off the power at the embassy where deposed President Jose Manual Zelaya surprisingly reappeared this week, and said that the people inside were free to come and go. A soldier takes a picture Wednesday of the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Honduran forces also will not enter the Brazilian embassy, where Zelaya has been housed since Monday, de facto President Roberto Micheletti said in an interview with CNN en Español. But these developments do not spare Zelaya, who was ousted in a June 28 coup, from being arrested and facing charges for violating the constitution if he leaves the safe haven of the embassy, Micheletti said. ""President Zelaya should present himself before the tribunals of justice in our country where he has charges against him,"" Micheletti said. The de facto president challenged versions of events surrounding Zelaya's return. Despite local reports citing police officials that authorities turned off the power to the embassy and surrounding area ostensibly to discourage looting, Micheletti said that a congregation of pro-Zelaya protesters at the embassy short-circuited the power themselves. As of Wednesday, power was restored to the building, Micheletti said. A nationwide curfew was lifted Wednesday, but a security cordon remained in the area around the embassy. Micheletti said that the police were there because the people inside the embassy requested the protection, and said, ""We are not impeding the exit nor the entrance of absolutely anybody."" Zelaya's announced return has re-ignited a stand-off between the two disputed leaders of Honduras. Brazil now finds itself involved because of its embassy. Brazil wants an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the situation, the official Brazilian news agency reported. In another development, Micheletti said he is willing to meet anywhere with ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya as long as Zelaya agrees to abide by presidential elections scheduled for November 29. But the de facto leader said in a statement read by his foreign minister Tuesday that his offer to talk with Zelaya does not nullify an arrest warrant issued against the ousted president by the nation's Supreme Court. ""I think that what the whole world should understand about this country is that there is no immunity for anyone -- for anyone,"" Micheletti told CNN en Español. ""And, no one can be above the law."" Micheletti's willingness to engage Zelaya seemed to be a reversal of his position. On Tuesday, he had said in an interview with local network Televicentro that Zelaya's sudden appearance would not revive negotiations to have him return to power. The United States and Brazil have said they support dialogue between the two sides, centered on the San Jose Accord, an agreement negotiated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. That deal calls for Zelaya to be restored to power. The Brazilian request for a Security Council meeting came after the Honduran government isolated the embassy by cutting water, power and phone lines to the building, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly confirmed to reporters Tuesday in Washington. This was the same action that Micheletti denied Wednesday. Micheletti said that other nations have not given his government a fair hearing of its position. ""This is what we Hondurans want: to be heard, for them to read our constitution, to read our laws, and to see what happened before June 28,"" Micheletti said. The de facto government argues that Zelaya was not removed in a coup, but in a constitutional transfer of power. Zelaya, a centrist whose politics took a strong turn to the left once in office, was ousted in a June 28 military-backed coup. Despite increasing political, diplomatic and economic isolation, Micheletti has steadfastly resisted pressure to allow Zelaya to return to power and Micheletti thwarted two very public attempts by Zelaya to return to his homeland. ""Yes, we are alone, but we are surviving,"" Micheletti said. ""Two months ago, people didn't think we would withstand all this time, but here we are almost three months later."" Amnesty International issued a statement Wednesday in which the human rights group ""denounced a sharp rise in police beatings, mass arrests of demonstrators and intimidation of human rights defenders in Honduras since the June coup d'état and warned that fundamental rights and the rule of law in the Central American nation are in grave jeopardy."" The organization said police fired tear gas Tuesday at a building housing a prominent human rights organization. Around 100 people, including women and children, were inside, Amnesty International said. Many were there to denounce what they said were police abuse while breaking up the demonstration outside the Brazilian Embassy, the rights group said. ""The situation in Honduras can only be described as alarming,"" said Susan Lee, Americas director at Amnesty International. ""The attacks against human rights defenders, suspension of news outlets, beating of demonstrators by the police and ever increasing reports of mass arrests indicate that human rights and the rule of law in Honduras are at grave risk."" It was still not publicly known Wednesday how Zelaya got into the country and he declined to provide details, only telling CNN en Español on Tuesday that it was a 15- to 16-hour trip he took ""with the help of Hondurans."" Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report for CNN en Español.","Amnesty International official calls situation in Honduras ""alarming""

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose new book is ""Late Edition: A Love Story."" Bob Greene says Logan, Ohio, paid an extraordinary tribute to its most dedicated football fan. (CNN) -- ""Yes, it's all gone now,"" Craig Dunn told me the other day. ""If you're not from around here, you'd never know it was ever there."" Dunn is the sports editor of the Logan, Ohio, Daily News, a paper with a small circulation (around 4,000) and a small news staff (five people put the paper out, covering the entire county). Last fall, when I was crisscrossing the country on the CNN Election Express, I spoke with Dunn about the town's high school football stadium, which was being demolished. Bill Sauer Field, it was called. The story I wrote appeared briefly on the Political Ticker and then went away quickly; there was so much rapidly breaking news coming out of the presidential campaign that the story was little more than a blip. Yet I found myself, during the last year, thinking about Bill Sauer Field, and Logan, Ohio, and how it's possible for all of us, if we make the effort, to find the best in ourselves -- to find the best in each other. I find myself thinking about Bill Sauer, and about what that little town did for him, more than I think about almost anything else on which I reported during our long journey through America. And so, with a new football season beginning all across the United States, I spoke with Craig Dunn again the other afternoon. ""When I drive by the place where it used to be, it's not with a sense of sadness,"" he said. ""It's with pride for what this town once did."" Bill Sauer Field was the core of public life in Logan. The town, population 7,300, gravitated to the old stadium on Friday nights in autumns to watch the high school team, the Chieftains, play their games. And who was Bill Sauer? A self-made millionaire from the community who had bestowed the stadium upon the town? A prominent local politician? A long-gone Logan football hero? No. Bill Sauer was born in Logan more than 100 years ago -- in 1908. From the time he was a little boy, he could not walk. He spoke with great difficulty. His parents, desperate, searched for answers. Logan was and is a rural community, and back then sophisticated medical diagnoses were not easy to come by. His mother and father were eventually told that the boy had cerebral palsy. He attended public school in Logan. It was not easy, of course. He was 23 by the time he graduated from Logan High School. Then, as now, the boys who were strong and swift and athletically graceful were the ones most celebrated. Bill could not even take a step on his own. But he loved the Logan sports teams, and he took pride in supporting them. Football, basketball, track and field -- he never missed a game, and he seldom missed a practice session. He would be there on the sidelines, sitting in his wheelchair, cheering for his classmates. His life didn't get any less arduous after he graduated. His father died. It became incumbent upon Bill to support himself and his mother. He sold Christmas cards; he sold magazine subscriptions. At the town's swimming pool, he ran the concessions stand. His philosophy of life, Craig Dunn told me, was basic: However often you get knocked down, you get back up one more time. Bill Sauer grew older. New generations of healthy and talented young athletes played for the Logan Chieftains on Friday nights. No matter the weather, no matter how he was feeling, Bill was always there. The Logan football stadium had been constructed in 1925. It was the heart of the town; it was what made the community feel like a community. In 1975, there was a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the stadium. On that night, it was renamed. For him. For Bill. The whole town had fallen in love with him. All of the quarterbacks who had ever thrown touchdown passes in that stadium, all of the linebackers who had ever made jarring tackles, all of the field goal kickers who had ever won games for Logan as the scoreboard clock ticked down ... and the place was renamed for the boy who could never run a single stride. As the years went by, when visiting teams would come to town, few of the opposing players would have any idea why the stadium in Logan bore the name that it did. That didn't matter. Logan knew. Bill knew. He never married or had a family. He kept going to the games, sitting on the sidelines, right up until his death in 1988. The town, by honoring him the way it did, had given his life meaning, and contentment, and joy. The decades after his death passed; the stadium grew too old, too outmoded. Finally, by last year, there could be no more delay. It was time to tear down Bill Sauer Field. It has vanished now. The new athletic complex -- Logan Chieftain Stadium, it is called -- has risen out near State Route 328. Craig Dunn, the sports editor, spends his Friday nights in the fall covering the games there. Plans are in the works, he said, to erect a plaque at the new stadium in memory of the lifelong fortitude of the town's most faithful fan. ""They want the plaque to be in a place where the Logan players can see it as they run onto the field for every game,"" Dunn said. ""They want to make sure that Bill is never forgotten."" This can be a mean old world sometimes. But other times, when you least expect it, it can light you up.

"Peppermint oil, soluble fiber, and antispasmodic drugs can indeed help people with irritable bowel syndrome, according to an analysis of 25 years of research on the condition, which is characterized by bouts of diarrhea and constipation. ""It wasn't appreciated how much of an impact [IBS] can have on a patient's quality of life,"" says one researcher. About 10 to 15 percent of people in North America have IBS, and it's twice as common in women. However, only about one-third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment. The exact cause of IBS remains unknown, and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments, including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives. However, many treatments are controversial because study results have been mixed. Newer and more expensive medications have been introduced to the public, but some were ineffective or withdrawn from the market due to side effects. The recent study sheds light on the cheap and readily available treatments that can help patients, says study coauthor Eamonn M. Quigley, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at University College Cork in Ireland. ""Medical science has tended to ignore IBS; it wasn't appreciated how much of an impact it can have on a patient's quality of life,"" he says. Health.com: Is that belly ache in your head? In the new analysis, researchers systematically reviewed 38 studies from the last 25 years; more than 2,500 volunteers were involved. That research compared therapies -- all relatively cheap, safe, and readily available -- with a placebo or with no treatment at all. The team looked at three treatments -- soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and antispasmodics, which are drugs that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping -- and found that they were all more effective than a placebo, according to the report in the British Medical Journal. But not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber ispaghula husk, which is also known as psyllium and found in some bulk laxatives, significantly reduced symptoms of  IBS, particularly constipation; insoluble fiber, such as bran, did not relieve symptoms. Several antispasmodic drugs helped prevent IBS symptoms, particularly diarrhea. The most effective one was hyoscine, which is sold without a prescription in the United States. Although peppermint oil was found to be the most effective of the three therapies, more data are needed, cautions Quigley. The peppermint-oil therapy was analyzed in only four trials involving 392 patients. Because past research has been mixed, doctors' treatment guidelines mention the remedies, but don't necessarily give them a ringing endorsement, says author Alex Ford, M.D., a registrar of gastroenterology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. ""I suspect that filters down to the practitioners who don't believe they work, so they try something that's newer or a bit sexier,"" Dr. Ford says. ""The problem with IBS is that it's a chronic medical condition and no drug has been shown to alter its natural history."" Health.com: Should I be tested for IBS? The study results are not surprising, says Joanne A.P. Wilson, M.D., a professor of medicine in the gastroenterology department at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. Dr. Wilson adds that such treatments are best for patients with mild or moderate IBS. However, in her practice, she's found that prescription medications need to be used for severe cases that don't respond to these treatments. Health.com: Belly flab doubles mortality risk . Prescription drugs that have been used to treat IBS include Amitiza, a drug for chronic constipation; Zelnorm, which was pulled from the market in 2007; and Lotronex, which was removed from the market because of potentially life-threatening side effects (although exceptions are now made for women with severe, diarrhea-prominent IBS who don't respond to other treatments).

"Washington (CNN) -- A couple who allegedly crashed this week's state dinner at the White House met President Obama in a reception line at the event, a White House official told CNN on Friday. A White House photograph taken Tuesday evening shows Michaele Salahi, wearing a gold-accented red sari, clasping her hands around Obama's right hand as her smiling husband, Tareq, looks on. The dinner was held for visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is smiling next to the president in the photo. An investigation into Tareq and Michaele Salahi has found that Secret Service agents did not follow protocol at a security checkpoint, the Secret Service said. ""The Secret Service is deeply concerned and embarrassed by the circumstances surrounding the State Dinner on Tuesday,"" the agency said in a statement Friday. ""The preliminary findings of our internal investigation have determined established protocols were not followed at an initial checkpoint, verifying that two individuals were on the guest list."" The Salahis, who are aspiring reality TV stars, made news when they showed up at Tuesday's state dinner. The White House says the Salahis were not invited, but their lawyer, Paul W. Garner, ""states emphatically that the Salahis did not 'crash' this event,"" according to a statement from the couple's publicist, Mahogany Jones. The Secret Service's statement says that although the Salahis went through magnetometers and other levels of screening, ""they should have been prohibited from entering the event entirely."" ""That failing is ours,"" the statement said. The investigation continues and ""appropriate measures have been taken to ensure this is not repeated,"" the agency said. Also Friday, two Secret Service agents visited a Virginia winery to say they wanted to question the couple, according to the winery's manager. Diane Weiss, manager at the Oasis Winery in Hume, Virginia, said the agents wanted to speak with the Salahis. Weiss said she didn't know their whereabouts. The Warren County Report, a local newspaper, quoted Weiss as saying the agents said they wanted to speak with the couple and not arrest them. It also quoted her as saying that the Salahis live in Linden, Virginia, but receive mail at the winery. And the agents said it was ""imperative"" that investigators speak with the couple and that they would ""take whatever action"" is necessary if they did not, the paper quoted Weiss as saying. Weiss told CNN that the newspaper quoted her accurately, but she declined to elaborate. Meanwhile, court records have revealed a more complete picture of the Salahis, who have left an extensive paper trail in federal bankruptcy and state court filings. They are named in at least 16 different civil suits in Fauquier County, Virginia, near Washington, sometimes as plaintiffs, sometimes as defendants. Family members have sued the county and each other. The family winery, Oasis Winery, has sued Michaele Salahi. They did not respond to CNN requests for comment Thursday about their legal history or the White House dinner. ""At this time the Salahis will not make any formal comments regarding the rumors and media speculation surrounding the White House State Dinner,"" Jones, their publicist, said in a statement. Tareq and Michaele Salahi were engaged in a long court battle with his parents over the winery. Tareq Salahi sued his mother, Corinne, court records show, and the suit was dismissed. The mother sued Tareq Salahi and the case went to trial. The outcome is not clear from a Virginia courts Web site. Tareq and Michaele Salahi won control of the winery in 2007, but it has run into debt since then. Oasis Winery filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February of this year, according to U.S. Bankruptcy Court records in the Eastern District of Virginia. Tareq Salahi is listed as company president in the filing. Listed creditors include the IRS, Fauquier County, the state of Virginia, several banks and American Express Corp., among others. The company claims about $335,000 in assets and $965,000 in liabilities.","White House official: Couple met Obama in reception line .

"(CNN) -- A salty soup of seawater, microscopic pieces of plastic and marine debris. Those are the ingredients in the North Pacific Gyre, an ocean vortex estimated by Greenpeace to be the size of Texas, contaminated with the floating detritus of our modern lives. The sheer size of the ocean area affected has been enough to catch public attention, but a number of concerned groups are aiming to capture more than that. Project Kaisei plans to find a way to scoop up the plastic waste and devise a way to turn it into a future fuel source. It's a huge task, but led by innovator and environmentalist Doug Woodring, Project Kaisei has already embarked on a mission to the gyre. An August voyage onboard the New Horizon and Kaisei sailing ships was in partnership with Scripps Research Institute. The crews returned with samples of the water from various locations in the gyre and the most immediate discovery was the pervasiveness of plastic material found at regular points over 3,500 miles. The most heavily polluted areas of surface water in the gyre contained six times more plastic than plankton biomass. Derelict, or ""ghost"" nets, plastic crates and even toys were found by the crew. Some items like plastic bottles had become impromptu homes to varieties of marine mollusc. As well as posing hazards to the oceans through toxic contamination and to sealife through ingestion or being trapped in nets, unnatural transport systems could allow invasive species to be introduced to different areas and upset delicate ecosystems. The project now counts scientists, innovators, sailors and environmentalists among its ranks, galvanized around a desire to clean up the Pacific's plastic vortex. A further voyage next year hopes to gather more data and move closer to a practical solution to the ever increasing problem.","Voyage to the North Pacific Gyre found plastic in the ocean over 3,500 miles .

"(CNN) -- Dubai could lose its place on the Women's Tennis Association Tour calendar after Israeli Shahar Peer was denied entry to compete at this week's event, the WTA supremo warned Monday. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. Peer was scheduled to fly into the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, but was informed Saturday night by telephone that she would not be granted a visa. WTA Chairman and CEO Larry Scott said the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour ""will review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament."" Scott added: ""The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly, and has a clear rule and policy, that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking."" Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is ""very, very disappointed"" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. ""They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,"" Peer said from Tel Aviv. ""So it's very disappointing, and I think it's not fair."" Watch Peer describe her disappointment » . Scott, meanwhile, confirmed: ""Following various consultations, the Tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the Tour's Board of Directors. ""Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally, and the Tour is reviewing appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer."" Scott said Peer's visa refusal has precedence: Last year an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry to Dubai. He said the Emirate cited security reasons following recent unrest in the region. ""At that time I was in Dubai. I made it clear to the authorities, the representatives of the government, that next year when our top players wanted to play this very prestigious tournament all of them had to be allowed to play,"" Scott said. ""They had a year to work on it and solve it. We've spent time through the year discussing it. We were given assurances that it had gone to the highest levels of government,"" Scott said. ""I was optimistic they would solve it. And we've made crystal clear to the government, to the tournament organizers that there could be grave repercussions not just for tennis in the UAE but sports beyond that.""  Watch CNN's interview with Larry Scott » . The Dubai government issued a short statement through the state-owned news agency, saying that Peer was informed while in Thailand that she would not receive a visa. The agency quoted an official source in the organizing committee saying, ""The tournament is sponsored by several national organizations and they all care to be part of a successful tournament, considering the developments that the region had been through."" Earlier an official source who did not want to be named, said, ""We should check what happened in New Zealand, when Peer was playing there with all the demonstrations against Israel during the attacks on Gaza. We have to consider securing the players and the tournament."" In January, a small group of about 20 protestors waved placards and shouted anti-Israel slogans outside the main entrance to the ASB Classic tournament in Auckland. They were moved on before Peer played her match. The Israeli player said she's received phone calls of support from her fellow players. ""'All the players support Shahar,"" world No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times, adding, ""We are all athletes, and we stand for tennis."" Peer is uncertain of her next move. She said the last-minute decision had left her at a loose end. She said she was concerned about her points and ranking and may go to the U.S. this week to try to take part in another tournament. ""I don't think it should happen,"" she said. ""I think sport and politics needs to stay on the side and not be involved. I really hope it's not going to happen again, not only to me but to any other athlete.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On February 2, 7-year-old Cameron Dunmore crossed a street to get to his elementary school in Lithonia, Georgia. This scenario takes place thousands of times uneventfully each school day in our country. But this time Cameron did not make it to school. A crossing guard was halting traffic at the time, but the busy intersection did not have a traffic light and one vehicle did not see the boy. Cameron was struck by an SUV and died that same day in the hospital. Remind children to walk, not run, when crossing the street, so drivers have a chance to see them. As a parent who walks my young child to school every day, Cameron's story is tragically heartbreaking, but unfortunately not unique. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, nearly 5,000 pedestrians died and 70,000 were nonfatally injured in traffic crashes in 2007. Children are at particular risk because of their size, immature judgment and lack of experience with traffic rules. As we promote walking as a healthy and environmentally sound way to get to school, how can we make sure our children make it there safely? Read NHTSA's tips on walking and biking safety . Can seeing red help? Sally Flocks, president and CEO of PEDS, a pedestrian advocacy organization based in Atlanta, believes that traffic lights or flashing red lights in school zones can make a difference. She cited studies showing that having a marked crosswalk without a light may be more dangerous than having no crosswalk at all, and that yellow lights tend to get ignored compared with red. Flocks encourages the public to urge their legislators to invest in traffic safety measures such as red lights, which can ultimately benefit motorists, cyclists and pedestrians alike. Speed kills . According to a United Kingdom Department of Transportation study, speed really matters. A pedestrian hit by a car traveling 20 mph has a 5 percent chance of being killed, while one hit at 40 mph has an 85 percent chance. Flocks suggests that radar signs that tell how fast you are driving and photo enforcement of speeders at intersections near schools could help save lives. Even without the threat of getting a speeding ticket, I would hope the risk of injuring or killing someone else or ourselves would be enough to remind most of us to slow down, especially in school zones and other congested areas. Give walking and driving your undivided attention . It's well known that the distraction from talking on a cell phone while driving can be as bad as or even worse than driving drunk. New research shows that cell phone use while walking can also be distracting. Psychologist David C. Schwebel Ph.D. and his associates from the University of Alabama at Birmingham reported in the February 2009 issue of Pediatrics that preadolescents (ages 10 and 11 -- when most children are mature enough to cross the street by themselves) talking on cell phones had a greater chance of being hit or nearly hit during a simulated road-crossing exercise. Schwebel explains that crossing a street is much more complex than we may realize, with the need for assessing such variables as the approaching vehicles' direction and speed, along with the distance and time needed to cross the street. Adding a diversion such as a cell phone conversation causes risky behavior and delayed reactions. Use common safety sense . Don't check your common sense at the door when you leave for school. Encourage your children to wear brightly colored clothing. Try to walk in groups, and be sure to include adults, who are taller and more visible to drivers. Remind children to walk, and not run, when crossing the streets, so that drivers have a chance to see them. Finally, don't take any traffic risks: If you're not sure whether you can cross safely, wait until you can. It could happen anywhere . Cameron's story took place in metropolitan Atlanta, but it could happen anywhere in America, in my neighborhood or yours. Mourners have placed stuffed animals and flowers at the intersection where Cameron was killed. I'm going to put some at my crosswalk too, in hopes of reminding us all to be safer pedestrians and drivers. After all, our lives -- and our children's -- may depend on it. Jennifer Shu, M.D., is an Atlanta-area pediatrician and mother. She contributes regularly to CNNhealth.com .","NHTSA: Nearly 5,000 pedestrians killed, 70,000 injured non-fatally in 2007 .

"Editor's Note: Daniel J. Mitchell is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research foundation. He formerly worked at The Heritage Foundation and as an economist for Republican Sen. Bob Packwood and the Senate Finance Committee. He also served on the 1988 Bush-Quayle transition team. Daniel Mitchell says an auto bailout would subsidize bad management and reward inflexible unions. (CNN) -- General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union are pouring millions of dollars into a lobbying campaign for a taxpayer bailout. The money devoted to influence peddling in Washington would be better spent on improving quality and finding ways to reduce a bloated cost structure, but both management and UAW have decided that fleecing taxpayers is a better option. A taxpayer bailout would be a terrible mistake. It would subsidize the shoddy management practices of the corporate bureaucrats at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, and it would reward the intransigent union bosses who have made the synonymous with inflexible and anti-competitive work rules. Perhaps most important, though, is that a bailout would be bad for the long-term health of the American auto industry. It would discriminate against the 113,000 Americans who have highly-coveted jobs building cars for Nissan, BMW and other auto companies that happen to be headquartered in other nations. These companies demonstrate that it is possible to build cars in America and make money. Putting them at a competitive disadvantage with handouts for the U.S.-headquartered companies would be highly unjust. A bailout also would be bad for General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. The so-called Big Three desperately need to fundamentally restructure their practices. More specifically, the car companies need to endure some short-term pain in order to restore long-term viability. But that won't happen if politicians raid the treasury. Getting access to taxpayer money would be akin to giving an alcoholic the key to a liquor cabinet. It also would be bad for American taxpayers and the American economy. For instance: . • A bailout will hurt the overall economy by misallocating resources. When politicians grant special favors to a certain industry or a particular union, such decisions necessarily mean that market forces are being replaced by special-interest deal-making. This type of interference with free markets is why nations such as France, Germany and Japan tend to grow more slowly and enjoy less prosperity. But if America goes down this same path of government intervention, it is inevitable that we will suffer the same fate of stagnation and higher unemployment. • A bailout will encourage other industries to seek taxpayer handouts. The Wall Street bailout was a disaster in many ways, most notably as measured by the weak stock market and economic volatility. But another negative aspect of the bailout is that other industries have now decided that it is OK to stick their snouts in the public trough, as well. First Wall Street's high fliers get a bailout. Now the inefficient management and union at the Big Three want a handout. Who will be next in line to pillage taxpayers? Giving handouts in exchange for political support is akin to getting high. Once politicians decide they like the buzz of campaign contributions, they'll turn into junkies with ordinary Americans footing the bill. • A bailout is a perverse transfer from poor taxpayers to rich taxpayers. America's Founding Fathers surely never envisaged that the federal government would take money from one group of Americans and give it to another group. Yet much of the federal budget is devoted to redistribution programs. Bailouts are a particularly bizarre form of redistribution, however, because the corporate bureaucrats at the Big Three are among the very richest Americans. The UAW bosses make extravagant salaries, as well, and even regular union workers make an average total compensation including benefits of approximately $70 per hour, far higher than the average American. The government should not be in the business of giving unearned wealth to any group of citizens, but surely liberals and conservatives both can agree that politicians should not be taking money from middle class taxpayers and giving it to upper-middle class and rich taxpayers. Advocates oftentimes admit that bailouts are not good policy, but they invariably argue that short-term considerations should trump long-term sensible policy. Their biggest assertion is that a bailout is necessary to prevent bankruptcy, and that avoiding this result is critical to prevent catastrophe. But Chapter 11 protection may be precisely what is needed to put American auto companies back on the path to profitability. Bankruptcy laws specifically are designed to give companies an opportunity - under court supervision - to reduce costs and streamline operations. Bankruptcy would not be popular in some quarters, to be sure. The bloated management structure would be streamlined and many overpaid executives would be unhappy about having to find new jobs. The UAW would be equally upset, particularly since bankruptcy might force an end to extravagant pension benefits and inefficient workplace practices. But bankruptcy is akin to getting an alcoholic to put down the bottle. There clearly will be short-term discomfort, but compassionate people recognize that this is the best approach. America is on a dangerous path. The Wall Street bailout was a mistake. It transferred a huge amount of money from the productive sector of the economy to the government, and also exacerbated ""moral hazard"" by rewarding companies and executives who made dumb decisions. But this may be the tip of the iceberg. A bailout of U.S.-headquartered auto companies also would be a mistake, as would bailouts of homeowners or any other constituency. If politicians genuinely want to help the economy, they should focus on reducing the burden of government, not increasing it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Mitchell.","Daniel Mitchell: Bailing out the Big Three would reward shoddy management .
A bailout would be unfair to other auto companies making cars in the U.S., he says .

"Mecca, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Chanting ""Allahu Akbar"" -- God is Greater than any -- more than 2 million pilgrims crossed new pedestrian bridges Saturday to perform one of the last rituals of the Hajj season. Jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations, according to Muslim traditions. The ritual stoning of three pillars, which occurs in the tent city of Mina -- about two miles from Mecca, was the scene of stampedes and many deaths in the 1980s and 1990s as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars on the ground. But this year the Saudi government completed a new project that avoids past congestion at the site. The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $1.2 billion, five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones. Authorities and pilgrims say it's a roomier atmosphere and more efficient way to accommodate the faithful. ""Everything went fine so far,"" Col. Khakled Qarar Mohammadi, head of the emergency forces at Jamarat, told CNN. ""It is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with. About 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual. So we have been preparing for this for years now."" Irtiza Hasan, a pilgrim from the United States, said all went well at the ceremony. ""The only incident I saw was that there were some handicapped women who were turned away in fears that they get hurt."" But Mohammadi said, ""There are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped. Each van can take up to 14 pilgrims."" As a measure to alleviate harm, according to Muslim traditions, the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them. The five-story Jamarat bridge is air-conditioned at 19 degrees Centigrade, or 66 Fahrenheit, throughout the day and backed by water sprinklers that can reduce the temperature to about 29 degrees C, or 84 F. The bridge is designed to allow the addition of seven more levels to hold as many as 5 million pilgrims in the future if the need arises. According to authorities, the bridge is 950 meters (1,039 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) wide. Each floor is 12 meters (13 yards) high with three tunnels and 12 entrances and 12 exits in six directions. It has a helicopter pad for emergencies. According to Mohammadi, the project has 509 advanced closed-circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims' movements. Those cameras feed into the main operations room, which oversees the Jamarat Bridge and the surrounding areas -- all screened by dozens of security officers on 72 monitors at the operation room. The stoning ritual is done over at least two days, where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God's orders to slaughter his son. According to tradition, the event was a test from God, who gave Abraham a ram to slaughter instead. The last ritual that marks the end of Hajj is when pilgrims go from Mina to Mecca to make a last visit to al-Masjid al-Haram, Islam's holiest site, before going back home. The ritual is called Tawaf al-Wada'a -- or farewell circumambulation in the holy mosque. It's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their Lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city.","Goverment constructed three new massive pillars, five-story bridge for Hajj ritual .

"(CNN) -- A proposal to house federal prisoners, including some detainees from Guantanamo Bay, in a largely vacant maximum-security prison would be an economic boost to struggling northern Illinois, state officials said Sunday. ""This is something that is very good for our state, it's good for our economy, it's good for public safety,"" Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn told reporters. Officials from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security and the federal Bureau of Prisons will visit the Thomson Correctional Center on Monday, the officials said. Quinn's office on Saturday said the officials would see whether the ""virtually vacant, state-of-the-art facility"" in Thomson, about 150 miles west of Chicago, could be of use to the Bureau of Prisons. If it is, the governor and other officials said Sunday, it could provide up to 2,000 jobs and up to $1 billion in federal money to the area. And Dick Durbin, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, said he believes the proposal provides a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" for his state's residents. ""There are other states that want to take these jobs,"" Sen. Durbin said. ""We've got to win this competition."" Under the proposal, he said, federal officials have said fewer than 100 detainees from the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba would be housed in the 1,600-bed facility. They would be in a wing under the control of the Department of Defense, while the Bureau of Prisons would assume responsibility for the rest of the facility. The United States is asking other countries to house some of the Guantanamo detainees when the prison is closed, said Durbin, the Senate majority whip. But those countries are asking why America is not housing some of the inmates itself, he said, and use of the Thomson facility would demonstrate to them that the United States is willing to shoulder some of the responsibility. An Obama administration official said Saturday that as part of the conversion at Thomson, the Bureau of Prisons and Defense Department would enhance security to exceed those of the nation's only supermax prison -- the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado. No person has ever escaped from the prison. The Thomson proposal, first reported Saturday by the Chicago Tribune, triggered immediate concern from critics. U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, whose district covers suburban Chicago, circulated a letter addressed to President Obama to Illinois leaders Saturday, opposing the possible transfer of detainees and saying that housing them in Thomson would turn metropolitan Chicago into ""ground zero for Jihadist terrorist plots, recruitment and radicalization."" As home to Chicago's Willis (formerly Sears) Tower -- the nation's tallest building -- ""we should not invite al Qaeda to make Illinois its number one target,"" says Kirk, who is running for the same Senate seat once held by Obama. Durbin on Sunday pointed to the federal maximum-security prison in Marion, Illinois, which he said already houses 35 people convicted of terrorism, along with members of Colombian drug gangs and Mexican drug cartels -- ""some of the most dangerous people in America."" ""They're all in our prisons, and they're all held safely,"" he said. And ""things haven't changed in Marion, Illinois."" Those housed in the Marion penitentiary include Ali al-Marri, who is serving a sentence of eight years and four months after pleading guilty in federal court to conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda. The Thomson prison was built in 2001 and sat empty for five years because the state lacked the resources to open it. Despite being built as a maximum-security facility, it houses 144 minimum-security male inmates, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections Web site. ""After living in limbo for eight years, we're open to any and all alternatives for Thomson,"" said Jerry ""Duke"" Hebeler, Thomson village mayor. He estimated that the move would cut the county's unemployment in half. ""I'd never chase jobs if I thought it would jeopardize the security and safety of my neighbors and friends,"" Hebeler said. Quinn said that during the inspection Monday, ""We want to answer any and all questions that the federal authorities have."" The Obama administration has vowed to close the Guantanamo facility, but acknowledges it is unlikely to happen by its self-imposed January 22, 2010, deadline. About 215 men are held there. They include alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who officials said Friday will be transferred to New York to go on trial in civilian court. The federal prison system houses approximately 340 inmates linked to international terrorism, including more than 200 tied to international incidents, another Obama official said.

"(CNN) -- EU border patrol missions are scouring the Italian shore in search of yet another missing vessel carrying North Africans attempting to reach Europe, a Maltese commander told CNN Thursday. Many immigrants from Africa attempt to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean in overcrowded boats. On Friday, a French patrol frigate operating under Frontex, a EU border patrol mission, alerted Italian officials of new incoming vessels after sighting six corpses floating in the Mediterranean. Maltese army officials were unable to recover the corpses because of poor weather conditions. ""Unrelated to these corpses cited, last Friday, we monitored a fiberglass boat that originated from North Africa carrying about 30 to 35 people on board,"" said Major Ivan Consiglio from Valletta, the Maltese capital. ""Its fate is uncertain,"" he said. ""We have lost track of this boat."" Malta is a hub for immigrants from Africa trying to reach Europe. Approximately 20,000 would-be immigrants have been apprehended on European shores just this year alone, according to Frontex figures. But many do not survive the trek. ""These waters are like the American Wild West,"" Consiglio said. ""So many boats try to cross with families and children and some never make it."" Humanitarian groups such the Dutch-based UNITED against Racism, which keeps records on immigration, say thousands of Africans have died trying to cross the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. The trek between Sicily and Tunisia has been dubbed ""a floating cemetery for African immigrants."" In August, 70 people died off the cost of Malta attempting to cross the Mediterranean. On Wednesday, about 300 would-be immigrants were rescued during a storm in the Italian island of Lampedusa. Consiglio said that a growing number of would-be immigrants are braving the waters of the Atlantic in overcrowded dingy boats -- a dangerous mission this time of the year. ""It's fall here, waters are choppy and covered with fog,"" he said. ""Trips are becoming even riskier and these locally-manufactured fiberglass boats don't have the same rigidity.""","This year around 20,000 migrants have been apprehended on European shores .

"NEW YORK -- There's no shortage of diners in New York City, but one of its most beloved will soon be taking up residence in Alabama. The Cheyenne Diner, which opened in 1940 in New York City, shut its doors in April 2008. The Cheyenne Diner, which first opened in 1940, was split in two Monday night to begin its move on a pair of flatbed trucks some 860 miles to its new home near Birmingham. The dining experience at the Cheyenne was typical of many similar New York eateries, where more often than not, you're guaranteed a hearty meal at a comfortable price. After taking a seat in a roomy booth or even at the counter, you check out the flimsy paper placemat with innocuous historical information or a simplified map of the Greek Isles. A busboy places a glass of ice water on your table. Then it's time to break out the reading glasses and flex those muscles to heft the always lengthy menu. While it may take you several minutes to sift through it, take comfort in knowing that you may actually burn some calories by lifting this bible of comfort food. Unlike the sometimes stuffy pretense of a formal restaurant, the diner experience is generally simple, while the food offerings are diverse -- from apple pie to baked ziti and everything in between. While never known as a bastion for fine dining, the Cheyenne saw brighter days before it unceremoniously closed on a chilly Sunday in April 2008. Originally known as the Market Diner until its moniker was changed in 1986, the pre-assembled restaurant stood as a rare classic definition of free-standing diners. Its streamlined, railcar-inspired design boasts a reverse-channel illuminated neon sign. Horizontal and vertical stainless steel strips border the colorful enamel panels and wrap-around windows on its facade. Celebrities from Jerry Lewis to David Letterman entered through its curved entryway lined with glass blocks. But, like a beloved baseball team whose owner has tossed in the towel, the Cheyenne is moving to a new town for a new life in a new home. The owner of the diner, George Papas, wanted to change the flavor of the block and replace the eatery with a multilevel condo building. Enter preservationist Michael Perlman, a 26-year-old patron saint of sorts for unwanted diners. Perlman found out that the Cheyenne was facing demolition and began to look for a guardian angel to save it. He connected with Alabama businessman Joel Owens, head of the investment group NAIC, who saw the Cheyenne for sale on a Web site devoted to the preservation of New York City structures and fell in love with its ""gorgeous structure."" ""I like it better each time I see it,"" Owens said. ""The barrel roof. The exterior facades are second to none. I think it's the most beautiful diner in the world."" Owens and his business associate, Patti Miller, have a grand vision for the diner and eventually want to incorporate it as part of an entertainment and historic area outside of Birmingham. Once it's restored, which could take up to a year, the Cheyenne will become the first free-standing diner in Alabama, Owens said. A longtime collector of antique cars and Coca-Cola memorabilia, Owens is a firm believer in the lessons that can be learned from the past. ""If you think about what's wrong with today, in order to fix the problems of today, you've got to look back... [to] when it was better,"" Owens said. ""I think [the diner] is symbolic of the glory days. Technology and more money doesn't necessarily mean progress. We long for simpler times,"" he explained. ""These types of buildings can be an instrument for our youth to learn from the past. Teenagers need a clean environment for entertainment, a 'hang out.'"" The departure of the Cheyenne Diner brings back some bitter memories for aficionados of historic New York. The Moondance Diner encountered a similar fate in 2007, after it was put up for sale by developers who purchased the land it was sitting on and planned to build a hotel. That summer, a couple from Wyoming found the Moondance's sale notice on the American Diner Museum Web site. Perlman acted as a conduit there also, helping to broker the sale of the 1920s diner located in the SoHo section of Manhattan, which the couple planned to move to their home state. When news of the sale and move came out, the Pierces began to have some doubts. ""We're quiet people,"" said Cheryl Pierce, of La Barge, Wyoming. ""[But] the media response has been a blessing as people have shown a keen interest."" Pierce and her husband paid $7,500 for the Moondance and ultimately invested $40,000 to move it more than 2,100 miles to La Barge, where it became a popular site in the town of 600 residents with few other restaurants. The barrel-roofed diner reopened on January 12 this year, complete with its original floor and window frames. Customers can sit at the old-fashioned soda fountain or on the outdoor patio in the summer. The menu contains the traditional diner fare -- burgers, fries and milk shakes -- but also caters to the local palate, with chicken fried steaks, ribeye steaks and prime rib. ""Business has been exceptional. We've been able to hold our own,"" said Pierce. ""We get a lot of people who take a detour to visit us."" She noted that it's a lot of work, and a huge commitment, but said she and her husband ""have been blessed."" ""There's never going to be another Moondance Diner,"" she said. In response to critics who complain that historic pieces of New York City are being sold off, Pierce said that in the cases of old diners, ""to keep it alive, somewhere else is the best option, [rather] than seeing it demolished. We've run into New Yorkers who are appreciative that we brought it back to life."" Owens is hoping that will be the case with the Cheyenne, which was loved as a no-frills refuge for comfort food on Manhattan's desolate west side. But now it's served up its last order in New York. And that last order was to go.","The Cheyenne Diner, opened in 1940, moves to its new home by Birmingham .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A man dubbed ""the Field Marshal"" by one advocacy group for alleged third-world arms dealing has been arrested on charges that he conspired to illegally export U.S. F-5 fighter jet engines and parts to Iran. An Iranian F-5 fighter jet lands in southern Iran during a military exercise on June 23, 2009. Jacques Monsieur, 56, a Belgium native who currently lives in France, was arrested Friday in New York, officials said. An indictment also charges Dara Fotouhi, 54, an Iranian living in France, with participating in the alleged crime. Fotouhi remains at large, official said. Monsieur pleaded not guilty at an arraignment Wednesday in Mobile, Alabama, where he is being held. He and Fotouhi are charged with conspiracy, money laundering and smuggling, as well as violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. According to the indictment and an affidavit filed in the case, both are experienced arms dealers who have been actively working with the Iranian government to procure military items. The F-5 Freedom Fighter, also called the Tiger, is built by Northrop and is used by the U.S. military for training. It is also sold overseas as a combat aircraft. The F-5 engine and parts are listed on the U.S. Munitions List and may not be exported from the United States without a license from the State Department, said John Morton, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and they can not be exported to Iran without a license from the Treasury Department. In a 2002 report by the Center for Public Integrity, a citizen advocacy group, Monsieur was nicknamed ""the Field Marshal"" for allegedly acting as a middle-man in numerous arms deals with war-torn countries. The center's report said Monsieur is ""believed to be among the biggest arms traffickers in Europe"" and said he ""violated a United Nations embargo by shipping arms to Bosnia and Croatia during the long, bloody conflict in those countries, with the approval, he later claimed, of both the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the ... French domestic intelligence service."" Morton said his agency launched an investigation in February when Monsieur contacted an undercover federal agent and indicated he wanted to buy engines for F-5 or C-130 aircraft for export to Iran. In subsequent e-mails to the agent, Monsieur requested engines for F-5 jet fighters. Officials said the engines could be used as replacements in fighters sold to Iran by the United States before the imposition of sanctions in 1995. In March, Monsieur met with the undercover agent in Paris and again requested engines and parts, the indictment alleges. They met again in May in London, where Monsieur introduced Fotouhi as a business associate and again discussed the export of F-5 engines to Iran, according to the indictment. During this negotiation, it says, Monsieur and Fotouhi asked the agent if he could use U.S. shipping or export authorization documents that falsely indicated the items were going to Colombia. In July, Monsieur and Fotouhi wired about $110,000 from a bank in the United Arab Emirates to one in Mobile, Alabama, the indictment says. ""The two believed the funds would be used for the purchase of F-5 aircraft parts,"" Morton said. Monsieur indicated he would deposit an additional $300,000 as a down payment for the purchase of two jet engines. ""This is part of our long-standing efforts to ensure that sensitive military equipment is not exported in violation of U.S. law and against the international interests of the United States,"" Morton said.","A man dubbed ""the Field Marshal"" allegedly tried to get F-5 engine parts for Iran .

"(CNN) -- A mushroom cloud of thick dark smoke hovered over the Puerto Rican capital after a blast ripped through a fuel storage complex near San Juan early Friday and caused a massive fire. At least one injury occurred and at least 350 people have been evacuated as about 100 firefighters worked through the night to fight the blaze, Gov. Luis Fortuno said. Firefighters said it would take a few days to control the inferno. Eleven tanks are ablaze, and firefighters are trying to cool down the remaining 29 tanks. The tanks are holding jet and diesel fuels and gasoline. Authorities are looking into the cause of the blaze, which took place at Caribbean Petroleum Corp., a storage complex on San Juan's bay that owns the Gulf brand in Puerto Rico. iReport.com: See, share, send images of the explosion . Justin Gehrke, a U.S. Army civilian employee who filed an iReport for CNN, was taken aback by the sight of the thick black smoke and took photos of the scene from his iPhone.

"(CNN) -- A street vendor in Ghana's capital sells small American flags with an image of President Obama on them, in front of a billboard that proclaims ""Akwaaba"" -- or ""Welcome"" -- next to a smiling image of the U.S. leader. President Obama says he chose Ghana partly because of the ""democratic commitments"" by President Mills. When Obama arrives in Accra on Friday night, he will be the third sitting American president to visit the West African nation of Ghana. But unlike Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Obama is only visiting Ghana and no other country in the continent. Obama said he picked Ghana as the first African country he would visit as U.S. president partly because of the ""democratic commitments"" demonstrated by President John Atta Mills, who took office in January after a close election. ""By traveling to Ghana, we hope to highlight the effective governance that they have in place,"" Obama said Tuesday in an interview with AllAfrica.com. During his 24-hour visit to Ghana, Obama will meet with the president and address parliament before he and first lady Michelle Obama tour the Cape Coast Castle, which was used in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Security has been tight all week in Accra, and Ghana plans to deploy some 10,000 security forces during Obama's visit, according to Ghana News Agency (GNA). The White House has set up SMS codes to allow people across Africa to send ""words of welcome"" via text message to Obama during his visit. Obama has already received thousands of messages, and plans to answer several of the questions sent to him, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported on Thursday. Bill Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit Ghana, in 1998, as part of a six-nation Africa tour. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, stopped there during a four-nation Africa tour during his last year of office that largely focused on U.S. aid programs. Ghana's government named a road after Bush to recognize his government's contribution towards the country's development. As the United States' first African-American president, Obama's trip has broader significance as well. Obama's father is from Kenya and he expressed concern about the political situation in that East African nation. ""The political parties [in Kenya] do not seem to be moving into a permanent reconciliation that would allow the country to move forward,"" Obama told AllAfrica.com. ""And Kenya is not alone in some of the problems that we've seen of late, post-election or pre-election."" Many in Kenya were critical of Obama's decision to pick Ghana the first African nation he visited instead of his father's birthplace. During his campaign for president, Obama was hailed by many as a ""son of Kenya."" Shortly after the White House announced the Ghana trip in May, newspaper headlines in Nairobi asked, ""Why Obama Snubbed Kenya."" A political cartoon in one Kenyan paper showed Air Force One dropping a note to Kenya's leaders saying, ""Get your act together,"" as it flew over the country. Obama said he wanted his visit to Africa to mean more than just something to cross off his list as U.S. president. ""I actually thought that it made sense for us to connect a trip to Ghana to a previous trip with the G8 ... to show that Africa is directly connected to our entire foreign policy approach,"" Obama told AllAfrica.com. ""That it's not some isolated thing where once every term you go visit Africa for a while to check that box, but rather it's an ongoing part of a broader discussion about how we move many of these international challenges forward."" As Ghana gears up for the visit, a group of local singers and rap artists wrote a welcome song for Obama and produced a music video on YouTube. ""President Obama, Welcome to Ghana,"" they sing, with images of U.S. and Ghanaian flags interspersed between the musicians. ""We welcome you to the Land of Gold.""","President Obama arrives in the West African nation Friday night .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- An emotional Nancy Reagan helped unveil a statue of her late husband, President Reagan, on Wednesday, calling the 7-foot figure ""a wonderful likeness."" Nancy Reagan, with House Minority Leader John Boehner, wipes away tears at Wednesday's event. ""I know Ronnie would be deeply honored to see himself with a permanent home in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol and very proud to be representing his beloved California,"" Nancy Reagan said. She appeared to battle emotions as she mentioned her last visit to the marbled hall for Reagan's memorial in June 2004. ""It's nice to be back under happier circumstances,"" she said.  Watch Nancy Reagan unveil the statue » . The statue is one of two from California in the National Statuary Hall Collection donated by states to honor significant figures. Nancy Reagan stood arm-in-arm with House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio to pull down the curtain from the statue. She thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California for making the event possible. In her remarks, Pelosi noted that the former president's statue contains pieces of the Berlin Wall, ""as a symbol of his commitment to national security and to his success."" The wall was torn down shortly after Reagan left office. ""I'm so grateful to Californians for giving him this honor,"" Nancy Reagan said. ""Artist Chas Fagan has captured his likeness so well, and I think the addition of the pieces of the Berlin Wall in the pedestal reflects my husband's commitment to freedom and democracy for everyone."" The former president is credited with polices that led to the break-up of the former Soviet Union and the dismantling of the wall that divided Berlin as a symbol of Cold War politics. James Baker, a longtime Republican who served in the Cabinets of Reagan and President George H.W. Bush, recalled that Reagan inherited some major problems when he took office in 1981. Citing the former president's trademark optimism, he quoted from Reagan's first inaugural address that ""we are not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline."" Nancy Reagan attended a White House ceremony Tuesday marking Barack Obama's signing of legislation authorizing a Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission. The 11-member commission will plan activities marking Reagan's 100th birthday on February 6, 2011.

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- An outbreak of flu at Washington State University showed few signs of slowing down as more students continued to report symptoms suspected of being from the H1N1 virus, school officials said Wednesday. WSU Web page gives information, advice to students who suspect they may have H1N1 virus. About 2,500 students have come down with possible cases of H1N1 since classes began August 24, said James Tinney, WSU director of media relations. He added, ""It takes about three to four days to get over the virus, so many of the people who have had it are already feeling better and are back in class."" On Wednesday, 169 new suspected cases of the virus, also known as swine flu, were reported among the nearly 18,000 students that make up the school's Pullman, Washington campus, according to a university news release. The university said while it is no longer testing sick students to confirm H1N1, it is following guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and the local health department by ""treating all patients with influenza-like symptoms as if they have H1N1."" Students who contact the school health services department complaining of symptoms of swine flu are urged to stay at home and drink fluids.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A weekend incident with racial overtones at a high school for deaf students could result in criminal charges with ""enhanced penalties for a hate crime,"" Metro Police Chief Cathy Lanier said Wednesday. A black student was held against his will and then released with ""KKK"" and swastikas drawn on him in marker at the Model Secondary School for the Deaf on Sunday, she said. No charges have been filed, and no names have been released, Lanier said. The incident began when a group of black students and a group of white students were in a dorm. ""My understanding is the two groups engaged in friendly horseplay,"" she said. But, she said, the groups got ""angry with each other."" The two groups separated, she said, but later, six white students and one black student -- all between the ages of 15 and 19 -- took one of the black students into a dorm room and ""held him there against his will."" ""They used markers to write 'KKK' and draw swastikas on the student,"" Lanier said. The student was released after about 45 minutes. He notified dorm and school authorities, who called police. Lanier said police have identified and interviewed the students involved and the ""investigation is ongoing."" ""The support we've received from the campus and from the school employees has been tremendous,"" Lanier said. ""And I think they're supporting us in making a very strong statement that this investigation may lead to charges that could have enhanced penalties for a hate crime."" The school is a residential high school on the campus of Gallaudet University, a higher education facility for deaf and hard of hearing people. The high school is administered as a division of the university's Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center. Dean of Clerc Center Katherine A. Jankowski said the seven students who participated in the incident were sent home. Gallaudet provost Stephen Weiner said the school does ""not tolerate any action, behavior of this type.""

""That's why the Metro police are involved. That's how serious we are about this incident."" Jankowski said the school has also hired a consultant to work with the school and its students on diversity issues. On Monday, teachers and staff hosted a school-wide assembly with students related to the incident, said Jankowski.

This is the man, after all, who once said: ""My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe."" It is this drive to get a better grasp on the laws which govern the universe that has informed Hawking's research since the early days when he was a research fellow at Cambridge University in the UK. One of his great achievements since then, together with mathematician Roger Penrose, has been to prove that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity means space and time has a beginning in the ""Big Bang"" and ends in black holes. In 1998, Hawking published ""A Brief History of Time,"" a layman's guide to the origins of the universe. The popular science book, which is aimed at helping the general public to answer questions like, ""Where did the universe come from?"" and ""Will it end and if so, how?"" is a best-seller and has since become a modern classic.

The bus stop was about 100 yards from her home in rural Winfield Township in western Pennsylvania. But Cherrie did not make it to the hilltop trailer she lived in with her parents. She was never seen again. Investigators say her disappearance after the four mile ride home from elementary school on February 22, 1985, remains a mystery. ""It's like a black hole opened up and she fell in,'' said Cherrie's mother, Janice McKinney. She recalled that she and Cherrie's stepfather, Leroy, could hear the bus pulling up that day. Soon after Cherrie did not arrive, he went to the stop to look for her. ''He came flying back up because she wasn't there,'' McKinney said.  Watch what the girl's mom has to say » . Cherrie, an only child, would soon be celebrating her 33rd birthday, but in the minds of many, she will always remain a missing girl. ""People still talk about it,'' said Trooper Frank Jendesky, the lead detective working on the case for the Pennsylvania State Police for the past 15 years. The driver and children riding the bus remember Cherrie getting off the bus with a few other students who lived nearby. One lingering detail has baffled investigators for years -- reports that a 1976 model van was following the school bus. The van, according to students, had a distinctive painted mural of a snow-capped mountain and skier wearing red and yellow clothes coming down the mountain. Despite many efforts, the van was never found and it remains unclear whether it holds a link to the puzzle. ''By now it's probably in a junkyard or somewhere,'' said Jendesky, who considers the case a kidnapping or abduction -- rather than a homicide -- because a body was not found. ""It's the not knowing that kills you,'' McKinney said. ''Every day you wonder and you look at some girl who's 33 and you wonder, 'Is that her?' I look at little kids and wonder, 'Is that my grandchild?' '' Over the years, police conducted hundreds of interviews and cleared several persons of interest, while the case file grew to more than 4,000 pages. Among his biggest frustrations, Jendesky said: ""The time lapse and a lot of the calls I've gotten over the years really had no relevance to the case.'' In the days before Amber Alerts and greater public awareness of crimes against children, McKinney said it took time before word of her daughter's disappearance became widespread. McKinney said Cherrie's case was included as a public service insert in a direct mail advertising campaign, one of the first times that approach was taken. Cherrie was especially close with McKinney's parents. She described how the girl would lovingly mimic her grandfather's daily morning walk in the garden with his hands cupped behind his back. Hanging in McKinney's dining room is a picture Cherrie drew of a rainbow, trees, birds and clouds. It says ""Mom and Dad."" ""I have more memories of my daughter than most people get in a lifetime,'' McKinney said, remembering that Cherrie loved the children's character Strawberry Shortcake, enjoyed spelling and wanted to be an elementary schoolteacher. The day Cherrie went missing she was bringing home annual school pictures. That photo and the girl who never made it home with it became known to many on missing posters distributed across the nation. ""She was one heck of a special kid,'' McKinney said. ""And there's somebody out there that knows. And I hope that someday they have a conscience and they'll let us know. Because that's all I pray for, is to have an answer.'' Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Cherrie Mahan or those responsible for her disappearance are asked to call the Pennsylvania State Police at (724) 284-8100.","Third-grader disappeared in February 1985 .

"(InStyle.com) -- So you're finally ready to settle down and make that marriage proposal? There's no better time to do it than engagement season, which, lucky for you, is now! Get inspired by these uber-romantic celebrity proposals. Brandon Routh popped the question to Courtney Ford while on a picnic. Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict . Although the set of a slasher movie seems an unlikely place for romance to bloom, that's just where it happened for actors Tia Mowry and Cory Hardrict. Shortly after shooting began in 1999 on their film ""Hollywood Horror,"" the co-stars started spending time together. Seven years later, on Christmas Day 2006, Hardrict, 32, told Mowry, 30, that he wanted to give her a promise ring. Then, as her entire family looked on, the ""Lincoln Heights"" actor yelled, ""Psych!"" and got down on one knee to present her with a 1.5-carat diamond engagement ring. Antonio Pierce and Jocelyn Maldonado . Antonio Pierce, an NFL linebacker, met Jocelyn Maldonado during a celebrity appearance at an ESPN Fantasy Football Draft. Maldonado, a model at the event, instantly caught his eye. Pierce and Maldonado (who now hosts Mets Weekly) were inseparable over the next six months. In February 2007, Pierce treated Maldonado to a helicopter ride above Manhattan, New York, before dining at Brooklyn's The River Café. Famous for its chocolate Brooklyn Bridge cake, Pierce conspired with the restaurant's manager to place the engagement ring atop the confection, which was covered with pink rose petals. Howie Dorough and Leigh Boniello . Backstreet Boy Howard ""Howie"" Dorough got more than he bargained for after hiring Leigh Boniello to be the band's webmaster in December 2000. Boniello went on tour with the group and quickly grew close to Dorough. Six years later, the couple attended a New Year's Eve party at the New Jersey home of Boniello's father. ""I figured, what better timing,"" says Dorough, ""because all of her family was going to be there, including her 92-year-old grandmother."" Just before the stroke of midnight, Dorough made a toast and presented Boniello with a custom-designed three-stone diamond engagement ring. Brandon Routh and Courtney Ford . Three years before actor Brandon Routh donned those famous blue tights, he tended bar at Lucky Strike Lanes in Hollywood. During a party there in 2003, actress Courtney Ford repeatedly poured out the drinks he made her as a ruse to chat him up. ""I kept asking him for another drink, telling him the one before was too strong,"" she recalls. In 2006, Routh purchased the 3-carat diamond ring that had caught Ford's eye during an earlier visit to Neil Lane. But since the two were traveling for the Superman Returns press tour, Routh asked Gilbert Adler, one of the film's producers, to hold the ring until they arrived in England. ""Poor man!"" says Routh. ""He carried it around for two and a half weeks."" Finally, while picnicking in Glastonbury, Routh popped the question. Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter . Roselyn Sanchez and Eric Winter became friends after meeting at a party in 2006 and Sanchez immediately pegged him as perfect husband material. She found out for certain that he felt the same way just two days before Christmas 2007, under a full moon at midnight, in a bay off the coast of the Puerto Rican island Vieques. The two were seated in a double kayak, taking in the bioluminescent organisms shimmering in the water all alone, except for a tour guide in a second kayak. The scene should have been pure bliss, except that Sachez was concerned when their guide speedily paddled away. ""The guy knew to take off so Eric could propose, but imagine how I felt floating in this huge bay in the middle of the night with nobody around,"" Sanchez explains. ""I started calling back, 'Senor, hello! Come back!' until I realized something was going on."" After an ""amazing speech,"" Winter pulled out a 4.3-carat brilliant-cut diamond ring by Michael Barin, Sanchez's favorite jeweler. But her joy was soon laced with anxiety over the fact that such a costly bauble was surrounded by acres of sea. ""I said, 'Put it away, please. I don't want it to drop in the water!'"" Anna Chlumsky and Shaun So . Actress Anna Chlumsky, 27, best known for her role in ""My Girl,"" was awaiting her seven-year anniversary with college sweetheart and army reservist Shaun So, 28, and hoping he might pop the question. While they were having breakfast at a café in her neighborhood a week before their anniversary, Chlumsky described a cocktail ring a friend was selling. So, who had been carrying an engagement ring for two weeks in anticipation of the perfect moment, pulled out the 1-carat, cathedral-mounted, radiant-cut bauble and asked, ""Does it look anything like this?"" Guiliana DePandi & Bill Rancic . It started out all business: Giuliana DePandi was interviewing Bill Rancic, first-season winner on ""The Apprentice"" and co-host of the Chicago, Illinois, TV show ""In the Loop with iVillage."" But when the cameras stopped rolling in April 2006, a whirlwind -- and adventurous -- romance began. Eight months later, when Rancic, 36, popped the question during a chopper flight over Chicago, complete with champagne, Giordano's deep-dish pizza (DePandi's favorite) and Michael Bublé tunes piped into the headset. ""Bill told me we were going to look at Christmas lights,"" says DePandi. ""It was dark in the helicopter, so I didn't really get a look at the ring until the next day, when I went into shock for the second time,"" she says of the 4-carat cushion-cut diamond in a micro pavé setting Rancic helped design. Jeri Ryan and Chistophe Eme . ""He was hot!"" Shark star Jeri Ryan, 39, recalls of first glimpsing her future husband, Christophe Emé, 38, at a food-related charity event four years ago. ""He looked good in his chef's hat, and he had this ornery little spark in his eye that I really enjoy."" After dating for two years, the couple opened Ortolan, their celebrated French restaurant in Los Angeles, California. The proposal came soon after. ""One night, Christophe covered my eyes and took me into our bedroom,"" recalls Ryan. There the die-hard romantic had placed candles, champagne and a canvas painted with the messages ""And you come with me forever"" in French and ""Grow old along with me"" in English. Emé then presented Ryan with a made-to-order cushion-cut solitaire set in pavé diamonds. Jason Priestley and Naomi Lowde . Fate has looked after Jason Priestley. On Valentine's Day 2000 the actor met Naomi Lowde, a makeup artist from Hertfordshire, England, while walking back from a play rehearsal in London. ""I was smitten,"" says Priestley, now 36. The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum and Lowde, 27, immediately began dating, and in 2002 they moved back to California together. That's when fate took another turn: On August 11, 2002, Priestley was driving his race car on a Kentucky track when he hit a wall at 180 mph. Though he sustained three skull fractures, a broken back and a bleeding artery in his neck, he pulled through. ""It was a tough time, but it was also magical because we kept each other's spirits high,"" says Lowde. ""We pushed two beds together in the hospital and put Swifty, our French bulldog, in the middle. We were together 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for three months."" In May 2004 Priestley arranged another trip to London, England -- to the very street corner where he and Naomi first met, where he presented her with an emerald-cut, three-diamond ring by Steven Pomerantz. Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell . What happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas -- and for Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell, that's not a bad thing. Nearly four years ago the two ran into each other poolside at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. ""I was working on a documentary, and Jerry offered to help,"" recalls Romijn, 35. ""He spent a week operating the microphone, but later he told me he would have done anything. I don't think he really cared about the project, if you know what I mean."" For their first date the couple went to see the Blue Man Group with friends, and O'Connell had Romijn in stitches. ""It was this whole Jerry show in my ear. That's how it is with Jerry. You get sucked into it!"" Evidently: A year and a half later, on September 18, 2005, O'Connell, 33, proposed to Romijn in New York with a diamond ring from Simon G. ""I got down on one knee, asked her to marry me and said, 'You better say yes' a couple of times -- there was a little bit of a pause on her part,"" says O'Connell. Romijn's take? ""Not true!""

"(CNN) -- A prisoner killed in a Maryland county jail on Sunday was a victim of ""vigilante justice,"" Prince George's County Chief Executive Jack Johnson said. Ronnie White, 19, died of strangulation and asphyxiation and had two broken bones in his neck, an autopsy showed. An attorney for White's family said that because White was being held in solitary confinement at the Prince George's County Correctional Center, a corrections officer would have had to let whoever killed the prisoner into his cell. His death came two days after his arrest in connection with the death of Prince George's County police Cpl. Richard Findley, who died Friday after being struck by a truck. Authorities believe that White was driving the truck, which was thought to be stolen. Police were attempting to flag it down when Findley was struck. ""The killing of the officer is absolutely abhorrent, but also, Mr. White was presumed innocent and deserved his day in court just like any other citizens,"" Johnson said Monday night. ""We live in a constitutional democracy, and no one has the right to be judge and jury."" The FBI's Baltimore field office said it has opened a civil rights investigation into White's death. The Justice Department said Tuesday that federal prosecutors have been in contact with the state police and FBI as well as county prosecutors and the department's own Civil Rights Division. ""In support of the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office, which intends to retain lead responsibility for the criminal investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office will provide guidance and legal advice to the officials looking into the death and seeking to develop evidence of criminal violations,"" the department said in a written statement. Johnson said Monday that he had requested that the Maryland State Police conduct an independent investigation into White's death. White family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement.  Watch why death has outraged family » . ""You either have to be buzzed in from the booth -- I believe it's called the control booth -- you need a key from there, or you have to get a key from one of two officers who were assigned to his unit on that day,"" Henry said. The attorney said a ""yet to be identified person or persons took it upon themselves to be the judge, jury and executioner for Mr. White."" ""The family of Ronnie White is absolutely, unequivocally outraged, incensed and deeply saddened that the life of their loved one could be taken so cold[ly], so callously,"" Henry said Tuesday. ""Something is dreadfully wrong with the system."" County authorities have said that police are not suspects and that seven corrections officials and an unspecified number of supervisors were the only ones authorized to be in White's cell. None has been suspended or removed. There were no surveillance cameras in the area of the jail where White was being held. White had not had the opportunity to meet with an attorney, Henry said. A physical conducted when White was processed revealed no health issues, according to Johnson. He was checked regularly in his cell and appeared fine when corrections officers saw him at 10:15 a.m. Sunday. When officers brought him lunch 20 minutes later, he was unconscious and without a pulse, Johnson said. Henry said White's family was not notified of his death until several hours after it occurred. They were told to go to Prince George's Hospital to identify the body, he said, but upon arrival were told the state medical examiner's office had taken custody of the body and it had been taken to Baltimore. ""At this very moment, the family has not even seen the body of their loved one,"" Henry said. ""They have been denied the opportunity to start the grieving process which naturally must occur."" He said White's family is calling upon the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Maryland State Police and county officials ""to conduct a thorough and exhaustive investigation into all of these tragic events, beginning with the events of Friday, June 27, and continuing up until this time."" Prince George's County State's Attorney Glenn Ivey said a grand jury will be convened in the case. He said his office, which will handle any prosecutions that might result, is keeping an open mind. ""We'll follow the evidence wherever it leads,"" he said. He added that he's ""never seen one like this. We've had deaths in custody, but this could be a unique one.""

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- Electricity returned early Wednesday to a large swath of central and southern Brazil that was plunged into darkness when power from a major hydroelectric dam was lost. Up to 18 of Brazil's 26 states were left without power when electricity from the Itaipu dam was interrupted around 10:15 p.m. (7:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday, leaving Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other cities in darkened chaos. Hundreds of people were trapped in elevators. Subways, trains and buses stopped running their routes. Video showed long snaking lines of cars at a near standstill on the roads, their headlights the only illumination. The outage also led to medical emergencies, with a report in Sao Paulo of neighbors having to rescue someone who breathes with the help of a ventilator but the back-up battery was running low. Police also reported increased robberies and looting related to the blackout. Authorities in Rio de Janeiro and other cities stepped up enforcement. Officials said up to 60 million of Brazil's nearly 200 million residents were pitched into darkness. ""I thought, 'How is this happening?' "" said Rio de Janeiro resident Wesley Ferreira. ""All of Copacabana is black."" Power was restored to most of Brazil by 6 a.m. (3 a.m. ET), the government-run Agencia Brasil news agency said. But some water-treatment plants remained affected Wednesday. Authorities in Sao Paulo reported that 3 million residents in the metropolitan area remained without water, down from a previous 6.7 million. Sao Paulo is the largest municipality in South America, with about 11 million inhabitants in the city and nearly 20 million in the metro area. The Itaipu dam, one of the world's largest hydroelectric facilities, is shared by Brazil and Paraguay, which also lost power. Neighboring Uruguay also reported outages. Itaipu provides more than 19 percent of Brazil's energy and 87 percent of Paraguay's, Agencia Brasil said. The outage affected 18 states, the UOL Noticias news outlet said, citing Brazil's minister of mines and energy, Edison Lobao. The states of Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo went totally dark, while Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana, Acre, Rondonia, Bahia, Sergipe, Paraiba, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte were partially affected. The Federal District in which Brasilia, the nation's capital, is located also had outages. As a point of reference as to how widespread the blackout was, it is about 2,000 miles from the southern tip of Santa Catarina to the northern tip of Pernambuco. Jorge Samek, the director general of the agency that runs the dam, said the blackouts were caused by a failure in the Brazilian power delivery system, not the hydroelectric plant at the dam. Officials said three transmission lines went out. Officials said they had not determined an official cause for the power failure, but pointed at the weather. They discounted any type of sabotage. ""Apparently, according to information that we have, it was because of meteorological conditions that were pretty adverse, with strong winds and strong rain at the same time,"" Lobao said. Some experts agreed that the electric system should not collapse because of a storm. ""There is a problem,"" said Luiz Pinguelli, director of the Post-Graduate Engineering Center at the Rio de Janeiro Federal University. ""And you can't say under any circumstances that this is due to nature. There is a transmission problem, and the worst part of it is the dimension it takes. That is to say, an accident that can tumble one line is always possible. But for the power to go out in so many cities for such a long time, that shouldn't happen."" Some residents blamed a sudden surge in electricity use as Brazil, which is in the Southern Hemisphere, enters spring and the weather gets warmer. ""Those responsible for the energy supply do not perceive that the weather is changing and that there's a lot of hot weather in the spring,"" said Rio resident Pabla de Visconti. ""Summer promises to be hot, and everyone is turning on air-conditioners and fans."" The nation's ability to handle basic utilities concerns some officials as Brazil prepares to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Summer Olympics two years later. ""I always say that Brazil is a country that is growing much, that everyone takes pride in, that is talked about favorably in the rest of the world, but that has a Third World infrastructure,"" said Adriano Pires, director of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure. ""When we have consumption peaks, there are blackouts. If the government does not invest in infrastructure, the problems will be more serious each time. It will lead to the strangulation of economic growth and could embarrass the country in events like the World Cup and the Olympics."" CNN's Alessandra Castelli and journalists Fabiana Frayssinet and Lucrecia Franco contributed to this report.","Electricity returns to central and southern Brazil after power from major hydroelectric dam was lost .

"(CNN)  -- Tillakaratne Dilshan scored his sixth Test century of a remarkable year to give Sri Lanka a fine start to the third match of their series against India in Mumbai on Wednesday. Dilshan made 109 as Sri Lanka, seeking a win to level the series at 1-1, closed on 366 for eight wickets on the opening day. All-rounder Angelo Mathews was closing on his first Test century with an unbeaten 86 on a wicket offering turn and bounce, but was rapidly running out of partners to the second new ball. India, who won the second Test in Kanpur last week by a crushing innings and 144 runs, will take over from South Africa as the top-ranked Test team in the world if they can win the series 2-0. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh claimed four victims and slow left-armer Pragyan Ojha two but Dilshan proved a formidable opponent. He continued his superb 2009 with 10 boundaries and two sixes to reach three figures for the 11th time in Tests. He made 112 in the high-scoring draw in the first Test in Ahmedabad. Dilshan put on 93 in 20 overs for the first wicket with Tharanga Paranavitana, who made 53.before becoming Harbhajan's first victim just before lunch. India claimed three wickets in the afternoon as Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara went cheaply with Mahela Jayawardene adding 59 for the third wicket before falling victim to paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. Harbhajan had Thilan Samaraweera caught in the leg-trap for one just before the tea interval. Mathews and Dilshan put Sri Lanka back on top again in the final session with a 74 stand which was ended when the opener was given out caught at short-leg off Harbhajan, with TV replays indicating he was unlucky. Prasanna Jayawardene made 43 in a sixth-wicket stand of 67 with Mathews, but he Nuwan Kulasekara and Rangana Herath fell in quick succession as India hit back again.","Tillakaratne Dilshan scores sixth Test century of 2009 for Sri Lanka .

"(Mental Floss) -- We remember Henry Ford as the automotive magnate who perfected assembly line technology, but he also dabbled in ambitious social programs, including one in which he hired ex-convicts straight out of Sing Sing to staff his factories. Henry Ford, pictured in 1942, unsuccessfully attempted to increase the rubber supply with a plantation in Brazil. Although many of these efforts were successful, Ford's ill-fated foray into the Brazilian jungle was a notable and fascinating exception. The plan . If you're going to make millions of cars, you're going to need an awful lot of rubber. In 1927, Ford came up with a novel plan: He'd solve his rubber problem and test out his lofty theories about social planning. If everything went well, he could craft both a utopia full of healthy, productive workers and a direct pipeline of coveted rubber to Detroit. Ford approached the task with characteristic zeal. He talked the Brazilian government into granting him 10,000 square kilometers of land in the Amazon rain forest -- a plot that was nearly twice as big as the state of Delaware -- in exchange for a 9 percent cut of the plantation's profits. In theory, this setup seemed like one of Ford's ideas that would shake out pretty well, and in 1928, Ford sent a barge full of supplies from Michigan down to his new plantation town, which was dubbed ""Fordlandia."" Growing rubber in the jungle . Unfortunately for Ford's stockholders, though, the captain of industry didn't always have a great eye for detail. (One famous story about Ford was that he disliked accountants so fiercely that he never had his company audited. By the end of his tenure, the Ford Motor Company allegedly had no idea exactly how much it cost to build a car.) Ford didn't check to see if the plantation was suitable for growing rubber. According to Greg Grandin, author of ""Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City,"" Ford never consulted any sort of expert on rubber cultivation; he just sent a bunch of supplies and managers into the jungle hoping to grow some rubber. Mental Floss: Henry Ford and others who survived bankruptcy . Ford was legendarily contemptuous of experts, but he could have saved some serious dough if he'd just hired a consultant to tell him that the plantation wasn't at all suitable for growing rubber. The land wasn't very fertile, but that wasn't the main problem. The real difficulty was that it's practically impossible to farm rubber in a plantation setting in the Amazon rainforest. To grow the trees on a commercial scale, you've got to pack them in fairly close together, and at that point they become incredibly susceptible to blight and insect attacks. Fordlandia's trees were no exception, and caterpillars and blight quickly decimated the fields. Not exactly a worker's paradise . Obviously, the rubber production part of the Fordlandia got off to a rocky start. How was the ""worker's paradise"" part of things going, though? Even more abysmally. The American managers and their families that Ford imported from Michigan weren't accustomed to the sweltering Brazilian heat and headed back north with an alarming frequency. The heavy machinery used on the plantation left deep ruts in the soft soil, which collected stagnant water and became breeding grounds for malaria-ridden mosquitoes. Ford had attempted to design Fordlandia like any American town, complete with schools, restaurants, a golf course, and shops. The catch here, though, was that the indigenous Brazilians who farmed the rubber weren't used to living in a stylized American community. Worse still, the plantation's workers were expected to work a strict shift from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., whereas normal harvesting practices in the region saw workers hit the fields before dawn, take a long break, and then head out again at twilight to save themselves the misery of working in the tropical midday heat. Food fights . Ford's influence extended all the way down to the residents' diets, and while the indigenous workers weren't crazy about having to eat American foods, they were livid about having to eat in a cafeteria setting rather than enjoying the homestyle meals to which they were accustomed. Eventually, the workers decided they'd had enough of the affront of cafeteria dining and rioted during a meal. Mental Floss: Three historical food fights . As the American managers fled to the safety of boats, the workers destroyed their mess hall and continued to riot until Brazilian soldiers came in to suppress violence. Another sticking point for the workers was Ford's insistence that his model community be entirely free of alcohol and tobacco. Although Prohibition wasn't exactly an unqualified success at home, and although alcohol was still legal in Brazil, Ford stayed firm on his booze ban. Workers who needed a drink were forced just outside the city limits to buy a bottle of cachaca; enterprising liquor salesman could simply paddle by on the river and unload their wares. Mental Floss: Why is the drinking age 21? End of the road . Eventually, even though Henry Ford steadfastly insisted that the community could thrive and help introduce American-style industrialization to the rest of the world, it became abundantly clear that the noble Fordlandia experiment was a flop. After the perfection of synthetic rubber in 1945, Ford sold the plantation at a $20 million loss and left Brazil. Just how much of a fiasco was the Fordlandia experiment? Although Ford spent 17 years trying to produce rubber on the plantation, no Ford car ever rolled off the assembly line with a single bit of Fordlandia's rubber in it.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of Opel workers went on strike in Germany on Thursday in protest at the decision by U.S. parent General Motors to abandon the sale of the automaker. GM shocked German public officials when it announced earlier this week its decision to keep its European Opel and Vauxhall units and cancel a planned sale to Canadian firm Magna. If Magna had bought GM's European operations thousands would have lost their jobs in Spain and at Vauxhall plants in Britain. After the announcement there were celebrations in Britain but fury in Germany, where thousands of workers fear they will face the axe. ""We want Opel to continue to exist,"" Hesse state Premier Roland Koch -- one of the biggest lobbyists for a sale to Magna and its Russian partner Sberbank -- told rallying workers at Opel headquarters in Ruesselsheim on Thursday, according to Reuters.com. ""We will have to fight again with the goal of saving jobs."" GM announced a restructuring plan for Opel that would include cuts of as many as 10,000 jobs at the European subsidiary. About half of Opel's 50,000 workers are based in Germany. The U.S. car giant confirmed in a statement to CNN that its revised viability plan for Opel ""will likely include cuts in that range."" Jürgen Rüttgers, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state, where GM proposes closing a factory, told the Financial Times: ""General Motors' behaviour shows the ugly face of turbo-capitalism. That is completely unacceptable."" German Opel workers reject GM's restructuring plan for the company, which they believe will see a drain of vehicle development from Germany to the United States, Lorenz said. Employees in Germany are not only unwilling to accept pay cuts moving forward, but they will also demand to be paid for concessions they have made, like giving up a scheduled pay rise in May, their 2008 Christmas bonus, and vacation pay for 2009, Lorenz said. GM promised to work with all the European labor unions on a plan for Opel's restructuring. The GM board of directors said an improving business environment over the past few months and the importance of Opel and its British brand, Vauxhall, to GM's global strategy were reasons to retain Opel. The board said it would begin restructuring its European operations ""in earnest"" instead, according to a news release issued late Tuesday. GM's decision is a setback for Magna, which agreed to purchase Opel and Vauxhall in September in a deal brokered by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. General Motors said in March that it wanted to sell Opel after it reported an annual loss of $30.9 billion for 2008. Opel, together with Vauxhaull, is the fourth-largest car brand in Europe after Volkswagen, Ford, and Renault. It is also GM's largest-selling brand in Europe by far, representing more than 70 percent of GM's European sales. While GM's decision may still mean layoffs as it restructures its European businesses, it may safeguard jobs in the short-term. Employees at the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, England, welcomed the news. ""I think it's a good idea, really, because a lot of people will have jobs,"" one employee told Sky News.

"Editor's note: Ed Rollins, a senior political contributor for CNN, was political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ed Rollins says Jack Kemp's intellect and force of personality helped guide the Republican party. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The world of politics has many players but few giants. One of the giants left the stage last week. I was privileged to have had Jack Kemp as a friend. Our friendship was not unique, because Jack Kemp had thousands and maybe tens of thousands of people who thought of themselves as his friend. He gave his friendship willingly and with a spirit of generosity. Those of us who knew him are saddened by his passing and the political world is a whole lot emptier because he's gone. When Jack entered a room he filled it with an energy and fervor and his presence was felt big-time. Every conversation with him became a debate, even if you agreed with him on an issue. Jack Kemp had no casual thoughts. I knew Jack for nearly 40 years. He was one of my early heroes. To this day I think of myself as a Reagan-Kemp Republican. We both were Californians who came out of blue-collar working-class roots. His father was a truck driver, my father a shipyard worker. We both wanted to remake the Republican Party into a party for working people where hard work was rewarded and opportunities were offered to every man and woman regardless of background, color, religion or beliefs. Jack went from a 13-year all-star career as the starting quarterback with the Buffalo Bills straight to Congress. He was first elected in 1970 and over the next four decades he was one of the most influential and popular men in the Republican Party. He was a true intellectual, a vociferous reader and was a warrior for his ideas. He took the intensity that made him the AFL's most valuable player directly to the halls of Congress without missing a beat. In his 18 years in Congress he was a leader of the new breed of conservatives. After he ran for president in 1988, he was appointed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by President George H.W. Bush. In 1996, he was the Republican vice presidential nominee running with Sen. Bob Dole's presidential effort . Along the way he was an extraordinary husband for 50 years to his wonderful Joanne and a remarkable father to his two sons, Jeff and Jimmy, and his two daughters, Jennifer and Judith, who provided him 17 grandchildren. I was the national chairman of Jack's presidential campaign in 1988. I believed he was the rightful heir to Ronald Reagan and that his conservative principles and ideas would continue to build on the foundation that President Reagan had established. Many of us thought Jack or Sen. Paul Laxalt, Reagan's closest friend and campaign chairman, should have been the vice presidential candidate in 1980. If either of them had been selected, he likely would have been the future president and there would not have been a Bush dynasty. They were the favorites of the convention delegates and President Reagan's top choices, too. He was argued out of them because people said you couldn't have a movie star running with a football star -- or two former governors from neighboring states (California and Nevada). Be that as it may. Jack's contributions to Ronald Reagan's legacy as the tax-cutting guru and unstoppable missionary of supply side economics made much of President Reagan's domestic policy possible. Even though he had always been a quarterback, he became a blocking back for President Reagan in moving his legislation through Congress. Shortly after he became HUD secretary in 1989, several National Football League team owners came to him offering him the job of National Football League Commissioner to replace his long time friend Pete Rozelle. He told me it was the one job he always wanted. My counsel was to take it. He called me back several days later and said he couldn't, because he felt he owed it to President Bush not to walk away after so short a time and that he so wanted to help all those in the urban communities who needed help. Jack was the Republican party's greatest advocate of a ""big tent theory"" and felt the party of Lincoln needed to do more to broaden civil rights and encourage minority participation. He often said he played and showered with more African-Americans then most Republicans meet in a lifetime. They were his friends, and in sports you learn all men bleed the same color. He often repeated the line: ""I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But I am here now, and I am going to yell from the rooftops about what we need to do."" And just as he led his Bills to back to back championships, he drove his party to an ideology that led to the Republican Congressional majorities in the '90s. Like all of us, Jack wasn't perfect, but he was darn good. As someone who tried to manage him, I found that he wasn't manageable. I once told him: ""Jack, if I could remove half your knowledge and three-quarters of your vocabulary, I could make you into a decent candidate."" He laughed and went on his merry way. And of course it was that incredible intellect and his passion for words as well as people that made him such a powerful force. Jack Kemp was the indefatigable happy warrior, who over the last four decades drove his party with an intellectual fervor that influenced every leader from President Reagan to Speaker Newt Gingrich. He fought for his ideas with an intensity like that of very few men I have known. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Ed Rollins: Jack Kemp helped guide Republican Party in 1980s and 1990s .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- A strong Russia is good for the United States, President Obama said in a speech in Moscow, where he is visiting in an effort to ""reset"" the countries' relations. President Obama meets with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Tuesday before heading to the G-8 in Italy. Obama delivered a commencement speech Tuesday at a Moscow graduate school. ""America wants a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia,"" he told a large crowd at the New Economic School. ""This belief is rooted in our respect for the Russian people, and a shared history between our nations that goes beyond competition."" He repeated the message in a meeting later with Russian business leaders, but also said Russia has to do more to fight corruption. ""We have to promote transparency, accountability, rule of law on which investments and economic growth depend,"" he said.  Watch Obama discuss thoughts on Kremlin visit » . ""We want Russia to be selling us goods and we want Russia to be buying goods from us,"" he said. ""Total trade between our countries is just $36 billion. Our trade -- America's trade with Russia -- is only about 1 percent of all our trade with the world -- 1 percent -- a percent that's virtually unchanged since the Cold War.""  Watch Obama's full opening statement » . Obama later met Russian opposition leaders, speaking of the importance for the country to ""not simply tolerate dissenting voices but also to respect and recognize dissenting voices."" Obama also spoke to civil society leaders, promising the United States will support universal values and human rights such as the rights of people to live as they choose, to have a free press and to speak their minds. On Monday Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and discussed a series of agreements -- including one on nuclear-arms reduction -- as part of an effort to strengthen ties between the one-time Cold War rivals. The two signed a deal on parameters for negotiations to replace the START agreement, with the goal of reducing nuclear weapons. START expires December 5.  Watch Obama discuss arms control pact » . Under Monday's agreement, Russia and the United States will reduce their strategic warheads to a range of 1,500 to 1,675, and their strategic delivery vehicles to a range of 500 to 1,100. The numbers would be a reduction from the expiring START, which allowed 2,200 warheads and 1,600 launch vehicles. The two-day summit in Moscow was to help refocus a relationship that, according to Obama, ""has suffered from a sense of drift"" in recent years. The president reiterated that in his speech Tuesday. ""That is why I have called for a 'reset' in relations between the United States and Russia,"" Obama said. ""This must be more than a fresh start between the Kremlin and the White House, though that is important,"" he said. ""It must be a sustained effort among the American and Russian people to identify mutual interests and to expand dialogue and cooperation that can pave the way to progress."" Obama met with Medvedev again Tuesday and with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin before heading to Italy for the Group of Eight summit. The G-8 agenda is packed with issues, including Iran, the global financial crisis, climate change and eradicating world poverty. Putin said his meeting with Obama was ""very good and substantive."" ""We also talked about how we will be improving our relations in the near- and medium-term. It was a very well-intentioned and substantial conversation in many concrete fields. We have many points we agree on,"" Russia's prime minister said. After his speech, Obama sat down with Ed Henry, CNN senior White House correspondent, for a brief interview. The president spoke about a wide range of issues, including how much his daughters were enjoying Moscow, his impressions of Putin, relations with Iran and Michael Jackson. On Iran, Obama reiterated recent statements about the post-election protests there. ""Events in recent weeks have disturbed the world. They are not only heartbreaking, but raise questions over where leaders want to take the country,"" Obama said. ""We have to wait and see how the dust settles. But we have to speak out and say that the Iranian people have to be treated with justice."" The president also spoke about the legacy of Michael Jackson, on the day of the pop star's public memorial program. ""No doubt he was one of greatest entertainers of our or any generation. Like Elvis, Sinatra, the Beatles, he became core part of our culture,"" Obama said. ""His extraordinary talent and music was mixed with big dose of tragedy in private life. It is important for us to affirm the best of him."" CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: PM Putin: Much agreement in ""well-intentioned, substantial"" talks .

"(CNN) -- The United States successfully tested a sea-based component of its missile defense shield Thursday evening, intercepting a ballistic missile with a dummy warhead over the Pacific Ocean, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said. A dummy missile is launched from a ship during a 2008 test of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program. The exercise was the 19th successful test in 23 attempts of the system -- known as the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Program -- since 2002. A target missile was fired from Hawaii about 5:40 p.m. (11:40 p.m. ET) and was tracked by Navy ships hundreds of miles away. The USS Hopper, one of three Navy ships tracking the launch, fired an interceptor missile, which struck the target about 100 miles above the Earth. The process -- from launch to shoot-down -- took less than five minutes, according to the U.S. military. The United States plans to use the sea-based system on Navy Aegis-class ships to protect against incoming short- to medium-range missiles fired from hostile countries. Eighty-six of the ships eventually will have the capability. Another part of the missile defense protection -- ground-based midcourse defense -- is designed to strike at long-range missiles. Both the sea-based and ground-based systems are part of the Pentagon's ""layered"" missile defense plan. Much of the missile defense program is still under development, including lasers fired from a plane that the military hopes would destroy an enemy missile during launch. Other parts of the missile defense would fire short-range missiles at incoming warheads that are close to hitting their targets. Over the past seven years, the U.S. military has spent billions of dollars on the missile defense program. Pentagon officials have said that each missile defense test costs about $85 million.","Ship-based system shoots down dummy missile from hundreds of miles away .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The suspect in last week's deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood urged in 2007 that Muslims in the U.S. Army be allowed to claim conscientious objector status when it comes to fighting other Muslims in war, a defense official said Tuesday. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan also discussed religious aspects of Islam during a presentation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as part of a final project for his residency tenure, said the official, who has knowledge of the investigation into Hasan. ""It's getting harder and harder for Muslims in the service to morally justify being in a military that seems constantly engaged against fellow Muslims,"" Hasan said, according to a slide show that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation. ""Muslims [sic] soldiers should not serve in any capacity that renders them at risk to hurting/killing believers unjustly,"" a Hasan slide said, though he added that individual feelings ""will vary!"" Hasan is the only suspect in the shooting at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas on Thursday that left 13 people dead and 42 wounded. Twelve of the dead were soldiers. Hasan remains in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, after having been shot by a police officer. Dr. Val Finnell, a former medical school classmate of Hasan's, described him as ""a very outspoken opponent of the war"" in the classroom and in public settings. ""He equated the war against terror with a war against Islam,"" Finnell said. He added that he was shocked by Thursday's shooting. ""However, that said, given the things that Maj. Hasan has said to me in the past and to other people, I am not surprised."" Hasan's comments came in what was supposed to be a medical seminar, The Washington Post reported, but instead he spoke to senior Army doctors about Islam. Hasan, a psychiatrist, aimed to describe ""religious conflicts that Muslims may have with the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" according to the newspaper's report. The report is based on a slideshow that The Washington Post said Hasan used in the June 2007 presentation. See the presentation and the Post's report . In a statement issued Monday night, the FBI said its investigation ""indicates that the alleged gunman acted alone and was not part of a broader terrorist plot."" Hasan came under investigation for a time last year when his communications with radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric's communications, a federal law enforcement official said. An employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, ultimately made the decision to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files. However, a senior defense department official said late Tuesday that the agency was not aware of any such communication. ""Contrary to reports we have seen in some news outlets, based on what we know now, neither the United States Army nor any other organization within the Department of Defense knew of Major Hasan's contacts with any Muslim extremists,"" the official said. ""Not until after the tragic shooting at Fort Hood last week were Major Hasan's e-mail communications first brought to our attention by federal investigators."" President Obama traveled to Fort Hood for a memorial service on Tuesday for the victims of the shooting. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other dignitaries also attended the service. Read profiles of the shooting victims . Hasan, 39, was wounded several times during the attack. His ventilator was removed over the weekend, and he began talking afterward, hospital spokesman Dewey Mitchell said. Federal agents attempted to interview Hasan on Sunday, but he refused to cooperate and asked for an attorney, according to senior investigative officials, who insisted they not be identified by name because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing federal investigation. Hasan has retained a lawyer, ex-military judge and retired Army Col. John Galligan, the attorney told CNN affiliate KXXV-TV. ""Like anybody that's facing criminal charges in the military arena, he's entitled to a defense counsel,"" Galligan told the station. Galligan said he had a 25-minute conversation with Hasan, and the two did not talk much about the Fort Hood shooting. ""There's still a lot to be done on the medical side,"" Galligan said. Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the Army in 1997. He was promoted to major in May and was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan sometime soon but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military. Hasan, a Muslim, also told his family that he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of September 11. In August, he reported to police that his car was keyed and a bumper sticker that read ""Allah is Love"" was torn off. A neighbor was charged with criminal mischief after that complaint.","Official: Let Muslims be conscientious objectors, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan said .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Want to boost your spending power? Try giving your wallet a break by shopping at a dollar store. Americans have embraced the four leading chains -- Dollar General, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree and the 99¢ Only store -- in droves during the recession. This year, Dollar General's sales were up almost 10 percent quarter-over-quarter, and they're opening 450 new stores, according to The New York Times. Dollar Tree, meanwhile, planned to open 235 new stores this year. And Family Dollar's early 2009 numbers pointed to sales being up 6.5 percent year-over-year. But despite the booming sales, Consumer Reports' Money Adviser has taken a close look at this hot retail segment and found that not everything is a deal. Before I tell you what they say to stock up on and what to pass on, I want to clarify something. There are important distinctions to note among the chains. Dollar General and Family Dollar both price the majority of their items at $1, but they also offer some merchandise at higher price points. Dollar Tree and the 99¢ Only chain are the only true dollar stores where everything is $1, with no exceptions. So what did Consumer Reports find? Cotton rounds, gift wrap, birthday candles, paper bags, composition notebooks, plastic cups, security envelopes, napkins, foam plates and tissue paper are among the best deals. Yet they advised against buying jewelry (too much lead content), electrical products (possibly fake UL labels), medication (expired products) and vitamins (probably not to be from reputable sellers) at any dollar stores. Now, I've routinely bought medication like ibuprofen at dollar stores and have not found it to be past expiration date. Of course, some would argue that I can get a better deal on ibuprofen at a warehouse club. But unless you're in constant pain, who can use all those 12 million pills in the bulk container before they expire?! The research that Consumer Reports did reminded me of a similar report in Good Housekeeping several years ago. At that time, the women's magazine compared four knockoff products from the dollar stores versus four brand name products purchased elsewhere. The products included generic glass cleaner, body lotion, dishwashing liquid and detergent. The brand name products were Windex, Lubriderm, Dawn and Tide, and they proved to better than their generic counterparts. For example, a teaspoon of Dawn washed 19 dishes, while a teaspoon of the dollar brand washed only six! As for the detergent, the dollar brand failed to wash out a mustard stain that Tide did. So the message is, let the buyer beware at the dollar stores. Certainly, there are some deals to be had, but you've got to be picky.","Recession has boosted spending at dollar stores .

"(CNN)  -- Thierry Henry could face FIFA disciplinary action over his handball which helped France to qualify for the finals of the 2010 World Cup at the expense of Ireland. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told reporters in Cape Town that the Barcelona striker's ""blatant unfair play"" could land him in hot water. ""The FIFA disciplinary committee will open an investigation ... concerning the behavior of the player Thierry Henry,"" he said. ""It was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world. I don't know the outcome of the disciplinary committee, let them make the decision. ""Fair play must be maintained in our game."" Blatter was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the FIFA executive committee, which was convened to consider the refereeing controversy in the France - Ireland match, incidents surrounding the Algeria - Egypt playoff tie and matchfixing in Europe. It had been widely trailed that the FIFA executive would sanction the use of two extra officials behind both goal lines in World Cup. But Blatter said that the finals in South Africa was too soon to introduce the system which has been used in the second-tier European club tournament this year. ""The experiments with the Europa League shall go on into the knockout stages next year but it has been decided, for the World Cup 2010, there is no change in the refereeing: one referee, two assistants and a fourth official."" He went on to say that there would be further investigation into both video technology and additional referees. ""We shall have a look at technology or additional persons and this shall be done by a committee but not the referees committee alone, it will be done by the football, technical and medical committees, too,"" he added. Ireland were denied a place in the finals by a goal that should have been disallowed because Henry used his hand to control the ball before setting up William Gallas to score the aggregate decider in the second leg in the Stade de France. Ireland subsequently launched two appeals, the first for the match to be replayed, the second for them to be added to the line-up for the finals as the 33rd team. Both have been rejected, but Blatter was forced to apologize to the Irish for making public their supposedly private bid to be included as an extra team. Blatter put their request into the public domain in light-hearted comments made in Johannesburg, which left Irish football officials infuriated and insulted. ""I would like to express my regrets for the wrong interpretation of what I said. I regret what I have created and I'm sorry to the Ireland football confederation for these headlines going around the world,"" he said. ""It's a pity I communicated in this way. Sorry again.""","Thierry Henry face disciplinary action over his handball in World Cup playoff match .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- What do you say when you meet one of the most iconic statesmen in the world? Mandela holds baby Freya as Robyn Curnow and her husband Kim look on. For someone who makes a living out of communications, I have consistently been tongue-tied around Nelson Mandela. The funny thing is I am not particularly star-struck -- as a CNN correspondent I get to interview and profile all sorts of ""famous"" people. It's just a not a big deal for me. However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day. As a South African he has a place in our hearts that is hard to define. However, my stories about my encounters with Nelson Mandela are the stuff of comedy clubs. I've never quite managed to hold my own with him. I always land up somehow embarrassing myself when I am around him; I've slipped on shiny presidential floors, got tangled up in camera equipment and made pathetically inane comments. I first met Nelson Mandela in the early 1990s. I can't remember exactly when, but it was at the Wanderers cricket stadium in Johannesburg. He visited the VIP room, during a test match, where I was working during school vacations and everybody lined up to meet him. I stood proudly and waited my turn, he came over to me. He was tall. He said to me, ""You are so gracious, I am so humbled to meet you."" I remember thinking, if Nelson Mandela thinks I am gracious -- fantastic. I promptly turned around and ungraciously tripped on my best shoes, tumbling into the crowd behind me. I was the one humbled. Years later, I was a young reporter working for the South African Broadcasting Corporation during Mandela's presidency. I wasn't senior enough to cover the big political stories of the day so news editors only assigned me the light hearted Mandela news stories. The one I remember most was around a birthday or Christmas during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson's kindergartens. Word had got out among the press that ""Twinkle twinkle little star"" was Madiba's favorite nursery rhyme, so, of course, all the children sang it for him. I sang along too, twinkle-finger actions included, it's a great song. Whether it was or not Madiba's favorite, is not something I have ever asked him. Years after that, I was taking a sabbatical from journalism and spent a year studying for my Masters degree at Cambridge University. Mandela just happened to be an honorary fellow at Magdalene College, where I was studying. He came to visit that year, giving a speech in the college's beautiful cloisters. I waved at him, as he passed by all of us students assembled in the quadrangle. Of course, he didn't wave back, but I felt gracious and humbled in his presence, protected by Magdalene's great walls. And then I turned to my awe-struck friends and said, ""Did you know his favorite song is 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?'"" -- which kind of killed the moment. Fast forward a few more years, I reported on Mandela occasionally during my time as a correspondent at CNN London's bureau. From a distance, I saw him get older and shakier on his feet. His hair got whiter and his public engagements lessened considerably. Once in while, I would regale my friends with Madiba's stories -- yes, there are more -- like the time I sneaked into the bathroom in his presidential mansion, desperate for relief, before a long-delayed press conference and phoned a friend from within to ask whether it was morally right to steal some of Nelson Mandela's soap. ( I didn't. It isn't very gracious). Or the time, I asked Zelda la Grange, his devoted personal assistant, to take a photo of me and Madiba together before I went up to Cambridge. He agreed and came over to me, throwing his arm around me and giving me squeeze a and joking, ""Ah, I am sure your boyfriend will be jealous."" Did you know that Nelson Mandela is a terrible flirt? Again, I became self-conscious. I was carrying my handbag over my shoulder and I didn't want the photo to look like I was Margaret Thatcher or my grandmother, for that matter, constantly clutching a handbag. So with his arm still firm around my middle, I bent down to put my handbag on the floor. That's when Zelda took the photo... unfortunately; the automatic flash went off on my camera. That's a complete no-no around Mandela -- his eyes were damaged during his years of imprisonment on Robben Island and flash photography is forbidden. So they whizzed away, slightly peeved, and I landed up with a ""Me and Mandela"" photograph that showed the president grinning into camera, holding me around the waist and me half bent over, lowering my handbag, with my head half cocked and eyes half closed. It was not mantelpiece material. I never thought I'd meet him again, up close and personal, until, last year when Zelda, ever the diplomat, like her boss, invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter, Freya, to him. My husband Kim and I had just returned back to live in South Africa, after nearly six years away in London. It was oddly nerve-racking, and I did what I always do in his presence I acted incredibly gauche, stupid and clumsy. I kept on saying: ""So how are you?"" As if he'd offer me a glass of wine, and say, ""Ya know Robyn, my knees are killing me, I'm bit worried about the situation in Zimbabwe and howz about them Mets?"" I offered my baby to him, like a little sacrificial lamb. The pictures tell it all. The ones we sent to friends (and everybody we knew), show us laughing with the world's greatest statesman. The ones we didn't email to the world show our daughter freaking out and crying. Madiba tried to placate her by wagging a finger at her and telling her, ""I am your great great grandfather."" She freaked out some more. I think she takes after her mother.","Curnow first met Mandela in 1990 and has encountered him several times .

"(CNN) -- When she heard news of the Continental Airlines plane that plunged into a house in suburban Buffalo, New York, on Thursday night, killing 50 people, Jenny Gomez experienced a familiar feeling creep deep within her psyche. ""It definitely sparked those old feelings of anxiety,"" she said. The risk of dying in a jet crash has been estimated to be one in 70 million, according to an MIT analysis. Gomez, 31 and a mother of two, was never afraid to fly during her childhood and early adolescence. ""I had flown all my life since I was very small, getting on a plane to visit my grandparents at least a couple of times a year, and I was fine,"" she remembered. Then, in her late adolescence, the panicky feelings began, slowly at first, but then the anxiety and nervousness started to snowball. ""Every bump, every shake of the plane would set me off."" Finally, during a college psychology class, she realized she fit the classic criteria for someone with a fear of flying, also known as aviophobia or aviatophobia. For five years, Gomez avoided flying altogether. ""I missed out on some really cool things in my life back then because I wouldn't get on an airplane,"" she said. An estimated 10 percent to 25 percent of the U.S. population experiences the phobia of flying, according to the American Psychological Association.  View a timeline of recent notable crashes » . In contrast, the risk of dying in a domestic jet crash has been estimated to be one in 70 million, according to MIT statistician Arnold Barnett, who has performed statistical analyses for the Federal Aviation Administration. Among the causes for aviatophobia is what many will experience as a result of seeing reports about the crash near Buffalo: vicarious trauma. This is trauma that one observes and subsequently develops within based on that observation. ""They see it, and they imagine what would that be like if it happened to me,"" said anxiety disorder psychologist R. Reid Wilson. By focusing on the possibility instead of the actual probability of the plane crashing, someone who's vulnerable to such fears can grow even more anxious about flying, he said. The fear of flying constitutes one of the two most common fears humans grapple with (the other one being fear of public speaking), said Wilson, who served as lead psychologist for American Airlines' first national program for fear of flying. Gomez's development of the phobia later in life is not unusual either, Wilson said; the average age of onset is 27, which is relatively old compared with when most other phobias begin. Some people who are subject to vicarious trauma actually see the crash scene in the media and actively put themselves in the scenario. Wilson has seen patients who fixate on visualizing themselves in the plane and who go so far as to seek out information such as how long the plane fell through the sky so they can intensify the reality of the experience in their minds. ""They get wrapped up in what is actually happening. Your body reacts to what you're seeing,"" he said. Another cause of the condition is the perception of a non-dangerous event -- such as turbulence or normal sounds that planes make -- as being an actual threat to one's safety. Many people afraid to fly actually have panic disorder, which is an anxiety disorder characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms. Having what Wilson refers to as a ""constellation of other fears"" could also contribute to the phobia of flying; claustrophobia, fear of death and being afraid of turning control over to the pilot could all contribute to the ultimate fear of the not-so-friendly skies. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . Overcoming the fear of flying begins with a solid trust in the aviation industry and the ability of the plane, the pilot and everyone involved in the safety of the flight to be competent. ""If it's about someone else, then you have no control, but if you shift your feelings of fear to yourself, then you can do something about it,"" Wilson said. Relaxation, meditation and breathing skills can improve the chances of surmounting one's distress. Distractions, such as having someone to talk to on the plane or focusing on an engrossing book, can also work to ease the tension. However, changing one's mind about the extreme unlikelihood that something would go wrong is key; relaxation and distractions serve as additional support systems. A licensed mental health professional can aid individuals seeking help to beat the fear of flying. Hypnotism can work too, especially when administered by someone trained in anxiety disorders. Virtual reality therapy, wherein a helmet is worn to simulate the experience of flying, has also been proved an effective technique, but the institutions providing virtual reality therapies are few and far between. In 2005, Gomez reached a crossroads. Her new job description would require her to travel frequently. A licensed counselor herself, she knew she could avail the services of a specialist to help her get past her fears. Perhaps the most useful part of her course of therapy, she reveals, was developing an understanding of the science behind aviation. ""If I was sitting in the cockpit, I would have had no problems at all. It's the lack of control, sitting in the back of the plane, that would get to me, so when I learned what all the sounds were and how unlikely it would be that the plane would actually fall out of the sky, that's what really helped me."" Another aid that worked for Gomez was Xanax, a drug often prescribed by doctors to provide temporary relief from the stress of flying. Working as a mild tranquilizer, Xanax, Valium and other benzodiazepine class drugs do not remove the underlying fear but instead work to dull the sensations. When Gomez finally started to fly again, she began with Xanax, a glass of wine and a meditation CD that she would listen to during the entire flight. Her anxiety progressively subsided over the course of a year and a half of regular flying for work. ""With each successful flight, I would need less and less help from the pills or the wine,"" she said. Finally, she let go of the medication and alcohol altogether and allowed her sense of trust to keep her calm.","10 percent to 25 percent of the U.S. population experiences the phobia of flying .

"KILLEEN, Texas (CNN)  -- Spc. Logan Burnette arrived at Fort Hood, Texas, a week ago Wednesday to prepare for an upcoming tour of Iraq. The following day, he, like all deploying soldiers, reported to the ""ready room"" on post to fill out final paperwork. However, what was to be another day of the mundane erupted into hell on Earth. Burnette heard shots, though that's a sound to which soldiers grow accustomed. He had been hearing blanks for many months of training. But on November 5 at Fort Hood, he quickly understood that something was terribly wrong when he saw the blood -- crimson everywhere. ""Seeing bullet wounds in the back of a friend's head, seeing friends grabbing their arms, and blood just everywhere. It's a pretty hard thing to see,"" Burnette recalled. ""And not having any way to defend yourself."" The gunman had been in the room for a while and had perfectly blended in with his Army combat uniform, his gold major rank emblazoned on his chest. No one had reason to pay him heed, Burnette said. When the madness began, the gunman popped up like a target at a shooting range. He just stood up and started firing methodically and with precision. He reloaded. And fired. Reloaded. And fired again. ""He was very swift, very tactical,"" said Burnette, sitting in a wheelchair at the Metroplex Adventist Hospital near Fort Hood, his left arm and hand bandaged. The mass shooting last week was the deadliest ever on a U.S. military base. Twelve soldiers and one civilian were killed; more than 40 others were wounded. Fifteen soldiers remained hospitalized on Wednesday, four in intensive care, according to Fort Hood spokesman Col. James Rossi. They were victims of a soldier who turned on his own, authorities say. Burnette saw the laser sights on the gunman's weapon. The shooter looked serious, intent. He screamed at the top of his lungs, ""Allahu akbar,"" which means 'God is great' in Arabic. Burnette dropped to the floor, hugging the ground for dear life. His mind was spinning. What insanity was this? ""Once I saw the blood, I realized I had to move,"" he said. ""I had to get out of there."" Burnette began to stand up and noticed the gunman was pointing in his direction. He picked up a folding table next to him -- it was the heaviest object he could see -- and hurled it toward the shooter. He knew it would draw the gunman's attention and divert his line of sight from others. Burnette said he wasn't trying to play a hero. ""There are guys overseas doing more than what I did,"" he said. ""I just happened to be at a certain place at a certain time in the world and hopefully I made a difference."" But that's when he got hit. He took a round that pierced his hip on the left side and tore through his abdomen. ""After the hit, I fell down, not even realizing I had been hit,"" he said. ""As I tried to get back up, I was shot in the elbow on the left arm and ... the knuckle on the left pinky finger."" He was like a wounded animal desperate to escape the hunter's aim. ""He wanted to kill all of us,"" Burnette said. ""We were all unarmed."" Burnette's gut felt like a knife slicing through it. He couldn't feel his leg. His left arm was numb, too. He stared at it and thought of those dummy arms that people buy at Halloween. ""Oh my God,"" he thought. ""This guy shot me."" Burnette began moving with every ounce of strength he could muster and hid in a nearby cubicle. The gunman had started moving to the other side of the building, reloading and shooting. Reloading and shooting. Burnette knew he had to get out of that building. ""As I started to run, I fell again, not realizing I couldn't use my left leg."" After falling, Burnette said, he ""threw all of my body weight ... towards that door as hard and as fast as possible."" ""Once I hit that front door, I began to low crawl, about five meters up a hill just, you know, pushing my body forward with everything I had,"" he said. A staff sergeant grabbed him by his uniform collar and dragged him into an office and locked the door. ""Everything is going to be all right,"" the sergeant told him, as he began administering first aid. Burnette said he doesn't know the sergeant's name, but he will recognize him instantly if their paths ever cross again. ""Our Father who art in heaven ... hallowed be thy name."" Burnette, a practicing Catholic, lie on the ground, repeating the prayer over and over again. He didn't know whether he would see his wife again. A week later, Burnette has undergone two operations and still has a bullet lodged in his right hip. On Wednesday, he was making his way to the Army's Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, for further treatment. He knows that's where Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the accused shooter, is also being treated. ""I can't really think about it,"" Burnette said. ""I have a lot of faith in our military, our judicial system -- and God."" Soldiers are taught from day one that you help the wounded, even when they are enemies in combat, even the guy who shot you. ""Don't get me wrong,"" he said, ""Everything in your heart wants to [unleash] anger at this person, but we have to trust that our system works somehow. ""By no means am I happy that he is in better shape than a lot of my comrades,"" Burnette said about the suspect. ""But I'm not here to play God, either."" Ultimately, Burnette said, he is sorry for a man who feels the need to execute unarmed personnel, his comrades, in the name of God. Does he pity the Fort Hood shooter? ""Yeah,"" he said, pausing. ""To an extent."" CNN's Sanjay Gupta and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.","Spc. Logan Burnette's original day at Fort Hood turned to nightmare .

"(CNN)  -- Hundreds of U.S. and Afghan soldiers have embarked on a major operation against militants in the eastern Afghan region of Tora Bora, near the border with Pakistan, officials have told CNN. File photo of the remote mountain Tora Bora region on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Air and ground strikes under way in the remote mountain region are aimed at large numbers of militant fighters. The troops are targeting ""hundreds of hardened al Qaeda and Taliban in dug-in positions,"" said officials familiar with the intelligence. The operation started two days ago in the region, where al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was once thought to be hiding. The Bush administration has been criticized for not sending enough ground forces to Tora Bora in December 2001 to capture the militant after the invasion that toppled the Taliban. ""U.S. and Afghan forces engaged al Qaeda and other violent extremist fighters in eastern Afghanistan during a combined arms assault using precision munitions. There have been no substantiated reports of civilian casualties in this engagement,"" said Capt. Vanessa R. Bowman, a U.S. Army spokeswoman. ""The targets were carefully chosen to pinpoint enemy positions and eliminate the likelihood of harming innocent civilians,"" she said. ""This region has provided an ideal environment to conceal enemy support bases and training sites, as well as plan and launch attacks aimed at terrorizing innocent civilians, both inside and outside the region."" Also Wednesday, a manager at a private British security firm in Afghanistan was shot and killed in the capital Kabul, a spokesman for the company said. ""We did lose a manager today in Kabul to unknown assailants,"" Christopher Beese, spokesman for ArmorGroup International, said Wednesday. He said next of kin have been notified and an inquiry into the incident has begun. The name of the man, a British national, was not released. ""It's bad news. He was a very well-respected man,"" Beese said, noting that the victim had experience in Afghanistan going back to the early 1980s. Beese -- who said the man's role was to run the administration of the 1,200-person-strong security presence in the country -- described the man as a ""logistics manager"" and ""all things to all people."" The firm, which has been operating in Afghanistan since 2002, mostly provides diplomatic protection and has contracts with the British and American governments. The man recruited and trained Afghan guards and was the most senior administrator at the company's Kabul base, Camp Anjuman, the company said. E-mail to a friend .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For 8-year-old Ryan Mohar, an elevator isn't just an elevator. He spends hours pressing the buttons and riding up and down, preferring this to the slew of alternatives that his teachers offer -- even candy. Ryan Mohar, who has autism, gets treated with ABA approaches at the Marcus Autism Center. Ryan is one of many American children with autism, a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive behaviors or limited interests, and difficulties with communication and social interactions. At the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, Ryan and other children with communication and behavior difficulties get help through a rigorous empirical method called Applied Behavior Analysis. ""Decades of research has shown that that is the treatment of choice, and results in the best gains in terms of skill acquisition and behavior problem reduction for kids with autism and other developmental disabilities,"" said Alice Shillingsburg, program coordinator of the center's Language and Learning Clinic. The effectiveness and nature of ABA is particularly relevant as many parents fight for insurance companies to cover it and other autism treatments. The organization Autism Speaks has endorsed bills in 25 states that would require private health insurance policies to cover the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders for anyone under the age of 21. The legislation would specifically be targeted at ABA and other structured autism therapies. Only eight states have autism insurance reform, according to Autism Speaks. While ABA encompasses a broad range of practices of studying and changing behavior, the one usually associated with autism is called discrete trial instruction. A trial consists of a cue, the opportunity to respond and a reward.  Watch therapists using applied behavior analysis on Ryan » . For example, a therapist might try to teach a child who likes sweets to request candy. The trial gets repeated over and over so that the child learns that candy comes only as a result of the request. The clinicians at Marcus Autism Center carefully record how many trials the child successfully completes.  Learn more about autism » . ""If suddenly they can emit some vocal response, and suddenly when they do that, candy appears -- someone delivers candy to them -- that's a very powerful response for that child,"" said Nathan Call, director of Behavior Treatment Clinics at the Marcus Autism Center. Analysts examine progress based on such data at least once a day -- sometimes five or six times a day -- and will change the treatment plan if necessary. In Ryan's case, a trial begins when his clinical specialist takes him near the elevator and asks him to hand over a card -- his way of requesting access to the elevator. If Ryan gives the card, he gets to go to the elevator, and that is the end of one trial. If he does not, his helpers walk him away, and a new trial begins. Experts working with Ryan hope that teaching him to ask for the things he enjoys -- elevator rides, elevator buttons -- will help him stop running away, which he does even at home. In fact, Ryan wears a GPS-equipped ankle bracelet so that police can track him if he gets far from home. ABA is very effective, but the term ""cure"" is inaccurate, experts said. Autism describes a broad range of characteristics, not an underlying cause, Call said. ABA techniques can produce significant behavior changes, however. ""The goal is not necessarily for the child to have hit all of their developmental milestones, necessarily, but rather it's hopefully to get them to a point where they're able to take advantage of a more typical or less restrictive educational environment,"" he said. Studies have shown that 60 percent of high-functioning children can lose their diagnosis of autism by age 8 by using ABA, according to the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a leading center in autism research and treatment in Baltimore, Maryland. Not everyone is so enthusiastic about ABA, however. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, associate professor of pediatric neurology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, cautions that the treatment should fit the child, and ABA may not work as well for some children as other types of therapy. An alternative approach is play-based therapy, whereby the therapist takes cues from the child rather than the other way around. For example, if a child is bouncing a ball, the therapist would take that as an opportunity to encourage the child to bounce the ball back to him or her, Wiznitzer said. One of the pioneers of ABA is Ivar Lovaas, a child psychologist who in the 1960s began investigating how to help children who injured themselves. His research showed that components of ABA could reduce these behaviors. The therapy has evolved since then, however. In the beginning, the approach to ABA was more dogmatic and ""cookie-cutter,"" Wiznitzer said. A child who cooperated got a reward, but a child who did not cooperate got a punishment such as yelling or a squirt of water. ""ABA in a classic sense is a very restricted, very limited program that has issues with the ability to generalize the learned skill outside of the ABA environment,"" he said. A family once told him that their child showed great restaurant manners -- but only in the basement, he said. Today, many analysts who use ABA as a guide go more with the flow of the needs of the child, he said. ABA isn't just for children with autism -- the methods have been used for people of all ages, with and without disabilities. Staff members at Marcus Autism Center try to help children use the skills they learn outside of the artificial environment of the classroom. ""They're doing research here on finding the best way to create those moments where the child really needs information in order to complete a preferred task or to gain access to a preferred activity or a preferred outcome,"" Call said. Another criticism of ABA is that children become mechanical because they learn to have only one specific response for a given prompt in real life. Call's response is that variability is just another behavior that can be taught, but noted that there are trade-offs. Parents have input in the decision to focus more on teaching a lot of different skills, rather than to teach several responses in any one situation. ""Oftentimes, the goal is to focus more on giving as many functional skills as possible to that child, so they can have as fulfilling a life as they can,"" Call said. ABA is extremely costly, however. For the behavior clinics, therapy sessions at Marcus Autism Center begin at $60 per hour, and go higher in price depending on the expert who is providing the treatment -- a session with someone with a master's or doctorate may cost more. A person with autism costs society about $3.2 million over the course of his or her lifetime, according to a 2007 study in the journal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. Direct medical costs for the first five years are, on average, about $35,000, the study said. For children from non-English-speaking families, two staff members at Marcus Autism Center speak Spanish, and an outside translator can be brought in if necessary for other languages, said Chris Tullis, a clinical specialist. But the Association for Behavior Analysis International told CNN that it does not have any ""board-certified therapists"" in Atlanta who report speaking Spanish. As for Ryan, after only about two weeks at Marcus Autism Center, his screaming has come down from more than 200 times an hour to about 38, Call said. ""It looks promising, but we've got 10 more weeks to actually find out what's really going to work the best with Ryan,"" Tullis said.","Applied behavior analysis is a rigorous empirical method to teach behaviors .

"Editor's note: Kevin Pho, a primary care physician in Nashua, N.H., blogs at KevinMD.com . Dr. Kevin Pho says health reform can't succeed as long as there's a shortage of primary care doctors. (CNN) -- When President Obama recently cited the number of Americans without health insurance, he declared that, ""We are not a nation that accepts nearly 46 million uninsured men, women, and children."" Uninsured patients often delay preventive care, waiting to seek medical attention only when their conditions worsen. This leads to more intensive treatment, often in the emergency department or hospital where costs run the highest. Universal health coverage is therefore a sensible goal, and the reforms being considered all make considerable effort to provide everyone with affordable health care. But expanding coverage cannot succeed as long as there remains a shortage of primary care clinicians. After all, what good is having health insurance if you can't find a doctor to see you? Massachusetts is often held out as a model for national health reform, and the bills being considered in Washington emulate much of that state's 2006 landmark universal coverage law. As a physician in neighboring New Hampshire, I have had the opportunity to observe the effect of the Massachusetts reforms. Today, 97 percent of Massachusetts residents have health insurance, the highest in the country. But less publicized are the unintended consequences that the influx of half a million newly insured patients has had on an unprepared primary care system. The Massachusetts Medical Society reported that the average wait time for a new patient looking for a primary care doctor ranged from 36 to 50 days, with almost half of internal medicine physicians closing their doors entirely to new patients. And when you consider that Massachusetts already has the highest concentration of doctors nationwide, wait times will likely be worse in other, less physician-abundant parts of the country, should universal coverage be enacted federally. When patients are forced to wait weeks to obtain medical care, they inevitably find their way into the emergency department for treatment that ordinarily can be handled in a doctor's office. Indeed, since health reform was passed, according to state data provided to the Boston Globe, Massachusetts emergency rooms have reported a 7 percent increase in volume, which markedly inflates costs when you consider that emergency room treatment can be up to 10 times more expensive than an office visit for the same ailment. Alwyn Cassil, a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change, told HealthDay News that expanding coverage without improving access to care is a ""recipe for failure,"" as well as unsustainable, ""because it will just bankrupt us."" Massachusetts is finding out just how difficult it is to fiscally maintain universal coverage. In part due to soaring health costs, the state Legislature has proposed reducing health benefits for 30,000 legal immigrants and cutting funding to inner-city hospitals like Boston Medical Center, which, according to the Boston Globe, may ""force it to slash programs and jeopardize care for thousands of poverty-stricken families."" The success of universal health coverage depends on an adequate supply of primary care providers. But the Association of American Medical Colleges is forecasting a shortage of 46,000 primary care physicians by 2025, a deficit that not only will balloon under any universal coverage measure, but cannot be made up as doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants all gravitate towards more lucrative specialty practice. It's not only the financial incentives that need to substantially change for primary care to prosper. More important, the working conditions for the physicians already in the field have to improve. A recent survey in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that roughly half of primary care doctors reported practicing in a work environment ""strongly associated with low physician satisfaction, high stress ... and [an] intent to leave."" Primary care clinicians routinely face unreasonable time pressures, a chaotic work pace, and bureaucratic impediments. Onerous paperwork requirements that obstruct patient care have to be reduced. And instead of the current system which encourages doctors to rush through as many office visits as possible, physicians who take the time to counsel, guide, and address all of their patients' concerns should be rewarded. Better valuing the doctor-patient relationship will increase satisfaction, not only for physicians, but for their patients as well. Such solutions, however, have been largely absent from the health reform conversation. Although it is a moral imperative for every American to have access to health insurance, alleviating the shortage of primary care providers is of equal importance. The prospect of suddenly adding tens of millions of patients to an overburdened primary care system has the potential to make the already dire state of American health care even worse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Pho.","Kevin Pho: It's important to extend coverage to the uninsured .

"(CNN) -- A man charged with murder in the deaths of 11 women pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity Thursday, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, prosecutor. A grand jury has indicted Anthony Sowell on 85 counts, following the discovery of 11 sets of human remains at his Cleveland, Ohio, house in October. The charges include several counts of aggravated murder with a ""mass murder specification,"" meaning multiple people were killed in a similar fashion, said Bill Mason, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor. Sowell, 50, faces rape and kidnapping charges as well and also has been charged with brutalizing three other women and raping two of them, Mason said. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Sowell. Investigators arrested him in October after authorities serving a search warrant in a rape case discovered the remains of six women in and around his house. Subsequent searches turned up the remains of five others. All 11 remains were of African-American women. Police used cadaver dogs Wednesday to search Sowell's childhood home, just outside Cleveland. ""We're just trying to cover all our bases,"" said Scott Wilson, spokesman for the FBI, which is assisting local detectives in the case. Authorities have said they are looking at the unsolved slayings of three women in East Cleveland to determine if they share any similarities with the remains found at Sowell's house. The indictment against Sowell also alleges that he assaulted women on December 8, 2008, and on September 22 and October 20 of this year. The women in September and October were raped, and the other woman was punched and choked before escaping, Mason said. Sowell's charges in those cases include attempted murder, rape or attempted rape, kidnapping, robbery and felonious assault. Sowell has pleaded not guilty to charges in the September 22 rape. On October 20, neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor of his house. Firefighters responded and later notified police. But the woman told officers she fell off the roof while she was at the home ""partying,"" police said earlier. No charges were filed at the time. Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police, Mason said. It's possible there are others, he added, and urged anyone who has not come forward to do so. Sowell ""knew what he was doing was wrong at the time he was doing it,"" the prosecutor said. As of last month, Sowell was on suicide watch at the request of his public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. She had said a psychiatric evaluation of Sowell had been ordered but was unlikely to happen until after an indictment was filed. Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid told reporters this week that Sowell has been a ""model prisoner,"" is kept in an isolated unit and has declined visitation requests. Most of the victims were strangled by ligature -- which could include a string, cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand, officials said. Seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. The skull of one woman was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the home's basement. Sowell served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape and was released in 2005. He was required to register as a sex offender. After the discovery of the 11 women, police in mid-November used thermal imaging in an attempt to see if any additional human remains were on the property and dug certain areas by hand. No more remains were found.","Suspect pleads not guilty by reason of insanity .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From bedroom creators to big studios, hand-drawn to CGI, animation has charmed and entertained children -- and, increasingly, adults -- for many years. The Screening Room went to Annecy in France to discover the secrets of success in animated films... Annecy has hailed animators like director Tim Burton, seen here receiving a special award at Annecy in 2006. Annecy is the Cannes of animation. The French town, which lies close to the Swiss border just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Geneva, has hosted the International Animated Film Festival for almost half a century and attracts a younger crowd than many of the major film festivals. With prizes for long and short features, television and student animation, Annecy highlights a wide variety of different types of animation and budgets. One veteran of Annecy is Craig Decker, known as worldwide cult figure ""Spike"" and co-founder of ""Spike and Mike's Sick & Twisted Festival of Animation."" Beginning 30 years ago as a means of bringing independent animation to new audiences, the touring festival was instrumental in showcasing the early works of legendary animators such as Tim Burton, Pixar's John Lasseter and Aardman's Nick Park, as well as the first episode of ""Beavis and Butthead."" Spike explained to CNN the challenge of getting animation taken seriously. He said, ""Originally we had to deal with the stigma. We showed great films like National Film Board of Canada [pieces], or ""Tin Toy"" by John Lasseter, works of art, masterpieces that take two to three years to make, and we had to deal with, 'What is it? Cartoons like Bugs Bunny or something like that?' And over the years we've educated the public, and we've put animation in the context of a very cool thing [with] a young, hip, adult audience of 18 and over."" Stop-motion classics . One of Spike and Mike's biggest fans, Nick Park, won the Annecy award for Best TV Animation with ""Shaun the Sheep,"" a spin-off from ""A Close Shave,"" one of Aardman's famous Wallace and Gromit short features that grabbed an Oscar. Stop-motion is also close to the heart of director Tim Burton, who employed the technique on ""Corpse Bride"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" He said, ""Because it's such an old-fashioned technique, a lot of it truly has to do with finding the right group of animators, the right group of people to build the puppets, because a lot of things are being done by computer now. Very few people are doing this style of animation."" Allison Abbate, a producer on ""Corpse Bride,"" added, ""Stop motion is an age-old process as far as animation in film-making goes. It hasn't really changed since the days of King Kong - we used new technology in 'Corpse Bride' to bring it into a new century."" Appropriate animation . ""I think there's room for all types of animation,"" she continued. ""It depends on the story. The story should really decide how you tell it. I think there are stories that are better made in 2-D and CGI and that's what you'd go for."" 2-D animation is the mainstay of Japanese anime - a subject so vast it will command its own feature in a subsequent edition of the Screening Room. The film ""Paprika"" has won worldwide critical praise during the past year as a sophisticated example of the art, whose keenest supporters are sometimes contemptuous of their Hollywood animation counterparts. Asia is becoming an increasingly powerful force in animation, where companies who traditionally provided a cheap source of labor for animation studios are now using their skills to take a leading role in the creative process. UTV Toons is one of several Indian companies forming partnerships with big U.S. production houses to make new animated features. Combination of skills . Animation requires a combination of several skills, as producer Allison Abbate explained. She told CNN that animators face many complex challenges. ""Animators have to know how to move things, how things work anatomically in a space, but they also have to know how to act, how to emote and that is what makes animation so different from live action. It is so crafted, one frame at a time."" But Spike points out that the rewards animation promises can be very high. ""Obviously in features, look at the most successful films,"" he told CNN. ""They're nearly all animated Pixar pieces or, if it's live action, it's the special effects animation that carries the film."" And the future? Spike believes animation is going mobile. He said, ""Internationally, what's exciting is with new media: with digital; with broadband; with mobile phones. That's where we're going with our stuff.""

"(CNN) -- What could be bigger than the appointment of the first female minister in Saudi Arabia? Saudi King Abdullah made more than one noteable appointment to his council of ministers. Possibly the appointment of a new minister of justice who may actually help her get equal rights with her male counterpart. Right now, Norah al-Faiz, the new deputy minister for women's education, is bound by the same laws as every other woman in the land. She can do only what her closest male relative permits. For many women of her status and education, that law is interpreted liberally, but for the vast majority, it is not. Over the weekend, at a single stroke, King Abdullah set Saudi Arabia on what appears to be an irreversible new course, one of modernization. He replaced the conservative ministers of justice and the head of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice with people closer to his way of thinking. The king also appointed a new head of the central bank, SAMA -- widely seen by financial experts as a wise move -- and brought in young blood and fresh ideas to the Majlis al Shura, the closest thing the country has to a parliament. That these changes happened should not be a surprise. Since he took over as king in August 2005, when his ailing half-brother Fahd died, King Abdullah has been working quietly to bring about change. Indeed, al-Faiz used to lead the king's Center for National Dialogue, a sort of talking shop that allowed issues such as women's rights to be debated. The hope was that as discussions about change bubbled up in national and regional arenas, they would also filter out to newspapers and onto television. It's exactly what's been happening. The king is well into his 80s and inherited many ministers and other top officials almost as old as him. Many had been in their posts for decades, and many, unlike the king, held their conservative upbringings more than half a century ago to be models for the country's future. So when a judge recently upheld the marriage of a 47-year-old man to an 8-year old-girl, there was a public backlash. Why? Because debate about this issue had percolated into the public arena. And suddenly the judge looked out of step with society. It's not what made the king decide to replace the minister of justice; it just highlights how his steady behind-the-scenes work has helped him outflank the sizeable conservative segment of Saudi society. What the king and many of his fellow royals have realized for a long time is that no country is an island, least of all one as rich and prosperous as Saudi Arabia. The kingdom's large and rapidly growing young population watches satellite TV, surfs the Internet and chats on Blackberries with friends in Europe, and it expects a different future than the one currently on offer. The sweeping changes remove some of the ministers most likely to hold back the next generation. The old Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice commission head, who runs the religious police, is an example. He has been replaced with someone closer to the king's thinking, according to a deputy minister I talked with. The religious police patrol shopping malls and streets, enforcing religious laws such as ones requiring women to keep their heads covered and refrain from talking to men who aren't their relatives. They rile the youngsters who strain for more freedom. But no one is expecting revolutionary change overnight. Saudi Arabia is not about to become a ""permissive society."" Religious law, long-held customs and deep religious principles are not up for negotiation. After all, the Saudi king derives respect and authority from his role as ""guardian"" of Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina. To be less than thoroughly religious would not wash, even with Saudi's moderates. King Abdullah is calculating that he is making change at a pace people can cope with. On a recent visit to a shopping mall where religious police had taken a back seat for the past year, it seemed to me the octogenarian king is just about keeping up. The religious police were in the background, and among young girls in particular, headscarves were gone and lipstick was in bright abundance.","With minister picks, king appears to have put Saudi Arabia on a new course .

"(CNN) -- When Maggie Sorrells looks at her husband, Andy, she doesn't see the man she married. In fact, most days, she doesn't even recognize herself. Maggie and Andy Sorrells weighed 440 pounds and 505 pounds, respectively, at their heaviest. Before the Franklin, Tennessee, couple met online, both had endured lifelong struggles with weight and emotional overeating. Together, they had a combined weight of nearly 1,000 pounds. Maggie, who had a family history of heart disease and diabetes, had been warned by her doctor at the age of 27 that she wouldn't live to see 30. But her real moment of truth came when she visited her mother in the hospital. ""The biggest shock of my entire life was stepping on a hospital scale and realizing I weighed 440 pounds,"" she recalls. Until that moment, Maggie says she never knew how much she weighed, because she was too heavy to register on a household scale. Andy, like Maggie, tried countless diets but failed to keep the weight off. At his heaviest, he was 505 pounds and had to have most of his size 64 clothing made by his mother to fit his 6-foot-3-inch frame.  See before-and-after photos of CNN.com I-Reporters »  Obesity took an emotional and physical toll on the couple. Andy says people constantly teased him about his weight and he eventually withdrew. He battled depression and took anti-depressants for seven years. Maggie, on the other hand, tried to conceal her misery by making other people laugh. ""I was so depressed and so miserable. I was always the funny fat girl, but on the inside I was miserable,"" recalls Maggie. ""It held me back in many ways and I started to accept it as being genetic and felt this was just the way I was going to be."" Though she never let her obesity keep her from traveling or socializing, it had affected her quality of life. Maggie had to use a seatbelt extension on airplanes and was once asked to get off a roller-coaster at an amusement park. In August 2002, the couple was married and they soon made a decision that would forever change their lives. Before getting married, a friend introduced Maggie to The Weigh Down Workshop, a faith-based weight loss program, which teaches people to conquer their addiction to food, as well as other substances and vices, by turning to God. Maggie says she was never consistent or committed enough to stick with the program. But shortly after their wedding, the couple started packing on the pounds and while Andy tried another diet, Maggie gave Weigh Down another try. ""At the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003, I called Weigh Down and started taking the classes,"" says Maggie. ""My whole life, I had always wanted somebody to [lose weight] with me. But I knew if I wanted it bad enough, I would have to do it alone."" She began to lose weight. ""I ate whatever I craved, but only when I was truly hungry and then I ate a lot more slowly, so I could tell when to stop,"" Maggie says. In February 2003, after seeing his wife's results, Andy stopped counting calories, gave up the low-fat foods and reduced his portion sizes. Fifteen months later, he had lost 257 pounds. ""Once I started this program, it changed my outlook on my entire life. I realized that being happy is a choice. I can either be filled with hate and despair or I can be happy,"" says Andy, who realized he no longer needed the anti-depressants. Maggie's weight loss was more gradual. Shortly after starting the program, Maggie became pregnant with the couple's first child. Sadly, she lost the baby when she was seven months pregnant. ""Many of our family members were afraid that we would turn back to food after we lost our first daughter, since we had turned to food to solve our problems our whole lives,"" remembers Maggie.   Faith, she says, helped her overcome the loss and continue on the program. Three years later, she had not only lost 300 pounds but she also gave birth to another daughter, Lily. Last week, the couple welcomed their son, Jacob. How has the weight loss changed their lives? Maggie, who now weighs 140 pounds and wears a size six, and Andy, who weighs 220 pounds and wears a size 36, say they had no idea their lives could be this good.  ""It blows my mind that we look the way we do,"" says Maggie. The couple shares their success and strategy for weight loss by leading online classes for Weigh Down. Maggie believes if just one person's life can be changed by her story then her struggle will have been worth it.  ""I want people to know there is hope. I looked for hope my whole life,"" says Maggie. ""I want that person who is just like the old me to look at where I am now and know that you want to be here!""  iReport.com: Have you lost weight?

"(CNN) -- An Alaska lottery held to raise money for a group that helps sexual abuse victims had a surprise winner: a convicted sex offender. Alec Ahsoak in an undated photograph. Alec Ahsoak, who according to the state sex offender registry was convicted in 1993 and 2000 for sexual abuse of a minor, came forward Saturday with the winning ticket for the $500,000 Lucky Time Pull Tabs jackpot.

"(CNN) -- You'd think someone who lasted 17 years as host of a television program in this day and age -- particularly a show as venerable as NBC's ""Tonight Show"" -- would be receiving praise and honor. Jay Leno has rarely impressed critics, but he's been the No. 1 late-night host for almost 15 years. Not so Jay Leno, whose final ""Tonight Show"" is Friday. ""Without fail, Leno's show fills an hour and kills an hour,"" wrote The Associated Press' Frazier Moore in a recent column on Leno's ""Tonight"" legacy. ""For 17 years in late night he has vigorously played a game of lowered expectations, and met them."" Ouch. Leno has never been the critics' favorite. David Letterman, who watched Leno receive Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show"" desk but never Carson's blessing, has long been touted as the King of Late Night's true successor with his CBS show. Conan O'Brien, who began his run as Letterman's NBC successor facing howls of derision, leaves it with some critics' hopes that he'll infuse the ""Tonight Show,"" his new home as of Monday, with new life.  Watch how the late-night scene is changing » . And Leno? He'll leave behind the heavily rimshotted jokes, the Dancing Itos, the ""Jaywalking"" and ""Headlines"" bits -- all the things that drove Letterman and O'Brien fans up the wall -- with an audience of 5 million, still tops among late-night TV shows. And he'll be moving to prime time in September. Some CNN iReporters, asked to choose between Leno and O'Brien, say it's no contest. iReport: Whom do you prefer? ""I feel like Jay Leno is more for men and women,"" said iReporter Melissa Fazli of Yorba Linda, California. ""Where I think Conan O'Brien, only men get. ... I don't get his sense of humor."" ""Jay Leno is like everybody's cool guy to go to. You want to hang out with Jay,"" said Kyle Aevermann of Itasca, Illinois. Leno's comedy has usually played off his regular-guy persona. In the 1980s, when he was a regular guest on Letterman's ""Late Night,"" Dave used to welcome a wound-up Leno with a jovial, ""What's your beef, Jay?"" To which Leno -- who looked like a cross between a class clown and a Boston greaser -- would respond with a well-turned wisenheimer riff on being stuck in the middle seat on airplanes or evil-twin plots on television. (YouTube is full of Leno's old ""Late Night"" appearances.) Moore and other critics may criticize Leno for ""lowered expectations,"" but upon taking the reins of ""Tonight"" on May 25, 1992, Leno opted for a more Jack Paar-esque ""Tonight"" show, mixing raconteurs among the comedians, actors and pop singers. Along with the usual entertainers -- Tom Cruise, Rosie O'Donnell -- among his early guests were opera singer Kathleen Battle, humorist P.J. O'Rourke and author-reporter Robert Krulwich. But the show, also beset by infighting between Leno's then-executive producer and NBC brass, suffered in the ratings, often finishing behind Letterman's CBS ""Late Show,"" which premiered in 1993. Sources give various reasons for the turnaround -- a new set, Leno's growing comfort, broader jokes -- but generally pinpoint the moment Leno became late night's leader to the appearance of one guest: Hugh Grant. The actor, who was promoting his film ""Nine Months,"" appeared on ""Tonight"" in July 1995, just after his arrest for consorting with a prostitute. Leno led off the interview with a humorously exasperated, ""What the hell were you thinking?"" The audience picked up, and ""Tonight"" has led the late-night ratings ever since. Entertainment Weekly recently named the Grant interview the best moment of Leno's ""Tonight"" tenure. Leno, though he's been portrayed as a ferocious backroom infighter -- before striking a deal for the 10 p.m. talk-variety show he'll lead in the fall, he made no secret of his willingness to leave NBC -- generally lets criticism go by like a morning mist. ""Trash talking is a part of the competition,"" he said after hearing about a jab from ABC's Jimmy Kimmel. ""You do your best. It gives you the impetus to prove them wrong."" And the man must be doing something right. Until being hospitalized last month, he'd never missed a ""Tonight"" taping. He's done 3,775 episodes, about 750 fewer than Carson, but in 13 fewer years. He still gets out on the road, recently putting on free shows for Detroit autoworkers. In fact, the criticism aimed at Leno can be reminiscent of the complaints aimed at reliable-but-dull cars. When an auto executive was asked why his top-selling vehicle -- often compared to vanilla ice cream -- remained so popular, he pointed out that although some people may find vanilla ice cream boring, a lot of people like it. Leno, a major auto buff, must know what he means.","Jay Leno concludes 17 years as ""Tonight Show"" host Friday .

"(CNN) -- Akil Vohra quit a lucrative job in international trade litigation to take up something he strongly believes in -- as a legal expert, a Muslim and, most importantly, he says, as an American. He wanted to make sure that Muslims could fulfill zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam that mandates the giving of alms. Zakat is especially important during the holy month of Ramadan, which ends on Saturday. But after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a dark cloud hung over Muslim charities as the federal government heightened scrutiny over terrorism concerns. Zakat suddenly became a risky religious obligation. Agencies all over America from women's shelters and health clinics to inner-city community centers saw donation checks dry up. ""The fear of giving was very real, said Vohra, 33, who now works for San Francisco-based Muslim Advocates, an agency that was created to address two needs in post-September 11 America: racial profiling of Muslims and charitable giving. Muslim Advocates partners with the Better Business Bureau to attain accreditation for Muslim nonprofits so that agencies can attain greater transparency and overcome perceptions of wrongdoing. Plus, people can feel more at ease about their donations. The Muslim Charities Accreditation Program, which began in August 2008, examines nonprofits and trains agency leaders to comply with the federal government's legal and financial regulations, said Vohra, the program's legal counsel. Just before the start of Ramadan a month ago, three nonprofit organizations had met all 20 standards required for accreditation. Vohra said several others are going through the process. In turn, Vohra hopes that Muslim charities will start seeing more dollars come their way. ""We don't make comments on which group to give to,"" Vohra said. ""What we're concerned about is giving the right way -- best practices for zakat. ""To be able to give freely is a right of all Americans."" he said. Vohra takes phone calls from people around the nation seeking guidance. ""We're planning to send money,"" people tell him. ""Is this group OK? What's the best way to send our donation?"" Because of the widespread concerns, Muslim Advocates decided to upload a guidance video on YouTube. It asks people to consider donating to U.S.-registered tax exempt charitable organizations. It tells them to make the intent of their donation clear, keep records and perhaps ask for proof that the funds were used for their intended purpose. The guidance became essential after the federal government cracked down on Muslim groups in 2001, Vohra said. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the Bush administration froze the assets of three U.S. charities -- the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, Global Relief Foundation and Benevolence International Foundation -- during Ramadan in 2001. Six others have been shuttered to date, the ACLU said. Only one, the Holy Land Foundation, was tied to terrorism after five of its leaders were convicted of providing money to the Palestinian militant group Hamas. ""The government's actions against these three charities were the start of a pattern of conduct that violated the fundamental rights of American Muslims' charitable giving in accordance with their faith,"" the ACLU wrote in a report published in June. It said the result was that many in the American Muslim community restricted or stopped their donations altogether out of fear that they would be investigated for terrorism. Vohra, however, is hopeful the tide is turning. President Obama signaled change in his historic speech to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo, Egypt, earlier this year. Obama said he was committed to working with American Muslims to ensure they can fulfill zakat. Vohra said the accreditation program, along with new government perspective, can return confidence and comfort to a religious obligation for Muslims. ""It's been tough for American Muslims post 9/11,"" he said. ""This has to do with civic engagement, to be treated as full Americans.""","U.S. government started cracking down on Muslim charities after 9/11 attacks .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The war in Afghanistan may no longer be forgotten but the true victims always are. Having been denied healthcare and education under the Taliban, Afghan women are now training as midwives . Women and children in the landlocked Asian country have continuously paid the ultimate price throughout the decades of conflict and war. It is their lives that are considered not precious enough to save. A woman here dies every 29 minutes due to childbirth complications, according to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) -- one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. One in four children die before they reach the age of five because of the lack of health care and medical facilities in their cities and villages. But ignorance is also deadly. Misguided cultural pride prevents men from allowing their women to see a doctor, merely because the doctor could be male. And in many cases, it's not just women who die from childbirth-related issues. It is young girls forced into marriage before they even reach puberty. Their still-forming bodies cannot handle the complications of childbirth. But there are women in Afghanistan stepping up within the crowds of the forgotten and pushing past the barriers. They are training as midwives across the country to help bring change and save lives. ""A woman can help a woman more,"" midwifery student Fariha Ibrahimi told CNN. ""We have to introduce them with what to do, what foods to eat, how to take care of themselves. ""[We] tell their husbands how to treat them. There are some husbands who beat their wives to the point where they can no longer even get pregnant."" At the Ibni Sina Balkhi Midwifery Training Center in Kabul, dozens of future midwives study and practise in the hope of bringing a brighter future to their countrywomen. ""It's very heartbreaking,"" Ibrahimi said of the situation women face. ""Afghanistan has gone through so much war and most girls were not allowed to get an education, so I want to study and bring forth something new."" Sympathy for Afghan women is the strongest motivating force among students in this field: Many know personally what is like to live in a society where pregnant women are ignored and forgotten. ""We live in an area where we are far from any clinic or hospital and there are a lot of difficulties there for pregnant women,"" Nourzia, a student and mother, told CNN. ""It's very difficult for them to reach a hospital. This is why I was so keen in learning this profession and helping these women; so in the future they are in less danger."" All the women here are training with the permission and support of their families. They are leading the way to a brighter tomorrow for Afghan women -- one that may one day catch up with the rest of the world. ""The world is moving forward and he didn't want me to sit around jobless,"" said future midwife, Maurina whose husband is supportive of her new career. ""He wanted me to push ahead in this field, especially a field in which our people need help in."" There are still many obstacles left and these women are still in the minority. According to the World Health Organization there are only about 2,000 trained midwives servicing Afghanistan's population of just under 33 million. But that is a giant leap from just eight years ago when most women were denied an education, medical care and the basic necessities of survival under the Taliban regime. It will take many years to change mindsets instilled by decades of brutality. But these women prove that maybe, just maybe, the next generation can fix the mistakes of the last.","Afghanistan has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality in the world .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dangerous cocktails of prescription drugs were pumped into Anna Nicole Smith ""almost to the point of stupefaction"" and eventually led to her death, California Attorney General Jerry Brown said Friday. Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend Howard K. Stern was among those charged Thursday. Brown called Smith's longtime partner and attorney Howard K. Stern the ""principal enabler"" in a conspiracy with two doctors for giving the ""known addict"" thousands of prescription pills. Stern and a doctor were jailed on charges of conspiring to furnish drugs before her death in 2007, authorities said. ""Stern and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor were arrested and later released from a Los Angeles County jail Thursday night after each posted a $20,000 bond, a police spokesman said. Dr. Khristine Eroshevich also faces charges and is expected to turn herself in Monday, authorities said. The doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed ""thousands of pills,"" Brown said. Her doctors knew she was addicted and gave her drugs ""excessively,"" Brown said. ""The quantity of the drugs, the variety of the drugs, the combination at any given point and her continuing to use that; that, to a professional, is clear evidence of addiction,"" Brown said. ""These cocktails of methadone and antidepressants and sleeping pills and Xanax, you put all that into a cocktail, it explodes and can cause death, injury and permanent morbidity and disability,"" he said.  Watch Brown speak to the media » . Brown said he hoped the charges send a loud and clear message. ""Doctors do not have a license to pump innocent and often vulnerable people full of dangerous chemicals,"" he said. Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8, 2007, after being found unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino near Hollywood, Florida. The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs, a coroner said. Several prescription medications -- both in Smith's and Stern's names -- were found in the room after her death. Officials said prescription and over-the-counter drugs were found in Smith's system, including three antidepressant or anti-anxiety drugs. Also found in toxicology testing was human growth hormone and chloral hydrate, a sleep medication, officials said. Stern and Kapoor, both 40, and Eroshevich, 61, each were charged with eight felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 to January 2007 -- only weeks before Smith's death. Kapoor and Eroshevich also were each charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by ""fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" And each was charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address, according to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. Smith was buried in the Bahamas on March 2, 2007, next to the grave of her son, Daniel, who had died in September 2006, days after the birth of her daughter, Dannielynn. Brown said his office will aggressively target California doctors who over-prescribe dangerous drugs. ""People think those drug dealers on the street corners are the only threat,"" he said. ""As a matter of fact, people in white smocks and pharmacies and with their medical degrees are a growing threat, and we aim to curtail it and curb it in the best way we can.""","NEW: Attorney General calls Howard K.

"ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- Sex columnist Dan Savage and author of the popular syndicated sex advice column ""Savage Love,"" made his way to St. Paul, Minnesota, to attend the Republican National Convention where he is filming a piece for HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" Sex columnist Dan Savage is reporting on the GOP convention for HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" Planted in the CNN Grill, Savage shares his thoughts on John McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, tells us what a sex columnist is doing at a political convention, and gives us his take on who's sexier, Democrats or Republicans. Here are five questions for Dan Savage: . CNN: You're here because you're a lifelong Republican? Savage: No, that's not true, actually. I'm a Democrat, although I am a registered Republican in Washington State, but just to drive the Washington State Republican Party up the wall. CNN: Why are you here? Savage: I was here to see if I could find any evidence of George W. Bush at the convention. And I found very little. There was that satellite feed. I bought this button [points to Dick Cheney button on his shirt]. This will be the only time you'll see Dick Cheney at the convention is when you see me walk by with this button ... I wasn't able to purchase it here ... I mean you talk to Republican delegates walking around, a lot of them will admit that George Bush has been a major disappointment and they're happy that he's not here. And one of the reasons that they're happy he's not here is that they don't want America reminded that four years ago and eight years ago, these same delegates ... thought George Bush walked on water. CNN: Why would ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" send a sex columnist to cover the Republican National Convention? Savage: Because when you're a sex writer in America you have to write about politics because politicians will not stop obsessing about it -- screwing around with people's sex lives. Often when I write about politics in ""Savage Love,"" my sex advice column, people write to me and say, ""you're a sex columnist, stick to sex."" And I'll say -- I usually respond -- ""I'll be able to stick to sex when politicians stick to politics and leave our sex lives alone, and stop politicizing our sex lives."" But they do. And it's one of the major differences between the two political parties, our sexual issues. And so my view is very relevant, I feel very at home here. CNN: Any thoughts on McCain's running mate choice? Savage: I think Palin has been the clown car of the vice presidential nominee. You never know what's going to pop out of Palin next. CNN: Who's sexier: Republicans or Democrats? Savage: Well, there's just something about those Young Republicans. They're very sexy. They're very tense and nervous. I spoke to a lot of them because I've been running around the convention asking teenagers throughout the convention if they're virgins or not. 'Cuz I feel like I have a right to know because we've invested over a billion dollars in abstinence education programs under George Bush.","Savage: Here to see if I could find any evidence of George W.

"(CNN) -- A Chicago, Illinois, nightclub accused of barring six African-American students last week will participate in a rally against discrimination late next month, the senior class president of Missouri's Washington University said Wednesday. Fernando Cutz, 21, said the group and Original Mother's in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood had reached an agreement that would also see the nightclub sponsoring four fundraisers and its managers attend diversity training classes. ""What we are looking to do is to turn this negative into a positive,"" the text of Cutz's remarks said. ""To make sure that all of us learn from what happened to these six students in Chicago 10 days ago and that we move forward, together, in a productive manner. ... ""We would also like to show that the best way of fighting discrimination can be by reaching out and extending a helpful hand to those who need it,"" Cutz said at a news conference. The club has also agreed to a private apology to the six students and a public apology to the  senior class, which was in Chicago for a two-day class trip. The students complained to state and federal agencies after six African-American members from their senior class trip celebration were denied admission to the club on October 17. Bar personnel cited dress code violations -- specifically baggy jeans -- in barring the African-American students, Cutz said. At one point, a white student and a black student exchanged jeans to see what would happen. The white student was admitted while his classmate still was kept outside, Cutz said. After the students' news conference, an attorney representing the club said the bar would be working with the students to fight discrimination and will issue an apology because they had a bad experience at Mother's. But Brad Grayson said the club does not believe it discriminated against the group. ""There was no intention to admit white kids with baggy jeans and exclude black kids with baggy jeans,"" he told the Chicago Tribune newspaper. In his remarks Wednesday, Cutz said the students wanted to avoid being ""caught up in the hype"" of the situation and ""forget the values that we are truly fighting for."" Mother's representatives will speak at the rally, which will be held in in Chicago in late November, he said. The celebration at Original Mother's had been arranged with the bar in advance by the student class board, which includes two of the African-American students who later were denied entry, Cutz said. He said he was already inside the bar with some 200 other students, none of whom are African-American, when the first group of African-American classmates arrived. Cutz said he quickly learned that the manager of the bar had denied the six students entry, and he said the manager told the students their baggy pants violated the bar's dress code. Cutz, who is white, said he confronted the manager. ""These six [students] were better-dressed than I was,"" Cutz told CNN. He told the students to ""go back to the hotel and change."" But the manager of the bar stepped in to say that he had made his decision and that the six men could not return to the bar even if they changed clothes, Cutz said. The students became ""more agitated"" and ""set up an experiment,"" Cutz said. Class Treasurer Regis Murayi, who is black, exchanged jeans with a white student, Jordan Roberts, who -- being 3 inches shorter than Murayi -- looked ""substantially baggy."" Roberts approached the same manager who had turned away the African-American students, paid the entry fee and was allowed in, Cutz said. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Leavitt contributed to this report.","Club accused of barring black Washington University students from entering .

"(CNN) -- A shoeless Tiger Woods snored on their lawn while the golfer's wife stood silently by in the minutes after his SUV crashed into a tree, neighbors told Florida investigators. The Florida Highway Patrol on Thursday released the audio recording of their interview of Wood's longtime neighbors who rushed out of their house in the early hours of last Friday to help Woods. Troopers issued a careless driving citation to Woods for the crash, but he will not face criminal charges, police said Tuesday. Woods, 33, struck a fire hydrant and a tree with his 2009 Cadillac SUV in his luxury neighborhood near Windermere, Florida, early Friday, police said. Kimberly Harris said she was awake in her bedroom when she heard ""a faint, continuous knocking sound for about 10 or 15 minutes."" It was unclear from the interview what Harris heard. Harris eventually noticed headlights shining toward her house from a vehicle on the lawn, so she awakened her brother, Jarius Adams. ""It's Tiger, dial 911,"" Harris said her brother yelled after rushing outside. ""I saw Tiger lying on the ground,"" Adams said. ""Elin was talking to him,"" he said, referring to Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren. ""'Can you please help me, can you please help me?' "" he said she asked. After that, she ""wasn't very verbal,"" Adams said. ""She was actually very quiet. Just kind of in shock, you know, just kind of sitting there."" Nordegren told investigators she used a golf iron to smash a rear window so she could unlock the door to get her husband out after the wreck. Woods appeared to have a cut lip, but he wasn't bleeding much, Adams told the troopers. ""Maybe if you'd have bitten your lip, or something like that,"" he said. ""Nothing on his shirt, nothing on his hands."" It was a cool morning, so Adams and Harris covered Woods with a blanket and put pillows under his head, Adams said. ""I tried to just keep everyone kind of calm,"" he said. When a trooper asked if Woods was unconscious, Adams said, ""At that point, he was, uh, he was snoring."" ""He was snoring?"" the investigator asked. ""He was actually snoring,"" he said. Adams said he never smelled alcohol on Woods' breath. Woods eventually was placed in an ambulance and taken to a hospital. He was released several hours later. The police report called his injuries serious, but a spokesman for Woods described them as minor. Woods cited the injuries as the reason for his decision not to attend his own charity golf tournament this week.","Shoeless Tiger Woods snored on neighbor's lawn as his wife stood by after car crash .

"(CNN)  -- Biologist Matt Aresco has been carrying a big burden for years. A biologist says that wherever he can get it, he'll take money to protect turtles from a killer stretch of road. He's made it his mission to save thousands of turtles from near-certain death on one of the worst turtle-killing highways in America, U.S. Route 27 just north of Tallahassee, Florida. The road skirts Lake Jackson, but that didn't stop the turtles from wanting to get to the other side. In three years, Aresco counted nearly 9,000 dead turtles. ""There were days when I would find 200 turtles attempting to cross,"" he told CNN. ""It was unreal."" But what sounds unreal to some in Washington is the solution to the turtle trouble: $3.4 million in federal stimulus money to build a series of walls and tunnels under the highway so the turtles and other creatures don't have to take on the cars and trucks roaring overhead. U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, highlighted the turtle crossing in a blistering report on what he called the 100 worst projects in the stimulus bill. ""They are wasteful projects, and most of us don't want to steal money from our grandkids to do something that's really stupid right now,"" he said. Members of the turtle contingent in Florida were less than thrilled to be singled out. ""You've got 30- to 40-pound box turtles as big as a manhole cover, and 12-foot alligators,"" said Leon County Commissioner Cliff Thaell. ""Now if Sen. Coburn was to drive his SUV speeding down Highway 27 [at] 60 miles per hour tonight and met one of those fellows, he would have an unpleasant encounter."" But according to the White House, the stimulus money is all about jobs, not turtles. Thaell said he expected ""dozens"" of jobs to be created in the construction of the tunnels, but he could not be precise. The jobs that will last only as long as it takes to build the tunnels, and Aresco says he'd rather get the money to help the turtles from other sources. But after years watching the creatures die, and trying to slow the carnage with makeshift fences, he says he'll take the money wherever he can get it.","Biologist wants to end deaths of turtles on highway near Tallahassee, Florida .

"(CNN) -- A barn fire that killed two men and dozens of horses in Ohio on Saturday shows no sign of criminal intent, authorities said. The Ohio State Fire Marshal said the cause of the fire, at the Lebanon Raceway near Cincinnati in southwestern Ohio, is undetermined. ""However, investigators have ruled out criminal intent,"" it said in a written statement. The ages and identities of the men are not yet known. Initially, officials reported that 65 horses perished, but later put the number at 43. The state fire marshal said that preliminary information from the men's autopsies may be available by Sunday. The fire began in the northwest corner of the barn, according to the state fire marshal's office. It would not release the specific origin of the fire because of the investigation. The Warren County Fair Board -- which operates the track -- confirmed the men's deaths and the destruction of the barn, but couldn't say how many horses were killed. It said in a statement that harness racing scheduled for Saturday night has been canceled. Firefighters from 11 departments, which received the call just before 5 a.m., cleared debris and extinguished hot spots during the day. For more than 50 years, the Warren County Fair Board has been operating the county fair grounds, which includes ""a harness racing track and supporting facilities that are leased for harness racing meets to two harness racing clubs,"" according to the statement issued by a fair board attorney, Bill Schroeder. Schroeder said the fire was first noticed by a neighbor and that the barn, harness-racing carriages, and other racing equipment have been destroyed. Firefighters kept the flames from spreading to other barns, officials told CNN affiliate WHIO-TV. State and local fire officials are working to determine what sparked the fire.

"(CNN)  -- Manny Pacquiao returned home to a hero's welcome in his native Philippines on Friday after wresting the WBO welterweight title from Miguel Cotto on a 12th round technical knockout in Las Vegas. 'Pacman' has a fanatical following in the Philippines which has been further enhanced by his record breaking victory as he claimed his sixth world title at a different weight by beating Cotto on Saturday night. ""Welcome home, the world's bext boxer of all time,"" read a banner as thousands of fans greeted the 30-year-old. Following his hard-fought victory over Puerto Rican Cotto, all the talk is of a cash-rich superfight with American Floyd Mayweather Jr. next year. Leading promoter Bob Arum said he is ready to put the pay-per-view extravaganza at the 147-pound welterweight class, with Las Vegas the preferred venue. Pacquiao played down the possibility as he talked to reporters on his return. ""We are not forcing a fight with him. It is right that he is the one challenging me, because my fights score more on pay-per-view,"" he said. Pacquiao has greatly enhanced his reputation with successive wins over Oscar de la Hoya, Britain's Ricky Hatton and Cotto. Mayweather returned to the ring with a comfortable win over Juan Manuel Marquez and has the reputation for grossing massive receipts from his pay-per-view appearances. For the moment, Pacquiao will spend time at home with his wife, Jinkee, and three children and is also set to pursue his ambition to enter Filippino politics, standing for a congressional seat in his home island of Mindanao.","Manny Pacquiao returns home to Philippines after Las Vegas triumph .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The beautifully ornate Catholic church in the nation's capital has seen its share of history and controversy. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and Chief Justice John Roberts attend Red Mass in 2005. In 1963, the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle was the site of John F. Kennedy's funeral. After the service, on the steps outside, the slain president's young son famously saluted his father's memory. But the church is also the site of an annual Mass that has drawn criticism for what many see as an unhealthy mix of politics, the law and religion. Washington's annual Red Mass, which celebrates the legal profession, will be held this year on Sunday, October 4 -- the day before the Supreme Court begins its new term. Several justices traditionally attend, along with congressional leaders, diplomats, cabinet secretaries and other dignitaries. Past presidents have also attended, though there is no word yet on whether President Obama will appear. It is a Catholic service, but power brokers of other faiths are asked to attend the invitation-only event. Justice Stephen Breyer, who is Jewish, is a regular. The Mass ""takes its name from the color of the vestments. ... [It] goes back centuries, to Rome, to France to England,"" Washington Archbishop Donald Wuerl said. ""There was the idea [to] bring all the people who are involved in the law ... once a year so that together, they can simply pray for the wisdom of God."" The church, built starting in the 19th century, is considered one of Washington's hidden gems. Tucked between modern office buildings a few blocks from the White House, it is a mix of architectural styles, a hint of ancient Roman style, a splash from the Italian Renaissance and a definite Byzantine flavor. St. Matthew, noted Monsignor Ronald Jameson, was the patron saint of civil servants, appropriate in a city where the federal government dominates the workforce. Five justices attended last year's Red Mass, which was similar in tone to other recent gatherings. Cardinal John Patrick Foley, who has held several prominent positions in the Catholic Church, noted many parts of the Bible ""sound very much like American ideals"" and reminded the members of the high court to build a society ""of justice, of peace and of love."" Critics of the service, however, find the attendance of leading decision-makers, including members of the highest court in the land, to be inappropriate. ""The truth is, this was set up as a way to basically lecture and give information to the justices,"" said the Rev. Barry Lynn, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ""There is no other institution that has this special way to talk to the justices on the Supreme Court."" The Red Mass was started in Washington in 1952 by the John Carroll Society, a lay Catholic group of prominent lawyers and professionals. Chief Justice John Roberts' wife, Jane, is an officer of the group. Lynn, an ordained minister with the United Church of Christ, noted the Mass was begun after several high court decisions that were disapproved of by the archdiocese. ""They figured if they got all the justices together and chatted them up in a worship service, they might be able to convince them to see the law their way,"" he said. In 1989, a top church official used the occasion of the Mass to call for a return to ""religiously based moral values"" and lament the ""inviolable, impenetrable and towering wall"" between church and state. In 1986, Washington Cardinal James Hickey attacked the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion. Among those in attendance that year were then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and William Brennan, both Catholics. One member of the court who no longer attends is Ruth Bader Ginsburg who, like Breyer, is Jewish. Ginsberg said she grew tired of being lectured to by Catholic officials. ""I went one year, and I will never go again, because this sermon was outrageously anti-abortion,"" Ginsburg said in the book ""Stars of David: Prominent Jews talk About Being Jewish"" by author Abigail Pogrebin. ""Even the Scalias, although they're much of that persuasion, were embarrassed for me."" Six Catholics now sit on the high court: Roberts, Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor. Church officials, however, said they do not attempt to lobby or seek to persuade anyone who attends the service. Wuerl likens the experience to putting aside the partisanship and troubles in the world and seeking comfort in a shared community and a sacred place. Americans have ""been very careful about ... not allowing any one tradition or church to become the state church,"" he said. ""But from the very beginning, we've always said we need to hear the voice of faith in all the discussion that is a part of determining what we want to do."" Lynn takes a different tack. ""I don't think there is any doubt that people in that congregation, including the Supreme Court justices, are going to listen to what is said. They might hear something phrased in a way you might never hear it in the court, but it might become a lingering factor in their decisions. ... People who are concerned about the Red Mass worry about this kind of undue influence, an influence that no other group, religious or otherwise, has on those nine men and women."" Their sharply differing perspectives show that, more than two centuries after the Constitution's ratification, the interpretation of the First Amendment and the role of religion in American society remain hotly contested questions.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Terrorists are likely to use a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the world in the next five years, a blue-ribbon panel assembled by Congress has concluded. Police watch over travelers at New York's Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving. They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one -- and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN. ""The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension. It would be 9/11 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed,"" former Sen. Bob Graham said. He cited the flu virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example. ""Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago,"" he said.  Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack » . The U.S. government ""needs to move more aggressively to limit"" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report. Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary. ""The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority ... they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world,"" he said. ""It is not going to be cheap. It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices. It won't be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals. But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so,"" he added. Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out. Biological weapons ""are more available,"" he said. ""Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals. Other serious pathogens are available in equally accessible forms."" ""There are so many scientists who have the skills to convert a pathogen from benign, helpful purposes into an illicit, very harmful weapon,"" he added. But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorism, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals. ""Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons,"" said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday. CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening. It cited testimony before the commission from former Sen. Sam Nunn, who said that the ""risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding."" The report recommends a range of measures, including increased security and awareness at biological research labs and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons. ""Many biological pathogens and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured -- and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists,"" the report warned. The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, and about Pakistan, which it described as ""the intersection of nuclear weapons and terrorism."" While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally, the report said, ""the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas"" in Pakistan. The tribal areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Congress created the commission to investigate and report on WMD and terrorism in line with a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission, which compiled a report on the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Commissioners heard testimony from more than 250 experts from around the world over the course of their six-month investigation. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","NEW: Next terror attack on U.S. likely to originate in Pakistan tribal areas, report says .

"HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- Two of four Uyghurs relocated to Bermuda after seven years of detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, denied Friday that they had ever been terrorists and expressed gratitude toward U.S. President Barack Obama for working to free them. Salahidin Abdalahut and Kheleel Mamut were two of four Uyghurs released from Gitmo. Thirteen remain there. Asked what he would say to someone who accused him of being a terrorist, one of the men, Kheleel Mamut, told CNN's Don Lemon, ""I am no terrorist; I have not been terrorist. I will never be terrorist. I am a peaceful person."" Speaking through an interpreter who is herself a Uyghur who said she was sympathetic toward the men, the other man -- Salahidin Abdalahut -- described the past seven years as ""difficult times for me ... I feel bad that it took so long for me to be free."" The two Chinese Muslims were among four relocated from Guantanamo to Bermuda; another 13 remain in detention on the island. He said he had traveled to Afghanistan not to attend any terrorist training camps but because -- as a Uyghur -- he had been oppressed by the Chinese government. ""We had to leave the country to look for a better life, a peaceful life, and Afghanistan is a neighboring country to our country, and it's easy to go,"" he said. ""It is difficult to obtain a visa to go to any other places, so it was really easy for us to just travel to Afghanistan."" Asked what he hoped to do next, he said, ""I want to forget about the past and move on to a peaceful life in the future."" In addition to the four relocated from Guantanamo to Bermuda, another 13 Uyghurs remain in detention on the island. The four were flown by private plane Wednesday night from Cuba to Bermuda, and were accompanied by U.S. and Bermudian representatives as well as their attorneys, according to Susan Baker Manning, part of the men's legal team. The men, who are staying in an apartment, are free to roam about the island. Mamut accused the Bush administration of having held them without cause, and lauded Obama for having ""tried really hard to bring justice and he has been trying very hard to find other countries to resettle us and finally he freed us."" He appealed to Obama to carry out his promise to shut Guantanamo Bay within a year. ""I would like President Obama to honor that word and to free my 13 brothers who were left behind and all of the rest of the people who deserve to be free,"" Mamut said. Asked how he had been treated in Guantanamo Bay, Mamut said, ""It is a jail, so there will be difficulties in the jail that we have faced and now, since I am a free man today, I would like to forget about all that. I really don't want to think about those days."" He cited a proverb from his homeland that means, ""What is done cannot be undone."" Asked if he had anything to say to anyone watching, he said, ""Thank you very much for those people who helped me to gain freedom."" He said he had spoken earlier in the day with his family. ""They told me, ""My boy, my son, congratulations on your freedom.' "" The move has had international repercussions, including causing a rift between the United States and Britain. A British official familiar with the agreement but not authorized to speak publicly on the matter told CNN the United States had informed London of the agreement ""shortly before the deal was concluded."" A U.S. official, speaking on background, said the British feel blindsided. Bermuda is a British ""overseas territory."" The four were twice cleared for release -- once by the Bush administration and again this year, according to a Justice Department statement. The issue of where they go is controversial because of China's opposition to the Uyghurs' being sent to any country but China. Uyghurs are a Muslim minority from the Xinjiang province of far west China. The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement. They left Afghanistan after U.S. bombings began in the area in October 2001 and were apprehended in Pakistan, the statement said. ""According to available information, these individuals did not travel to Afghanistan with the intent to take any hostile action against the United States,"" the statement said. However, China alleges that the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement -- a group the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization -- that operates in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang. China on Thursday urged the United States to hand over all 17 of the Uyghurs instead of sending them elsewhere. The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities. China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured. A senior U.S. administration official told CNN that the State Department is working on a final agreement with Palau to settle the 13 remaining Uyghur detainees. CNN's Don Lemon and Brian Vitagliano in Hamilton, Bermuda, and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","Two Uyghurs relocated from Guantanamo spoke Friday with CNN's Don Lemon .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities are moving to rein in the man dubbed ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" after complaints that immigration raids by his deputies amounted to unconstitutional roundups of Latinos. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio supervises an inmate relocation in Phoenix, Arizona. Sheriff Joe Arpaio and the Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff's department have had an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security since 2007 that allows his department to enforce federal immigration laws. But Arpaio says the federal agency is moving to revise the agreement to limit that power to checking the immigration status of inmates already in his Phoenix jail. Arpaio has cultivated his image as ""America's Toughest Sheriff,"" a nickname earned by his treatment of Maricopa County inmates. Many of his prisoners are housed in tents and forced to wear pink underwear, and he once boasted of feeding them on less than a dollar a day. Now he faces a Justice Department investigation into allegations of civil rights abuses, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona is suing the sheriff over immigration raids conducted by his department. The class-action lawsuit alleges that Arpaio has abused the power delegated to him under his agreement with Homeland Security, known as the 287(g) program. ""He's unconstitutionally acted to racially profile many persons in the community, persons who appear or are Latino,"" ACLU lawyer Dan Pochoda told CNN. Pochoda said the five-term sheriff has launched a series of high-profile raids to appeal to ""his anti-immigration base."" Arpaio told CNN's ""American Morning"" the allegations were ""garbage"" and said he would continue to use state laws to crack down on undocumented immigrants in his county. ""We do not go on street corners and grab people that look like they're from another country,"" he said. ""Pursuant to our duties, when we come across illegals, we take action.""  Watch what Arpaio has to say » . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who was Arizona's governor before taking her Cabinet post, told CNN that Arpaio is reacting prematurely to decisions that have not yet been finalized. But Arpaio says he's now become the poster boy of the emotionally charged immigration debate and is losing authority for political reasons. ""They don't want to aggravate the Hispanic community, aggravate the businesspeople who hire the illegals, and they want amnesty,"" he said. Arpaio said he planned to continue his operations ""with no changes."" ""We do enforce traffic violations. All law enforcement does that, and comes across some serious criminals, which we do in our crime suppression,"" he said. ""We go into workplaces under the state law, and we arrest people in the workplace there illegally with identity theft situations and human smuggling."" But according to a 2008 policy report on effective law enforcement by the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian-leaning watchdog group based in Phoenix, Arpaio's department ""falls seriously short of fulfilling its mission."" The report found that Maricopa County has ""diverted resources away from basic law-enforcement functions to highly publicized immigration sweeps, which are ineffective in policing illegal immigration."" CNN Correspondent Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report.","Some say his deputies' raids were unconstitutional roundups of Latinos .

"ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- The Italian media call her ""Foxy Knoxy,"" portray her as a ""devil with an angel's face,"" and there are 11 Facebook pages dedicated to her, all in Italian. Both Raffaele Sollecito (left) and Amanda Knox deny charges of murder and sexual assault. Amanda Knox, 21, is an American college student from Seattle, Washington, who is on trial for murder in Perugia, Italy. The case has given Knox almost pop star status there. She was voted the top woman in an online ""person of the year"" poll by an Italian TV channel in December, beating out Carla Bruni, the Italian-born French first lady. Seven of the 11 Facebook pages champion her innocence; four seem convinced that Knox is pure evil. A sampling of comments: ""No to Amanda. No to her superstardom"" ... ""She's a sociopath"" ...""Everyone is not sure if she is guilty or not and that she will lead us to a new existential awareness. Please shout with me your anger. ... Let's say no. Let's say Knox."" Knox and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 24, are charged with murdering and sexually assaulting one of Knox's roommates, British exchange student Meredith Kercher, on November 1, 2007. They insist they are innocent and are disputing the allegations. Knox and Sollecito are due back in court today. The last time Knox appeared before the panel of eight judges, she wore a T-shirt quoting The Beatles: ""All you need is love."" Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini alleges that Kercher, 21, was killed because she refused to participate in a drug-fueled sex game played by Knox, Sollecito, and a third man, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede. In court papers, prosecutors stated that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her. The case is being tried in Perugia, a university town about 115 miles north of Rome that is better known for its chocolate than for its scandalous murder trials. According to the prosecutor's office, Kercher had been in Italy for two months as part of a year-long course with Leeds University, where she was working toward a degree in European Studies. She shared a house with Knox, a University of Washington student in the same exchange program, and two Italian housemates. The crime scene, which has become a tourist attraction, has been broken into twice, police say. Knox and Sollecito were arrested November 6, 2007, and were kept in prison while an investigation continued. The judge overseeing the investigation found both were capable of committing the crime again, fleeing the country or tampering with the evidence. Police sought charges in July 2008, and they were ordered to trial in October. The trial began January 16 and has been held mostly on weekends. Italian newspapers assigned their top crime reporters, and the case has received unprecedented international coverage. Knox has appeared on the cover of People magazine, which shares a corporate parent with CNN. A random sampling of women on the streets of Rome showed that all of them had heard of the case and most believed Knox and Sollecito were at the very least implicated in the slaying. The superheated publicity surrounding the case helped make Knox a household name in Italy. She is usually portrayed as a femme fatale. Consider these headlines: . • ""Sex, lies and stabbings""  • ""Lovers without any inhibitions""  • ""And in prison, she even tries to sun tan"" Italian journalists also have plastered their newspapers with photos they found of Knox on the Internet, especially images that showed her as a ""wild girl."" They pounced on the ""Foxy Knoxy"" nickname they found on her MySpace page, even though her parents later explained the high school moniker came from the way Knox played soccer, quick like a fox. Although Italian law limits the publication of court and police records, the media ban is less strict than in many European countries. While it is not exactly legal to publish police investigative reports, no journalist has gone to jail in Italy for doing it. Among the items leaked: Knox's diary, various police interrogations, photos of Kercher's body, video of Kercher's body (which wound up on YouTube but has been pulled), and video of the Italian forensic police carrying out their investigation. Eventually, even the leaks made headlines, leading to more speculation. Knox can do no right in the Italian media. If she appears reserved and timid in court, she is portrayed as someone with plenty to hide. If she smiles or laughs in court, she's called disrespectful. As far as the Italian media is concerned, Knox is the mastermind who manipulated those around her and seduced her Italian boyfriend and led him astray. While Knox and Sollecito's preliminary hearings were being held in October, Guede was convicted of murder after a fast-track trial. His lawyers had hoped that the speedy resolution of the case would give him a break at sentencing. He got 30 years in prison. According to testimony at Guede's trial, his fingerprints were found in the house, and his DNA was linked to Kercher's body. He has never denied being in the house the night of the slaying but insists he didn't kill her. He says he had an ""appointment"" with her that night and was in the bathroom when she was killed. Sollecito and Knox say they weren't at the house the night of the slaying. They say they both were at Sollecito's house. But the alibi has been contradicted by witnesses at the trial. Eighty-six media outlets sent 140 journalists to cover the opening of the trial in January, but publicity has waned since then. The Italian 24-hour news channel TG24 no longer breaks into its programming with multiple updates. Knox, for now, has been relegated to the pages preceding the sports or weather report. But Italians love their murder cases, and attention has shifted to other crime news. A mother is accused of killing her toddler son, a husband and wife are accused of multiple killings. Their courtrooms are now filled with spectators who wait in line an hour or more. The Perugia courtroom still is packed, but the long line is gone. That is likely to change, however, as testimony shifts to the defense case.","Murder trial makes American student notorious in Italy .

They also say it serves as a warning sign of how some stimulus money is not being used to finance new projects but is being diverted to public works already under way. Supporters argue the bridge is an ideal public-private partnership that will benefit an entire community while fulfilling the stimulus package's goal of getting people back to work. ""It's going create just under 400 jobs for 18 months constructing the bridge,"" says Redmond Mayor John Marchione. ""It's also connecting our technical sector with our retail and commercial sectors so people can cross the freeway to shop and help traffic flow.""  See a larger image of the proposed bridge » . Marchione applied for federal stimulus money after costs jumped on the project from $25 million to $36 million. Marchione says the increase in costs were due to a rise in construction prices and because the bridge will be built on a diagonal in order to connect Microsoft's original East campus with a newer West campus that are split by a public highway. Microsoft is hardly getting the bridge for free. The company is contributing $17.5 million or a little less than half the tab of the $36 million bridge, which would be open for public use. And even though the bridge goes from a parking lot behind Microsoft's West campus across a highway to an entrance of Microsoft's East campus, Marchione says, people other than Microsoft employees would use the overpass. ""We're not a one-company town,"" Marchione says. ""Our traffic studies show that Microsoft traffic would be about 42 percent of the bridge, yet Microsoft is paying for about 50 percent of the bridge, so we think we are getting fair value. ""The United States taxpayer is leveraging their dollars, and I think everyone is getting a fair deal."" But a watchdog group monitoring how stimulus money is being spent says the taxpayer in this case is getting ripped off. ""This is $11 million where we are substituting public money for private money, and that means there's some other project that would have a greater benefit than a bridge to Microsoft that's not being built,"" says Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. But without the stimulus money, Marchione counters, the bridge may not have been built. Microsoft had ""capped out"" its contribution to the project, he explains. And the economic tough times have affected even the biggest companies. ""Microsoft laid off 5,000 people in January,"" Marchione points out. Ellis doesn't buy it. ""Let's face it. Microsoft is one of the most lucrative companies in the country,"" Ellis says. ""They could have easily funded this out of pocket change. This is really about getting while the getting is good. Uncle Sam has a big wallet that's there for the taking, and Redmond wanted to take it -- and Microsoft was happy to let them pick up that part of the tab."" Microsoft did not respond to CNN requests for an interview on the bridge project. But in a posting online, Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith wrote: ""As the largest employer in Redmond, Microsoft takes its responsibility to the surrounding community seriously. We have spent over $50 million to assist the City of Redmond and other local governments with street construction, transit facilities, water and sewer facilities and fire equipment."" Last week, Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire certified 138 projects, including the bridge, to receive stimulus funding. Construction is expected to begin in June. Michael Ennis of the Washington Policy Center, a Seattle-based not-for-profit group that advises policy makers, said there are many reasons the bridge project is a good one. ""Any time you can include the private sector in funding transportation projects, it's a win-win situation,"" Ennis explains. ""The state has a monopoly on our roads system. Even if Microsoft wanted to pay for this project on their own, legally they are required to work with the public sector."" But Ennis also says the bridge does not fit with the kind of projects the stimulus plan is meant to bankroll. ""This project would have moved forward regardless of having the federal money or not, so it doesn't have any additional benefit to the economy,"" he says. As he pedaled on his bicycle to work, one Microsoft employee saw the issue in much simpler terms. ""It's going to cut about two miles off my ride each day,"" he said.","Project would build bridge between Microsoft's two campuses .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal agents have arrested more than 1,300 suspected gang members, including 343 with violent criminal histories, in the past three months, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said Tuesday. Gang weapons and paraphernalia are displayed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2006. ""Violent foreign-born gang members and their associates have more than worn out their welcome, and to them I have one message: good riddance,"" Julie L. Myers, assistant secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a news release. Of those arrested, 374 face criminal charges, officials said. The rest face deportation, they said. During the nationwide crackdown, immigration and customs agents worked with law enforcement counterparts in 23 cities in what officials described as a ""summer surge."" The most arrests were made in the New York area (205) and Miami, Florida (160), but gang members were arrested in cities as small as Boise, Idaho, and Fort Smith, Arkansas.  Watch agents in action in suspected gang roundup » . Myers told a Washington news conference that some of ""the worst of the worst"" gang offenders had been taken off U.S. streets. One of the gangs targeted has been MS-13, which is believed to be the fastest growing group in the United States as well as one of the most violent, the agency said. The FBI estimates MS-13 has about 10,000 members in the country, along with tens of thousands in Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador, where the gang originated in the late 1980s. ""MS-13 still seems to be the primary gang and the most violent gang still out there, and it is penetrating throughout the United States,"" said Marcy Forman, director of investigations for the agency. Don Hunter, sheriff of Collier County in southwest Florida, said MS-13 was present in what he called the ""upscale"" community. ""We are not unique, we have transnational gangs, we have homegrown gangs,"" Hunter told the news conference. But he said cooperation among federal and local agencies had made it possible to put a dent in gang operations. The sweep was part of the agency's Operation Community Shield anti-gang initiative, which started in 2005, and has resulted in arrests of more than 7,000 alleged members and their associates from more than 600 gangs, the agency said.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off after inspiring Real Madrid to an incident-packed 4-2 victory at home to Almeria on Saturday night, in which he created a goal, scored one and also missed a penalty. The world's most expensive player helped Real bounce back from last weekend's 1-0 ""El Clasico"" defeat to Barcelona as the big-spending capital outfit came back from 2-1 down in an explosive final 20 minutes. However, unbeaten Barca stayed five points clear at the top -- having played one more match -- with a 2-1 victory at Deportivo La Coruna as Lionel Messi scored twice. Ronaldo, making his first appearance at the Bernabeu in two months following ankle problems, crossed for Sergio Ramos to head the opening goal in the 31st minute. However, Fernando Soriano leveled with a deflected shot in the 58th minute and Kalu Uche put lowly Almeria head just three minutes later as Real failed to clear a corner. The hosts equalized with 17 minutes left as Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain kept up his hot scoring run with a predatory finish after the Almeria defense did not deal with a cross from the left. With eight minutes remaining, Ronaldo went down under the challenge of the onrushing Diego Alves, but the goalkeeper saved his resulting penalty -- however, Karim Benzema followed up to smash in the rebound to put Real ahead. Ronaldo wrapped it up a minute later from Higuain's low cross, and was booked for tearing off his shirt to pose in front of his adoring fans. The Portugal captain received his second yellow card five minutes later for kicking out at Michel, but it was not costly as Real completed a morale-boosting win ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Marseille. Barcelona, whose European title defense is still in the balance ahead of Wednesday's trip to Dynamo Kiev, took the lead against Deportivo in the 27th minute when Messi scored with a trademark neat finish. However, Adrian leveled in the 39th minute with a header after an error by Sergi Busquets, who returned from suspension. But Messi, named Europe's top player for 2009 during the week, put Barca ahead again with 10 minutes left from Pedro's cross and Zlatan Ibrahimovic followed up his winner against Real by wrapping up the victory on 88. Third-placed Sevilla again failed to keep pace with the leaders after being held 1-1 at home by mid-table Valladolid, who had a player sent off. Angola striker Manucho put the visitors ahead in the 33rd minute with a glancing header from Diego Costa's cross but five minutes later Borja Fernandez was red-carded for a lunge on Diego Perotti. Sevilla, who were held at home by Malaga last weekend, leveled with a penalty from Luis Fabiano just before halftime after Marcos brought down Jesus Navas. Brazil striker Fabiano squandered two golden second-half opportunities as Valladolid held on, meaning Valencia can move above Sevilla with victory away to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Atletico Madrid moved further away from relegation trouble with a 2-0 victory at promoted strugglers Xerez, with star strikers Diego Forlan and Sergio Aguero scoring in each half. Uruguay international Forlan put Atletico ahead in the 29th minute from a cross by Jose Antonio Reyes, while Argentina's Aguero doubled the lead on 65 with a low shot from 12 yards.","Cristiano Ronaldo sent off after inspiring Real Madrid to 4-2 victory at home to Almeria .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Family members of Meredith Kercher said Saturday they were satisfied with the verdict that found American Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the fatal knifing of the British student. ""Ultimately we are pleased with the decision,"" said Lyle Kercher, Meredith Kercher's brother. ""But it was not a moment of celebration. We are here because our sister was brutally murdered."" The victim's sister, Stephanie Kercher, talked Friday about her family's grief. ""Our lives have been on hold, really. You can't really carry on as normal,"" she said. ""You have to take each day as it comes. It's not ever going to be the same without [Meredith]."" Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of murder Friday after a lengthy, sensational trial. Knox was given a 26-year sentence; Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years. Both will appeal, attorneys said. Knox and Sollecito were convicted on all charges except theft. The pair was accused of staging a theft to cover up the killing. Authorities said 300 euros (about $444) was discovered missing from Kercher's purse. The pair must pay 5 million euros ($7.4 million) to Kercher's family. In addition, Knox must pay 40,000 euros (nearly $60,000) to a man whom she falsely accused of the killing. One of Knox's sisters said Saturday that Amanda ""had a rough night."" Her mother, Edda Mellas, said, ""She had a lot of support. The inmates and the guards were all taking great care of her. They care a lot. ""Amanda, like the rest of us, is extremely disappointed -- upset about the decision,"" Mellas said. ""We're all in shock; we're all heartened by the support"" that she said residents of Perugia and other Italians had shown. ""People from all over the world have been sending us messages of support all through the night,"" Mellas said. ""We told her she's going to get out of there. It's [just] going to take a little longer."" Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, criticized his client's punishment -- less than the life sentence the prosecution requested but far short of exonerating Sollecito -- as making no sense. ""For the grave crimes they claimed, you either sentence them to life. ... or you acquit. There is no middle way,"" Maori said. Public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini told CNN he feels he presented a strong case. He said about 20 magistrates worked alongside police during the investigation. However, he said that in the face of the planned appeals, clearly the conviction is not final. Learn how the murder case played out . People who disagree with the verdict should at least respect it, because so many professionals were involved in the investigation, Mignini said. ""I believe, evidently, that they think there was violence. They are the deputies who establish the foundation"" of charges, he said. ""And they did this."" The victim's mother said she believed the defendants were guilty of the slaying. ""You have to go with the evidence,"" Arline Kercher said. Take a look at the evidence against Knox . Knox's lead defense attorney, Luciano Ghirga, said that when he met with his client Saturday morning, she was angry and continued to proclaim her innocence. He told CNN the situation has been a trying experience, and Knox hardly slept Friday night after the verdict. She was consoled by the other prisoners, who managed get her a cup of warm milk, Ghirga said. The jury reached its verdict after deliberating nearly 11 hours on the 11 counts. Jurors must submit an explanation of how they reached their decision to the judge within 90 days, and this ""jury motivation"" will be made public. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of life in prison. Italy does not have the death penalty.

"(CNN) -- The Philippine House of Representatives and Senate were meeting Monday to debate the imposition of martial law in the country's south by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the aftermath of last month's massacre of 57 civilians. As required by law, the president issued a report Sunday explaining her reasons for making the proclamation for the province of Maguindanao. ""Lawless elements have taken up arms and committed public uprising against the duly constituted government and against the people of Maguindanao,"" Arroyo said in a 20-page letter to the leaders of the House and Senate. Martial law went into effect Friday night, allowing arrests without a warrant. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said it was necessary to impose peace following what has been called a politically motivated massacre. He added that Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. The House and Senate might jointly convene on Tuesday to discuss the president's report, House Speaker Prospero Nograles said Sunday, according to the Philippine News Agency. The debate began as elite forces of the Philippine National Police clashed in the town of Datu Unsay with suspected followers of the politically powerful Ampatuan family, which has been implicated in the massacre, the Philippine News Agency reported Monday. Reports said the armed men offered stiff resistance on Sunday against government security forces in a 10-minute firefight, withdrawing after government reinforcements arrived. No casualties were reported on either side. Charges of rebellion will be leveled against many of those arrested since martial law was implemented, Philippine Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera said Saturday, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. At least six members of the Ampatuan family have been arrested, including Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr., according to ABS-CBN. Ampatuan, whose father is governor of Maguindanao, has been accused of directing the killings and has been charged with 25 counts of murder. One of the massacre victims implicated members of the Ampatuan family before she died, the affiliate reported. Over the weekend, authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family. They confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindinao command, told CNN. The military was looking at arresting at least 100 people tied to the massacre, ABS-CBN reported. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities ""were trying to build a case, a tight case"" against suspects. ""But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law."" Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the country. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","Arroyo outlines reasons for martial law declaration in 20-page letter .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Like many young men, Josh Nahum loved a thrill. That's why he took up skydiving. But on Labor Day weekend in 2006, he had an accident while skydiving in Colorado, fracturing his femur and skull. Josh Nahum, right, died at 27 from a bacterial infection he got while being treated for skydiving injuries. Josh spent six weeks in the intensive care unit. Slowly, his condition improved, and his doctors predicted that with rehabilitation, he could fully recover in a year or two. But instead of recovering, Josh developed a bacterial infection. He died two weeks later at the age of 27. ""One nurse, who was trying to be comforting, said, 'These things happen,' "" says Victoria Nahum, Josh's stepmother. ""That's true, but they happen way more often than they need to happen."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Josh is one of 99,000 people who die each year because of infections acquired in the hospital. As Betsy McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York, put it, ""You don't often come across such a big problem that you can prevent."" After being contacted by families like the Nahums, McCaughey started the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths. After Josh died, the Nahums started the Safe Care Campaign. These groups, and others, have advice about what you can do to keep yourself safe in the doctor's office and hospital, from the waiting room to the operating room. 1. Bring your own toys . At the pediatrician's office, don't let your child play with the toys or books in the waiting room. ""They're covered with bacteria,"" McCaughey says. Also, don't let your child crawl on the floor; bacteria there could get into cuts on their knees or hands. ""This is one place you ought to keep your child sitting still or on your lap,"" she says. 2. Heat up your car . Yes, we know that sounds strange. But studies show staying warm before and during surgery can help you fight infection. So the Institute for Healthcare Improvement suggests that in cold weather, you heat up the car, wear warm clothes on the way to the hospital, ask the hospital staff to give you plenty of blankets while you wait for surgery, and ask how they plan to keep you warm during surgery. 3. Want to touch me? Wash your hands first. Many people feel uncomfortable asking this. Nahum suggests putting it like this: ""I didn't see you wash your hands. Do you mind doing it in front of me?"" Dr. Vicki Rackner, a patient advocate, also has a few ideas for lightening things up. ""In the hospital, you can have the grandkids make a sign that says, 'Please wash your hands and keep Grandma healthy.' ""  Watch more on preventing hospital infections » . Another suggestion: Put a dish of wrapped candy near the sink and say 'Could you please wash your hands, and oh, please take some candy with you when we're done.' "" If the doctor or nurse has gloves on, are you safe? ""Don't be falsely assured by gloves,"" McCaughey says. ""If they put on gloves without washing their hands first, those gloves are immediately contaminated."" 4. Ask where that syringe has been . Doctors offices sometimes reuse syringes -- it's unusual, but it happens. In fact, there have been 14 documented outbreaks of hepatitis since 1999 because of reused syringes. The recent outbreak in Nevada, where 50,000 people will be notified that they might have been infected at a colonoscopy clinic, is one example. It's not an easy question to ask, but when someone's heading at you with a syringe, ask if this is the first time it's been used. Dr. Thomas Frieden, commissioner of the New York City Department of Health, suggests phrasing it like this: ""I read in the paper that some doctors are reusing syringes. I can't imagine anyone would do that. Do you?"" 5. Having surgery? Speak up! A week or so before surgery, ask your doctor whether you should wash your skin daily with a disinfectant such as chlorhexidine to prepare. Also, ask whether you should have a nasal or skin swab for MRSA, the superbug that causes many hospital infections. If you've got it, you can be treated with antibiotics. The day of surgery, if the surgical site needs to be shaved, ask to be clippered, not shaved with a razor, which can create nicks where bacteria thrive. Also on the day of surgery, if your doctor has ordered IV antibiotics just before surgery, make sure you get them, as they're sometimes forgotten. One last note: If you or a loved one has a urinary catheter in the hospital, be extra vigilant -- they can become breeding grounds for bacteria. First, ask if one is truly necessary. ""If the patient is awake and oriented and alert and can use a bedpan, it may not be needed,"" says Dr. John Jernigan, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. If you get one, make sure it comes out ASAP, since the longer it's in, the riskier it becomes. Ask the same questions about central venous catheters, (also called central lines), another potential host for bacteria. ""My brother was in the hospital and needed a central venous catheter for his procedure,"" Jernigan says. ""The day after surgery, I asked the nurse, 'Are you all still using this? Do you still need it?' And she checked and came back and said, 'We don't need it anymore, we'll take it out.' "" Nahum says it all boils down to this: Passivity kills. ""People need to start participating instead of just being spectators when it comes to their medical care,"" she says. ""You need to do your due diligence."" CNN Medical News associate producer Jennifer Pifer and associate archive coordinator Sarah Edwards contributed to this report.","CDC: 99,000 people die annually from hospital-acquired infections .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. military will stop publishing the number of Taliban and insurgents it kills in Afghanistan under orders from the senior U.S. military spokesman for the American-led coalition. A French soldier mans a gun Sunday during maneuvers in Afghanistan's Kapisa province. Rear Adm. Gregory Smith ordered the change as part of the new military strategy in the war that focuses on protecting Afghan citizens rather than killing militants. ""Indicating the number of insurgents killed has little relevance to impacting the lives of Afghans. In fact, if that were the only purpose and metric, you would likely only extend the time it takes to bring about an end to the insurgency,"" Smith said in an e-mail to CNN responding to a query about the change. The issue of publishing enemy body counts has been extremely sensitive to the U.S. military since the Vietnam War when the military regularly published large enemy body counts but seemed to be failing overall to make progress in the war. In the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon has shifted policies several times, both publishing numbers in news releases on particular engagements and firefights and also declaring it would not publish body counts. In the past some military officials have said the numbers have been part of individual releases to the media as a means of demonstrating success against enemy forces. Smith said, ""We conduct operations not aimed at killing insurgents, although in many instances that is the outcome, but to over time clear areas of insurgency and give the people a chance to reconnect with official forms of governance and to rebuild their lives, socially and economically.""","U.S. will stop publishing number of Taliban and insurgents killed in Afghanistan .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Thirty-six people were killed and dozens were injured in explosions at a market in Lahore, Pakistan, on Monday, an official said. Rizwan Naseer, chief of Lahore's rescue service, also said 109 people were wounded. The explosions did not appear to be a suicide attack but could instead have been bombs detonated by remote control, Punjab Police Chief Tariq Salim said. The nation's state-run news agency, Associated Press of Pakistan, said the blasts were the result of ""bomb explosions."" The explosions occurred at Moon Market in the Iqbal Town neighborhood, the news agency said. It cited Iqbal Town Division's Ali Nasir Rizvi as saying most of the victims were women. Khusro Pervaiz, a senior government official in Lahore, said in a television interview that 60 people had been taken to five Lahore hospitals. The blasts happened around 8:45 p.m. at the popular market, said Rai Nazar Hayat, a spokesman for Lahore police. Earlier, ten people were killed -- including two police officers -- when a suicide bomber detonated outside a district courthouse in Peshawar on Monday, officials said. At least 36 were injured, six of them seriously, said Dr. Hameed Afridi, CEO of the Lady Reading Hospital. The bomber got out of a rickshaw and detonated himself, according to witnesses. The attacker was wearing a suicide jacket with about 6 kilograms of explosives, said Shafqat Malik, head of the North West Frontier Province bomb disposal unit. Peshawar is the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, where the Pakistani government waged a recent military offense against Taliban militants. Meanwhile, five people were hurt in a bomb attack in Quetta on Monday morning, said Jamil Kakar, a Quetta police official. The explosives were placed in a car and destroyed two other cars and three motorbikes. The courthouse attack comes three days after four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel. At least 36 were killed and 75 wounded. Among the dead were 17 children, according to military officials. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of senior rank. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan reiterated its claim in an e-mail to CNN the next day, after media outlets quoted officials who doubted the group's participation. ""We reconfirmed it, that the TTP has done it and will do more which are already planned,"" the group said in the e-mail. ""We once again mention that we are not against the innocent people and the state of Pakistan but against those officers and ministers who are American by hearts and minds and Pakistani just by faces.""

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- A former Miss Argentina died Sunday after complications arising from plastic surgery, the official Telam news agency said. Solange Magnano, 37, died in a hospital after being transferred from a clinic where she underwent an elective surgery on her buttocks on Wednesday, the agency reported. Magnano ran her own modeling agency in Argentina, and had been a model and Miss Argentina in 1994. She also was the mother of 7-year-old twins. The cause of her death was under investigation, authorities said. News of her death shocked her fans. By Monday, a tribute page on the social networking site Facebook had more than 830 members. ""This is a horrible day. We will miss you, Sol,"" one Facebook poster wrote. ""You couldn't be any more beautiful than you already were,"" another person added. ""You had to pay with your life."" Magnano's most recent project was a runway show to be held in December in her hometown of San Francisco, Argentina, according to Telam. In recent years, Argentina has become an international destination for plastic surgery. The costs of such procedures there are much lower than in other countries. Estimates say that 1 in 30 Argentines has gone under the knife, making surgeons here some of the most experienced on the globe. Medical tourism has seen a huge jump over the past decade, and is projected to be a $100 billion global industry by 2010, according to the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions.","Solange Magnano, 37, died Sunday following elective surgery on buttocks .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Four American teenagers, all children of U.S. military personnel, have been arrested on charges of attempted murder after a woman was knocked off her motorbike with rope strung across two poles, Japanese police said. The four suspects -- two 15-year-old boys, a 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man -- were taken into custody on Saturday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said. They are accused of causing a severe head injury to a 23-year-old restaurant employee by stringing a rope between poles across a road. U.S. Forces Japan was informed of the August incident in late October, a public information officer said. There was no clear explanation for the delay in the handover of the suspects to police, other than it involved rules between Washington and Tokyo covering U.S. forces and their dependents in Japan. The U.S. military presence and its impact on Japanese residents have been a thorny issue over the years. Most recently, residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa, where the U.S. maintains a large military presence, have blamed American troops for crime and noise. In 2008, a 14-year-old Okinawa girl alleged that a Marine had raped her. The prosecutor released the Marine after the girl decided not to pursue charges. In 1995, a 12-year-old girl was gang-raped by three servicemen. A Japanese court convicted all three men. Both incidents caused a furor in Japan. Then-Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda called the 2008 incident ""unforgivable ... It has happened over and over again in the past and I take it as a grave case."" It is unclear what, if any, role the military can take in the case. The 1960 Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan gives Japan jurisdiction over ""the members of the United States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents"" in cases of offenses committed in Japan and punishable under Japanese law. The agreement also says the United States must cooperate in investigating such offenses.

"(CNN) -- Armored cars patrolled the streets of Zimbabwe's capital and residents flocked to banks Thursday after limits on cash withdrawals were lifted in the inflation-ravaged African nation. With prices rising even more than once a day, shopping is a mathematical proficiency test for Zimbabweans. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe had capped maximum daily withdrawals at 500,000 Zimbabwean dollars -- about 25 U.S. cents, and about a quarter of the price of a loaf of bread. But faced with mounting chaos in a country already in economic free fall, the bank decided last week to raise that limit to 100 million dollars ($50 U.S.) per week. Soldiers were deployed to all banks in anticipation of throngs of people lining up to withdraw money Thursday, when the increase took effect. Wednesday, police chased depositors away and arrested union leaders who planned to protest the limits. Zimbabwe's inflation rate of 231 million percent is the world's highest. In addition, the country is faced with a growing outbreak of cholera that its government declared a national emergency Thursday. The outbreak has killed at least 565 people and sickened more than 11,000, the U.N. Humanitarian Affairs Office said.

"(CNN) -- The Philippine House of Representatives and Senate were meeting Monday to debate the imposition of martial law in the country's south by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the aftermath of last month's massacre of 57 civilians. As required by law, the president issued a report Sunday explaining her reasons for making the proclamation for the province of Maguindanao. ""Lawless elements have taken up arms and committed public uprising against the duly constituted government and against the people of Maguindanao,"" Arroyo said in a 20-page letter to the leaders of the House and Senate. Martial law went into effect Friday night, allowing arrests without a warrant. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said it was necessary to impose peace following what has been called a politically motivated massacre. He added that Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. The House and Senate might jointly convene on Tuesday to discuss the president's report, House Speaker Prospero Nograles said Sunday, according to the Philippine News Agency. The debate began as elite forces of the Philippine National Police clashed in the town of Datu Unsay with suspected followers of the politically powerful Ampatuan family, which has been implicated in the massacre, the Philippine News Agency reported Monday. Reports said the armed men offered stiff resistance on Sunday against government security forces in a 10-minute firefight, withdrawing after government reinforcements arrived. No casualties were reported on either side. Charges of rebellion will be leveled against many of those arrested since martial law was implemented, Philippine Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera said Saturday, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. At least six members of the Ampatuan family have been arrested, including Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr., according to ABS-CBN. Ampatuan, whose father is governor of Maguindanao, has been accused of directing the killings and has been charged with 25 counts of murder. One of the massacre victims implicated members of the Ampatuan family before she died, the affiliate reported. Over the weekend, authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family. They confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindinao command, told CNN. The military was looking at arresting at least 100 people tied to the massacre, ABS-CBN reported. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities ""were trying to build a case, a tight case"" against suspects. ""But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law."" Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the country. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","Arroyo outlines reasons for martial law declaration in 20-page letter .

Reports from police and the Bhutto camp conflict over whether she was injured. • Geo TV quotes Zardari saying his wife suffered a bullet wound to the neck after the suicide bombing. • Khan and Pakistan's primary television networks report Bhutto is dead. Television reports indicate she died of bullet wounds suffered after the suicide bombing. • Khan says it appears Bhutto was shot, but he adds it's unclear whether bullets or shrapnel caused her wounds. • Doctors and a spokesman for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party confirm the ex-premier's death, but it remains unclear how she was killed. • Police tell CNN that a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle detonated himself near Bhutto's motorcade. She was rushed to nearby Rawalpindi General Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead. Khan says it's unclear if a bullet or shrapnel dealt the fatal wounds. Friday morning, Pakistan time: . • The Pakistani Interior Ministry tells the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan that Bhutto died of a gunshot wound to the neck. The suicide bomber fired shots before blowing himself up, the ministry tells the news agency.

Contrary to previous reports, she did not die from bullet or shrapnel wounds and nothing entered her head, the Interior Ministry spokesman said. • Cheema says that Bhutto ""fell down or perhaps ducked"" when gunshots rang out. She apparently hit her head on a lever, Cheema said, adding that it was stained with blood. • Khan, the doctor who treated Bhutto before she was declared dead, says the former prime minister had a ""big wound"" on the side of her head ""that usually occurs when something big, with a lot of speed, hits that area.""

"(CNN) -- Seiji Ozawa is Asia's most successful conductor, a maestro in a quintessentially Western art form, and a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan. But the affable 74-year-old is used to crossing cultural boundaries. Born in Manchuria during the Japanese occupation - his father a Buddhist, his mother a Presbyterian - he was raised in Tokyo, and greatly influenced by western culture and a Christian upbringing. His love of music was first explored through the church, but later he studied at the Toho School of Music in Tokyo. A career as a pianist was curtailed when the 16-year-old sports-loving Ozawa broke two fingers during a rugby match. From Toho he traveled to Europe and New York to further his studies. It was a steep learning curve where he learnt how to deal first-hand with other cultures and prejudices. ""I have many problem, beginning. Um... maybe now, I don't know, but beginning especially. It was difficult. Some people ask me, 'You came from China, you came from Japan, do you really understand Bach or do you really understand Mozart?'"" he told CNN. After years abroad, his return to Japan in 1962 to conduct the NHK Symphony Orchestra for six months was far from a happy homecoming; the orchestra rebelled and refused to play for him. ""I made mistake, and I think it was too soon [for me] to take a professional orchestra for six months and at the end I think they had enough. ""I think I was a little bit stuck up... I mean, I was conducting the best orchestra in Japan already I'm still 26 or 27. Very young. And I think I'm sure during rehearsal I say something not so nice. And in Japan very bad if conductor say something not so nice. But I learned, so I become more careful and I think I started more studying, so not make mistake. ""But in a way, it may sound very strange, but really it did me good that boycott."" It meant Ozawa explored opportunities outside of Japan, directing festivals and orchestras across Europe, Canada and the U.S. He became musical director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra a post he held for 29 years until 2004. He left Boston for Vienna to embrace a new challenge with the State Opera. As well as the challenge of a new city and repertory, Ozawa believes it was a move that rounded out his musical education, even if he was 68-years-old at the time. When a young conductor his interest in opera had been fostered by his early tutor Herbert von Karajan. ""He said if you don't study this, one half of Mozart you'll never touch and almost 99 percent of Wagner, almost 100 percent of Puccini and Verdi, you know, half of Mozart is gone."" While Ozawa will step down from his position at the Vienna State Opera next summer, he will remain active in directing, conducting and educating the next generation in classical music. ""I have big hope all Asiatic people and countries... everybody love music basically,"" he said. ""Teaching has become, I think, more and more important my life, really.""","Seiji Ozawa was musical director of Boston Symphony Orchestra for 29 years .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi parliament members adjourned on Saturday without reaching an accord on a controversial new elections law, and the lawmakers could make another try to forge and pass legislation tomorrow. Abdul Bari al-Zebari and Mahmoud Othman, Kurdish members of the Council of Representatives, told CNN that the session is adjourned until Sunday because lawmakers didn't forge an agreement. Passage of the law on Sunday is expected to ensure that national elections would be held on January 16. Al-Zebari said several Sunni Arab parliament members boycotted the Saturday session and doubts there will be a Sunday vote. Othman told CNN that lawmakers couldn't reach an accord over the issue of Kirkuk and said some Sunni Arab and Turkmen members left the session. But the biggest roadblock to a new election law is the question of how balloting should unfold in the ethnically diverse, oil-rich province of Kirkuk, where Kurds displaced during Saddam Hussein's rule have returned to claim their land. The power struggle among Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen has been a political hot potato. Kurds have long regarded Kirkuk -- the province and the city of the same name -- as an integral part of Kurdistan, and many want it to be part of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Arabs and Turkmen also lay claim to the city and province, and all the groups want their voices and votes to be adequately represented in the political system. Disgruntled Arab and Turkmen residents say many more Kurds have moved into Kirkuk than were displaced, and that allowing them to vote would create an unfair advantage. Arabs and Turkmen want special measures to adjust for the increased numbers because they believe many of the Kurdish immigrants are there illegally. The Kurds insist there should be no special voting procedures and reject a United Nations' proposal that singles out Kirkuk for special treatment. The disagreements among the groups spurred the postponement of provincial elections in Kirkuk last January because officials there could not agree on how to apportion seats among the ethnic groups.","New election law will ensure that national elections take place January 16 .

"(CNN Student News) -- December 9, 2009 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Baghdad, Iraq  • Kabul, Afghanistan • New Orleans, Louisiana . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz. You've landed on CNN Student News. First Up: Job Creation . AZUZ: During a speech yesterday, President Obama offered some ideas on how to create new jobs and help out the country's economy: offering tax breaks to small businesses, expanding some of the government's stimulus programs, and spending more funds on infrastructure projects -- things like roads, bridges and water systems. The thing is, all of that costs money. And that's where the TARP comes in. That's the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the financial industry bailout passed last year. The bailout ended up not costing as much as expected, and President Obama thinks the extra could be used to help out in other ways. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The TARP program was flawed and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly. And today, TARP has served its original purpose and at much lower cost than we expected. In fact, because of our stewardship of this program and the transparency and accountability that we put in place, TARP is expected to cost taxpayers at least $200 billion less than it was anticipated just this past summer. AZUZ: Couple of things to keep in mind here, though. First, White House officials say that they can't just use TARP money to pay for infrastructure projects; the program just doesn't work like that. And second, some Republicans are outraged by the idea of spending any unused TARP funds because they say that money was supposed to help pay off the country's debt. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) MINORITY LEADER: This makes me so angry. I was there. I know all about TARP. First, it was never intended that all this money would ever have to be spent. But any money that wasn't spent was to go to the deficit. And the idea of taking this money and spending it is repulsive. Health Care Debate . AZUZ: Senators are considering alternatives to part of their health care legislation. Specifically, the so-called public option: That's a government-run health insurance program. Senate Republicans, and some Democrats and Independents, are against that plan. A group of Democratic senators was working to come up with some other ideas that could replace the public option. Late last night, they said they had reached an agreement. If the Senate passes its health care bill, that doesn't make it law. It would still need to be combined with the House bill, and then that final version would need to pass both the House and the Senate. Baghdad Bombings . AZUZ: The head of Iraq's government says that a series of suicide bombings is designed to create chaos in that country and prevent progress toward elections that are scheduled for next year. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called yesterday's terrorist attacks ""cowardly."" The five explosions killed more than 125 people and injured more than 440 others. The bombings all took place within minutes of each other Tuesday morning. They targeted several government buildings around the capital city of Baghdad, as well as a neighborhood and a business district. Is this Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Hillary Clinton is the U.S. secretary of defense. Not legit! Robert Gates is the defense secretary. He was appointed by President George W. Bush, and President Obama asked him to stay on the job. Defense Secretary Visit . AZUZ: It's Mr. Gates' job to advise the president on military issues like the war in Afghanistan. And that is where the defense secretary is right now, meeting with military officials and Afghan leaders following President Obama's announcement that he plans to send 30,000 additional U.S. forces to Afghanistan. Barbara Starr has more on Mr. Gates' trip there and some of the challenges that U.S. troops face there. (BEGIN VIDEO) BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Defense Secretary Roberts Gates arrived in Afghanistan on an unannounced trip. He is here, of course, for the first time since President Obama made the announcement that 30,000 additional U.S. troops will be headed to this war zone. The defense secretary plans to meet with troops, commanders, and he has already met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to talk about the way ahead, Secretary Gates assuring Karzai that the U.S. has a continuing commitment to this country. But where we are right now, at FOB, Forward Operating Base, Shank, south of Kabul, really illustrates the continuing security challenge in this country. The U.S. Army task force that operates here has already had the plus-up from 300 troops to 3,000 troops operating in this region to try and get a handle on security against the Taliban and the insurgents. One of their major jobs here is to continue every day to secure Highway 1, the main road to Kabul. The road is secure right now, they tell us, because the troops, U.S. and Afghan troops, are out patrolling every day. If the troops weren't out there, the feeling is that the Taliban and the insurgents would again rear their head and control the road and really hinder commerce and development in this region. So, that's the bottom line here. It's a continuing, spotty security picture. Where the troops are, security improves. But where the troops are not located, security still very troublesome in many areas of this country. (END VIDEO) Promo . AZUZ: Another member of President Obama's Cabinet, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, can have an impact on your education.

MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! When does winter officially start? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) October 31, B) November 15, C) December 21 or D) January 1? You've got three seconds -- GO! Winter begins around December 21, which is the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Wintry Weather . AZUZ: Don't tell that to the folks who are already getting hammered by the first major storm of the season. States out west got slammed by two to three feet of snow, winds whipping around at up to 90 miles per hour. Even some desert states felt the freeze. Check out this video from Arizona! The storm is making its way east, and as of yesterday, parts of Iowa and Minnesota were both under a blizzard warning. Green Collar Training . AZUZ: Some homes are protected against winter cold by weatherizing, which keeps heat in and costs down. Installing it is an example of a green-collar job, work that's focused on the environment. Christine Romans shows us how some folks are learning to be part of a green-collar world. (BEGIN VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hot air is coming into your house. You know that you're losing, what? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Energy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Energy. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The skills taught here are green. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is recycled newspaper. ROMANS: And so are the students. SUZY MASON, PROGRAM DIRECTOR, LOUISIANA GREEN CORPS: We do work with 17- to 24-year-olds who lack work history, are often low income, court involved. Our corps members don't want to hang out on the street. They want to be productive. They want to work. ROMANS: That's where Louisiana Green Corps comes in. Based in New Orleans and funded through a grant from the U.S. Labor Department, the program teaches young adults how to weatherize and rehabilitate homes. MASON: We're giving a general base of construction knowledge, carpentry skills. We also emphasize academic improvement, work readiness, and really encourage our corps members to make positive life decisions. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a lot of work to be done in New Orleans. ROMANS: One of the people doing that work is LA Green Corps graduate Chris Williams. After completing the program, he landed a job with local contractor Brotherhood Way, weatherizing homes and building new ones. CHRIS WILLIAMS, LOUISIANA GREEN CORPS GRADUATE: I believe that this program helps kids by, you know, letting them see that there is another way, you know, besides, you know, maybe they aren't, you know, high... maybe they don't have their high school diploma, or maybe they aren't the ones who go to college. So this program, you know, it invites them in and it gives them the opportunity to learn a trade, you know, to learn a skill. On average, their energy bill will be $20-$30 on a month. ROMANS: Despite Chris's success, jobs are still hard to come by. So far, out of 177 LA Green Corps graduates, 37 percent have found jobs and a third have gone back to school. Even those who didn't immediately find work have achieved something. DAVID WEATHERSBY, BROTHERHOOD WAY: For Chris and so many other young adults, when they finish the program, they are ready to be thrown into the work force. ROMANS: So, when the job market does turn around, they're ready. Christine Romans, CNN, New York. (END VIDEO) Before We Go .

"(CNN) -- Yemen told outside powers Wednesday to stay out of its battle with a Shiite rebel group in its northwest amid concerns that Iran and Saudi Arabia are being drawn into the conflict. The statement, carried by the state news agency Saba and attributed to a Foreign Ministry source, followed a statement of concern for Yemen's ""national unity and territorial integrity"" by Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on Tuesday. ""We welcome what Mottaki affirmed about Iran's position towards Yemen's unity and stability, and Yemen reaffirms that it definitely rejects the interference in its internal affairs by any party,"" the statement said. It said Yemen's battle with the Houthi, a Shiite Muslim rebel movement, is ""an internal Yemeni affair, and Yemen can solve its issues without any interference from others."" Battles between Yemeni government forces and rebels have raged intermittently for five years, and government troops launched a new offensive in late summer. Saudi Arabia, Yemen's northern neighbor, turned its air force against suspected Houthi rebels last week after it said the rebels had crossed into Saudi territory. The Houthi claimed that the airstrikes occurred within Yemeni territory, a claim both the Saudi and Yemeni governments denied. The persistent fighting has raised concerns that Yemen -- where U.S. officials say al Qaeda is attempting to establish a new foothold in the region -- could be the stage for a proxy struggle between Shiite-dominated Iran and the Sunni-led Saudi monarchy. Yemen says the conflict is about reasserting government authority and is not a sectarian war. Yemen has accused Iran of supporting the rebels. A Yemeni government official told CNN on Tuesday that Yemen's navy was ""on the highest state of alert"" after an Iranian boat was captured near Yemeni and Saudi territorial waters last week. In Washington, however, a senior State Department official told CNN that although the U.S. government is concerned about the Yemeni conflict it does not see any sign of an Iranian hand in the Houthi revolt. The State Department has been in touch with the Yemenis and Saudis about the need to reduce tensions but is yet to be convinced that Iran is involved in Yemen, the official said. The United Nations has expressed alarm over the fighting and said there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people displaced in recent weeks. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates as many as 175,000 people have been affected by the conflict since 2004, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Tuesday. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Yemen battles with Shiite rebels in its northwest .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Kristin Budden's hotel promises her a refund for her nonrefundable hotel room after a hurricane strikes. But months later, there's no sign of the money and the hotel has gone into radio silence. Should she kiss the money goodbye? A guest's hotel promised her a refund, but she hasn't received anything. Q: I think that you may be my only hope! My father and I were supposed to meet in San Antonio before a conference. Lucky for us, the weekend that we were to be in San Antonio was the same weekend Hurricane Ike plowed through Texas. After experiencing Gustav just two weeks prior in Baton Rouge, I was not very keen on going for round two. My flight was canceled, anyway. We had made reservations at the Holiday Inn on the Riverwalk for the weekend. The rate was pre-paid and nonrefundable, which at the time of booking was fine. However, when we saw where the hurricane was headed, we called to cancel our reservations independently. After some discussion about the storm, the hotel told us both independently that, due to the extreme circumstances, we would receive refunds. I have an e-mail from the hotel regarding my ""refund."" Despite numerous e-mails to the hotel over many months, we've received nothing. Any assistance that you can offer me would be greatly appreciated. -- Kristin Budden, Baton Rouge, Louisiana . A: I think Holiday Inn owes you a refund. Not because of the hurricane, or because it was the right thing to do (although both are true) but because a hotel representative promised one in writing. If you had disputed the hotel charge on your credit card -- which would have been one of your options -- then the e-mail from your hotel is almost like money in the bank. During a dispute, a hotel may counter that by citing its nonrefundability policy, but from your credit card's perspective, a written statement from the property that it agrees to override its rule is compelling evidence in your favor. Many resorts offer hurricane guarantees that give guests a no-questions-asked refund when a storm is on the way. Holiday Inn wasn't one of those hotels as far as I can tell, but the commonly accepted practice in the travel industry is to not hold a customer accountable for a trip that can't be taken because of circumstances beyond his or her control. (Remember, we let travel companies off the hook when they can't operate a plane because of bad weather or a hotel shuts down during a flood -- it's only fair that they should do the same thing for us.) It looks as if you limited your correspondence to the hotel. In a situation like this, it's useful to begin with a brief, polite e-mail to the corporate guest-relations section on its Web site. Many hotels pass these complaints along to the hotel and may fine it if the grievances aren't resolved quickly. However, dealing with the hotel directly puts it under no such pressure and it may feel as if it can ignore your repeated requests. Next time you reserve a room during hurricane season, consider one that's refundable. And if not, then at least consider taking out a travel insurance policy that would cover you if a hurricane hit your hotel. I contacted Holiday Inn on your behalf and it promised you a full refund.

"(CNN)  -- A wildfire continued its rampage through the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California on Monday, but the U.S. Forest Service said fire crews were gaining ground. The Sheep Fire in Southern California has burned thousands of acres and left this bus a charred ruin. ""Firefighters have made very good progress against the Sheep Fire. It's currently at approximately 7,500 acres with 20 percent containment,"" U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Robin Prince said Monday. The fire, which was reported Saturday afternoon in the Lytle Creek area, quickly grew to 3,500 acres by early Sunday and forced about 4,000 people in the community of Wrightwood from their homes. ""People are going to have to hold off on getting back to their homes until we get a little better containment lines on the fire, but things are looking really good,"" according to Prince. More than 1,200 firefighters were battling the blaze, and numerous firefighting aircraft have dropped water and retardant on the wildfire. Back fires have been set to protect homes at the eastern edge of Wrightwood, authorities said. The weather was cooperating Monday, unlike over the weekend when a high-wind warning remained in effect and gusty winds helped fan the flames. ""There's very little smoke. There's a few flare ups here and there, but if the winds pick up, we could still have some problems. So that's why we're holding off on letting people go back into the mandatory evacuated area,"" said Prince. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino County on Sunday so the state can mobilize agencies and equipment to help fight the fire.","Sheep Fire is about 7,500 acres with 20 percent containment, Forest Service says .

"(CNN)  -- The New Zealand All Blacks gave their nation double reason for cheer with a 20-6 win Italy before a massive crowd at the San Siro in Milan. With their football counterparts qualifying for the 2010 World Cup finals with a win over Bahrain earlier on Saturday, it was left to Graham Henry's men to complete the double. But they were given a tough fight by underdogs Italy, who were inspired by an 80,000 crowd in a stadium normally reserved for Serie A giants Inter and AC Milan. Henry fielded a largely second-string team after last week's 19-12 defeat of Wales in Cardiff. Italy briefly led as former Australian rugby league international Craig Gower kicked a penalty. But New Zealand pulled ahead with two Luke McAlister penalties and Corey Flynn put them further ahead with the only try of the game after 25 minutes. McAlister landed another penalty before halftime to send the visitors into the break with a 14-3 lead. After the interval he kicked two further penalties with Gower getting his second for Italy. The All Blacks next play England, who saw off Argentina 16-9 at Twickenham in a poor quality match in difficult conditions. A late try by Matt Banahan gave Martin Johnson's men the edge and his sixth win from 13 games in charge. Fly-half star Jonny Wilkinson provided all of England's points in the first half, with a drop-goal and two penalties as the scores were tied at 9-9 at the half. Center Martin Rodriguez, one of a trio of Argentina debutants, kicked three penalties from five attempts to keep them level until the late home try. In other international action, former England coach Andy Robinson led his new Scotland team to a 23-10 win over Fiji. Johnnie Beattie and Graeme Morrison went over for tries for Scotland at Murrayfield. On Friday night, France shocked world champions South Africa 20-13 in Toulouse. The Tri-Nations champions paid the price for ill-discipline as Julien Dupuy kicked four penalties and Morgan Parra one. Winger Vincent Clerc capped a fine performance for the home side with a try. South Africa's points came from Morne Steyn with a penalty and drop-goal as well as converting a fine try by captain John Smit.","New Zealand All Blacks beat Italy 20-6 in rugby union international .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's the oldest trick in the political playbook: Call together a ""summit"" of fancy people so you'll appear to be focused on work that must get done. Thursday, the White House convened CEOs from  companies such as Boeing, AT&T, Comcast and Dow Corning, top leaders of the United Steelworkers, United Food and Commercial Workers, American Federation of Teachers unions, Ivy League academics and a few small-business representatives to brainstorm how the country might generate much-needed jobs. A schmooze-fest is nice, but the hard work of putting America back to work will be done by entrepreneurs, not the leaders of the biggest companies in the nation and the heads of big unions. The mom-and-pop shops, garage start-ups and small businesses across the country will put Americans back on the payroll. According to the Census Bureau, nearly all net job creation in the U.S. since 1980 has been generated by firms operating less than five years. This means that our job generators are likely not on the White House guest list. They are home working long hours to meet payrolls on tight deadlines and scraping by with limited resources. While others can advocate for the merits of entrepreneurship, and will hopefully do so, our job creators are strangely left out. Innovators from Oregon to Tennessee are the ones who will generate new jobs. Commerce Department data show that small companies represent 99.1 percent of all employer firms (a firm is an aggregation of all establishments owned by a parent company, even in multiple locations.). They pay nearly 45 percent of U.S. private payroll and have generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually over the past decade. A few start-ups from the last century may be familiar: Disney, Burger King, Fed-Ex, CNN and Microsoft all started during a period of economic downturn. Today, each of these companies employs thousands of people in the U.S. and abroad. Recent research shows that more than half of the 2009 Fortune 500 companies were launched during a recession or bear market. In 2002, when the tech bubble burst, I graduated from business school just a few miles from Google. The start-up was a mysterious algorithm-based business, little known and lesser understood. Today, Google employs 20,000 people worldwide. So the question is how can we foster the next Google? Policy-makers can't predict breakthrough technologies, but they can create an environment that will encourage innovation. How to start? First, provide further access to capital. Last week, two Small Business Administration stimulus provisions that helped to get millions of dollars to small-business owners ran out of funding. The provisions, passed as part of the Recovery Act, raised the maximum guarantee on SBA loans to 90 percent and reduced or eliminated fees associated with the loans, making it more attractive for banks to lend during the downturn. Access to capital is the lifeblood of small businesses. We must renew these provisions and provide even greater access to credit. Helping fledgling companies grow fuels the economy from the bottom up. Second, welcome immigrants who are job generators. We are a country of immigrants, and yet in recent years, we have made it incredibly difficult for immigrants to launch companies in the U.S. Why not create a new visa for entrepreneurs? Increasingly venture capitalists, angel investors and innovators are advocating a ""start-up visa"" offered to immigrant entrepreneurs who want to start a company in the United States. In 2008, nearly 40 percent of technology company founders were foreign-born; 52 percent of Silicon Valley company founders were foreign-born, including the founders of Google, Yahoo, eBay and Intel, to name a few. Why chase these innovators away when we need jobs and should be hanging an ""innovators wanted"" sign on our front door? Third, match funds for early investors. Early investors need incentives to put money behind companies that will create U.S. jobs. We have channeled billions of dollars to preserve ""too big to fail"" institutions. Why not make federal matching dollars available to catalyze smart investment in next generation businesses? Investors could keep their normal returns and a share of returns on federal matching funds could go back to the government to further revitalize our weakened economy. Instead of preserving outdated jobs, we need to fuel the creation of future employment prospects. Early-stage investors with a track record of success can help make this happen. Obama came into office on an entrepreneurial platform. His campaign catalyzed involvement at the grassroots level. Tapping into new technologies such as YouTube, Facebook and other social networks, our president benefited from entrepreneurial advances. It is time for the White House to return to its campaign roots. Since Obama's inauguration, our unemployment rate has risen from 7.6 percent to 10.2 percent. It is time to stop propping up outmoded and overleveraged institutions and start betting on the new men and women who offer hope for greater prosperity. Supporting entrepreneurs is change we can believe in. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy M. Wilkinson.","Amy M. Wilkinson says Obama's summit had mostly CEOs, union reps, academics .
But, she says, most job creation in the U.S. since 1980 has been from start-up firms .

"SILVER SPRING, Maryland (CNN)  -- Thomas Cuddy enlisted in the U.S. Army 28 years ago, but he's facing his greatest battle now that he's out. Retired veteran Thomas Cuddy is so weakened by ALS that he often can't catch himself when he slips. Cuddy spends most of his days in his small apartment in Silver Spring, Maryland, reading on his couch, and working at his computer. He leaves only when it is absolutely necessary; the trek down the three flights of stairs is exhausting and dangerous. He slips easily, and he does not have the strength to catch himself. Thomas suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the legendary baseball star who lent his name to the mysterious illness over 60 years ago. His doctors have told him to stop working but he cannot afford to, so he works when his body will let him. He is able to work from home most days -- he's a community relations officer, command speechwriter and medical publications reviewer based at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. But as typing becomes an increasingly strenuous chore, even this will become too much to bear. Thomas hopes this day comes later rather than sooner. Sitting idly is not is his nature, but ever so slightly, that is changing. ""This is a disease where...one day you wake up and you can walk, and the next day you can't,"" he says. ""And once you lose it, you can never get it back."" ALS is a progressive disease that attacks neurons in the brain, eventually leading to total paralysis. It affects 20,000 to 30,000 Americans at any given time, according to the ALS Association. It can take up to 10 years to fully develop, but by the time it is diagnosed, it is usually fatal within two to five years. ALS was first classified as a disease in 1869, yet there are still few clues as to its cause. Researchers are just as far from finding an effective treatment or cure. In fact, just one drug has been approved by the FDA to treat ALS, and has been proved only to extend life by a few months. ""They have no idea what is happening to us. I'm taking it one day at a time,"" Thomas says. Thomas has found that many of his brothers suffer from the illness as well -- his fellow veterans, that is. ""There have been recent studies that have been proven that if you are a veteran, your chances of developing ALS are double that of anyone else,"" Thomas says. Dr. Mark Weisskopf, an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that doctors took notice as a large number of veterans of the first Gulf War began to report ""non-specific neurological conditions."" Several subsequent studies published in the last decade have established an increased rate of ALS among Gulf War veterans. Weisskopf was co-author of a study in 2005 that found that men with any history of military service are about 60 percent more likely to develop ALS than men who did not serve in the military. He concluded that ""the branch, length of service, and where you served didn't seem to matter."" The cause of this connection is still unknown. Weisskopf says that there may be an environmental trigger, but due to the immensity of potential exposures to which military personnel are subjected, no one has been able to pinpoint exactly what that trigger might be. For men who are trained to fight for their lives, this disease is perhaps the ultimate torture. ""The way we are in the military, if you show us an enemy, we'll defeat it, ""Thomas says. ""It's really hard to identify what you're fighting. I'm just fighting to stay alive."" The Department of Veterans Affairs established ALS as a service-connected disease on September 23, 2008. This acknowledgment gives veterans suffering from ALS access to much-needed benefits such as health care, disability compensation, and many other essential support systems. While it may seem as if the VA has moved slowly in reacting to these studies, Weisskopf notes that there is still a lot that is unknown about the connection between ALS and military service. ""In that regard, I commend the VA in taking this step before many scientists are fully convinced,"" Weisskopf says. Nonetheless, for those suffering from ALS, navigating the vast bureaucracy at the VA can be an exasperating process. Veterans such as Thomas find themselves in the helpless position of watching their disease advance at a much faster pace than their paperwork. When he filed for disability last March, Thomas was told that his request could take up to a year to be approved -- if it is approved. For now he waits. Despite his deteriorating condition, Thomas has chosen to remain positive. Each day, he carefully gets out of bed and tests his legs, hopeful that he is able to walk for one more day. He is all too aware that he will wake up one day soon and his limbs will no longer work. Someday, he will lose the ability to talk, and eventually, he will stop breathing. But today, he can do all of these things, and he is grateful. ""What I do all day long, is I tell myself in six months, I will probably be in much worse condition, and in six months I would give anything to be where I am today,"" he says. ""So today I'm happy with what I have.""","ALS, a progressive disease, attacks brain neurons leading to total paralysis .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- He's been a homicidal singing barber in ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" and a drunken swashbuckler in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Depp is back as bank robber John Dillinger, revered in the Depression as a modern-day Robin Hood. Now, Hollywood shape-shifter Johnny Depp is back as another unexpectedly charismatic outlaw: Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger, a character he says he's been drawn to since he was a boy. ""I sort of had a fascination with John Dillinger when I was about 10, 11 years old, for some reason,"" Depp told CNN. ""I always kind of admired him, oddly."" Oddly, perhaps, because for a short but intense period between September 1933 and July 1934 Dillinger and his gang rampaged through the American Midwest, staging jail breaks, robbing banks, and killing 10 men and wounding seven along the way. Dillinger's violent spree is the focus of gangster drama ""Public Enemies,"" the latest offering from director Michael Mann, and also starring Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. Mann is known for his sympathetic portrayal of criminals, and Dillinger -- whose acts on the wrong side of the law led him to become one of America's first celebrities -- is the quintessential good hood. In the 1930s, the United States was in the grips of the worst financial disaster in history -- a time when many Americans watched their life savings disappear and became jobless and hungry. Members of the public blamed banks for losing their money and politicians for failing to stop them. For many, Dillinger's exploits represented sticking it to the fat cats, and he was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood. J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director at the time, may have made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy No. 1, but the bandit was careful not to alienate the public. There is a memorable moment where he drapes a coat over a female bank hostage during a raid to keep her warm. Also, it's said he never swore in front of women. He was always courteous even as he tried to meet his target of robbing banks in under two minutes. Crucially, he never robbed the average guy, telling him to put his money away during robberies. It is this Dillinger that Depp captures: a captivating revolutionary with the gift of  gab who lit the public's imagination, causing people to flock to cinemas to watch his exploits in weekly newsreels. Review: Depp is great in 'Public Enemies' Of course, the dark, violent side of  Dillinger's psyche is unavoidable. Depp plumbed the depths of his own character to come up with those murkier elements. That was something that took courage, according to Mann: ""He had Dillinger in him; that's something I sensed. Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness."" Depp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters. He shook off an early reputation as a teen pin-up in movies like Tim Burton's 1991 Gothic tale ""Edward Scissorhands."" He went on to cement his reputation for unusual film choices and quirky performances in films like ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2005) and ""Finding Neverland"" (2004).  In pictures: Johnny Depp's iconic roles » . The 46-year-old actor says he felt a close affinity to Dillinger: ""I related to John Dillinger like he was a relative. I felt he was of the same blood. He reminded me of my stepdad and very much of my grandfather. ""He seemed to be one of those guys with absolutely no bull whatsoever, who lived at a time when a man was a man."" ""Public Enemies"" was adapted by Mann from a nonfiction book of the same name by Bryan Burrough. Is it sozzled Captain. Jack Sparrow or smooth Donnie Brasco? Tell us your favorite Johnny Depp character in the SoundOff box below. The ""Last of the Mohicans"" director is known for fastidious research and attention to detail, which in this case included collaborating closely with the FBI to check facts -- although Mann subsequently chose to gloss over some elements for the sake of the story. Mann filmed in many of the locations where Dillinger's story took place almost 80 years ago, including the Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago, where the bandit was finally shot dead by FBI agents as he came out of a Clark Gable movie. They also shot at Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters in the far north of Wisconsin, the site of one of Dillinger's most famous showdowns with the FBI. Dillinger was hiding out there after a botched robbery. When the feds finally caught up with him, two men were killed in the vicious gunfight. ""We were able to shoot not just in the actual place where this happened, but in his actual room,"" says Mann. ""There's a certain kind of magic for Johnny Depp to be lying in the bed that John Dillinger was actually in."" A lot of Dillinger's success was down to superior guns and getaway cars. Depp, who has experience shooting guns from previous productions, had to learn a completely different technique for the heavy guns of the time. Depp says shooting the Thompson submachine gun was one of the highlights of the production: ""When you've got a beast like that strapped to you and you're emptying magazines, a 50-round drum, it's a good feeling."" The ride may have been thrilling for Depp but he also recognizes that the Depression-era setting has some extra significance these tight-belted times. ""You know,"" says Depp, ""We're in the middle of a recession, teetering on a depression. It's time to view the banks and grown-ups for what they are.""","Johnny Depp plays charismatic bank robber John Dillinger in ""Public Enemies""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A schoolteacher from southern England with no previous filmmaking experience has given amateurism a good name by directing her pupils in a feature film fit for Hollywood. Alice Ralph, 18, stars in ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" as Bathsheba Everdene. It has taken a year of hard work using only one camera, but teachers and pupils at The Gryphon School in Sherborne, Dorset, recently premiered their 110-minute long adaptation of English novelist Thomas Hardy's seminal 1874 work ""Far From the Madding Crowd."" ""When I watched it for the first time, it was actually quite an emotional experience,"" director/producer and Head of Drama Rosita Clarke told CNN. ""It's a kind of relief to see the efforts of what you've worked on and achieved an absolute reality."" Clarke is the driving force behind the project and says many people didn't believe she would be able to pull off a feature film when she first came up with the idea. ""Miss Clarke pitched the idea, and said she was going to make a feature film and we all thought she was joking,"" said 18-year-old Ben Jones, a Gryphon student, who plays Sergeant Troy in the film. ""But we all kind of went along with it and it's turned into this."" Clarke was inspired to make the feature after she directed a play with some film footage in it the previous year. ""I thought to myself, 'I'm going to make a film,'"" she said. After getting permission from the school, Clarke sat down with Hardy's book during the school summer holidays and over two weeks wrote a screenplay. In August 2008, Gryphon's Hardy feature went into production. ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" unfolds against the backdrop of rural 19th Century England and tells the story of beautiful Bathsheba Everdene who inherits a farm from her uncle and finds herself loved by three men. The feature was filmed over weekends, holidays and snatched evenings after school. It is full of exquisite costumes, gorgeous Dorset vistas and faultless acting from students aged between 16 and 18-years old. Despite the demands of the shooting schedule, the students say they were able to fit in their schoolwork around it. ""As far as the study goes, it's been ok,"" said Jones. Watch CNN The Screening Room's Myleene Klass report on the Gryphon School's London premiere . The pupils involved say it didn't undermine their studies, and in some cases helped it by giving them an invaluable experience in an industry they would like to work in in the future. ""Some of us want to get into the profession and this experience has been really valuable,"" said Jack Buckley, 18, who plays shepherd Gabriel Oak. ""We haven't done any film acting before and it's very different to stage acting so we've learn a lot about that."" But the experience has not been without challenges: Using just one camera Clarke and her team had to film a fire in a 19th Century hayrick [haystack], work with livestock including sheep and shoot large crowd scenes. In total 130 pupils worked on the film in roles from hair and make-up to walk-on parts. Alice Ralph, 18, who stars as Bathsheba, says acting for the camera was one aspect that took some getting used to. ""At first I found it really hard to get used to the camera. I found it really awkward,"" she said. ""I remember the first shoot. I couldn't even say my lines."" Emotional scenes shot up-close requiring convincing tears and restrained acting also proved a challenge for the students who are used to acting on stage. ""The emotional scenes were actually really difficult,"" said Ralph. ""I found them quite hard to get, with the crying and things but with Mrs Clarke's help she put me in a situation and I'd use emotional memory and I'd get there in the end."" Clarke had no experience of filmmaking when she started up and used the Internet and books to learn about lighting and camera angles. She also picked up some tips on camera work from her 21-year-old son, Sunny, a broadcast production student. Sunny also edited the film and Clarke says he had the editor's final word and helped her to keep the film slick. ""I wanted as many students as possible to have a little showing, and he's looking at it from a professional level of final finish."" The film cost a little over $11,000 (£7,000) to make, much of which Clarke raised from banks and supermarkets in the local community. ""We haven't had money and we couldn't get the sound right all the time and it got dark too quickly because we were trying to get it all done and it's just been so pressurized,"" says Clarke. Nevertheless, she was always convinced she would successfully complete the film --  ""It wasn't ever not going to happen."" For Clarke the best bit of the film is ""the success for the students. What they're feeling. What they must be feeling. That just blows me away. ""That's what makes me proud and if I've helped them on their way.""","The school in southern England made a feature-length film starring pupils .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Crack-addicted Felicia Anderson was pregnant with her third child when an ultrasound changed the direction of her life. After inpatient rehab, Felicia Anderson sought help from Mothers Making a Change to help beat her addiction. ""You could hear that baby's heartbeat strong and steady. Really, that's her personality today, a strong, vibrant little girl. And at that time, laying there, tears starting rolling down my face,"" Anderson, 44, recalled. In that moment, Anderson vowed to stay off drugs, something she'd been unable to do in more than a decade addicted to crack cocaine, even when she was pregnant with her first two children. Anderson didn't think she could do it alone, so, like almost 2 million Americans a year, she entered a treatment program. Anderson spent three weeks in residential treatment -- all she could afford -- but didn't think that was enough, so she enrolled in Mothers Making a Change, a year-long outpatient drug and alcohol program in Atlanta, Georgia. Three times as many Americans choose outpatient treatment as residential treatment, or rehab. It costs less, is more likely to be covered by insurance and does not require participants to leave work or their families for a month or more. The outpatient program Anderson chose, Mothers Making a Change, is designed especially for pregnant women and women with young children. Anderson was both. At the time, her oldest daughter, Sierra, was 5; her middle child, Anicia, was almost 2. In addition to therapy and education, Mothers Making a Change provided transportation and offered free child care while Anderson was there. When she completed the program, Mothers Making a Change helped her find a job. ""I can say with everything in me, with every bit of my breath, that program helped me turn my life around,"" said Anderson, who now runs a program to help the developmentally disabled in DeKalb County, Georgia.  Interactive: Addiction and the brain » . Like most programs, residential or outpatient, Mothers Making a Change is built on the 12 steps pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous. Among them: Admit you're powerless over your addiction, and turn your life over to a higher power. ""It's important in my opinion to have a connection with your spiritual world, your higher power,"" Anderson said. ""So I thank God, first of all, for giving me a second chance in life."" Anderson began drinking and smoking marijuana in high school. She moved on to snorting cocaine and then smoking it. She said her drug use began spiraling out of control when her husband, an Army infantryman, committed suicide after returning from Operation Desert Storm. She said the crack numbed her pain.  Watch Felicia Anderson describe her experience » . Anderson tried to hide her addiction, but the lies became harder to maintain. She lost weight. She couldn't keep a job. And she began stealing to keep her children clothed and fed and to support her habit. She even stole their Christmas presents. ""The gifts would be under the tree, and I needed some crack, and I would take whatever present was there,"" Anderson recalled. ""The crack was my friend. The crack was my job. The crack was my children. You know, it was my life. So no matter how bad I wanted to stop, I couldn't stop,"" she said. Anderson said she even smoked crack as she went into labor with her second child. ""That's to tell you how bad off, how out of control, how much it didn't matter,"" she said. ""But I couldn't stop. I couldn't stop."" Caught shoplifting repeatedly, Anderson said, she was facing a five-year prison sentence in Maryland for violating probation when her brother Brian Robinson intervened. He convinced the judge to let Anderson and her two daughters come to Georgia with him and to let his sister check into rehab instead of going to jail. Like many addicts, Anderson hit rock bottom before seeking treatment. Counselors and others say most addicts get help only when they get in trouble at home, at work, with their health or with the law. Anderson went for her ultrasound and had an epiphany. ""Something inside me -- and I would say it's the voice of God -- saying, 'You can do this.' And laying there at that moment, I did say to myself, 'I can do this. Let me try to do this.' That was a turning point for me,"" Anderson said. ""That baby that was born was born drug-free."" Anderson said that she has been drug-free for 12 years and that she's lucky: Her older two children did not suffer any health consequences from her addiction. Anderson now has everything she had lost for a big part of her adult life: a stable home life, a job. Also, she's engaged.

"(CNN) -- It's not just for French kissing or for showing your dissatisfaction. Besides showing off at concerts, licking lollipops, and teasing, the tongue could help people gain mobility. Aside from everyday functions of chewing, swallowing, talking and tasting, the tongue has new uses such as steering wheelchairs and helping blind people see. Also in Spain last month, doctors transplanted a tongue as part of a face transplant surgery. ""The tongue is considered very much like the trunk of an elephant or the tentacle of the octopus. It's the same kind of structure with how many shapes, configurations the trunk or tentacle can assume,"" said E. Fiona Bailey, an assistant professor of physiology at The University of Arizona in Tucson. ""Researchers realize there is a lot of potential there."" Transplanting tongues . A team of surgeons in Spain last month performed a face transplant, which is considered the first to include the tongue and jaws. A 43-year-old man who lost his jaws and tongue after a cancer battle 11 years ago received a transplant for the bottom third of his face, according to the Hospital La Fe in Valencia, Spain. Dr. Pedro Cavadas, the surgical team leader, said the objective was for the patient to recover feeling in his face and also to swallow, talk, feel and taste with his tongue again. But the first tongue transplant in 2003 had short-lived results.  Doctors in Austria transplanted a tongue to a 42-year-old cancer patient.  The cancer returned and the patient died 13 months after the surgery, according to a 2008 article written by his doctors in the journal Transplantation. A transplant recipient has to take immune suppressing drugs so he or she won't reject the new organ.  But this puts the person at risk for cancer recurrence because of the weakened immune system, said Dr. Douglas Chepeha, a head and neck surgical oncologist at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ann Arbor. Unlike liver or kidney transplants, reconnecting the tongue is also more complex because of its nerves, said Chepeha, who is the director of the microvascular program. ""A nerve is not like a single wire in your house,"" he said.  ""When we say a nerve, there are literally thousands if not hundred thousands of tiny little fibers. It'll be like taking a fiber optic cable and cutting it -- let's say that cable had 100,000 fibers in it -- how do you realign it?"" Chepeha said: ""If we can get some way of knowing which way to hook the nerves up, someday it'll work better. Right now, we're not there."" Driving wheelchairs . A new kind of wheelchair allows people who cannot use their hands and feet to steer using simple tongue movements. This technology can assist people who have spinal cord injuries, said Maysam Ghovanloo, an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Unlike hands and feet, the tongue has a distinct advantage because it doesn't connect to the spinal cord, he said. To use the wheelchair, a magnet the size of a lentil sits on the driver's tongue affixed by edible glue. When the person in the wheelchair touches a certain tooth with his or her tongue, the wheelchair moves -- for example, a left tooth, the wheelchair will turn left. Magnetic sensors trace the movement of the tongue and transmit the directions to get the wheelchair moving. ""The tongue is always moving, but the technology is smart enough to tell the difference between natural movements and the tongue movements [meant to steer the wheelchair],"" Ghovanloo said. Researchers conducted clinical trials this summer in which people with spinal cord injuries navigated through an obstacle course using their tongues. Those who had recently been injured were more receptive to driving with their tongues than others who have gotten used to the existing technology, Ghovanloo said. The tongue-driven wheelchair is not available to the public yet, pending more clinical trials in 2010. Aiding vision . Researchers devised an instrument to allow users to ""see"" through the tongue. Called the BrainPort, the vision device sits on the tongue to help blind people get a sense of their environment. The device, which is the size of a postage stamp, connects to a digital video camera. The camera paints the visual scene in front of a person by turning it into gentle stimulations on the tongue that feel like bubbles. For example, when a person moves across the room, the device creates vibrations across the tongue to resemble the movement. Aimee Arnoldussen, a neuroscientist at the device maker's company, Wicab Inc., said scientists turned to the tongue because ""the tongue has a high density of nerve endings, which makes it sensitive."" Other parts of the body, such as the back, were not sufficiently sensitive.  The fingertips were sensitive enough, but people wanted full use of their hands to grip a cane or to grab objects. Placing the device ""on the tongue inside the mouth, frees the hands to interact with environment,"" Arnoldussen said. Plus, the device can be hidden in the mouth. The device is still in development, but Arnoldussen said the company hopes to make it available to the public within the next year. E-tongue senses sweet . Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed a handheld device the size of a business card, which can taste the sweetness in food and drinks. This could lead to the first electronic tongue that would be able to identify sources of sweetness. ""We could determine what sweetener would be in your tea,"" researcher Christopher Musto told CNN Radio. The device can distinguish among 14 kinds of sweeteners, from natural sugars to artificial ones such as Splenda. Musto described two possible applications: This would be a first step toward an electronic tongue and second, it could be a handheld device that would determine what sweetener and the amount.","Researchers turn to the tongue for new ways to help people with disabilities .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Six gay men were shot dead by members of their tribe in two separate incidents in the past 10 days, an official with Iraq's Interior ministry said. In the most recent attack, two men were killed Thursday in Sadr City area of Baghdad after they were disowned by relatives, the official said. The shootings came after a tribal meeting was held and the members decided to go after the victims. On March 26, four additional men were fatally shot in the same city, the official said, adding that the victims had also been disowned by their relatives. The official declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Witnesses told CNN that a Sadr City cafe, which was a popular gathering spot for gays, was also set on fire.","In the most recent attack, two men were killed Thursday in Sadr City area of Baghdad .

"(CNN)  -- Panathinaikos sacked Dutch coach Henk Ten Cate on Tuesday after the Greek side lost the league leadership to arch rivals Olympiakos. Ten Cate took over at the Athens-based side last season as Panathinaikos looked to end the dominance of Olympiakos, who have won every Greek championship bar one since 1997. They led the standings until a 2-0 defeat to Olympiakos saw the champions move one point clear of Panathinaikos after 13 games. Panathinaikos are also still in the Europa League and Greek Cup, but this did not prove enough to save Ten Cate, who will be replaced by Nikos Nioplias, the coach of the Greece under-21 team. Ten Cate, who was assistant manager at English Premier League side Chelsea, told the official Panathinaikos Web site that it had been an ""honor"" to be in charge. ""I have laid the groundwork for this team. I respect the fact that some people may not be happy with the general picture, but my assistants and I have given everything to succeed."" The 54-year-old was assistant at Chelsea under Avram Grant and was previously number two at Barcelona to Frank Rijkaard. Panathinaikos was his first managerial position and he took them to the last 16 of last season's Champions League, but could not dislodge Olympiakos in the Greek title race. He was on a two-year contract, which still had six months to run on his departure. The 45-year-old Nioplias, was bullish in his official statement on taking charge. ""My aim is to achieve with the team as a coach what I have achieved as a player -- win titles."" He has an excellent record with the Greek age group teams, taking the under-19 team to the final of the European championship and leading the under-21 squad to the top of their European championship group. On other managerial news, Sinisa Mihajlovic has taken charge of Catania after the Serie A side dispensed with Gianluca Atzori on Monday. Former Bologna coach Mihajlovic has signed a two-year deal with Catania, who are second bottom of the Italian standings.","Coach Henk Ten Cate sacked by Greek giants Panathinaikos .

"(CNN) -- When George Pinon thinks of colors, he associates them with what other people have described. George Pinon leads tour groups through Dialog in the Dark, an exhibit that simulates the blind experience. ""They say that red is supposed to be a warm color, a hot color. I heard that apples are red and roses are red. I heard that plants are green, the grass is green,"" he said. ""That's all you can do, you know?"" Pinon, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, has been blind since age 3, when a high fever caused optic nerve damage. He leads small tour groups through Dialog in the Dark, an exhibit traveling around the world that aims to foster understanding between people with and without vision. For about an hour, visitors navigate different environments in complete darkness, relying on all senses except sight, and ask questions of their visually impaired guide, whose face they don't see until leaving. Stumbling in darkness makes the Dialog visitor appreciate how visually oriented the world is -- how would you go grocery shopping? How would you cross the street? -- as well as the reliance on other senses such as sound and touch to navigate the world. Investigating preventions, therapies . Researchers continue to search for methods of preventing and treating blindness. A new study in the Journal of Archives of Ophthalmology shows that a single serving of fish per week is associated with a reduced risk of incident early age-related macular degeneration, a disease that is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people older than 60. The macula, a part of the retina that allows central vision, deteriorates in this condition. Stem cells may also hold promise for AMD. The London Project to Cure Blindness, with support from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, is working on a therapy from human embryonic cells. The project's goal is to begin human clinical trials by 2011. The therapy aims to use embryonic stem cells to replace the cells that have been lost because of the disease. Through surgery, the cells would be implanted to restore vision. Read more about AMD . Interpreting the world . A variety of devices have been developed to help visually impaired individuals interact with the world around them. Some of these technologies use Braille. There are Braille codes for alphabets, mathematics, science, music and even computer programming, all based on the system of characters called cells, which consist of six dots in two parallel columns. But fewer than 10 percent of the 1.3 million legally blind individuals in the United States read Braille, according to the National Federation of the Blind. Only 10 percent of blind children are learning the system of raised dots that allows blind people to read and write through touch. Reasons for this include a shortage of teachers qualified to teach Braille and misconceptions about the system, such as that it's difficult to learn, the organization said in a recent report. The National Federation of the Blind has worked with technology developers to enhance Braille to adapt to the needs to visually impaired people, said Mark Riccobono, executive director of the organization's Jernigan Institute. The organization's International Braille and Technology Center for the Blind in Baltimore, Maryland, has nearly every tactile and speech output technology available for blind people to learn how to use. A mechanical device called a refreshable Braille display raises and lowers a set of pins to form characters, translating words on a computer screen into Braille. The pins refresh and translate subsequent text as the user scrolls down on a computer screen. Riccobono, who has glaucoma and has been losing vision throughout his life, did not learn Braille as a child and believes that he missed out on literacy opportunities. He discovered Braille in college, which cut his study time down by 50 percent, he said. Braille is the only equivalent to print for visually impaired individuals, he said. ""Listening is not the same as actively reading something and seeing how words are spelled,"" he said. ""Sometimes technology is used as an excuse to not provide Braille."" Still, Pinon, who reads Braille, uses speech access software to browse the Internet. He also noted that some movie theaters provide a special earpiece that has voice commentary describing what's on screen, and some DVDs have commentary features also. Some visually impaired individuals use a knfbReader, a device that takes a picture of text, such as a menu, and reads it back. The Amazon Kindle, a digital reader for books and magazines, now has speech access, a feature for which the National Federation for the Blind advocated. Read more about the voice capabilities of Kindle 2 . Improving sight through technology . There are also technologies that allow visually impaired people to use other senses to orient themselves. One new device is called BrainPort, which allows the user to ""see"" through the tongue. BrainPort consists of an electrode array the size of a postage stamp on the surface of the tongue, which communicates with a digital camera, a base unit and a hand-held controller. The device electrically stimulates the tactile receptors on the tongue. The electrode array has a spatial map such that, as people move across a room, the vibration goes across the tongue. ""People are able to adapt and be trained to interpret this as spatial information,"" said Dr. William Seiple, vice president for research at the nonprofit Lighthouse International in New York. The device is being tested at Lighthouse, which has a mockup bedroom, bedroom and kitchen to help visually impaired individuals learn how to handle real-life situations.  Watch as one patient gets an artificial corneal transplant » . Another avenue of research is the retinal implant. The user experiences something akin to what a person with sight sees when pressing on a closed eyelid: flashes of light, Seiple said. The rays of the electrode in the eye produce these flashes, which the brain learns to interpret. ""We've all done this throughout our lives,"" he said. ""We have to interpret what's out there in the world."" Getting around without seeing . The U.S. Mint introduced the first coin with readable Braille in March, but not for general circulation. Only 400,000 are minted, and they cost more than $30 each. The National Federation of the Blind can receive surcharges from sales. Since paper bills have no obvious tactile indicators, blind individuals can ask for their money bill by bill at the bank and fold it in different ways to know what they're getting, Pinon said. He tends to use debit cards when possible. As sighted people feel around with canes in the dark at Dialog, Pinon helps them along with the sound of his voice and, for the lost ones, a gentle pat on the shoulder. Pinon has a dog to help him navigate. He has a wife and three children. He even enjoys traveling, sampling the smells, tastes and sounds of foreign voices. Moving to a new place -- from Florida to Georgia -- was somewhat challenging, but, as he told a group of Dialog visitors seated in total darkness, ""You have to be adventurous and explorative and just get out and get to know the area a little bit. ""You pretty much have to be fearless,"" he said.","Fewer than 10 percent of legally blind individuals in the U.S. read Braille .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- A suspected terrorist linked to several Indonesian bombings in the past decade was killed in a protracted firefight Saturday in the Central Java town of Temanggung, two law enforcement sources told CNN. A poster in Malang, East Java, Indonesia, has under ""dicari,"" or""wanted,"" Noordin Top. Another raid by police Saturday averted a planned assassination attempt on Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, authorities said. Noordin M. Top was killed during a raid by the anti-terrorism unit Detachment 88 that began Friday and lasted 18 hours into Saturday, said a police source and a security analyst with close ties to the police. Official confirmation of Top's identity will come next week after DNA results, said Indonesia's National Police Chief, Bambang Hendarso. Indonesia's anti-terrorism forces had been hunting Top for the past six years. He is also the main suspect in last month's twin hotel bombings in Jakarta. A statement attributed to Top, 40, a Malaysian-born explosives expert, claimed responsibility for the attacks that targeted Jakarta's JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels. The coordinated bombings killed seven people and the two suspected bombers, and wounded more than 50.  Watch more about the raid » . It was the first major terrorist attack in Indonesia in more than three years. Top is reportedly an officer, recruiter, bomb-maker and trainer for a splinter group of the militant organization Jemaah Islamiyah, which has ties to al Qaeda. He allegedly was involved in a previous attack on the Marriott in Jakarta in August 2003, as well as attacks on a Bali nightclub in 2002 and the Australian embassy in Jakarta in 2004, according to the FBI. In February 2006, the FBI added Top to its list of 10 suspected terrorists who have not been charged in the United States, and are wanted only for questioning. The ramifications of Top's death were not immediately clear. ""This is a huge advance in Indonesia's fight against terror,"" said Sidney Jones, a senior Asia adviser for the International Crisis Group, a global nonpartisan advisory organization. ""But this is not the end of it because we still don't know the extent of the network and the funding source of Noordin's network."" Three to four people were believed to be holed up in the house in Temanggung, police said. Security forces had launched a raid on the house after two people believed to be nephews of its owner were arrested earlier in the day, according to the official Antara News Agency. ""Police officers entered the house and fired profusely inside the house while other policemen surrounded the house and opened its windows by force,"" Antara said. After the gunfire ended, local television showed police with their helmets off, shaking hands and carrying caskets into the house, suggesting that those inside the house had been killed or captured. Also on Saturday, in a house on the outskirts of Jakarta, Indonesian police killed two militants believed to be connected with a 2004 bombing and found a cache of explosives in an early morning raid, the national police chief said. Hendarso said that police found about 100 kg (220 lbs) of explosives along with bomb-making materials and a truck, which they did not immediately open for fear it might have been rigged to explode. Those bomb-making materials were going to be used in an attack on the president, Hendarso said. The two militants killed are believed to be connected with the 2004 bombing of the Australian embassy in Jakarta in which 16 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded, Hendarso said. Also, a man identified as Suryana, who uses the aliases Yayan and Gepeng, was arrested in north Jakarta on suspicion of terrorism charges, said Nanan Soekarna, police inspector general. Soekarna could not say whether Suryana was connected with last month's hotel bombings or other incidents.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Leon Panetta, chief of staff in President Bill Clinton's White House, will be President-elect Barack Obama's choice to be CIA director, two Democratic officials told CNN on Monday. Leon Panetta, who has a strong background in economics, was chief of staff for President Bill Clinton. The officials also said retired Adm. Dennis Blair, who formerly headed the U.S. Navy's Pacific Command, will be tapped as director of national intelligence. Panetta, 70, has had a long political career, beginning in 1966 when he served as a legislative assistant to U.S. Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel. R-California. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1977, serving California's 16th (now 17th) District until Clinton appointed him to head the Office of Budget and Management in 1993. He was chief of staff from 1994 to 1997. Panetta and his wife, Sylvia, founded and co-direct the Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, which provides study opportunities for students there and at several other schools. He serves on several boards and committees, and lectures internationally on economics. With a strong background in economics, Panetta has little hands-on experience in intelligence. But he is known as a strong manager with solid organizational skills. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who will be the new chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she had not been told in advance of Panetta's selection. ""My position has consistently been that I believe the agency is best served by having an intelligence professional in charge at this time,"" the California Democrat said. But Sen. Ron Wyden, a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, said he was consulted on the pick and praised Panetta. ""I believe he has the skills to usher in a new era of accountability at the nation's premier intelligence agency,"" said Wyden, D-Oregon. ""For too long our nation's intelligence community has operated under a policy of questionable effectiveness and legality in which consulting two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee counted as 'consulting with Congress.' "" Sen. Kit Bond, R-Missouri, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, also questioned Panetta's lack of intelligence experience, as did outgoing committee chairman Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, wouldn't comment until Obama makes an announcement, but his spokesman said that Hoekstra ""has called for a new direction and a change in the culture a the CIA for some time."" ""Whether it is Leon Panetta or someone else, it is important the agency move in a new direction,"" Jamal Ware said. Blair, 61, was a 1968 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and attended Oxford University in Britain as a Rhodes scholar at the same time as Clinton. Blair retired from the Navy in 2002. He was the CIA's first associate director of military support and served on the National Security Council. He has been sharply critical of U.S. policy in terms of strategic long-term planning. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's cabinet picks . ""I am in awe of the sophisticated strategies that American politicians can devise and pursue over many years,"" he told a House panel in July. ""They involve very public activities -- speeches, programs, alliances -- but also backroom deals, and stratagems, tactical flexibility but strategic constancy, investment in intellectual and organizational capabilities that will not pay off for years. ""I have yet to see these same brilliant politicians come up with similar strategies to advance the national interest when they come into national office. Our national strategies show little of the depth, brilliance and effectiveness of the domestic political strategies this country produces."" Blair also is known in Navy circles for once trying to water-ski behind the destroyer he skippered, the USS Cochrane.","Next Senate intelligence chairwoman says she wasn't told Panetta was picked .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Richard Waltzer has a pitch for Cuba: Miller beer and Häagen-Dazs ice cream. If he has his way, those products soon will be available at supermarkets and beach resorts on the communist island. ""This is one of the things people are going to pay premium for,"" Waltzer said, ""especially the tourists that have the dollars. It's going to be a phenomenal product."" This week, dozens of Americans are in Havana, peddling their wares at an international trade fair: apples, pears, grapes, raisins, nuts out of California. U.S.-Cuba relations appear to be thawing. In Havana, billboards depicting the U.S. president as Adolf Hitler have disappeared. In Washington, President Obama has lifted restrictions on Cuban-American travel and money transfers. The new political climate has prompted companies such as Chicago Foods to come to Havana's trade fair for the first time. They're hoping to break into the little-known market and go home with a contract. Despite a trade embargo imposed against Cuba in 1962, the United States is the No. 1 supplier of food to that country and has been for more than five years. A law passed in 2000 allows the United States to export agricultural products and medicine. But this year, the global economic crisis is taking its toll. ""Cuba has not been an exception,"" said Rodrigo Malmierca Diaz, minister of foreign trade and investment. ""At the end of the third quarter in 2009, our trade fell by 36 percent."" The country is slashing imports of U.S. food by one-third, which means some vendors will go home empty-handed. But vendors are betting U.S.-Cuba relations will only get better. They said they're also hoping the next step could be bills in the U.S. Congress that would eliminate restrictions on all Americans traveling to Cuba. ""We're in this for the long haul as well,"" said Paul Johnson of Chicago Foods. ""Like I said before, we're thinking about today as well as tomorrow.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Stevie Wonder has had more than 30 U.S. top ten hits and has won 22 Grammy Awards -- more than any other male artist. Blind from birth, Wonder's music has always reflected his concern with humanitarian and social issues. On Thursday, he joined the prestigious list of U.N. Messengers of Peace and will focus on the battle for disabled rights. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced the appointment, calling Wonder a ""musical genius"" and ""great humanitarian, who has campaigned against apartheid, for children in need, and for persons with disabilities."" Speaking about his new U.N. role Wonder told CNN's Becky Anderson: ""It's about that ten percent of the world that suffers with a disability. It's about sounding that alarm off that says to the 90 percent: it's time to get it together for those of us with disabilities."" Asked by Anderson what phrase which would encapsulate his mission Wonder said: ""We can never let our fears put our dreams to sleep."" He said the 90 percent of people who aren't disabled should learn not to fear disability, whatever form it takes and called for a stop to an ""ignorance to the highest point of ridiculousness."" Wonder hopes that politicians will listen to him in his new role as a U.N. messenger. ""If you love my music that much, then care about those ten percent as well. There are 650 million disabled people in the world. Lets do something about that. Lets make a change,"" he said. The popularity of Wonder's music at the White House is well known. Indeed, President Obama says he owes a lot to his music. When awarding Wonder the U.S.'s highest award for pop music: the Library of Congress' Gershwin prize earlier this year the president said: ""Michelle might not have dated me, we might not have married. The fact that we agreed on Stevie was the essence of our courtship."" Wonder isn't surprised to see a black man in the White House. ""That whole place of feeling that you can't have a black president or a female president, it's always been about people's inability to think out of the box that's always been backward in the first place."" The only downside from Wonder's new role is for his fans. His new album ""Gospel Inspired By Lula"" wont be coming out until next May he told Anderson. He admitted that after all these years in the business he still gets nervous and still hits the odd bum note. ""We did a show recently where my voice cracked and I said 'we gotta do that again!' We all laughed about it."" Does he have a favorite song from his own catalogue? ""I always use this thing that Duke Ellington would say. He used to say that 'I haven't written it yet.' I guess I would say the same. I would say this to you: whatever your favorite is, is my favorite too.""","Stevie Wonder talks to CNN about his new U.N. role .

"London, England (CNN) -- Formula 1 will continue to take place in Britain for the next 17 years after a deal was struck between Silverstone's owners and the sport's chief Bernie Ecclestone. Monday's announcement by the track's owners means the oldest venue on the F1 calendar keeps its place. Silverstone's comeback took place despite rival track Donington Park being awarded the contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010. However, that circuit lost out after failing to secure the $200 million needed to fund redevelopment plans. That had led to fears Ecclestone would look to move the race abroad. Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips told the Press Association: ""We've always had five-year deals and never been able to get the investment we needed to redevelop. ""But 17 years gives us the ability to invest and move forward. We've always had the belief the British Grand Prix was an important cornerstone of Formula One but, with Bernie, you're never quite sure. Phillips described the deal as ""peace in our time"" between the circuit's owners, the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC), and Ecclestone. ""The relationship with Formula One Management has been improving,"" added Phillips. ""There's a good working relationship with him now and we don't have any issues."" Applauding the negotiating team, BRDC president and 1996 F1 world champion Damon Hill told the Press Association: ""It's not easy to enter into an agreement of this magnitude. It's a big commitment. ""But the BRDC felt we wanted this relationship to continue, and we were prepared to back the negotiating team, with the level of risk satisfactory for the deal to go ahead. ""This announcement is tremendous news. It really does cement Silverstone as a motor sport venue and is incredibly satisfying for the BRDC to cement its relationship with F1.""","Formula 1 will continue in Britain after deal between Silverstone and sport's chief Bernie Ecclestone .

"Editor's note: Sherrilyn Ifill is a professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law and a civil rights lawyer who specializes in voting rights and political participation. She is the author of ""On the Courthouse Lawn: Confronting the Legacy of Lynching in the 21st Century,"" and is a regular contributor to The Root at http://www.theroot.com/. Sherrilyn Ifill says Sonia Sotomayor's speech was an honest effort to describe how judges rule on cases. (CNN) -- When Don Imus denigrated in clearly racist terms the championship women's basketball team from Rutgers University; when actor Michael Richards screamed at black guests in a comedy club, calling them the ""n-word"" and invoking the threat of lynching; when Trent Lott said that things would have been better if a southern segregationist had been elected president a half-century earlier, responsible white people from across the ideological spectrum stepped forward to explain that these individuals were not racist. The ""R"" word has become the taboo of the white world. By this I mean that calling someone racist is a taboo, not racism itself. So when Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich and several other conservative commentators call a sitting federal appeals court judge and Supreme Court nominee who happens to be Latina, a racist, it's time to push back. Real hard. The evidence offered in support of Judge Sonia Sotomayor's alleged racism is a speech she gave in Berkeley, California, in honor of Judge Mario G. Olmos, a former judge, community leader and graduate of Boalt Hall Law School who died an untimely death at the age of 43. The offending section of the speech is this: ""I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" This passage inspired Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives and potential 2012 presidential candidate, to call Judge Sotomayor ""a Latina racist."" To lift one statement out of Judge Sotomayor's eight-page speech without examining the context and substance of her remarks, is an example of the kind of shoddy character assassination that I suspect will dominate this judicial confirmation process. Judge Sotomayor's speech is, in fact, an excellent meditation on how the experiences of judges might affect how they approach aspects of judicial decision-making. It explores the important, and too-little examined reality that judicial deliberations can be affected by a judge's background, perspective and experience. In the next sentence immediately following the passage above, Judge Sotomayor says, ""Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice [Benjamin] Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society."" Could she have been referring to Buck v. Bell, the 1927 case in which Justice Holmes -- widely regarded as perhaps the most brilliant justice in the Supreme Court's history -- upheld the state's plan to sterilize Carrie Buck, an 18-year-old white woman, who was accused of being congenitally retarded. Buck's main crime seems to have been the fact that she'd had a child out of wedlock. In any case, Justice Holmes upheld the sterilization order, emphatically and coldly stating, ""three generations of imbeciles is enough."" Does anyone seriously believe that a woman, and especially a woman of color ""with the richness of her experiences"" would not have ""reach[ed] a better conclusion "" than that adopted by Justice Holmes in 1927? In fact Buck v. Bell is the perfect example of how a ""wise old [white] man"" got it wrong in a way that a woman judge or a racial minority most likely would not. It's worth pointing out that in that same speech Judge Sotomayor cautioned, ""we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group."" But she acknowledges that ""there may be some [difference in her judging] based on my gender and my Latina heritage."" What Gingrich and others decry in Judge Sotomayor should be applauded. Judge Sotomayor has the humility to recognize the difficulty of achieving true and pure impartiality. Instead, as she pointed out in her speech, ""[t]he aspiration to impartiality is just that -- it's an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others."" Unlike so many judges who by virtue of being white and male simply assume their impartiality, Judge Sotomayor recognizes that all judges are affected by their background and their life experiences. Ironically, it was Justice Cardozo who recognized this when he said, ""[t]he great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men, do not turn aside in their course, and pass the judge by."" Justice Cardozo concluded that ""[n]o effort or revolution of the mind will overthrow utterly and at all times the empire of ... [a judge's] subconscious loyalties. These are the realities of judicial decision-making evoked by Judge Sotomayor's speech. It's perhaps easier to say as [then-Supreme Court nominee] Clarence Thomas so famously did, that a judge can simply, ""strip down like a runner,"" and become utterly impartial simply by putting on a black robe. But it is more honest to acknowledge that regardless of race, gender, ideology or professional background, impartiality is always a work-in-progress for judges. Even Judge Richard Posner, a conservative stalwart on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals once observed that, ""Litigation commonly involves persons at different social distances form the judge, and the more proximate will garner the more sympathetic response regardless of actual desert."" Justice Thomas is the perfect example of how hard it can be for a judge to lay aside the personal experiences that shape his worldview. His views about the affirmative action cases that come before him are shaped quite clearly by what he regards as the self-sufficient dignity of his hard-working grandfather and the humiliation he says he felt when others believed his scholarly accomplishments were the result of affirmative action. White judges are also shaped by their background and experiences. They needn't ever speak of it, simply because their whiteness and gender insulates them from the presumption of partiality and bias that is regularly attached to women judges and judges of color when it comes to matters of race and gender. Only a judge who is conscious and fully engaged with the reality of how her experiences may bear on her approach to the facts of a case, or sense of social justice, or vision of constitutional interpretation, should be entrusted to sit on the most influential and powerful court in our nation. Too often we have allowed ourselves to be placated and charmed by fantasies about umpire judges calling ""balls and strikes,"" without ever asking which league the game is being played in or whether the umpire was standing in the best position to see the play. We forget that when deciding whether a batter checked his swing, the homeplate umpire will routinely ask for the alternative perspective from the first or third base umpire before calling a ""swing and a miss"" a strike. Judge Sotomayor rightly suggests that these things matter. She notes in her speech that ""personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see."" She should know this. She's been a trial judge. None of the other justices who will serve with Judge Sotomayor will have had that experience. Judge Sotomayor's speech is one of the most honest and compelling statements about judicial impartiality we're likely to hear from a judge of her stature. It ends with this humble observation: . ""Each day on the bench I learn something new about the judicial process and about being a professional Latina woman in a world that sometimes looks at me with suspicion. I am reminded each day that I render decisions that affect people concretely and that I owe them constant and complete vigilance in checking my assumptions, presumptions and perspectives and ensuring that to the extent that my limited abilities and capabilities permit me, that I re-evaluate them and change as circumstances and cases before me requires. I can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my experiences, but I accept my limitations. I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage but attempt, as the Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are appropriate."" It's entirely appropriate to question Judge Sotomayor about this speech at her confirmation hearings. She is evidently more than capable of explaining in compelling, clear language what precisely she wanted to convey in this speech. But Judge Sotomayor is not a racist. It is an insult of unimaginable proportion to unleash this charge on her, based on one sentence from her Berkeley, California, speech. It is not just irresponsible to make this charge against a sitting federal appeals court judge based on this flimsy record; it is -- and here I'll break the taboo -- racist to do so. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sherrilyn Ifill.","Sherrilyn Ifill: The charge of being a racist is a taboo in much of society .

"London, England (CNN) -- If the location is anything to go by, then the omens are promising. Denmark's capital city, Copenhagen -- host to the U.N. climate summit which starts today -- is already one of the greenest cities in Europe. With over 300 kilometers of cycle lanes it is estimated that around 40 percent of the 1.2 population travel to work on a bicycle. And visitors to the city are encouraged to join in by making use of the network of city bikes for a deposit of just 20 DKK ($4). The influence of two wheels has extended into Yuletide this year, as cyclists in City Hall Square are generating the electricity powering the lights on the Christmas tree. It's just one of hundreds of activities and events which Copenhageners have organized to coincide with the 11-day U.N. summit taking place at the Bella Center in the Orestad district in the southeast of the city. The opening of the summit marks the end of an exhaustive planning period by the city. Preparations at the Bella Center began two years ago. The finishing touches began eight weeks ago. ""It is, by far, the largest conference we have ever held and the largest political conference in Europe,"" the Bella Center press manager, Lars Lemche told CNN. ""If numbers continue to grow, it will be the biggest political meeting the U.N. has ever held,"" he said. The center has hosted big events before -- a European Union summit in 2002 and the 2006 MTV European Music Awards -- but the U.N. summit makes them look like a tea party. ""A conference is 36 hours. This is 11 days,"" Lemche said. The Bella Center has had to extend its floor space to 77,000 square meters -- the size of 11 football pitches -- to accommodate all delegates and 1000 staff will be on hand throughout. Numbers are expected to peak at around 18,000 in the second week when 100 heads of state arrive for the high-level political negotiations. This Herculean effort of planning is being backed up by a raft of green initiatives. Outside the conference center solar-powered streetlights are helping light the car parks. A wind turbine is helping power the lights indoors. Inside the conference center delegates will eat from a menu that is 65 percent organic and drink water that has come out of a tap rather than a bottle. Pens provided will be made from recycled plastic, and even the carpets are biodegradable. In a bid to offset the considerable carbon dioxide emissions - estimated to be 40,000 tons -- generated by the summit, organizers are funding the replacement of polluting brick factories in Dhaka, Bangladesh with 20 new efficient ones. Despite the disruption, Copenhageners have gone about their daily business as usual. Jason Heppenstall, Editor of The Copenhagen Post, a weekly English language newspaper told CNN: ""There hasn't been much of a build up until the last few days. Until about two weeks ago it's not been talked about a lot in the press and maybe a month ago half the people in Denmark didn't know there was going to be a conference,"" he told CNN. People are starting to notice changes now, and the mood among Copenhageners is positive, apart from the locals living near the Bella Center and whose lives have been disrupted by all the security arrangements, Heppenstall said. The concrete barriers and the perimeter fence erected to protect the Bella Center have been one of the more obvious signs of security in the city. And now that the conference has started, 6000 officers will be on duty during the conference. Niels-Otto Fisker, communications advisor to the Danish national police commissioner, told CNN: ""It is the single greatest operation that the Danish police have undertaken. Police are being drafted in from all over the country, and shifts are being extended from eight to 12-16 hours."" In all, the security operations are costing the Danish government an estimated $122 million. Last week, police unveiled a 22-ton vehicle armed with a water canon which will be used if trouble flares during the conference. The only confrontations in the buildup to the conference have been between Copenhagen's female mayor, Ritt Bjerregaard, and the city's prostitutes. A row started after city leaders requested hotels display postcards saying: ""Be sustainable: Don't buy sex."" The prostitutes -- whose are free to work under Danish law -- have responded by offering their services free of charge. ""Our office is based in the red-light district. There are prostitutes here, but it's not like Amsterdam,"" Heppenstall explained. ""I think some people coming to the conference think it might be. So the city council have been trying to pre-empt it by sending postcards saying please refrain from going to these areas. The sex workers have responded by saying that's ridiculous. They see this as their big moment."" As Copenhagen hands over to the U.N. for two weeks, the world's eyes are now turning to negotiations which precede the arrival of U.S. President Barack Obama and company. Earlier this year, Copenhagen announced the aim of being carbon neutral by 2025. Perhaps the U.N. could take a leaf out of their host's book.","Danish capital, Copenhagen, one of the greenest cities in Europe .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Six heat-trapping gases that contribute to air pollution pose potential health hazards, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday in a landmark announcement that could lead to regulation of the gases. ""This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem,"" EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said. The gases -- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride -- have been the subject of intensive analysis by scientists around the world, the EPA said. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA's scientific review in 2007. ""This finding confirms that greenhouse gas pollution is a serious problem now and for future generations,"" EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson said in a release, later adding, ""The science clearly shows that concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels as a result of human emissions, and these high levels are very likely the cause of the increase in average temperatures and other changes in our climate."" The EPA's finding now goes into a public comment period. The report, titled ""Assessment of the Impacts of Global Change on Regional U.S. Air Quality: A Synthesis of Climate Change Impacts on Ground-Level Ozone,"" is the culmination of a study started in 2000, the EPA said. The White House moved quickly to try to squelch any concerns that the EPA would immediately issue any regulations concerning the gases. ""The president has made clear his strong preference that Congress act to pass comprehensive legislation rather than address the climate challenge through administrative action,"" White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said. ""That's why the president has repeatedly called for a bill to provide for market-based solutions to reduce carbon pollution and transition to a clean-energy economy that creates millions of green jobs."" The EPA announcement comes amid efforts by Congress to enact a limit on global warming pollution. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin hearings next week on a comprehensive energy and climate bill, called the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Committee Chairman Henry Waxman is said to want the bill out of committee by Memorial Day, which falls on May 25, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wants to bring the bill to the House floor for a vote this year. Environmentalists hailed the EPA's announcement, with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund calling it a ""historic step ... [that] formally determined that global warming pollution 'endangers' the nation's human health and well-being."" ""The U.S. is taking its first steps as a nation to confront climate change,"" said Vickie Patton, deputy general counsel at the environmental advocacy group. ""Global warming threatens our health, our economy, and our children's prosperity. EPA's action is a wake-up call for national policy solutions that secure our economic and environmental future."" But critics say the finding will just produce a ""glorious mess."" ""Today's action by the EPA is the beginning of a regulatory barrage that will destroy jobs, raise energy prices for consumers and undermine America's global competitiveness,"" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, the ranking member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ""It now appears EPA's regulatory reach will find its way into schools, hospitals, assisted living facilities and just about any activity that meets minimum thresholds in the Clean Air Act."" The EPA notes in an accompanying report released Friday that global warming could make ozone pollution worse in some parts of the United States. Future ozone management decisions may have to take into account the possible effects of global warming, the report says. ""Climate change, along with other aspects of global change, including changes in population, land use and the technologies employed for energy production and transportation, may alter the capacity for U.S. states to successfully attain the national air quality standards in the future,"" the report concludes. Ground-level ozone is formed when sunlight causes a chemical reaction in the air between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by motor vehicles and industrial plants. Ozone levels are typically higher on sunny days in areas that have many vehicles or smoke-stack industries. Global warming also could increase the number of days with weather conditions conducive to forming ozone, potentially causing air quality alerts earlier in the spring and later in the fall, the report says. In addition to health problems, the report says global warming could lead to increased drought, more heavy downpours and flooding, and more frequent and intense heat waves and wildfires. Global warming could also cause a greater rise in sea level, more intense storms and harm to water resources, agriculture, wildlife and ecosystems, the report said. CNN political correspondent Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","EPA official says ""concentrations of these gases are at unprecedented levels""

"(CNN)  -- English Premier League Fulham produced a superb performance in Switzerland on Wednesday to eliminate opponents Basel from the Europa League with a 3-2 victory. Roy Hodgson's men went into the away game needing victory to leapfrog their opponents and join Group E winners AS Roma in the last 32 of Europe's second-tier club competition. Fulham were led by striker Bobby Zamora, who capped a recent scoring spree with two goals just before halftime. Basel hit back with a disputed penalty before Zoltan Gera put Fulham 3-1 ahead with a neat finish. But a Marco Streller 87th minute strike for the home side set up a nervous finish for the visitors, who survived to reach the knockout stages. Roma beat CSKA Sofia in the group's other match with Alessandro Cerci scornig twice. In Group F, French star Djibril Cisse scored a late double as Panathinaikos booked their passage with a 3-0 home win over Dinamo Bucharest. Ante Rukavina set the Greek giants on their way to the last 32 with a 55th-minute strike. Turkish side Galatasaray won the group but lost 1-0 to Austria's Sturm Graz, who scored through Daniel Beichler. In Group D, Bundesliga Hertha Berlin beat Sporting Lisbon of Portugal 1-0 through Gojko Kacar's second half strike. It meant Dutch side Heerenveen were eliminated despite a 5-0 home victory over FK Ventspils. Second-half goals from Gerard Sibon, who scored twice, Mika Vayrynen, Viktor Elm and Darryl Janmaat gave Heerenveen victory, but Hertha's win spoiled their celebrations. Sporting were already through as group winners. Last season's UEFA Cup finalists Werder Bremen beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0 to top Group L, with both guaranteed their spots in Friday's draw.

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for 16 Indiana National Guard soldiers on Wednesday sued the largest U.S. contractor in Iraq, alleging the company knowingly exposed the soldiers to a cancer-causing toxic chemical. 16 Indiana National Guardsmen have sued the Houston-based company Kellogg Brown and Root, known as KBR. The lawsuit against Houston-based KBR, which seeks an unspecified amount, alleges that the soldiers were exposed to sodium dichromate, an inorganic compound containing a highly toxic form of chromium known as hexavalent chromium. The soldiers say that they, along with other American civilian contractors, were exposed to the chemical at the Qarmat Ali water pumping plant in southern Iraq shortly after the U.S. invasion in 2003. KBR was tasked with getting the plant up and running using civilian contractors. The National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the civilian workers. The Guardsmen and civilian contractors who worked there have described walking on and sitting near the bright orange powder that was widely dispersed throughout the grounds of the water plant. The chemical was believed to have been left behind by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. Some of the Guardsmen already suffer from nasal tumors or respiratory system problems and other health problems, according to the lawsuit. One of the guardsmen may have died from the exposure, though the exact cause of his death earlier this year is still not clear. The odorless sodium dichromate was used at the plant as an anti-corrosive, the lawsuit says. The chemical contained nearly pure hexavalent chromium, the toxic substance that poisoned homeowners in Hinkley, California, and was made famous by activist Erin Brockovich, according to the suit. For the Guardsmen, KBR's ""knowing acts and omissions"" resulted in ""months and months of unprotected, unknowing, direct exposure to one of the most potent carcinogens and mutagenic substances known to man,"" the lawsuit alleges. A spokeswoman for KBR said the company was still reviewing the lawsuit, but denied responsibility for creating unsafe conditions at the plant. ""We are not providing comment on the suit at this time. The company does intend to vigorously defend itself,"" KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said. The Guardsmen say the company knew about the dangers of exposure to the chemical as far back as 2003, but did not act to protect the soldiers. ""KBR managers knew full well long ago that this stuff was incredibly dangerous. But there was no information about it for years. And now these soldiers are facing some pretty serious health concerns. They're going to be stuck with this the rest of their lives,"" said Doyle. ""The most frustrating thing is that these guys are finding out years later that they were exposed to something,"" said Mike Doyle, one of the Houston attorneys representing the Guardsmen. KBR took issue with the allegation that the company knowingly exposed the soldiers or anyone else and did nothing to help. ""KBR's commitment to the safety and security of all employees, the troops and those we serve is the company's top priority,"" the statement read. ""KBR appropriately notified the Army Corps of Engineers upon discovery of the existence of the substance on the site and the Corps of Engineers concluded that KBR's efforts to remediate the situation were effective. Further, the company in no way condones any action that would compromise the safety of those we serve or employ."" Mark McManaway, a father and grandfather, was an Indiana National Guard sergeant at the water plant from May through September 2003, when the worst exposures are believed to have occurred. He is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. ""The worst part is that the military has only just recently advised us that the stuff we were exposed to was much worse than they thought while we were out there,"" said McManaway. ""It's in our bodies, but we don't know how bad it is. Maybe within the next five years cancers could start showing up. You've got a ticking time bomb in you -- and when's it going to go off?"" The U.S. military is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The toxic chemical made famous by Brockovich in California was a diluted form of hexavalent chromium that caused serious illnesses after being ingested by homeowners through their water. The chemical the Guardsmen were exposed to in Iraq was a nearly  pure form of the chemical and could have been inhaled directly by anyone working at the plant. The U.S. Senate held hearings in August on emerging concerns about the exposure to the toxic chemicals after reports of civilian contractors and their exposure to the chemicals at the water plant. But officials of the National Guard -- and most of the Guardsmen who worked at the plant -- were not even aware of the possible dangers at the time of the hearing. Some heard about for the first time during the televised hearings. Only then did the National Guard begin efforts to find the men, some of whom had already been back in the United States for four years. An estimated 275 American soldiers may have been exposed to the chemical at the water plant, over a period of months through mid- to late-2003.","Suit says Guardsman, contractors exposed to cancer-causing chemical at Iraq plant .

"(CNN) -- A Brazilian court ordered Wednesday that 9-year-old Sean Goldman be returned to the custody of his father, David, in the United States, but his Brazilian relatives were expected to try to block the order, a Brazilian official said. Outside his home in New Jersey, David Goldman told reporters he was heartened by the news, but would not consider his efforts successful until he and the boy are reunited. ""I'm hopeful,"" he said. ""I can't be optimistic because I've gone down there so many times, always under the guise that the rule of law will be followed and Sean will come home to me and his family, and that doesn't happen."" The 3-0 ruling by the Federal Regional Tribunal in Rio de Janeiro upheld a June decision by the 16th Federal Court in Rio, which ordered Sean returned to his home in New Jersey in accordance with the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abductions. But a Brazilian official with knowledge of the case predicted Wednesday's order would be appealed. So far, the boy's Brazilian family has filed 40 appeals, most of them procedural but one substantive. The Brazilian high court is to take up any appeal on Thursday, said Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, who has been pressing the case for his constituent. ""Frankly, every possible nuance has been appealed by the other side,"" he told CNN's ""Situation Room."" ""Remember, this is an abducting family, they're kidnappers, but they have had a great deal of sway with the court."" The Supreme Court could still allow Sean Goldman to be returned to his father in the United States while it decides any appeal. Goldman, a former model, said he had last spoken with his son in June, but they did not discuss the custody battle. The case began in 2004, when his wife, Bruna Bianchi, took their 4-year-old son from their home in New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation. She never returned, instead remarrying there and retaining custody of their son. She died last year in childbirth. Goldman has argued that, as the sole surviving parent, he should be granted custody. But the boy's stepfather and his other Brazilian relatives have argued that it would be traumatizing to the boy to remove him from what has been his home for most of his life. The case has drawn high-profile input, including pressure for the boy's return from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said Wednesday in a statement that she was pleased to hear about the decision. ""We appreciate the assistance and cooperation of the government of Brazil in upholding its obligations under the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction,"" she said. ""And it is my hope that this long legal process is now complete and that the Goldman family will be reunited quickly.""

"A whopping 70 percent of American kids aren't getting enough vitamin D, and such youngsters tend to have higher blood pressure and lower levels of good cholesterol than their peers, according to two new studies published this week in the journal Pediatrics. Low vitamin D levels also may increase a child's risk of developing heart disease later in life, experts say. People who drank milk less than once a week were among those most at risk for vitamin-D deficiency, a study found. ""We were astounded at how common it was,"" says study author Dr. Michal Melamed, an assistant professor of medicine, epidemiology, and population health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx, New York. ""There is a lot of data that suggests adults with low vitamin-D levels are at risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and a lot of cancers, and if kids start out with low levels and never increase them, they may be putting themselves at risk for developing all of these diseases at a much earlier age."" Vitamin D is often called the ""sunshine vitamin"" because the human body makes it only when exposed to sunlight -- although it only takes 10 to 15 minutes a day to make an adequate amount. Vitamin D, which helps the bones better absorb calcium, is also added to multivitamins and milk. In Melamed's study, the researchers looked at the vitamin D levels of more than 6,000 people ages 1 to 21. They checked for vitamin-D deficiency, which is defined as less than 15 nanograms per milliliter of blood (ng/mL), and vitamin-D insufficiency, which is defined as 15 to 29 ng/mL. Overall, 7.6 million, or 9 percent, of U.S. children were vitamin-D deficient, and another 50.8 million, or 61 percent, had insufficient levels of this important vitamin in their blood. Children with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to have high blood pressure and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein, also known as good cholesterol -- two factors that are considered major risk factors for heart disease later in life. Health.com: How cholesterol affects your heart's health . Children with low vitamin-D levels also had higher levels of parathyroid hormone than their counterparts with adequate vitamin D in their blood. Parathyroid hormone is a measure of bone health. When levels are high, it suggests that bones need more calcium to grow.  Watch more on kids in the U.S. and low levels of vitamin D » . Overall, those most at risk for a vitamin-D deficiency were older, female, obese, drank milk less than once a week, and spent more than four hours a day watching TV, playing video games, or working on a computer. They were also more likely to be children with darker skin, including non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican-Americans. (Children with darker skin are more likely to be deficient in vitamin D because they have more melanin than their fairer counterparts. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin color, but it may prevent the skin from absorbing enough sunlight to produce an adequate amount of vitamin D.) Health.com: Battle aging with vitamin D . In the second study, a research team led by Jared P. Reis, Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, looked at 3,577 adolescents ages 12 to 19. Those with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to have high blood pressure, high levels of blood sugar, and metabolic syndrome (a cluster of factors known to increase risk of heart disease) than their counterparts with ample vitamin D in their blood, regardless of how much they weighed. Exactly how a lack of vitamin D increases the risk of heart disease is an evolving story. In terms of blood pressure, vitamin D helps control renin, a protein that plays a role in regulating blood-pressure levels. Health.com: Why belly fat increases type 2 diabetes risk . The best vitamin-D boosting strategy involves a three-pronged approach, says Melamed. ""You can get a little bit from food, but not as much as you need,"" she says. ""Supplements are readily available, and kids like to take Flintstones or gummy-bear multivitamins, which typically contain vitamin D."" Also, parents should help their children get at least 10 to 15 minutes of sun exposure daily without sunscreen. ""Set your watch and then apply sunscreen after 15 minutes,"" Melamed says. Some children, including those in high-risk groups, may need to be screened to check for low vitamin-D levels. Dr. Michael F. Holick, Ph.D., a professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, and the author of ""The Vitamin D Solution"" (to be released in April 2010), has been sounding an alarm about the dangers of low vitamin-D levels for years. Health.com: Easy food swaps cut cholesterol, not taste . ""This is a recipe for serious diseases occurring in our children when they are in their 20s and 30s,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Manor GP are to be rebranded Virgin Racing ahead of their Formula One debut next season. Manor team chief John Booth and Virgin supremo Richard Branson are due to announce the long-awaited sponsorship tie-up on Tuesday. The news has effectively been confirmed by motor sport's world governing body, the FIA, as they have announced the 2010 entry list for the F1 world championship. Currently there are 12 teams, with the name Virgin Racing amongst the newcomers for 2010, joining Lotus F1 Racing, Campos Meta 1 and US F1 Team. The issue of the 13th entry remains unresolved, although Sauber are widely expected to be granted a place on next year's grid following a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Monaco on December 11. Peter Sauber last week regained control of the team he sold to BMW four years ago after the German manufacturing giant's withdrawal from the sport. ""I am very relieved about that development,"" the 66-year-old Swiss, who is hopeful the FIA will now look favorably on the team's entry, told reporters. ""It would have been a crying shame had one of the best Formula One factories closed down. Regarding the slot on the grid, I am very confident we will be given a final confirmation very shortly."" The Formula One Commission are due to discuss Toyota's fate next week, again in Monaco on Wednesday. The Japanese manufacturer pulled out of F1 at the end of last season, despite during the summer signing the new Concorde Agreement that bound them to the sport for the next three years. Speculation has surfaced of late regarding a potential takeover, yet it is unclear whether a buyer would automatically be granted an entry on the basis of Toyota's signature on the Concorde. In a statement, the FIA said: ""Toyota Motorsport GmbH remains formally bound by the Concorde Agreement to put forward a team for participation, though it has indicated that it will not be in a position to do so.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- An executive of the Chinese dairy company Sanlu Group pleaded guilty Wednesday over her role in the contaminated milk scandal that sickened nearly 300,000 infants, state-run media reported. A salesgirl arranges powdered milk in China's Sichuan province in September. Tian Wenhua, Sanlu's former board chairwoman and general manager, and three other executives are on trial for producing and selling fake or substandard products, according to Xinhua news agency. Wenhua, 66, pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial at a court in Shijiazhuang, the capital of northern Hebei Province, Xinhua reported. She told the court that she first received tainted milk complaints from consumers in mid-May -- four months before the issue became widely known -- according to the report. Wenhua led a working team to investigate the claims, Xinhua reported. The three other executives are former deputy general managers Wang Yuliang and Hang Zhiqi, and Wu Jusheng, a former executive heading Sanlu's milk division. Chinese investigators found melamine in nearly 70 milk products from more than 20 companies, according to quality control official Li Changjiang, who was eventually forced to resign. The Ministry of Health has said the contamination likely caused the deaths of at least six babies. Another 294,000 infants suffered from urinary problems, such as kidney stones. The tainted formula came to light in September after babies who were fed milk powder produced by the Sanlu Group, which recently filed for bankruptcy, had developed kidney stones. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Some Chinese dairy plants added the chemical to milk products so they would appear to have a higher protein level. Prior to the four Sanlu executives, at least eight people stood trial over charges of producing, adding melamine-laced ""protein powder"" to milk or selling the tainted milk to Sanlu or other dairies. Victims of tainted baby formula are expected to be compensated by the 22 Chinese dairy producers that made the milk. ""The enterprises offered to shoulder the compensation liability,"" the country's Dairy Industry Association said Saturday, according to Xinhua. ""By doing so, they hope to earn understanding and forgiveness of the families of the sickened children."" The group said victims will receive a one-off cash payment, but did not provide the amounts, according to Xinhua. ""The money for compensation is in place now and will soon be handed to the people who have custody of the sickened children through various channels,"" the association said. No date for the payments was given. The dairies also raised money to cover medical bills for any after-effects suffered as a result of the poisoning, the association said.","Tian Wenhua, former Sanlu chairwoman and general manager, pleads guilty .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- The importance of references seems to be a hot topic these days. Employers want to make sure they are hiring the right person for the job; but some thwart the process because checking references can be labor-intensive. On the other hand, job seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report, but employers are getting smarter and finding references you didn't provide. So, what's the deal? Do references matter? Do employers even check them anymore? What's the protocol for providing them to a potential employer? Who are the best people to include as references? And, if an employer doesn't call any of your references, is it a bad sign? While the definitive answer to any of these questions depends on the employer, overall, yes, references do still matter. The process has just changed. ""References play a huge role in the hiring process, perhaps now more than ever,"" said Heather R. Huhman, founder and president of Come Recommended, an online community that connects internship and entry-level job candidates with employers."" Oftentimes, hiring managers fall in love with a candidate on paper and then again in an interview, only to find out through a reference check that none of their previous employers would ever hire them again. By checking a candidate's references, hiring managers save themselves the frustration of hiring a person who is not a good fit for a company. In this economy, where hiring budgets are slim, every hire must be a great fit."" Provided references are no guarantee . Though the majority of employers do check references, others skip this step. Not only is it labor-intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer, but Jack Harsh, adjunct professor at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business, said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references. ""[Hiring] decisions cannot be based on information that is discriminatory in nature, so to avoid any liability, the checks are forgone,"" Harsh said. ""Sadly, the first reference the employer gets in such cases is from colleagues after employment has begun."" Steve Langerud, director of career development at Depauw University, adds that sometimes, the quality of references is benign. ""Everyone wants to be helpful and supportive to former employees, but in the end, they offer little substance to a new employer,"" he says. ""Legally, they are limited by what they can or want to say about former employees. I think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields."" Langerud warns that just because an employer isn't checking personal references the traditional way doesn't mean he isn't checking references at all. ""Employers are more likely to check the informal, but tangible, behavioral reference sources like LinkedIn, Facebook, credit history [or] criminal history than the more subjective references provided by candidates,"" he said. ""Candidates should be much more intentional about crafting a professional identity that serves the role of a 'reference' but within the context of the work, profession and colleagues you seek to engage. It eliminates the weaknesses inherent in the old style of references that become so watered down they are useless."" Making the right choices . The last thing you want to do is give an employer useless references, but many job seekers make the mistake of not taking the time to thoughtfully choose the right people to speak on their behalf, said Elaine Varelas, managing partner for Keystone Partners, an outplacement and talent management consulting firm. ""You want people who can speak to your role as a professional, not as a nice neighbor,"" Varelas said. ""Candidates can make their references count by prepping them to discuss their specific skills as they relate to the job and the impact they brought to the job, which can be just the differentiation needed in this highly competitive market."" Harsh agrees that when he receives a résumé with references attached, he gives them virtually no weight. ""They seldom are specific to the role my company seeks and are not meaningful in considering qualifications or traits of successful candidate,"" he said. Finally, when it comes to protocol for submitting references, the process has changed as well. It used to be that applicants sent them in with their other application materials, but now, Varelas says, you should wait to provide references until you are asked. ""Most companies do not want your references until the end of the process and they will let you know when to provide a list of names and contact information. Do not send written references,"" she said. ""These do not offer the highest impact as they are not specific on how you will fit into the job you are pursuing. It is better to spend your time preparing your references for the kinds of questions they will be asked, and what they can do to help you close an offer."" Helpful hints . Harsh, Varelas and Langerud offer these 10 tips to ensure you do everything right when it comes to providing references: . 1. Include references only when requested by an employer. 2. Carefully consider whom to provide after discussion with the prospective employer. The time to check references is before an offer is made, but after the candidate is either the final candidate or among the final few for the job. 3. Seek references from people who actually know you and your work. Ask for permission to list them as a reference. 4. Ask directly if they can provide you with a positive reference for the position(s) you are seeking. If they hesitate, move on! 5. Prepare your references about who will be calling them and what to focus on when talking about you. Always ask them to call you after they have been called. 6. Prepare your references to speak consistently about your skills, but not identically. Suggest a different highlight for each person. Have 100 percent confidence in what they will say and how they speak about you, or cross them off the list. 7. Provide accurate contact information about your references, and ask your references how they prefer to be contacted (e-mail, phone, etc.). 8. Let your references know what happens to you and the position(s) you applied for. Thank your references. 9. Prepare a LinkedIn site to demonstrate your skills and interests. 10. Participate in professional blogs to create a history of professional involvement in your field that is independent of your work history. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- This month on MainSail . Shamrock V, a 1930's Americas Cup challenger at the J-class race in the Solent, Isle of Wight, in 2001. What makes a ""classic"" yacht? Is it age, or era? Are classics born or made? Is it size and value, or cultural significance? Classics can be modern and old -- from three-mast 1930s teak works of art like the original America's Cup racers, to cutting edge, contemporary monsters, like the ""Maltese Falcon"" and the exclusive fleets of luxury boat builders like Perini Navi and Wally. This month CNN's Mainsail investigates what makes a classic yacht at one of the world's great yachting regattas. Les Voiles de St Tropez . St Tropez, playground of the rich and famous, a bastion of class, richesse and style, plays host for the 26th year to Les Voiles de St Tropez, a classic event in every possible sense of the word. The regatta gathers together the most extraordinary modern sailing boats alongside the most beautiful traditional yachts, as sailors from all over the world gather to do battle in the Mediterranean's most glamorous bay. During the week's racing, presenter Shirley Robertson hitches a ride on board some of the world's most iconic yachts both ancient and modern, and attempts to find out what makes them ""classics."" Ernesto Bertarelli . Reporting from Genoa in a world exclusive, Shirley chats to Alinghi team boss, Ernesto Bertarelli and drives the new ""Alinghi 5"" -- the defender of the America's Cup. Robertson is likely to be the only person in the world outside of the Alinghi team to get her hands on the wheel of the spectacular 90-foot catamaran. Will this boat, just a few months old, become an instant classic? And in a report from the Perini Navi Cup in Sardinia, boat builders and skippers of the most glamorous luxury yachts on the planet explain what makes their machines the classics of the future.","What makes a 'classic' yacht?

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Three hundred and forty. At the Bandelier National Monument visitors can climb into ancient cliff dwellings used by Native Americans. That's how many steps and ladder rungs we climb to Bandelier National Monument (http://www.nps.gov/band/), to crowd into its ancient (dating back to before 1300) cliff dwellings about 50 miles northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Even the kids are impressed that Ancestral Pueblo families lived here before Columbus arrived, even before the Pilgrims stepped foot on Plymouth Rock. We look at the crumbling adobe and try to imagine apartment-type dwellings that stretched more than three stories: We crouch inside the ceremonial Kivas where the ancient people gathered to teach the children, weave, congregate and discuss the affairs of the day. These unique sites -- Bandelier certainly isn't the only one -- and spectacular desert landscape make New Mexico a terrific family destination winter or summer, and one that will win kudos from all ages. Where else can you ski one day -- in Taos or outside of Santa Fe, gallery hop or take a cooking lesson the next, shop or tour museums till you drop and gain a new perspective on Native American history? New Mexico is home to 22 sovereign Indian nations, including the Navajo Nation, two Apache Tribes and 19 Pueblos. The Pueblo of Acoma (http://www.skycity.com/), which sits on a 367-foot-high sandstone rock, is considered the oldest inhabited village in the United States. The Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque can help you get started (www.indianpueblo.com). You can even stay on a Pueblo -- the deluxe Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort and Spa (http://www.tamaya.hyatt.com), owned by the Santa Ana Pueblo and managed by Hyatt, offers holiday packages. The 350-room resort, halfway between Albuquerque and Santa Fe, sits on 500 sprawling acres of a 73,000-acre reservation and is one of the largest resorts ever built on Native American land. And you can't beat the Sandia Mountains on the horizon for scenery. Great pains have been taken to respect the ancient spirits at the resort. One of the pools is built in a circle, replicating the ceremonial Kivas that have been an integral part of Pueblo life for centuries. Spa treatments are designed to use products that are indigenous to the area (how about a hydrating treatment using desert seaweed or an exfoliation treatment with Tamaya Blue Corn flour?) The signature Corn Maiden restaurant serves dishes from the region. The profits go back to the Pueblo and fund everything from college scholarships to senior centers. Sure you can hang out by the pool, opt for the spa, or play golf here, but horseback riding through the pueblo's backcountry to see petroglyphs, making adobe bricks, drums or pottery or visiting the cultural center and museum devoted to the history, culture and art of the Santa Ana Pueblo make this a different experience. ""All of these activities appealed to us,"" said Eric Shimabukuro, who is from suburban Chicago and was busy making bricks one morning with his two daughters, Lauren, 9, and Carolyn, 7. New Mexico, I think, as I make my way down the ladder at Bandelier and later, watch my daughters knead the dough for Pueblo bread at the Hyatt Tamaya, under the watchful eye of a member of the Santa Ana Pueblo, can be a terrific winter vacation bet for families whose members are not all equally enthusiastic about spending their entire vacation on the slopes. Especially at holiday time when there are traditional dances at Northern New Mexico Pueblos and a variety of celebrations in Santa Fe and around New Mexico (www.santafe.org, www.nmtourism.org). Santa Fe Mountain Adventures (www.santafemountainadventures.com) can help plan a unique sojourn, organizing family activities from touring Bandelier to geocaching, an outdoor treasure-hunting game, to snowshoeing, cooking and pottery making. ""You get so much more out of a visit to a place like this when you're with a guide,"" offers David Thompson, whose family joined us touring Bandelier with Santa Fe Mountain Adventures guides Bill Neuwirth, a college professor, and Anne Stanley, an artist and guide. As we climb ladders and steps, courtesy of the National Park Service, Neuwirth points out the foot holes in the volcanic rock that the ancient peoples used. We wonder what it was like to live in this community so long ago when 30 was considered old, when children were married as soon as they reached puberty and when everything was about the community, not individuals. They raised corn, (the Pueblo people have some 50 recipes to prepare corn) squash and beans. The elevation here is 7,000 feet, but it doesn't seem to bother us. Where we hike at Bandelier, there are as many as 50 dwellings in one section -- and the ground floor doesn't have any doors or windows. The people who lived here climbed up to the roof and then climbed down into the room, which they probably did to protect their homes. No one, Neuwirth explains, really knows why the ancient Pueblo people decided to leave -- whether it was drought, or illness or an impulse to move to another Mesa; Neuwirth gestures out to the desert landscape, ""You couldn't have walked a meter in any direction without running into pueblo remains."" As we prepared to fly home, all I could think about were those ancient families (did their kids drive them crazy sometimes too?) and all those Pueblos I would have liked to visit, the cooking classes I didn't have time to schedule, the Santa Fe galleries and museums we missed, (check out the Eldorado Hotel and Spa's (www.eldoradohotel.com) Winter Wonderland package, valid now through Jan. 31, 2008. Starting at $199 per night, double occupancy, it includes daily breakfast in the hotel's Eldorado Court or via room service.), and the hikes we didn't attempt. ""We did something different every day!"" my husband said. More important, no one complained about what we did or where we were going. No one was bored. We ate great food, especially the guacamole at El Pinto restaurant (www.elpinto.com) outside of Albuquerque, which was made right in front of us. Not that our New Mexico sojourn was perfect. Traveling with kids -- no matter what their ages -- never is, even in the most spectacular locales. What matters, of course, is the chance to explore a new place -- a new culture -- together. Pass the guacamole, please. E-mail to a friend . (For more Taking the Kids, visit www.takingthekids.com, where Eileen Ogintz welcomes your questions and comments.)

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho has been accused of ""physical and verbal aggression"" towards a journalist after Sunday's 1-1 Serie A draw at Atalanta. The Italian Sport Union of Journalists (USSI) condemned Mourinho's alleged actions against Corriere dello Sport's Andrea Ramazzotti. A statement from the USSI urged Inter president Massimo Moratti, and the country's governing sporting bodies to investigate. It read: ""The physical and verbal aggression of Inter coach Jose Mourinho towards our colleague Andrea Ramazzotti marks one of the lowest and alarming moments in the relations between football and sporting press. ""Mourinho was already cited, prior to the Champions League game with Rubin Kazan, for his uneducated and disrespectful tone that he used towards certain colleagues. ""This aggression marks an irresponsible and unacceptable escalation. USSI expresses not only its indignation, but a strong concern for gestures and the unspeakable behavior that only increases tensions and controversies. ""It asks president Moratti to intervene energetically so that a member of his club (Mourinho) adapts to the great tradition of civility of the club and of the Moratti family. ""It asks as well of the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) that the sporting justice panel intervenes to examine the behavior of Mourinho for eventual sanctions."" Mourinho watched Sunday's game from the stands as he served a one-match touchline ban. Reports in Italy have claimed a heated argument took place between Mourinho and Ramazzotti outside the team bus. Mourinho has not commented on the incident but Moratti told the club's official Web site: ""For the moment I don't want to comment as I still don't have all the facts, but I'm sorry. ""I will talk to the head of the union to find out what he means by energetic action.""","Inter coach Jose Mourinho accused of ""physical and verbal aggression"" towards a journalist .

"(CNN)  -- The torch for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics was lit in a ceremony at the ancient Greek site of Olympia on Thursday, less than four months ahead of the games' opening ceremony. Actress Maria Nafpliotou, as a high priestess, lights the flame for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics on Thursday. The torch will be carried on an eight-day trip through Greece, the birthplace of the Olympics, before being transported to Canada for what will be the longest domestic torch relay in the games' history, officials said. Women dressed in white togas performed a ceremony on the green hillside at Olympia, the home of the Olympic flame and the place where the ancient Olympics took place. A woman playing the role of a high priestess lit the flame by sunlight focused on a mirror, the only way by tradition it can be lit. That fire then was used to light the Vancouver Olympic Torch, which Greek skier and three-time Olympian Vassilis Dimitriadis then carried on the first leg of its journey through Greece. ""The Olympic torch and flame are the symbols of the values and ideals which lie at the heart of the Olympic Games,"" International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said before the ceremony. The torch will carry a message of peace throughout the world, he said -- words echoed by Vancouver 2010 Chief Executive John Furlong. ""Today we build a bridge between ancient Olympia and young Canada,"" he said. ""Canada is a country with a welcoming spirit and a glowing heart. ... We will do all we can to be a shining example of the ideas and values that were first kindled here in this hallowed place."" After its 1,351-mile (2,180-kilometer) trip through Greece, the torch will be taken to Canada. On October 30, the first of 12,000 torchbearers will begin carrying it through Canada on what will be a 106-day, 27,900-mile (45,000-kilometer) relay. ""It will be the longest domestic relay in Olympic history, just to be sure every Canadian will be given the right to dream and celebrate,"" Furlong said. The torch relay is derived from ancient rituals in Olympia, where torch and relay races were popular festival events and where heralds traveled throughout Greece to announce the games. The torch for the 2010 Winter Games was designed by transportation and aerospace company Bombardier, a Vancouver Olympic sponsor. The lean curves of the white torch were inspired by the lines carved in the snow by winter sports and by the ""undulating beauty of the Canadian landscape,"" the company said. The torch's special construction will allow it to burn through a range of winter weather, including snow, rain, sleet, wind and subzero temperatures, Bombardier said. It weighs 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) fully fueled, the company said. The flame is due to arrive in Vancouver, British Columbia, on February 12 when the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Games will be held at the domed BC Place Stadium.","Olympic flame due to arrive in Vancouver, British Columbia, in February .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A former New York City bouncer was sentenced to life without parole Wednesday for the brutal slaying of a graduate student from Boston, the Brooklyn district attorney's office said. Darryl Littlejohn, 44, is already serving prison time for the attempted kidnapping of another student in 2005. Darryl Littlejohn, 44, was convicted of first-degree murder last month in the 2006 death of Imette St. Guillen, 24, who had been studying criminology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Littlejohn, who is already serving 25 years to life for the October 2005 attempted kidnapping of a 19-year-old Queens college student, will serve out the sentences consecutively, said Sarah McNaughton of the Brooklyn district attorney's office. During the trial, witnesses said they saw Littlejohn and St. Guillen leaving The Falls bar in lower Manhattan together early February 25, 2006. Littlejohn was working as a bouncer at the bar. Hours later, St. Guillen's nude body was found in an isolated lot in Brooklyn. Her face was covered with strips of packing tape, and a sock was stuffed into her throat. She died of asphyxiation, and investigators determined she had been raped. Littlejohn was charged with murder after investigators linked his DNA to blood found on plastic ties used to bind St. Guillen's hands behind her back. Littlejohn's attorney, Joyce David, has filed an appeal on behalf of her client and maintains his innocence. She said that although Littlejohn has a long criminal record, he has no history of violence against women. The horrific incident spread shockwaves through New York City nightlife, which relies heavily on unlicensed bouncers to keep order in the city's bars and nightclubs. Littlejohn is being held at New York's Rikers Island maximum security facility. CNN's Chris Kokenes and Kristen Hamill contributed to this report .","Darryl Littlejohn was convicted last month of murdering Imette St. Guillen, 24 .

"Editor's note: How would you rate President Obama's first 100 days? You'll get a chance to make your opinion known on at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday on the CNN National Report Card. Franklin D. Roosevelt had an ambitious first 100 days, CNN's Bill Schneider says. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Senior White House adviser David Axelrod has called the 100-day benchmark an ""odd custom, the journalistic equivalent of the Hallmark holiday.'' But where did the notion of a president's ""First 100 Days"" originate? With Franklin D. Roosevelt, another president who took office at a time of dire economic crisis. Roosevelt used his first 100 days to launch the New Deal, his plan to jumpstart the economy and put people back to work. Democrats had just won huge majorities in Congress and were ready to do the president's bidding. But, should Congress fail to act, Roosevelt would ask for ""broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were, in fact, invaded by a foreign foe,"" he warned in his inaugural address.  Watch what FDR's First 100 Days were like » . Congress gave Roosevelt nearly nearly everything he wanted -- 15 major bills in the first 100 days, including the Emergency Banking Relief Act, the Public Works Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Congress also approved the Beer-Wine Revenue Act that anticipated the end of Prohibition. A White House adviser remarked that members of Congress had forgotten to be Republicans or Democrats. Comedian Will Rogers joked at the time that, ""Congress doesn't pass legislation any more. They just wave at the bills as they go by."" Nothing since has equaled FDR's first 100 days. But as Obama nears the symbolic benchmark, he may have had the boldest 100-day agenda since FDR. Still, Congress has passed only a few major bills, including the $787 billion economic stimulus package, the public lands preservation bill and an expansion of children's health insurance. So what has changed? Presidents can no longer count on the kind of bipartisan cooperation FDR got in 1933 -- even at a time of crisis.","Franklin Roosevelt used his first 100 days to launch the New Deal .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Criminal charges will not be filed against the 18-year-old college freshman who falsely accused five men of raping her in a dormitory bathroom at Hofstra University, an official said Friday. Instead, Danmell Ndonye must participate in a year-long psychiatric program and spend 250 hours in community service for lying to police about what was a consensual sexual encounter with four of the five accused men, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said in a written statement. Ndonye said she did not engage in sexual activity with Rondell Bedward, the only one of the men who attends Hofstra University. He has returned to classes. Rice said she retains the option of filing criminal charges against Ndonye if she fails to complete the course of therapy or community service. Rice added that filing criminal charges might have made any future false accuser reluctant to recant and tell the truth, possibly leading to an innocent person serving a lengthy prison sentence. Authorities dropped charges and freed the four men they had taken into custody after their accuser changed her story about having been tied up and sexually assaulted in a dormitory bathroom. The woman recanted after authorities told her that part of the incident was recorded on a cell phone video, Rice said. ""That was when she began to tell the truth,"" she said. It is against the law to report a crime when there was not one, the district attorney said. ""Her actions and her demeanor depict a very troubled young woman in need of much help,"" Rice said. Hofstra University has suspended Ndonye.","Danmell Ndonye, 18, will not face criminal charges for falsely accusing 5 men of rape .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's family and about 200 of their closest friends gathered on a hill Thursday evening for their final farewell to the pop singer, who died 10 weeks ago. Thursday's service for singer Michael Jackson began 90 minutes past the announced start time. Jackson's burial may lay to rest some of the mystery and controversy that erupted with his sudden death on June 25. His large family was divided over where the superstar's final resting place should be, but matriarch Katherine Jackson settled on a crypt inside the well-guarded and ornate Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California. Thursday's service began 90 minutes past the announced start time, leaving dozens of celebrities -- including Elizabeth Taylor -- waiting in their seats for the 26 cars carrying the Jackson clan to arrive.  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service » . It began with Jackson's five brothers -- each wearing a single sequined glove -- carrying his flower-covered bronze casket onto the outdoor stage among six large bouquets of white lilies and white roses, along with green topiaries. His three children, led by daughter, Paris, 11, placed a crown atop their father's coffin, which a family spokesman said it was ""to signify the final resting place of the King of Pop."" Jackson's children, parents and siblings took their seats in the front row, while his nieces and nephews filled several rows of white chairs behind them. After an opening prayer by Pastor Lucius Smith, soul music legend Gladys Knight sang the gospel hymn ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow."" Clifton Davis sang ""Never Can Say Goodbye,"" a hit he wrote for The Jackson 5 -- the group that featured a young Michael and his brothers. What was said by Jackson's father, Joe Jackson, and others who took the lectern is not publicly known, because the family barred news cameras from the ceremony. A family statement issued afterward said close friends and family, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, spoke ""spontaneously to celebrate Michael's life."" News helicopters hovering above captured video from a distance, but without sound.  Watch media cover Jackson funeral » . Lisa Marie Presley, one of Jackson's former wives and the daughter of Elvis, attended the service, according to the family statement. It did not mention Debbie Rowe, Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two oldest children. Macaulay Culkin, the ""Home Alone"" actor who spent time with Jackson during his Neverland Ranch days, was there with his girlfriend, actress Mila Kunis. Actors Corey Feldman and Chris Tucker were also seen arriving for the service. Motown founder Berry Gordy, who gave Jackson and his brothers their first big record deal, and Quincy Jones, who produced Jackson's ""Thriller"" album, were there. Music producer Teddy Riley, who helped with Jackson's 1991 ""Dangerous"" album, attended. The guest list included TV executive Suzanne de Passe, who produced a miniseries about Jackson's family, and Kenny Ortega,  who was producing Jackson's comeback show. Thomas Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in a child molestation trial, sat just behind the Jackson family. When the hour-long service ended, his brothers lifted Jackson's casket for a final time to carry him inside the Great Mausoleum, where he was placed in his crypt at 9:43 p.m. PT (12:43 a.m. ET Friday). The family statement said it was ""his final resting place."" The family and friends then drove to an Italian restaurant eight miles away, in Pasadena, California, for ""a time of celebration."" The massive mausoleum, the final resting place for Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities, is normally open to tourists, though the public is denied close access to crypts. Security guards, aided by cameras, keep constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture. The Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, ""has been called the 'New World's Westminster Abbey' by Time Magazine."" Visitors will see ""exact replicas of Michelangelo's greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta"" and ""Leonardo da Vinci's immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world's largest paintings,"" the Web site says. Jackson's burial was delayed by division among family members, though Katherine Jackson would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN. He preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California. That idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted. The mystery of where Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death. After his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours after his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy. It was only later disclosed that Jackson's corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena. Again, speculation about Jackson's whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. It was only recently confirmed that it was taken back to the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family's decision. Though Thursday's interment may settle one Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide. A summary of the coroner's report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer's death. Los Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.","Jackson's three kids, led by daughter, Paris, placed a crown atop their father's coffin .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- As President Obama marks his 100th day in office, most recent national polls indicate that more than six in 10 Americans approve of the job he's doing as president. Polls reflect that most Americans approve of President Obama's performance during his first 100 days in office. According to a CNN poll of polls compiled Wednesday, 63 percent said they approve of how Obama is handling his duties. Twenty-nine percent disapprove. The rating is down 3 percentage points from CNN's previous poll of polls, which was compiled Sunday. The president's approval rating stood at 64 percent in a CNN poll of polls in January shortly after his inauguration. ""The number of Americans who think Obama has the right personal qualities to be president has gone up since the campaign last fall,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director.  ""That wasn't true for George W. Bush eight years ago, and it may be one reason why Obama's approval rating is still in the 60s."" How does Obama compare with his predecessors around the first 100-days mark? Bush stood at 62 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll in April 2001; Bill Clinton at 55 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll in April 1993; George H.W. Bush at 58 percent in a Gallup Poll from April 1989; and Ronald Reagan at 67 percent in a Gallup Poll in April 1981. ""The 100-day mark tends to fall during a period when Americans are still evaluating a new president. The danger period for most presidents comes later in their first year in office,"" Holland said. ""Bill Clinton, for example, still had good marks after his first 100 days, but his approval rating had tanked by June of 1993. Ronald Reagan's approval rating stayed over 50 percent until November of his first year in office, but once it slipped below that mark, it stayed under 50 percent for two years. So Obama's current rating certainly does not indicate that he is out of the woods yet."" The most recent edition of the CNN poll of polls is an average of seven national surveys taken over the past week: CNN/Opinion Research Corp. (April 23-26), ABC/Washington Post (April 21-24), Fox/Opinion Dynamics (April 22-23), CBS/The New York Times (April 22-26), Marist (April 21-23), Quinnipiac (April 21-27) and the Gallup tracking poll (April 25-27). iReport.com: Grade the first 100 days .

"(CNN) -- It's early April, and President Obama is on his way to France with the nation's top diplomat at his side. As he and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton converse in a private room aboard Air Force One, a photographer peers through the half-open door and snaps a candid picture of the formerly bitter campaign rivals. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton share a conversation on board Air Force One. Photographing two of the most powerful people in the country up-close and personal may seem like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to most Americans. But for photographer Pete Souza, it's a common occurrence. ""I try to photograph everything. Every meeting that the president does,"" Souza told CNN's John King on ""State of the Union."" On leave of absence from his normal post as an assistant professor of photojournalism at Ohio University's School of Visual Communication, Souza is the chief official White House photographer for President Obama, meaning he has an all-access pass to the president's most intimate and private moments. ""I look at my job as a visual historian,"" Souza said on Sunday. ""The most important thing is to create a good visual archive for history, so 50 or a hundred years from now, people can go back and look at all these pictures.""  Watch Souza talk to CNN's John King about his work » . While he relishes his unobstructed seat to a historic administration, he knows his limits. ""I'm smart enough to know that if he's having a one-on-one meeting with a head of state, I let them have some privacy,"" he said. ""I let him initiate any conversation. I am not there to take up his time in conversation."" Souza brings a unique perspective to the job, having also been the official White House photographer during Ronald Reagan's presidency. He acknowledged that Reagan was probably more formal, but told CNN he sees similarities between the two.  See some of Souza's photos » . ""I think they're both comfortable with themselves, which makes them great photographic subjects. The presence of the camera in behind-the-scene situations didn't seem to bother either president, which is good for me,"" he said. Souza released four never-before-seen photos on ""State of the Union,"" including one of the president and the first lady sharing a moment on the dance floor at the annual Governor's Ball, the couple's first big event at the White House. ""Earth, Wind and Fire was the band and I think the president was singing along to the music. I think their intention is to bring some fun to the White House, too,"" Souza said while reflecting on the picture. Previously a photographer for the Chicago Tribune, Souza began documenting Obama's ascension to the presidency in 2004 after a former colleague asked him to shoot the young politician's first year as a U.S. senator. Last year, Souza published ""The Rise of Barack Obama,"" an extensive book of photos chronicling Obama's rise from junior senator of Illinois to the highest office in the country. When asked to choose one picture as his favorite, Souza selected one of the president and first lady softly butting heads in a freight elevator, surrounded by staffers who appear to be avoiding eye contact with the couple. Michelle Obama is smiling playfully wearing her husband's jacket. ""I chose this one because it's a genuine moment. It was chilly in the elevator. He took his coat off, put it around his wife's shoulders and then there is this private moment going on between the two of them,"" he said. ""It's just a complete storytelling picture."" Though the historic nature of Obama's presidency is not lost on Souza, he doesn't view Obama any differently than past commanders in chief. ""Certainly you feel a sense of history, no question about that. When I look at him, I look at him as the president. I don't look at him as the African-American president, I look at him as the president.""","Pete Souza is the chief official White House photographer for President Obama .

"(CNN) -- Everton scored twice late on and goalkeeper Tim Howard saved an injury-time penalty as they fought back to secure a 2-2 Premier League home draw with Tottenham on Sunday. Jermain Defoe gave the visitors the lead soon after the interval when nipping in front of Tony Hibbert to convert Aaron Lennon's cross at the near post for his 13th goal of the season. And they doubled their advantage soon after when defender Michael Dawson headed home a Niko Kranjcar corner. But Everton got a foothold back in the game when Seamus Coleman's run and cross was converted by fellow-substitute Louis Saha in the 78th minute. And Tim Cahill rescued a point for the home side with four minutes remaining when he stooped low to head home Leighton Baines' bouncing cross. However, there was still further drama to come when Hibbert was penalized for crashing into Wilson Palacios in the area. However, England striker Defoe smashed his penalty too close to Howard and the keeper pulled off a fine save to give out-of-form Everton a morale-boosting point. The result means Tottenham remain in fourth place, behind north London rivals Arsenal, while Everton have now won just one of their last nine league games. In the day's other match, Bobby Zamora scored the only goal of the game as Fulham beat Sunderland 1-0 to move up to eighth place in the table.","Everton recover from 2-0 behind to earn a 2-2 Premier League draw with Tottenham .

"(CNN) -- Peruvian authorities say they have arrested four members of a gang that specialized in selling to European labs fat obtained from dead humans. Officials are investigating the disappearance of at least 60 people they believe were killed by gang members in two mountainous states in central Peru, lead prosecutor Jorge Sanz Quiroz said Friday. The four suspects have been charged with murder in the September slaying of a Peruvian man, the prosecutor said. ""They killed to obtain human fat because there were European laboratories that would pay them,"" Sanz Quiroz said. The suspects told authorities they were paid $15,000 for a liter (about 1 quart) of human fat. Officials did not disclose what possible use laboratories could have for the human fat, but fat can be a component of cosmetics and is used in reconstructive or cosmetic surgery. The use of human fat for any purpose is extremely rare, however, physicians say. Other suspects, including the Peruvian ringleader, have eluded capture, Sanz Quiroz said. Authorities have the names of two Italian suspects who are being sought by Interpol, the 188-nation worldwide police agency, the prosecutor said. He declined to reveal their identities. Sanz Quiroz acknowledged the uniqueness of the allegations. ""We are not making this up,"" he said. ""They have confessed to this. That's what's coming out now."" One of the suspects told officials he had been committing the murders for five years. According to a criminal complaint Sanz Quiroz filed November 18, officials discovered on September 22 a small container containing a fat-like substance that had been stored at the Bella Durmiente bus station in Lima, Peru's capital. On November 3, the complaint says, suspect Serapio Marcos Veramendi Principe was arrested after he retrieved three bottles from the Estrella Polar bus station. The bottles contained a substance authorities believe is human fat, the complaint says. Lab tests are being performed to determine what the substance is. Authorities identified the three other suspects as Elmer Segundo Castillejos Aguero, Hilario Cudena Simon and Enedina Estela Claudio. The suspects identified each other for police in photo lineups, the complaint says. In addition to murder, Veramendi Principe and Castillejos Aguero face weapons charges. Castillejos Aguero, Veramendi Principe and Estela Claudio also face drug charges, authorities said. They are accused in the September 16 killing of Abel Matos Aranda, the criminal complaint says. Authorities believe the substance found at the bus stations is body fat obtained from Matos Aranda. Officials unearthed a partially buried male body November 13 in Huanuco state. They believe it was Matos Aranda. Sanz Quiroz referred to the suspects as ""brujos,"" the Spanish word for witches. He noted that the suspects are part of an Andean mountain culture that believes bodies can be used to ward off evil and prevent disasters. For example, he said, bodies are often buried at the entrances to mine shafts and bridges in the belief they will keep the structures from collapsing. Authorities are calling the suspects ""pishtacos,"" which are Andean mythological creatures. In his 1996 book ""Death in the Andes,"" Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa mentions pishtacos extensively, saying they are half-white ghouls who live in caves, lurk along dark isolated roads and suck the fat out of anyone careless enough to travel Andean roads at night. Andean myth holds that the fat is used to make soaps, lubricants, healing potions and cosmetic creams. Until the arrests, few believed that anything resembling pishtacos existed. ""It's an Andean myth that we've now been able to prove,"" said Miguel Jimenez Torres, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. Some physicians say human fat is used in some medical procedures, but a few products were taken off the market because they were considered unsafe. The longevity of implants that use human tissue often is not as good, said Atlanta cosmetic surgeon Harold Brody. Nor is there any advantage, he said, to using human fat in cosmetic creams or lotions. ""They're a little behind the times,"" Brody said. ""It makes a great moisturizer, but it has no advantages over good moisturizers that don't use human fat."" New York dermatologist Barry Goldman said he had never heard of human fat being sold on the black market. ""The idea that anybody would use an injectable where you didn't know where it came from would be laughable if it weren't unethical and potentially dangerous,"" he said. Still, the notion of black market human fat seemed possible to him. ""They steal kidneys, so why not this?"" he asked. ""It is sick, but in the Holocaust they did use skin for lamps.""","Peruvian authorities reported to have arrested gang who are selling human fat .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Were nine attractive young Turkish women duped and imprisoned in a villa by Internet soft-core porn peddlers? Or did they simply call in the police to help them break their contract with an Internet contest similar to the reality TV show ""Big Brother""? A lawyer for the production company, Istanbul Group Electronic Trade Communications and Advertising A.S., is arguing the latter. In a written statement on the company's Web site, Hilmi Tufan Cakir denied reports published in the Turkish and international media, that nine women were trapped against their will in an Istanbul villa, while cameras sold their images on the Internet. ""My client organized a contest with reward money, contracts were signed with the contestant girls,"" the lawyer's statement said. ""In accordance with the contracts signed by the nine girls, this contest was to be broadcast on the Internet live."" But on Friday, an officer with a Turkish gendarme unit, told CNN that security forces raided the reality show's villa earlier this week, after they received a complaint. ""We detained one person,"" said the gendarme officer, who asked not to be identified. ""There were eight or nine young girls, some younger then 18, who were returned to their families."" Turkish television showed footage of gendarme officers raiding the villa and detaining a suspect earlier this week. The disputed Web-site is a page of hot pink graphics and photos of scantily clad young women, accompanied by throbbing dance music and the title, ""We Are at Home."" It shows video of the villa and its pool, and flashes photos of the nine female ""contestants"" as well as a list of ratings for viewers, who can vote for their favorite lady via cell phone text message. Audience members were also encouraged to send ""virtual gifts"" to the contestants, like pink panties, beer, chocolate and a pearl necklace. Each resident of the house had their own introductory video. The women, dressed in mini-skirts and bikinis, pose by the villa's pool, dance around in revealing outfits, and introduce themselves to the camera. In one segment, a hostess named Zeynep Karacan, who wears a long dress with a plunging neck line, reads from cue cards, introduces viewers to the house and its residents, who enter one-by-one waving to the camera and carrying luggage. According to the Web site's rating system, the second most popular contestant was woman from the town of Kocaeli who went by the name ""Tugce."" Text on the web-page said she was 18-years old, born on September 14th, 1990. But in her on-camera appearance, Tugce tells the audience ""I am 16."" She wears a purple bikini by the pool and goes on to say ""I came here to be discovered. My biggest dream is to be a model."" In Turkish press reports, the women said they signed contracts requiring them to pay fines of more then $30,000 if they left the show before it completed filming. This is not the first time scandal has rocked the booming reality TV industry in Turkey. In 2005, a male contestant from the hit show ""Would You Be My Bride?"" died of an apparent drug overdose after the season wrapped up production. On that show, mothers helped their sons choose a bride. The mother of the young man who killed himself, has since gone on to host another reality match-making TV show.","Police: 8 or 9 young girls, some under 18, were returned to their families .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States needs to formulate an ""updated strategy"" for Iraq, now that the Bush administration's 18-month game plan for the country is completed, the head of the Government Accountability Office told lawmakers Wednesday. U.S. soldiers crouch at their positions during a mission in  Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, earlier this month. Acting U.S. Comptroller General Gene L. Dodaro appeared before a House Armed Services Committee hearing to discuss last month's GAO progress report on Iraq, which reaffirmed the need for a renewed strategy in the war-ravaged country. The report, Dodaro said in prepared remarks, noted that ""some gains"" have been made in the security, legislative and economic areas since President Bush last year announced ""The New Way Forward"" -- the near-term goals for Iraq that included the military surge. The surge, or troop escalation, ended this month. ""The United States had made some progress in achieving key goals stated in 'The New Way Forward,' "" the report said. ""Looking forward, many challenges remain, and an updated strategy is essential."" Dodaro said the progress report recommended an updated strategy in Iraq to the Departments of State and Defense. He told lawmakers that the departments said they will ""review and refine the current strategy as necessary, but asserted that 'The New Way Forward' remains valid."" Dodaro also argued that a renewed strategy is important ""for several reasons."" The goals and objectives for the present phase end this month and they are ""contained in disparate documents rather than a single strategic plan,"" he said in his prepared remarks. ""Much has changed in Iraq since January 2007, when the president announced 'The New Way Forward.' Violence is down, U.S. surge forces are leaving, and a new framework for the U.S. presence in Iraq needs to be agreed upon beyond the U.N. mandate,"" Dodaro said. The GAO report said that while the number of enemy-initiated attacks in Iraq have decreased about 80 percent from June 2007 to June 2008, the ""security environment remains volatile and dangerous."" The agency noted that not all of the country's provinces have lead responsibility for security and less than 10 percent of Iraqi security forces ""were at the highest readiness level."" The progress report also cited the enactment by Iraqi lawmakers of measures ""to return some Baathists to government, grant amnesty to detained Iraqis and define provincial powers."" It said there is an ""unfinished"" legislative agenda, citing the need for measures on ""sharing oil revenues, disarming militias, and holding provincial elections."" A provincial election law was passed on Tuesday by Iraq's parliament, the Council of Representatives, but Iraqi President Jalal Talabani has rejected it, his office said Wednesday. The measure was strongly opposed by Kurdish lawmakers and Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government had criticized it, calling for its rejection. It's not clear whether further negotiations may take place to amend the legislation. As for the economic arena, crude oil production is below U.S. goals, even though it has ""improved for short periods,"" the GAO report said. Goals for water service are ""close to being reached,"" but the daily electricity supply ""met only slightly more than half of demand in early July 2008."" It also noted that Iraq ""spent only 24 percent of the $27 billion it budgeted for its reconstruction efforts between 2005 and 2007."" Dodaro said the Pentagon, State Department and other agencies should ""develop an updated strategy for Iraq that defines U.S. goals and objectives after July 2008."" ""This strategy should build on recent security and legislative gains, address the remaining unmet goals and challenges for the near and long term, clearly articulate goals, objectives, roles and responsibilities, and the resources needed,"" he said.","NEW: Head of Government Accountability Office speaks to House committee .

"London, England (CNN) -- Lang Lang Revealed - narrated by Jazz Legend Herbie Hancock. Heralded as the ""hottest artist on the classical music planet"" by The New York Times, 27-year-old Lang Lang has played sold out recitals and concerts in every major city in the world. The Chinese child prodigy started playing piano at the age of 3, won his first competition aged 5, and today age 27, he is on Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. On this month's Revealed, we follow the piano prodigy on an adventure out of his classical zone, and into the jazz world to meet his hero, American legend Herbie Hancock. Hancock narrates us through this journey, following Lang Lang back to China for a bittersweet trip down memory lane, and then onto Montreux in Switzerland for his first foray into the jazz world. Today Lang Lang is so much in demand that he is constantly on the move, joking to CNN, ""I am a professional traveler."" Revealed joins Lang Lang on board his private jet on a trip to China, where his megastardom has reached levels which make public outings rather problematic; Lang Lang is mobbed as soon as he sets foot on the street. We talk to his parents about the practice regime they implemented from the age of 4, and the ruthless work ethic that they believe has brought him success. Lang Lang has made it his mission to share classical music around the world, with an emphasis on training children through outreach programs. Following his performance at the opening of Beijing's 2008 Olympic Games, he became a symbol of the youth and future of China. This status has inspired over 35 million Chinese children to learn to play classical piano - a phenomenon popularly referred to as ""the Lang Lang effect."" Revealed documents the days leading up to Lang Lang's next major Chinese performance. He has been selected by the government to perform in celebrations of the 60-year Anniversary of the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, a fitting performance for the prodigy who is seen to embody modern China. The frenzy surrounding Lang Lang in China inspired iconic piano maker Steinway to create their first piano branded in someone's name. On a visit to the Steinway shop along the way, Lang Lang meets two aspiring young pianists, and Revealed captures an impromptu masterclass with the two young boys. Lang Lang is not however everyone's cup of tea. Famously ""loved by some, reviled by others,"" there are those who find his flashy image and demonstrative performing styles at odds with the world of classical music. But Lang Lang is not concerned about that. His mission is to spread a love of music and popularize classical works. Revealed follows him to the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, where he teams up with his hero, Jazz legend Hancock. The feeling of admiration is entirely mutual, and for Hancock who has not played classical repertoire in many years, he is feeling out of his depth. ""Lang Lang is totally amazing, I'm pretty terrified to be up on stage playing alongside him. I've never practiced so much in my life!"" Backstage another Jazz legend Quincy Jones has popped by for the concert, remarking, ""Lang Lang has taken the world by storm. This is as good as it gets."" Only 27 years old, Lang Lang is high on life and music, and hungry for as much adventure as he can get his hands on. His energy and enthusiasm rubs off on all those he comes into contact with, and as Revealed quickly discovers, a trail of laughter, hugs and applause seems to follow him everywhere he goes. Tune in to Revealed to join Herbie Hancock as he walks and laughs us through the adventure that brought him and Lang Lang, two worlds, two generations, and two musical genres together.

"(CNN) -- Comcast rolled out a Web-based on-demand television and movie service on Tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies. The move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their TV sets and heading straight to the Web -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows. The service, named Fancast XFINITY TV (formerly called TV Everywhere), is the biggest cable industry initiative to keep people from skipping traditional TV service in the United States. ""I watch TV online every day. I find it more convenient than my regular TV...,"" Michael Heard, a self-employed computer repairman from Atlanta, Georgia, said via e-mail. ""I'm usually watching TV on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another. ""And also my time is important, so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. isn't convenient. Online TV allows me to watch what I want when I want."" Networks have tried for the past couple of years to find a way to reach Web-watching audiences by streaming content on their Web sites or making partnerships with Hulu, one of the larger online TV sites. Now, Comcast is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content. It is available to all Comcast customers, so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service. Heard said he doesn't expect to give up Hulu, though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast. Heard, trying out the site Tuesday after it went live, tweeted that he thought the service was ""awesome,"" and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of ""The Sopranos."" ""The quality, it's really clear and loads fast,"" he said, though he noted there were still some bugs in the product. Heard occasionally had to reload the site, and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu. The service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter, with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences. Some complained that high-definition videos, which are available on Hulu, are not available on Comcast's service. Others complained about having to download a separate video player, the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system, and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers. Comcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future. In the next six months, after the service has gone through more beta testing, the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base. Customers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to. Those not paying for HBO regularly, for example, won't be able to snag the newest episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" online. In addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker, Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar. Executives said they hope the service would be available in about six months. To access the content, users simply need to log in with their Comcast e-mail address at fancast.com. The site is offering live online help, including help retrieving those addresses.","Comcast's Fancast XFINITY TV goes live Tuesday for its Internet, TV subscribers .

"(Health.com) -- More than one in 10 women develops depression during pregnancy. Now, a new study suggests that women who are treated with antidepressants are more likely to give birth early or to have newborns that need to spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit. Babies of women taking SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to have been admitted to intensive care. Depression itself can have ill effects for both mom and baby. Therefore, the benefits of the antidepressants -- known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors -- may still outweigh the risks for some women, researchers say. ""There is no easy way out of this,"" says Dr. Tim Oberlander, a developmental pediatrician at BC Children's Hospital, in Vancouver, Canada, who has studied the effects of SSRIs on children exposed in the womb, but was not involved in the current study. ""Depression needs to be managed, and for some women, the use of these medications is appropriate and necessary."" Health.com: 3 Signs you should stop, adjust, or switch antidepressants . The new study, led by Dr. Najaaraq Lund, of Aarhus University, in Denmark, found that babies whose mothers had taken SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an NICU. Women have been using SSRIs during pregnancy since the early 1990s, Lund and her colleagues point out in the report, which is published in the October issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. These drugs, which include Zoloft, Prozac, and others, are widely considered to be the safest type of antidepressant medication to take during pregnancy. It's been difficult to confirm their safety, however, especially since investigators have to find a way to distinguish between the effects of depression itself -- and habits that depressed women may be more likely to engage in, like drinking and smoking -- and the drug on the newborn. Health.com: Do pregnancy and bipolar disorder mix? Lund and her colleagues tackled this issue by including a group of women who reported a history of some type of psychiatric illness but weren't taking SSRIs. Some, but not all, of these women had suffered from depression. ""Using this group as a comparison group takes into account possible genetic or lifestyle factors associated with present or previous psychiatric disorders,"" the researcher notes. The analysis included 329 women who took SSRIs in pregnancy, 4,902 with a history of psychiatric illness who weren't taking the drugs, and 51,770 women who reported no history of psychiatric illness and weren't taking SSRIs. All had received prenatal care at Aarhus University Hospital between 1989 and 2006. Babies of women taking SSRIs were born an average of five days earlier than those born to women who had no mental illness, and were twice as likely to be born preterm. The babies whose mothers took SSRIs were 2.4 times as likely to have been admitted to the NICU than infants who hadn't been exposed to the drugs in utero. They were also more than four times as likely to have Apgar scores below eight, just five minutes after birth. (Apgar scores measure an infant's health at birth by looking at his or her breathing, heartbeat, reflexes, muscle tone, and skin color; scores of seven and above are considered normal, and a newborn's Apgar score has no influence on how he or she will fare later in life.) There was no difference between SSRI-exposed babies and unexposed babies in head circumference or birth weight. Antidepressant medication is just one part of the equation in addressing women's mental health during pregnancy, notes Oberlander, who says depression in pregnancy is a ""huge public health issue"" with lasting implications for women and their children. Helping ensure that women are getting enough social support and adequate nutrition is essential, he adds, while alternative treatments for depression -- such as exercise, light therapy, and omega-3 fatty acids -- ought to be explored further. ""In general, optimizing non-pharmacological treatment would be a really important step,"" he says. He explains that it is essential to follow SSRI-exposed babies as they grow up, to identify any problems and intervene as necessary. However, he and Lund agree that it's still unclear whether the differences seen at birth will have lasting effects on a child's development and health. Health.com: 6 Rules for a healthy postpartum slim-down . ""As depression itself can influence birth outcome in a negative direction, treatment is warranted in some cases based on the existing body of evidence,"" Lund says. ""In cases with mild or moderate symptoms, psychotherapy can be used as an alternative treatment. In severe cases and in patients with a history of recurrent, severe depression, continuation or initiation of treatment might be the best option. ""Every single case should be considered individually, and the decision should be made by the woman and her ob-gyn and psychiatrist,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- The drinking water in the area of last month's coal-sludge spill in eastern Tennessee is safe, but elevated levels of arsenic have been found in the sludge, authorities said. Properties near ground zero of the December 22 Tennessee spill are covered in sludge. A billion gallons of the sludge, made up of water and fly ash from a coal-burning Tennessee Valley Authority steam plant in Kingston, Tennessee, swamped 300 acres of mostly private property when a dike on a retention pond collapsed December 22. All residents in the area were evacuated, and three homes were deemed uninhabitable, according to the TVA. About a dozen other homes were damaged. Preliminary results from water samples taken in the spill area show no unsafe levels of toxins, said Leslie Sims, on-scene coordinator for the Environmental Protection Agency. The testing includes municipal supplies and private wells, he said. Kingston Mayor Troy Beets said he let his grandchildren drink and bathe in city water at his house over the holidays and didn't worry about it. At a Friday news conference, he drank a cup of water he said was straight from the tap in his home.  View a map of where the spill occured » . ""I'm gonna be fine,"" he quipped. However, samples of the fly ash scooped up along roadsides and river banks show elevated levels of arsenic that normally would trigger an EPA response, Sims said. ""These are levels that we consider harmful to humans,"" he said. But the EPA is not responding because the TVA is taking action to fix the problem, he added. Arsenic is a natural element found in soil and minerals, but exposure to it can cause sickness, the National Institutes of Health says.  Learn more about arsenic » . The arsenic is in the sludge but not in the air in significant amounts, said Alan Nye, a scientist with the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health, a private scientific consulting company based in Arkansas. ""The bottom line is that the air quality is very good and continues to be so,"" Nye said. That's not good enough for Suzanne Solomon, who rents a home about 2½ miles downwind from the spill zone. She and her family are moving somewhere they feel will be safe from fly ash that might blow around once it dries. ""We have a 2-year-old daughter whose health is not worth the risk, even if it is a minuscule risk,"" she said. ""I am an opera singer with mild asthma [and] I do not wish to expose [my lungs] to any dust which might become airborne. ... I do not see any way that they can keep all of this out of the air."" Rather than try to gather up all the spilled ash, the TVA plans to lock it in place by planting seeds and covering it with mulch, said Bob Summers, the TVA's operations section chief. ""We're hearing all kinds of stories,"" said Tom Vereb, whose formerly picturesque lakefront property is now caked in deep, swirling layers of gray muck and debris. ""We're hearing everything from 'This is perfectly fine to be around,' to 'Get away, as far as you can, from it.' So we really don't know what the right answer is there. We're not going to get panicked about it."" Howie Rose, director of the Roane County Emergency Management Agency, said the city of Kingston, about 40 miles west of Knoxville, has asked the EPA for long-term environmental monitoring, ""and we've got a commitment for that."" The TVA also is rebuilding the dike, as well as the roads and railroad tracks that were heavily damaged by the rushing sludge. ""It's 40 feet deep of sludge in the middle of a channel, and they're talking about four to six weeks of cleanup,"" said Travis Cantrell, another local resident. ""That'd be a stretch."" Whether the plant will continue to store its fly ash -- a byproduct of coal-burning -- in ponds will have to be evaluated, said Tim Hope, the TVA's incident commander. ""I would imagine that things would be done differently,"" Hope said.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- French investigators said they are looking into problems encountered by an Air France jet last month in nearly the same spot over the Atlantic where another Air France jet mysteriously crashed in June. Air France flight 445 was flying from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, the night of Nov. 29 when it encountered the problems, the French accident investigation agency, BEA, said in a news release this week. It is the same route taken by Air France flight 447 when it went down in the Atlantic Ocean in stormy weather June 1, killing all 228 people aboard. The investigation agency has not established the cause of the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found. ""The analysis of what happened could lead to complementary explanations about the accident of flight AF 447,"" the investigation agency said. Flight 445 encountered ""severe turbulence"" about four hours after takeoff on Nov. 29, forcing the pilots to descend, Air France said in a statement after the flight. The crew sent out an emergency radio message to indicate it had left its flight level, Air France said. The flight, with 215 people aboard, ""continued normally"" after half an hour of moderate to severe turbulence, the airline said. Air France declined to comment on the investigation agency's statement this week. The BEA said the November flight was an Airbus A330-203, the same model involved in the June crash, but Air France said the November incident involved an Airbus A330-200. While French authorities have not yet determined what caused the June crash, tests have brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which are used to measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages before it crashed that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich. -- CNN's Luc Lacroix contributed to this report .","Air France jet encountered problems near where Airbus jet crashed earlier this year .

"(CNN) -- Italy's Valentino Rossi gave his bid to seal a seventh Moto GP world title at the Malaysian Grand Prix a boost after qualifying for the race in pole position. The defending champion set a name lap-record time of 2 minutes 00.518 seconds despite sweltering conditions on Saturday. The time smashed Casey Stoner's 2007 lap record of 2 minutes 02.108 seconds. The Yamaha rider celebrated his seventh pole of the season by pulling a wheelie as he drove into the pit lane at the Sepang circuit. The 5.5-kilometer track that is situated south of the capital Kuala Lumpur, is a notoriously tought test for rider and machine alike with its combination of tight corners, long straights and tough high-speed bends. The 30-year-old currently leads the world championship by 38 points, a position that means a top-four finish at Sepang would seal the title on Sunday. Rossi's teammate Jorge Lorenzo qualified in second place, just 0.569sec behind -- a result that prompted Rossi to pay tribute to the hard work of his team. ""The team worked well, the bike performed well, hence I was able to go faster. ""Starting from pole is important since the (first) corner is far away,"" he added. Spaniard Dani Pedrosa (Honda) was 0.736sec behind Rossi while Australian Stoner was fourth at 0.937sec. Ducati rider Stoner, who finished ahead of Rossi in last weekend's Australian Grand Prix to take the win, is third in the world championship standings, with Pedrosa fourth on a Honda.","Italy's Valentino Rossi qualifies in pole position for the Malaysian Moto GP .

"(CNN) -- ""For architects, perfection is necessary,"" said Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. ""It is my mission to use the kindness and delicateness that old architecture had. I believe that this mission is not easy to complete. So I am planning to work until I fall down."" With nearly 60 projects on the go across the world, Kuma's search for perfection is all consuming; he rarely takes a day off from work and sometimes even finished projects are analyzed and amended. The 55-year-old from Tokyo has become synonymous with delicate simplicity and sensitivity to a building's surrounding. From the Great (Bamboo) Wall House located near the Great Wall of China outside of Beijing to the Suntory Museum of Art in Tokyo, Kuma has employed natural materials that complement a building's location to great acclaim. View the gallery of Kuma's spectacular buildings . ""I try to catch the atmosphere of the place where we build the house. We try to find out how the people live there and what kind of materials they use. After we find out the atmosphere of the place, we will think how we can relate that with the architecture."" Using mostly glass and Chinese bamboo to make the house by the Great Wall, it comfortably blended into the natural surroundings, but the Suntory Museum of Art, completed in 2007 presented different challenges. ""Usually, a building in a massive developed area tends to be a sad building. However, I wanted to make a building which is warm and could feel a human's touch. To make that ideal building, I used natural material such as Japanese paper and paulownia [wood]. I wanted to take back the human element even if the building was inside the city."" Much of modern architecture is often unfairly portrayed as lacking that human element, but Kuma's focus on retrieving and remaining Japanese traditions in architecture has gone some way to dispel that myth. It is a far cry from his initial architectural fascination with concrete, in part inspired by the Olympic stadium designed by Kenzo Tange for the 1964 Games in Tokyo. ""I learned that architecture can impress people. If the Olympics were not held in Tokyo, I might not have become an architect,"" he told CNN. If Tange's buildings for the Olympics were responsible for sparking Kuma's imagination, he's followed a different path in his career. After earning a master's degree in architecture from The University of Tokyo in 1979 and further study at Columbia University in New York, he returned to Japan in 1986 -- a boom time for architects. ""People who were only about 30-years-old could design a building. It was an era of post-modernism and a lot of young people were making outstanding buildings during that time."" But the economic recession hit Japan in 1992 and it had a profound impact on Kuma's life and changed his attitude to architecture. ""I didn't have a job in Tokyo for 10 years. I was designing small buildings in the countryside. I worked with a craftsman and studied how to use natural materials in those 10 years. From this experience, I learned the great aspects of Japanese traditional architecture. I started to design traditional Japanese architecture and foreign people took notice of the design,"" he said. ""I think the cities of Japan are a bit damaged by the concrete buildings,"" Kuma added. ""Because of the sub-prime issue and now another economic crisis, I feel this is again a good opportunity for architects to design buildings slowly."" In focusing taking a more holistic approach to his craft, Kuma has promoted the humanizing elements of architecture and its ability of improve people's lives. It's an approach that he has likened to making sushi. ""There are two important things to make sushi. One is the material and the other is the skill... For sushi, both the power of the material and skill is important and their balance is very important. ""I believe that this balance is what people want,"" Kuma continued. ""People and society are seeking the thing like sushi for the architecture and their city. A variety of people are interested in Japanese architecture and traditions and this is parallel to why sushi is popular in Western country.""","Japanese architect has popularized sensitive Japanese traditions in buildings .

"(CNN)  -- A parade of world leaders took the lectern at the United Nations on Wednesday. But days before the speeches on a host of issues, the global body quietly undertook an issue that often flies under the radar: Women. The United Nations consolidated four agencies that tackle women's issues and created a new super agency. Last week, the United Nations consolidated four agencies that tackle women's issues and created a new super agency. Humanitarian workers around the world embraced the move. It was about time, they said, that the world got serious about how half its population lives. The 1945 charter on which the United Nations was founded mandates equal rights for men and women. Since then, the United Nations has added new agencies that focus specifically on children, the environment, refugees, health, education, atomic energy and Palestinians. All report directly to the secretary general, except the agencies pertaining to women. Women's advocates said the agencies were run by lower-ranking officials and lacked clout. In 2006, a high-level panel on U.N. reform described the women's agencies as ""incoherent, under-resourced and fragmented."" It recommended that the United Nations create a dynamic agency focused on gender equality and women's empowerment. And last year, a coalition of 300 private development agencies launched the European Campaign for Gender Equality Architecture Reform (GEAR), which pressured the United Nations to create a single organization to address what it described as consistent neglect of women's needs. Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free World, said a double standard persists, despite the image of the United Nations as a strong women's advocacy machine. The only thing the U.N. Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) has in common with the well-known U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) is a similar sounding name, Donovan said. UNIFEM had neither the high-level U.N. staff nor the money of UNICEF, said Donovan, who worked at UNICEF for 15 years. She said UNIFEM's entire global budget equaled the budget of the UNICEF operation in Ethiopia. Donovan hopes the new agency will ""lift the ideals that are worded so eloquently in U.N. declarations and resolutions off of the inert pages they're written on and plant them in real women's lives."" ""Women who have been leading and achieving for decades without the help of the U.N. system will now enjoy the strengths and benefits that the U.N. can offer,"" she said. Development agencies shared high expectations for the new agency's promotion of women's rights in a world where a disproportionate number of the suffering and persecuted are female. ""This is a great move,"" said Helene Gayle, president of CARE, an international humanitarian agency that focuses on empowering women and girls in developing nations. ""Now, what's needed are resources, a clear mandate and strong leadership,"" she said. ""But I think what we're looking for most is the accountability to make sure gender is integrated into all U.N. strategies. It's up to member states to move quickly, get this new agency off on the right foot and turn the plan into reality."" Ahead of this week's U.N. meetings, UNIFEM issued a report on the progress of women's rights, part of a set of development goals that global agencies have committed to achieving by 2015. ""Implementation still has a long way to go in translating commitments to women's rights into changes in women's lives,"" UNIFEM said. Roughly 60 percent of the world's population living in poverty are women and girls. According to UNIFEM: . • Women are outnumbered four to one in legislatures around the world. • Over 60 percent of all unpaid family workers globally are women, and women still earn on average 17 percent less than men. • About one-third of women still suffer gender-based violence during their lives. • In some parts of the world, one in 10 women dies from pregnancy-related causes even though the means for preventing maternal mortality are cost-effective and well-known. ""Gender gaps on this scale are symptomatic of an accountability crisis,"" UNIFEM said. ""Governments and multilateral organizations have a responsibility to do a better job of answering to women."" Last week, the General Assembly voted to merge UNIFEM and three other U.N. women's agencies to better address glaring gender inequities. In Kenya, for example, the Parliament adopted a new sexual offense bill that hands a minimum 10-year-sentence to a man who is convicted of rape. If he is acquitted, his accuser goes to jail for 10 years. The bill was adopted two years ago over the objections of women lawmakers. Donovan cited the Kenyan law as an example of the uphill climb women face in developing nations. She said AIDS-Free World and other non-governmental organizations are urging the United Nations to fund the new women's agency with an initial $1 billion budget. Advocates would also like to see a presence of the agency in every developing nation, she said. HIV/AIDS agencies especially welcomed the news. ""This is a historic opportunity to advance the rights of women and girls,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of the U.N. agency on HIV/AIDS. He noted that 60 percent of people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa are women. Some aid agencies say that number is as high as 75 percent. Donovan said the new agency has the potential to change the way the United Nations functions in everything it does, as every institution -- whether it's a courtroom or classroom, a political party or a pub, a gymnasium or a country club -- opens its doors to women. And treats them differently, once they step inside.","United Nations consolidates agencies, creates group focused on women's issues .

"Editor's note: Danyel Smith is the chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief of Vibe. Danyel Smith says Michael Jackson sacrificed himself in the name of his art. (CNN) -- It falls to me to prepare a statement on behalf of Vibe magazine when someone is promoted, when there is trouble, or when something major happens in the world of pop. It occasionally falls to me to write an obituary or a tribute when an entertainer dies. It's a part of my job. One has to do it quickly, and I've never been prepared. Yet I've been prepping for this one my whole life. Michael Jackson has died at the age of 50. The sorrow at his passing is palpable, and wet, and illogical -- in my 20 years of being a critic and an editor, I've never met him. But this is a death in the family. I've known Jackson's work since I was 5 years old and was given The Jackson 5's ""ABC"" as a gift. He was on the surface the most uncomplicated of all boys -- beautiful, emotional, untouchable, ours. Michael has bruised my heart many times -- his antics and the accusations, his seeming desire not to be, at least physically, who he'd been. Which is who I am. But as his funeral is prepared, I, like the Jackson brothers sang with optimistic melancholy in 1976, think about the good times. There is no moonwalk down memory lane about Michael. The legends mix in with the rumors mix in with the ice-cold facts of 1960s black working-class Gary, Indiana. That mixes in with girls fainting at the sight of him when he was barely a teenager; which mixes with the many sold-out tours, and with Michael collaborating with Quincy Jones on 1979's ""Off the Wall"" and 1982's ""Thriller."" There is the alleged abuse inflicted on Jackson and his brothers by his father, Joe, along with the strong love and late rivalry with his superstar sister, Janet. There is the magic and melodrama of Motown. The accusation of child abuse (no charge; he agreed to a settlement in a lawsuit against him in 1994), and the 2005 trial in which Jackson was acquitted of child molestation and other heinous charges. There is the drastic change of his skin color, the radical narrowing of his nose, the short marriage to Elvis Presley's daughter, the friendship with Emmanuel Lewis, the 13 Grammys, the 13 No. 1 singles, the two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the haunting, otherworldly performance at Motown's 25th Anniversary special. The way he integrated MTV in 1983 with ""Billie Jean,"" the ""We Are the World"" extravaganzas, the face masks, the oxygen tanks, the Neverland Ranch -- all that mixes in with everything from ""Stop the Love You Save"" to ""Dancing Machine,"" ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',"" ""P.Y.T.,"" ""Man in The Mirror,"" adding up to the more than 750 million albums sold worldwide... I mean. And this is not the half, the tenth, the thousandth of what he was. It comes down to the fact that Michael Jackson gave. Whether he chose to or did it because it was all he knew, he sacrificed himself in the name of his art. Jackson gave almost his entire life on this planet to singing, to dancing, to recording, to performing. He practiced, he watched James Brown and Jackie Wilson and Diana Ross and he watched his brothers. He bent, when he had to, to the will of those who could have done better by him. He was knowing enough about who he was to pretty much demand we all call him The King of Pop, but it was the public shyness, the nerdiness of Michael Jackson that endeared. The whispery voice juxtaposed with the explosive grace he demonstrated on stage and on record. The tenderness, especially of his childhood work, and of ""Off the Wall,"" that seduced, and that inspired loyalty. He made me a believer. He made millions believe. I saw The Jacksons in 1981 in Los Angeles on the Triumph tour, sat in the nosebleeds and was living a dream. It was ecstasy, for what I know of it -- unadulterated joy at witnessing. I saw The Jackson 5 live in 1972 at the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, California. My mother got tickets for herself, my sister and me for my 7th birthday. What moves a heart? What makes a fan? I deserted my family and dashed toward the revolving stage. I told people until I was in my teens that Michael Jackson touched my hand. I know he didn't. I never got close, I was 7 and my mother grabbed me back. I know he didn't touch me, but he did touch me. I swear he did. Is it as simple as saying that an era has closed, that part of our childhood and teen years has died with him, that we have to face true adulthood with its Adult Contemporary radio formats, logical love, and guided tours through Neverland? Is the world grieving Michael Jackson, or mourning for a time when such earnest fandom was possible? Michael was truly something rare, the last of an endangered species. That he is the best entertainer who ever lived I will argue for life, and I come from an Elvis Presley and Motown household. iReport.com: Share your favorite memory of Jackson . In his absolute prime (1974-1986) there was no holding back. There was no cool. Michael Jackson had a sense of humor, but there was little he did, as a performer, with a wink or a nod to himself at our expense. He sometimes got tired of singing ""ABC,"" and the ditties of his (and my) childhood, but he was working. We could see it. It's a dying art. We took and take pride in it. For a time, with the white gloves and flooding pants and loafers and odd military jackets, we emulated it. He gave himself to the world. And Michael Jackson left nothing but blood on the dance floor.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- As I raised my hands toward the ceiling and then pointed them toward my head, I had to wonder: How would the 19th-century Russian writer Nikolai Gogol feel if he knew that a bunch of foreigners were dancing the YMCA at a nightclub named after him? The iconic St. Basil's Cathedral in Red Square takes on a brighter, more colorful look at night. Gogol the man is considered the father of modern Russian realism, with works such as ""Dead Souls."" Gogol the cafe-club is considered a favorite hangout for Russians and expatriates alike, perfect for meals, coffee, fruity cocktails and music 'til everyone clears out around 2:30 a.m., when Moscow's ""real"" nightclubs heat up. Since the Soviet Union fell in 1991, Russia's capital city has progressed in many ways, breaking free of old social structures while struggling to maintain its cultural heritage. The city has preserved a lot of its old beauty, boasting monuments such as St. Basil's Cathedral and gorgeous landscapes such as Tsaritsino Park. At the same time, there are Internet cafes and 24-hour bookstores, and you'd be hard-pressed to meet someone who doesn't carry a cell phone. But, as an American studying abroad at Moscow State University, I sometimes felt perplexed in this immense modern metropolis that still makes certain familiar conveniences inconvenient. In Moscow, kiosks for adding money to your cell phone seem far more common than ATMs. Even nice restaurants with $40-minimum meals -- for example, the best beef stroganoff and fried cheese balls of your life -- accept only cash, no cards. After two weeks, I never figured out where to buy a nail clipper -- but I did see Vladimir Lenin's body, perfectly preserved since 1924.  View more photos of Moscow » . At the university, I had to present a special ID card to one set of guards at the entrance, a dorm pass to another crew, and then confront a third layer of hallway-based security before arriving at my room. I also needed written approval from my floor's ""administrator"" to take luggage out of the building. Then, there's money. Moscow, or ""Moskva"" in Russian, holds the distinction of the world's most expensive city, according to Mercer's 2008 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey. Be prepared for fees from your bank and the Russian bank whenever you use an ATM. Try to stay away from touristy restaurants for meals, and do your souvenir shopping at Izmailovsky Market (Metro: Izmailovsky Park) instead of in stores. The expatriates I encountered all echoed the sentiment that Moscow is a city of constant stress. Maybe that's why I will always love most the Moscow I experienced at night. The monuments that look mildly impressive by day suddenly come to life with light against the onyx sky. You can look out over Sparrow Hills and see the endless glittering skyline, or settle down somewhere like Gogol (Metro: Tverskaya) for vodka-enhanced beverages and music from around the world. And, as long as you know ""Mozhna?"" (""May I?"") and ""Spasiba"" (""Thank you),"" it matters less that few people speak substantial English. Café Bilingua (Metro: Chistye Prudy) is another cozy place to mingle with locals and ex-pats for hours on end -- you can have your coffee in the tiny two-story book shop, or take it up to the restaurant and performance section. Another bar I liked is Etage (Metro: Pushkinskaya), right off Pushkin's Square near a large neon-light sculpture of flowers (how would the great poet feel about that?). Nightclubs dedicated to too-many-people-to-move dance floors don't start up until well after midnight. Propaganda (Metro: Lubyanka), conveniently located near the headquarters of the KGB, spins all kinds of dance music -- go on a Thursday evening for a less crowded experience. Then there's The Real McCoy (Metro: Barrikadnaya), so packed with people that merely crossing the room to stand in the bathroom line requires bumping bodies to the beat. At first we couldn't even get in because the bouncer shook his head at my Swiss friend. But, as always, it's all about who you know -- my Spanish friend's Spanish friend had VIP status, so we went as his entourage to an upscale restaurant-like room in the back.   Part of my Moscow nightlife adventures included riding on an overnight train. For my trip from St. Petersburg to Moscow, I had been told at every ticket office that only seats were available. But upon boarding at midnight, I asked a crew member if I could have a bed. Five minutes and $80 later, the fleshy man who took my ticket had locked me into a less-than-closet-sized space with him. I prepared to claw at the door with my untrimmed nails and scream. ""Close,"" he said. Then he unlocked it to demonstrate ""open."" He stepped out, gave me a stiff wave, and said, ""See you in Moskva."" I sighed and fell asleep on the child-sized mattress. Among the plethora of Moscow's unspoken rules: Do not talk in the elevators or hallways of your student dorm. Accustomed to the silence, one night I was surprised to hear the glorious sound of a Frédéric Chopin nocturne coming from behind a security guard's desk. ""Mozhna?"" I asked, pointing to the door his chair blocked. He just shrugged, so I quietly ducked behind him and pulled the handle. Behold, a secret two-story ballroom with tables and chairs and an upright piano in the corner, and a Russian student who abruptly lifted his hands from the piano keys when I sat down. We took turns playing (thus, my failed-love song ""Sad Panda"" debuted on a new continent) and, in broken but passionate  English, he told me how he wished he could sound like the Russian-American pianist Vladimir Horowitz, and said he often comes with his friend to play around 9 p.m. As if it were the end of a great Russian novel, I never heard music in that hallway again.","The preserved body of Vladimir Lenin is on display in Moscow's Red Square .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man is using billboards with an image of the burning World Trade Center to encourage votes for a Republican presidential candidate, drawing criticism for politicizing the 9/11 attacks. Businessman Mike Meehan says he has put up three billboards such as this one around Orlando, Florida. ""Please Don't Vote for a Democrat"" reads the type over the picture of the twin towers after hijacked airliners hit them on September, 11, 2001. Mike Meehan, a St. Cloud, Florida, businessman who paid to post the billboards in the Orlando area, said former President Clinton should have put a stop to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda before 9/11. He said a Republican president would have done so. ""I believe 9/11 could have been prevented if we'd had a Republican president at the time,"" Meehan said Wednesday on CNN's ""American Morning."" But Democrats and Republicans are saying Meehan shouldn't be using a 9/11 image to make a political point. ""This is a blatant exploitation of that terrible tragedy for political and, perhaps even worse, personal gain,"" Bill Robinson, the Orange County, Florida, Democratic Party chairman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando. The local Republican Party called the billboard ""inappropriate,"" according to WFTV. ""There are many ways to convey the importance of national security in this election without going to extremes, and we encourage a constructive dialogue,"" the Florida Republican Party said in a statement Tuesday. According to Meehan, President Bush has done ""an excellent job ... going after these terrorists.""  Watch Meehan's take on terrorism and the election » . ""You got to remember all the ... people that George Bush did catch and how much success he did have. And we haven't had an attack on this soil since 9/11,"" Meehan said. ""Unlike Bill Clinton, who actually had bin Laden right in his hand and through the CIA and other high officials decide to get him go,"" Meehan said. In a 2006 interview with ""Fox News Sunday,"" Clinton said he authorized the killing of bin Laden in 2000 after the attack on the Navy warship USS Cole in Yemen, but the order was never carried out because U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies refused to certify that bin Laden was behind the Cole attack. ""I got closer to killing him than anybody has gotten since,"" Clinton said in the 2006 interview. Meehan also is using the billboard to promote his Web site, the republicansong.com, where he's trying to sell copies of his song, ""Please Don't Vote for a Democrat."" The song goes beyond the national security issue, ripping Democrats on taxation and energy issues, too. ""They want to take the money from the hard workin' man, and give it to the lazy folks that don't give a damn,"" Meehan sings. Another verse takes on the oil issue. ""We're not fightin' for oil, we got plenty if we drill it,"" he sings. The song's not a moneymaker, he said, just an effort to recoup some of what he's invested in the billboards. A copy of the song on CD cost $5 on the Web site, and the site points out that Meehan can be hired to perform at a ""concert, party, meeting or event."" ""I'm willing to pay the cost for the fact that our soldiers that have died protecting this country have paid a heck of a lot more than what these billboards cost,"" Meehan told ""American Morning."" Florida resident Mary Anderson told WFTV she doesn't see politics when she's looking at the billboard. ""Just looking at it, I'm not thinking about Democrat or Republican, I'm thinking about the twin towers and all the people killed,"" she told WFTV.","Billboards use image from 9/11 to encourage GOP votes .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Brenda Gardenhire shows off her new home with pride. It looks like an oversized shopping cart covered with a khaki canvas. But to her, it's ""wonderful"" -- a stepping stone to get her off the streets and get her life back in order. Brenda Gardenhire was homeless over the last year, until she got her EDAR unit. ""It's like your own home, your own apartment, your own room,"" she said, showing off the 7-foot-long living space on wheels. ""No one else can come in here but me."" Gardenhire is talking about her makeshift home called an EDAR, which stands for Everyone Deserves A Roof. The units are being distributed to homeless people in the Los Angeles area by the Everyone Deserves A Roof nonprofit organization. It's the brainchild of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" movie producer Peter Samuelson, who has spent much of his life working with charities to help impoverished children. He got the idea to help the homeless in recent years as he rode his bicycle from Los Angeles to the beach at Santa Monica.  Watch a canvas-covered 'home' for the homeless » . On those bike rides, he began seeing more and more homeless people. But he didn't just whiz by. He stopped to talk with them -- 62 people in all. One by one, he listened to their needs and what they wanted most: a roof over their heads. And the idea for the EDAR was born. iReport.com: Homeless in pink tents . ""If you had to define the value of a civilization, it's not how many SUVs you've got,"" Samuelson said. ""To me, I think it's how well do we take care of our children, our homeless people, our mentally ill, those less fortunate."" He partnered with the Pasadena Art Center College of Design for a design contest and the current contraption was created. Each unit costs about $500 to make. The four-wheeled home has an expandable base that stays off the ground and is covered by a canvas, giving it the feel of a tent. It extends 86 inches and is 32 inches wide, thin enough to fit through standard doorways. Each unit has a mattress and sleeping bag to provide comfort. It's also flame-retardant and sturdy enough to keep its occupants dry during heavy rains. A braking mechanism prevents the unit from rolling away at night. They also come with a chain and padlock to prevent it from being stolen. Samuelson said he initially wanted to build more permanent shelters for all of the homeless people in the Los Angeles area. ""But when you do the math, you're looking at $3 billion to get 60,000 people off the damp concrete, and that's just in L.A.,"" he said, explaining why he opted for the cheaper EDAR instead of permanent shelters. He said the EDAR isn't a perfect solution, but it's a good, economical stopgap. ""This is $500 to get a man or a woman or a child off the damp concrete,"" he said. ""I don't think it's the best. ... But for now, I think a little bit of privacy -- not being rained on, not sleeping on the ground, not getting pneumonia from the damp -- has a little bit of value."" Jose Font, 50, agrees. He got an EDAR late last year. He said he's been homeless off and on since 1979. He slept on a tarp with a blanket and worked on computer repairs before he became one of about 60 people to get an EDAR. ""Everybody calls it the hobo condo. Everybody envies me because I sleep on a mattress inside,"" he said. ""It makes me feel like I've got something to come to. It feels more like a home than just a tarp and concrete."" He added, ""It's light as a feather when I push it. I can put it anywhere."" Font keeps it locked to a telephone on public property when he's away. James Ramirez, a social worker with the Venice Community Housing Corporation, said he has been able to use the EDAR as incentive to get people's lives back on track. ""What we're doing is using the EDAR as a carrot for them to come in to see us,"" Ramirez said. ""They want the EDAR because they want to keep dry when it's raining and they want a place to stay at night that's comfortable. So we're using this to connect with them."" ""For us, it's working really well,"" he said. ""This is their home. This is what they're proud of at this moment. ... It means a step in the right direction to get back into society."" The EDAR organization says it's starting with baby steps. In addition to the 60 units already given out, another 110 units have been ordered. The units are distributed to shelters, churches and other organizations that help the homeless. Those groups then distribute the units. The EDAR group tries to stay in phone contact with its users every week or two. EDAR.org: How you can help . EDAR currently has about 30 people on a waiting list, plus another 10 shelters in the Los Angeles area. The organization is also looking at land provided by a local authority where they could let women and families stay on a site that also has functioning bathrooms. EDAR has fielded dozens more calls from across the country and around the world about the units. Samuelson said they're ""studying what works best"" and looking at an array of options. ""People talk about the homeless as if it's some homogeneous group of drunken, unemployed, too-lazy-to-get-a-job men. They're totally wrong. They need to come meet people,"" he said. ""What's the point in having a society if it's devoid of helping people less fortunate?"" He added, ""As we raise money, we will get people off the concrete."" For Brenda Gardenhire, that means the world. ""It's a step up to you. It's like you're making progress,"" she said. ""Now, I have me a little place to stay. I'm moving up.""

"(CNN) -- That's right, I said it. And I mean it. Roland Martin says the GOP is missing its chance to win black voters. The GOP as a whole is completely scared of black voters, and the actions by the front-runners for the party's 2008 nomination show they are continuing the same silly political games the party has played for years. Oh, don't bother tossing out the appointments of Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state by Bush. Yes, they are African-American. But I'm speaking of the party. Ever since Richard Nixon ran for the White House, the GOP has run on a ""Southern Strategy,"" meant to alienate blacks in an effort to garner white voters. They've worked the strategy to perfection. When he was head of the Republican National Committee, Ken Mehlman apologized for that strategy as he sought to make inroads among black voters. Republicans will tell you they are the party of Abraham Lincoln, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but their outreach efforts to black voters are lacking. Oh, yes, I know. Democrats have a stranglehold on the black vote, receiving upward of 90 percent in national elections. A significant part of that is a result of the party seeing blacks as the backbone of the party. But the reality is that when you have only one party that truly makes a play for those voters, of course you will see such disparities! That's why it's dumb, dumb, and dumber for the leading GOP candidates to skip Thursday's debate hosted by Tavis Smiley and airing on PBS. Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, Fred Thompson and Sen. John McCain have all cited ""scheduling conflicts"" as the reason for their lack of attendance to debate at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, even though Smiley personnel tell me they began discussions with then-RNC head Mehlman in February 2006. When the debate was announced earlier this year, along with a Democratic forum held in June at Howard University, the RNC promised their candidates would speak. But those of us who follow politics knew that wasn't going to happen. This summer, all of the Republican candidates, save Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo, skipped the NAACP and the National Urban League conventions. OK, I get the former, but the Urban League? President Bush has spoken there several times as president! The GOP keeps blowing a big opportunity by ignoring blacks. And what about the debate sponsored by Spanish language TV station Univision? Only McCain accepted the invite. Today's generation of blacks and Latinos shouldn't be seen as the same as their parents. An increasing number of people are refusing to identify themselves with a party, and looking at issues. Latinos have been a huge part of the Republican outreach, but the immigration debate is turning that in a different direction. Why should the GOP talk to black voters, and what would they talk about? First, I can tell you that immigration is huge in the black community, and gets folks riled up in a hurry (you ought to see my talk show lines when this comes up). Education and health care are also major. And every GOP debate has been about faith in the public square, and we know that plays well with black voters. Now, when it comes to the war in Iraq, the GOP can forget that tune. No one is listening. And they are completely uneven on the issue of civil rights. Here is an example that further explains the GOP's stupidity on this topic. Several years ago, a Republican in the Dallas-Fort Worth area was trying to unseat then-Rep. Martin Frost, a heavily entrenched Democrat. That summer, a series of black churches were being burned. My good friend, Michael Williams, a third-generation black Republican, was planning to hold a fundraiser at his home for the GOP candidate. He called the campaign and said it would be a good idea for the candidate to make a statement on the burnings, condemning them and saying it didn't make sense. The campaign said no. Williams called back and made the suggestion again, and the response was they didn't want to seem as if they were pandering to the black community. He laughed at that because the campaign was bringing then-Rep. J.C. Watts, a prominent black Republican, to visit black churches with the candidate. Hello! That's pandering. So Williams told his wife, Donna, what the candidate said. She replied, ""Any man who is such a coward that he can't speak against churches being burned is not welcome in my home."" The fundraiser was called off. Here was a simple opportunity to actually show that he cared, but the candidate was so scared to say something, he turned off a campaign donor. Will speaking at one debate turn around decades of black support for the Democrats? Nope. But not speaking will just mean business as usual, and the GOP needs less of that. Roland S.

"(CNN) -- Archaeologists in Israel have discovered what they believe is the bust of a Roman boxer from the second or third century. The figurine is small -- about 6 centimeters high by 4 centimeters wide -- but very detailed, archaeologists say. ""It seems that what we have here is a unique find,"" the two directors of the excavation said in a statement released Monday by the Israel Antiquities Authority. The figurine, made of marble, comes from a time when ""the art of Roman sculpture reached its zenith,"" Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets said. It's tiny -- only about 6 centimeters high by 4 centimeters wide, Ben-Ami told CNN. ""That's why it is so impressive. It's so small, but still you can see every little detail on the marble,"" he said. The archaeologists believe a merchant family from the eastern part of the Roman Empire most likely passed down the ""precious object"" through the generations until the fourth or fifth century, when an unfortunate family member had it with him at a public building, perhaps a hostel -- and an earthquake struck. A team has been digging up the building in the City of David, part of Jerusalem. The object is part of the ""silent testimony of the drama that occurred in this impressive structure prior to its collapse,"" the Israel Antiquities Authority said. The ""short hair style, the prominent lobes and curves of the ears, as well as the almond-shaped eyes suggest that the object most likely portrays an athlete, probably a boxer,"" the statement said. Little bits of the sculpture have broken off. It is missing part of the nose and mouth, Ben-Ami said. ""The high level of finish on the figurine is extraordinary,"" Ben-Ami and Tchekhanovets said in their statement. They added: ""To the best of our knowledge, to date no similar artifact made of marble (or any other kind of stone) bearing the same image that was just found has been discovered in excavations elsewhere in the country."" A few similar artifacts made of bronze have been found ""at different sites in the country and they have been found in large numbers in different places throughout the Roman Empire, where the overwhelming majority of them date to the third century CE (the Roman period)."" Two tiny holes in the figurine suggest it was used as a suspended weight together with a balance scale, the archaeologists said. Last month, the excavation team at this same site discovered ""one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever found in Jerusalem,"" the Israel Antiquities Authority said. ""It consists of 264 gold coins and was found at about the same time as a gold earring, inlaid with expensive pearls and remarkably well preserved."" ""Every single object has a story behind it,"" Ben-Ami said in an interview with CNN. ""Behind every object there are people. And, for us, the most important thing is to try to tell the stories behind these items.""","Archaeologists in Israel unearth tiny marble figurine .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A man in a wheelchair blew himself up Monday in a northern Iraqi police station, killing three National Police officers, including a commander, police said. Soldiers stand by as pilgrims gather Sunday in Karbala for al-Arbaeen, one of holiest days on the Shiite calendar. The attack also wounded nine officers on the police force, which the Iraqi Interior Ministry operates. The bombing in Samarra raises concern about the recent tactics employed by insurgents in Iraq. Bombs have been placed inside dead animals and hidden in carts. And in recent days, vagrants have been involved in bombings. ""As a sign of desperation, some of those terrorists resorted to some new methods and techniques,"" said Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, spokesman for Baghdad's security plan. One of the tactics is the use of remote-controlled ""sticky"" bombs, small enough to tape under vehicles. A high-ranking Samarra police official said the disabled man came to meet with Brig. Gen. Abdul Jabbar Rabei Muttar, deputy commander of security, at the security operations building in Samarra. The pair met last week as well. The man was searched when he entered the building, but police didn't look under his wheelchair seat, where the explosives had been placed. The man, who police say was cogent, detonated the explosives when Muttar approached him. Also Monday, a roadside bomb exploded in the middle of a crowd of Shiite Muslims in Baghdad, killing three people and wounding 15, an Interior Ministry official said. The strike, in southeastern Baghdad's Zafaraniya district, is the latest attack against pilgrims trekking to Karbala for al-Arbaeen, one of the holiest days of the Shiite religious calendar. It falls on Wednesday. On Sunday, a suicide bomber in Iskandariya killed at least 45 people and wounded 68 others, and armed militants attacked pilgrims in southern Baghdad, killing three and wounding more than 30 others. Pilgrims traditionally make their way to Karbala on foot as a demonstration of piety, and those who head to the city from Baghdad go through Babil province, where Iskandariya is located. Joint forces have stepped up patrols during the pilgrimage to protect the thousands headed to Karbala. Last year, more than 180 pilgrims were killed in a series of attacks, most during twin suicide bombings in Hilla, Babil province's capital. Sunday's attack in Iskandariya, conducted by a bomber wearing an explosive vest, prompted authorities there to replace the police chief, Hilla police said. More National Police officers have been deployed to Babil to ensure the safety of pilgrims heading to Karbala, a police official said. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and American-led coalition forces condemned Sunday's ""barbaric attacks in Baghdad and Iskandariya"" against ""innocent citizens participating in an important religious commemoration."" Every year, thousands of pilgrims amass in Karbala for al-Arbaeen, which commemorates the end of a 40-day mourning period for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. Hussein, one of the most revered Shiite martyrs, is buried in Karbala, about 60 miles southwest of Baghdad. Karbala's main holy site is the gold-domed Imam Hussein Shrine. Other developments .

"(CNN) -- Hold on to the audacity of hope but shun the arrogance of over-promising. A scholar says President Obama could learn from Lyndon Johnson's Great Society mistakes. That's the message from a scholar who says President Obama can learn much from the success and mistakes of another ambitious attempt to remake America. Robert Weisbrot, co-author of ""The Liberal Hour: Washington and the Politics of Change in the 1960s,'' says the Great Society revolution was ""tremendously liberating"" for members of the most vulnerable groups in America. The Great Society was President Lyndon Johnson's sprawling legislative attempts in the mid-1960s to lift Americans out of poverty, erase racial injustice and clean up the environment. But historical circumstances won't permit Obama to push through his own Great Society, Weisbrot says. ""Obama is living in a different age,"" Weisbrot said. ""The circumstances won't permit him to be another Lyndon Johnson."" Obama came to office with the nation's economic institutions verging on collapse. He also has to contend with bitter partisanship and a public that's suspicious of big government programs. ""Obama needs to not only learn lessons from the Great Society but keep in mind the limits of what he can draw from a fundamentally different age,"" Weisbrot said. Americans were ready for the Great Society when Johnson became president, he says. The country was enjoying a post-World War II economic boom. The Republican and Democratic parties worked together because both had a significant number of moderates. And people had more faith in the federal government, which had led the nation out of the Great Depression and World War II and helped rebuild the European economy, Weisbrot says. ""For many Americans, the federal government could achieve anything for which there was a national mandate,"" Weisbrot said. Yet that same optimism helped stain the Great Society's legacy, Weisbrot says. He says Johnson framed the Great Society as a war to defeat poverty and racial injustice. He over-promised, particularly when the Vietnam War began to drain away resources for the Great Society. ""Lyndon Johnson dealt in hyperbole,"" Weisbrot said. ""It works well in getting legislation through Congress, but it sets the nation up for disillusionment when the promised Utopia didn't materialize.""","Scholar: Circumstances won't allow another Great Society .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Ramadan, the holy month of Islam, began Saturday with Iraqis hoping for tranquility but fearful after recent attacks that have shaken the country. Plastic flowers and banners hang on cars destroyed in Wednesday's bombings in Baghdad. Al-Iraqia state TV interrupted regular programming Saturday afternoon to broadcast Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's address to Iraqis on the occasion of the start of the holy month. The prime minister said that as he congratulates Iraqis, his ""heart is full of sadness and sorrow."" Four Iraqi soldiers and a government worker were killed Saturday in attacks in Baghdad and Mosul, according to an official of the Interior Ministry. Gunmen opened fire earlier in the day on an army checkpoint in the Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya in northeastern Baghdad, killing two soldiers and wounding one. Two more soldiers died and two were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near an Iraqi army patrol in Zummar, about 50 miles northwest of Mosul. Mosul is 260 miles north of Baghdad. A bomb left inside the district manager's office in the Qahira neighborhood in eastern Mosul killed the manager and two children. A roadside bomb also exploded near a car and wounded two people in the Saidiya district of southeastern Baghdad. The holy month of Ramadan, considered to be a time of peace and giving, is when Muslims across the world fast from dawn until dusk, and its observance is one of the five pillars of Islam. But since the start of the war, Iraqis every year brace for an uptick in violence during the holy month. Some years have seen a rise in suicide attacks. Extremist attacks during Ramadan are sometimes ""fueled by a belief that to carry out violence -- 'jihad,' a suicide bombing -- during a holy month such as this one will gain them more credibility with the Lord,"" said CNN Correspondent Arwa Damon in Baghdad. Ramadan ""is meant to be a time to show one's devotion to God, a time of sacrifice,"" said Damon, ""Unfortunately, even though it is very much intended to be a time of peace ... it has proven over the last few years in places like here in Iraq to be a time of increased violence."" On Wednesday, more than 100 people were killed and more than 500 were wounded in a series of truck bombings in Baghdad. It was the deadliest day since the United States pulled its combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns nearly two months ago and left security in the hands of the Iraqis.  Watch report on bombings of Iraqi ministries » . At least four people were killed and 76 were wounded Thursday in a string of bombings in Babil province, according to the Iraqi government. It is not just Iraq where extremists see Ramadan as a time of opportunity.

"Editor's note: Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN, appearing regularly on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" ""Campbell Brown,"" ""AC360°"" and ""State of the Union With John King,"" as well as special event coverage. Gloria Borger says we could be in for a month of venting sessions aimed at members of Congress. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ah, the summer. Time for all those members of Congress to go home, meet with their constituents, get their input on health care reform and take back what they have learned from the voters. Not exactly. In some town hall meetings around the country, anger and fear are trumping any constructive argument -- at least so far. Recently, for instance, Sen. Arlen Specter held a town hall meeting with Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary. In attempting to answer questions, they were shouted down by folks more interested in venting than discussing. On the conservative FreedomWorks Web site, the display was headlined ""Specter Gets Schooled."" Above the video of the event, the site says ""... this is a must watch and a must emulate at town halls across the country over the next month."" Really? What about those folks who are actually interested in debating and discussing a very complex issue they're trying to digest? There are some who may actually want to figure out the best way to solve the health care problem. What ever happened to asking questions about the quality of care, the cost of insurance, the impact of any public plan on the health care system? After all, this has been a turbulent economic time for this country, and another huge shock to the system is naturally worrisome. Especially when it comes to an issue as complex as health care. But it's not just the folks at these town halls who have learned how to heckle. Their bad behavior is a derivative of the questionable quality of the political debate they listen to every day. Indeed, if there's one thing we've gotten really good at over the years, it's this: reducing complicated problems to bite-sized slogans. It seems to work, so we keep doing it. Ipso facto, Obama's reform ideas become ""socialism"" to his Republican critics. And the administration is not above creating a handy bogeyman of its own: the insurance companies. At least according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who accuses them of ""full-force carpet-bombing and shock and awe against the public option."" Too bad they actually support the rest of reform, and are still running positive ads about the effort. They weren't at the table at all 16 years ago when Hillary Clinton's effort at reform failed. The world has changed since then, and the congressional plans for reforming health care have changed, too. But the invective of the debate, sad to say, has not. The effort on Capitol Hill has been serious. I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but members of Congress are actually doing some real work. Some policy differences may never get resolved because they are too ideological; others are regional, and that's tough, too. But they're working at it, for hours on end, behind closed doors. No cameras, no grandstanding. One of those working the hardest, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, was derided at a town hall recently on the matter of his own health insurance. So here's the fellow who is spending every waking hour trying to get a bipartisan measure that can pass the Senate -- and be fair to Iowans -- and he goes home and gets an earful. Maybe the discourse will become more productive as the summer progresses. And maybe not. But the health care dilemma remains, no matter how loud the discussion. As John F. Kennedy told us, ""To govern is to choose."" Especially when the choices are not easy.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed a $3.55 trillion budget for fiscal year 2010 Thursday night, capping off weeks of acrimonious partisan debate and a long day of voting marked by the defeat of several alternative plans. The U.S. House passed a $3.55 trillion budget for fiscal year 2010 Thursday night. The House version of the budget passed by a margin of 233-196 in a virtual party-line vote. All but 20 House Democrats supported it; no House Republican voted in favor. In London, England, where he has been attending the Group of 20 summit, President Obama lauded the House vote. ""Tonight, the House of Representatives took another step toward rebuilding our struggling economy,"" he said in a statement. ""And by making hard choices and challenging the old ways of doing business, we will cut in half the budget deficit we inherited within four years. With this vote comes an obligation to pursue our efforts to go through the budget line-by-line, searching for additional savings. Like the families we serve, we must cut the things we don't need to invest in those we do."" The Senate plans a vote on its $3.53 trillion version of the budget later Thursday night. That vote, too, is expected to fall on party lines. Moderate GOP Sens. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, who voted in favor of Obama's stimulus bill last month, intend to vote against what is essentially the blueprint of Obama's economic policies going forward. The House budget largely tracks Obama's initial proposed spending plan, with the exception of a decision to drop his $250 billion request for potential future bailouts of struggling financial institutions.  Watch more on Obama's budget details » . Fiscally conservative House Democrats, known as Blue Dogs, also negotiated with House Democratic leaders to cut $7 billion from the president's $540 billion request for nondefense discretionary spending. Under the House Democrats' plan, the federal government will run an anticipated deficit of $1.2 trillion in the next fiscal year. Their plan promises to cut the deficit by more than half by 2013. House Democrats agreed to extend the middle class tax cut that was included in the recently passed economic stimulus plan, but failed to specify how the cut would be paid for after 2010. They also included language that allows for the controversial procedure called ""budget reconciliation"" for health care, a tool that would limit debate on major policy legislation. Senate Democrats did not include reconciliation in their version of the budget. The matter is guaranteed to be a major partisan sticking point when the two chambers meet to hammer out a final version of next year's spending plan. If it passes, it would allow the Senate to pass Obama's proposed health-care reform without the threat of a Republican-led Senate filibuster. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyoming, speaking for most of his GOP Senate colleagues, warned Tuesday that if a health-care ""reconciliation winds up in the budget bill, it'll be like a declaration of war. ... I hope that that wedge doesn't get thrown in there."" Both the House and the Senate version of the budget allow former President George W. Bush's tax cuts for couples who make more than $250,000 to expire in 2010, and both plans let Obama's signature tax cuts -- $400 for individuals and $800 for couples -- expire as well, unless the White House finds a way to pay for them. Under the House plan, the cuts would expire in 2010; in the Senate plan, they would expire in 2012. Key differences between House and Senate include deficits and nonmilitary discretionary spending. The House budget would reduce the deficit from $1.7 trillion in 2009 to $598 billion in 2014, House Democrats said, while the Senate Democrats say their plan would bring the deficit down an additional $80 billion. The House rejected an alternative proposal put forward by the GOP leadership, which called for $4.8 trillion less in overall spending over the next decade, in part through a five-year freeze in most non-defense discretionary spending. ""House Republicans were united in the desire to find reasonable solutions for middle-class families, focused directly on creating jobs, tax relief and empowering small businesses to survive and grow,"" said House Minority Whip Eric Cantor. ""The Republican budget was crafted to help those Americans worried about their jobs, their health care, their financial security, and their real fears that Washington is spending and borrowing money that America does not have. Republicans offered a comprehensive budget that provides the American people with the ideas, energy and common-sense solutions they are looking for."" Among other things, the House GOP's version of the budget would have repealed the entire $787 billion economic stimulus package except for an extension of unemployment insurance benefits.

"Miami, Florida (CNN)  -- He wanted to sit outside for a while and enjoy the night air, then took a shower and curled up on the couch to watch a cartoon movie. A boring night by many teenagers' standards. But 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who suffered burns over 65 percent of his body in October -- allegedly at the hands of a group of youths he knew -- reveled in it, his mother told reporters Wednesday. Being out of a hospital burn unit, she said, was ""the only thing he wanted for Christmas."" ""He's really looking forward to spending Christmas with his family,"" Valerie Brewer said of her son, who was released from the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center on Tuesday. ""We hope everybody has as wonderful a Christmas as we're going to have."" Three teens -- Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16 -- are accused of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze October 12 in what police said was a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three teens are charged as adults with one count of attempted murder. Each has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, each could face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. The family did not return to their Deerfield Beach, Florida, home, and does not plan to, Valerie Brewer said. Instead, they went to ""a safe place"" -- both so they can have privacy and so Michael Brewer can feel secure. ""He doesn't feel safe going back to the neighborhood,"" she said. ""The families of the boys live within five blocks of us. He does fear for his life going back there. ... He doesn't want to go back and I don't blame him. We're looking forward to moving on and having some peace."" She told CNN in an interview later Wednesday the family is looking for another home. Brewer, who suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, has ""a long road ahead of him,"" Dr. Louis Pizano, associate director of the burn center, said Wednesday. He faces hours of physical therapy five days a week, Pizano said -- a painful process both because of the burns and because of muscle atrophy resulting from the recovery process. Therapists are working to help him walk more easily and regain a range of motion in his arms and legs, Pizano said. Doctors are hopeful Brewer will not require any more skin grafts, he said. Valerie Brewer told CNN in a later interview Wednesday that her son managed to shower ""all by himself"" Tuesday night. Showers can be excruciating for him, she said, as it hurts when the soap and water hit his open wounds. Plus, she said, he must take a piece of gauze and wipe his wounds to get any dead skin off. ""He's very courageous for doing it by himself."" Besides his painful treatment and recovery, Brewer suffered an emotional toll, his mother said. ""He really doesn't talk about it with me or with his father,"" Valerie Brewer said. ""He talks to the therapists about it because he doesn't want to upset us."" He takes medication to help with night terrors, she told CNN, but ""he wakes up every night with nightmares."" She said she sleeps about three or four hours a night, depending on how many times her son wakes up in pain or with a nightmare. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a ""bad decision."" Pizano said Wednesday he would have predicted a six-moth hospital stay for Brewer. While he said it is ""miraculous"" that Brewer was released in two months, ""the reason why he's home so early is because of him."" He said Brewer did everything he needed to do, a formidable task even for an injured adult. ""He followed everything to the T, and he got home early."" Brewer will be home-schooled for the rest of this year and possibly next to allow his recovery to progress, Valerie Brewer said. ""He never gave up on anything,"" she said. ""He got a little depressed once in a while -- anybody would, going through this kind of situation -- but his will to live is just unbelievable, and to move on and live a happy, normal life."" She told CNN, ""He's such inspiration to me. Seeing him go through this -- I know the rest of his life, he's going to have challenges, but nothing is going to ever amount to what he has gone through now, and what he's going to go through for the next several months.""","Michael Brewer, 15, was severely burned in October, allegedly by teens he knew .

"(CNN)  -- The new seven wonders of the world were named Saturday following an online vote that generated server-crushing traffic in its final hours. The Great Wall of China was among the top vote-getters of the ""New 7 Wonders of the World"" project. The final tally produced this list of the world's top human-built wonders: . • The Great Wall of China . • Petra in Jordan . • Brazil's statue of Christ the Redeemer . • Peru's Machu Picchu . • Mexico's Chichen Itza pyramid . • The Colosseum in Rome . • India's Taj Mahal . Before the vote ended Friday, organizers said more than 90 million votes had been cast for 21 sites.  Watch the contenders and controversy surrounding the 'new' seven wonders » . Voting at the Web site, www.new7wonders.com, ended at 6 p.m. ET Friday. Traffic was so heavy Friday that the site was crashing at times. One message urged voters to use text messages as an alternative form of voting. ""Keep on voting, as it is your votes that decide the New 7 Wonders of the World,"" the message said. ""We have traffic that is simply off the scale,"" Tia Vering, spokeswoman for the ""New 7 Wonders of the World"" campaign, told CNN.com. ""Things are just going ballistic."" The new wonders were announced at a star-studded event Saturday in Lisbon, Portugal, that featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Chaka Khan. The event was hosted by Oscar winners Hilary Swank and Ben Kingsley as well as Bollywood star Bipasha Basu. Send CNN.com photos and video of your favorite ""wonder"" The top contenders for the seven wonders were last made public in early June. The oldest candidate was Britain's Stonehenge; the newest was Australia's Sydney Opera House. The U.S. Statue of Liberty also was among the choices. Voting nearly doubled after the June results, when organizers said about 50 million votes had been cast. A single user can cast multiple votes. To be considered for the competition, all structures had to be built or discovered before 2000. All are among top tourist attractions around the world. Of the seven ancient wonders of the world, only one remains standing today, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Some nations have enthusiastically endorsed the new wonders campaign. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Jordan's Queen Rania actively promoted their countries' hopefuls. But the new wonders campaign hasn't been universally recognized. The United Nations' cultural organization, UNESCO, issued a statement saying it has ""no link whatsoever"" to the vote. Egypt's top antiquities expert also objected to the list. He said Egypt's pyramids are a ""symbol of the genius of the ancient people"" -- and are above any sort of online poll. As a result, the organizers struck up a compromise. The pyramids have been assured honorary status, in addition to the new seven wonders. The new wonders project was the brainchild of Swiss businessman Bernard Weber. He said he wanted to invite the people of the world to take part in selecting the world's greatest wonders. ""So that everybody can decide what the new seven wonders should be and not some government, not some individuals, not some institutions,"" he said. Vering said she believes the vote has accomplished that goal. ""We've managed to bring culture out of the museum -- out of the dusty, dry academic corners -- and have people talk about it,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- What do Elvis, Kim Kardashian, the Jonas Brothers, Dilbert and teen vampires have in common? Calendars like this one featuring the movie ""Twilight"" are big sellers. They are all subjects of hot calendars. Be it pinned to the wall, tucked in a pocket or lounging on a desk, calendars have maintained popularity even as they face stiff competition from technology. While just about every cell phone or PDA allows users to keep track of those ever important events and appointments, calendars still seem to hold an allure for users day by day. ""We do not see technology-based calendars as the competition,"" said Robert Gilbreath, director of marketing for Calendars.com, one of the largest e-commerce sites for calendars on the Web. ""They do not evoke memories of past occurrences, experiences, and pleasures."" A cell phone calendar also can't give fans the opportunity to gaze upon 12 images of their favorite celebrity or object of desire in the comfort of their own home or office. Some of Calendars.com's most popular sellers include classic movie stars like Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne as well as today's hottest fan favorites like the cast of the movie ""Twilight."" Calendars featuring beautiful women who also happen to be celebrities are also always in demand such as those featuring ""Transformers"" actress Megan Fox, Hugh Hefner's former girlfriends, known as The Girls Next Door, and a perennial favorite -- the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Calendar. If sales are any indication, print calendars are still holding their own. ""We've seen double-digit annual growth in our e-commerce channel every year until the last one,"" said Paul Hoffman, chief operating officer of Calendar Holdings LLC, parent company of Calendars.com and Calendar Club retail stores. ""We are very optimistic about the future growth online."" Calendars have a long history as a part of American culture. Larry Krug, one of the founders of the Calendar Collectors Society, said calendars used to be must have collectors items when they were produced using the works of famous photographers and artists such as Norman Rockwell. Calendars still have their enthusiasts, Krug said, especially among those who are able to tie in calendars to an already existing passion, such as collecting Coca-Cola memorabilia. ""People collect different kinds of calendars,"" he said. ""There are wall calendars, desk calendars, pocket calendars, towel calendars and calendar plates. It's really a very broad and interesting area."" And while there are a multitude of calendars that can be found -- often in a kiosk at the mall where a savvy shopper knows the prices will drop after the first of the year -- there are some that start out as collectors' items even before they are produced. The Pirelli calendar, with its limited availability and artistic nude photos of some of the world's most beautiful models, has become a sought-after item known for its exclusivity. Gruppo Campari, the makers of spirits, wines and soft drinks, also produces a limited-edition calendar every year which is not for sale and has featured various starlets including Eva Mendes, Jessica Alba and Salma Hayek. Since 2000, the company has employed world-famous and emerging photographers to capture the images, which are designed to tell a story within the calendar. Chiara Bressani, head of Gruppo Campari's Communication, said the calendars are marketing works of art. ""The calendar is always trying to convey seduction and passion,"" Bressani said. ""It's a creative way of showing what Campari is."" She said the women chosen to appear in the calendars are selected because they convey the Campari values. The calendars have become very popular in Europe and the United States, Bressani said, despite the fact --or maybe because -- they are not easy to obtain. ""[The popularity] is growing every year,"" said Bressani, whose company has chosen Bond girl Olga Kurylenko to appear in the upcoming 2010 calendar. ""You can enjoy the pictures on the Web, but it's a different feeling when you have the calendar in your hands.""","Celebrity calendars still the rage among fans .

"(CNN) -- Senior Taliban official Maulvi Faqir Mohammad has named himself acting head of the Pakistani Taliban, a close relative of Mohammad and local Taliban spokesmen in Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas told CNN Wednesday. Baitullah Mehsud, right, and a bodyguard arrive at a meeting in South Waziristan, Pakistan, in 2004. Pakistani and U.S. officials believe that the group's leader, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan. Through his relative, however, Mohammad said that Mehsud is alive but ill and temporarily unable to perform his duties. Mohammad believes that he is in line to lead the group because he is a deputy of Mehsud's, the relative said. A year ago, Mohammad was falsely believed killed in a Pakistani airstrike, according to media reports at the time. The relative also said that Mohammad appointed Haji Muslim Khan as the group's spokesman. Khan is a former provincial Taliban spokesman in Swat. Pakistani officials announced Tuesday that two top figures in the Pakistani Taliban had been arrested. Saif Ullah is believed to have been Mehsud's right-hand man, and Maulvi Umar is the well-known spokesman for the militant group. Umar recently declared that Mehsud had not been killed in the drone strike on his father-in-law's house, but a senior Pakistani official said Umar had admitted under questioning that Mehsud was dead. The top U.S. envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, said the Pakistani Taliban have not confirmed his death because of an ongoing power struggle over his successor. Journalist Janummah Hashaimzada contributed to this report.","Group's leader is believed to have been killed in air attack this month .

"Parkersburg, West Virginia (CNN) -- At nearly $12.1 trillion, the U.S. national debt has reached a size that is incomprehensible to most people and as intangible as the '""Big Bang"" or bipartisanship. But it is real in West Virginia, where a small, nearly anonymous group of government accountants calculate the public debt to the penny each day, living a mathematic nightmare and number cruncher's dream. At a large desk in Parkersburg, Jaime Saling watches over roughly 6,500 pieces of data and trillions of dollars each day. Her title takes up a few characters itself: Saling is the debt accounting branch manager for the Bureau of Public Debt. She and a division of just 15 people quietly and relentlessly work to account for every penny of the national debt. It is tedious and potentially overwhelming work, but Saling acts as if she flies jet fighters. ""I get very excited,"" the petite and energetic Saling says, ""They call me a nerd, several times; I think it's because I get very excited about all the work we do."" That work happens in a simple one-story, brick building in Parkersburg, some 300 miles from Washington. The public debt offices landed there thanks to heavyweight home-state Sen. Robert Byrd. The bureau's offices are tucked into a corner of town that's easy to miss. A brown hill and train track sit on one side, parking lots for county offices on the other. The locale is still a surprise to some. ""Every now and then we get a comment, 'Where are you? Parkersburg?'"" Saling says. The public debt building has become a number nerds' paradise. Employees say they balance their checkbooks at least weekly, some daily. A big happy-face sign marks progress on a recent audit. A written goal is taped to a Nerf-sized football. And the security guards brag that someone brings in a cake about every other day. Inside, Saling's office is pin-neat, but her computer screen is cramped. A full-screen photo of Saling's 4- and 5-year-old children is covered by dozens of icons for spreadsheets and documents, so that glimpses of bright blonde hair poke out from under a field of white data squares. ""I need to clean it out right now,"" Saling says with a shrug, then laughs. She then calls up the brain of the debt-management system, a software program called PARS, or Public debt Accounting and Reporting System. The acronym is a pun only an accountant would love. ""Par value"" means ""stated value"" in the field. PARS is a custom program, designed in the early '90s to check and double-check the constant buying and selling of U.S. debt. Thanks in part to the debt software, what used to take 100 people a month to compute now is done by 15 people in a day. Even so, the program looks like it's from another time, with a black screen and neon-colored letters that recall computer monitors of the ""War Games"" era. ""It is outdated,"" Saling says of the font. But she insists the program itself still operates well. Annual government reviews of PARS back that up. And the division overall has a remarkable record of 13 straight years of unqualified audits, the accounting gold standard of accuracy. That brings a massive smile to Saling's face; you see how someone so enthusiastic can be called a nerd. ""Things like that make me very excited."" (Her favorite report, by the way, is the ""schedules of public debt"".) Each day, to check the funds flowing in and out of the public debt, Saling types in five-digit codes into PARS and checks a slew of accounts. She knows about 50 of those codes by heart. In general, there is a scale to this work that would disrupt most minds. ""Most people don't have a sense of it until they come here and see it,"" said accounting director Mike Linder, who is Saling's boss. ""Most calculators don't handle what we do."" And almost no one sees the debt as they do. ""A lot of people, I don't think realize what the debt's made of,"" Saling put forth. ""In that $12 trillion you have both debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings."" In other words, the debt held by those outside the government and debt the government owes to itself, such as money borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund. At the end of November, $7.7 trillion was debt held by the public and $4.4 trillion was intragovernmental holdings. Saling sees a heartbeat in the numbers. ""It's actually helping us operate government."" And never has government been larger. But Saling and these accountants of the people are careful on that note. ""It's not that we're saying this is the right thing to do,"" she states matter-of-factly. ""A lot of times we're saying, 'If they pass this, how are we going to account for it?' A lot of times that takes a lot of meetings."" Saling is right, in the age of deficits and debt, all of that literally keeps government operating. Yet those trillions of dollars are overseen by a small division that works without contractors and is content with a software system that may look clunky, but which they insist works more than well. There is an irony here. These self-proclaimed nerds oversee the very symbol of big government but exude sobriety and restraint. Saling and her staff are nearly anonymous but deeply significant. And they are more than happy that way.","In West Virginia, a small group of accountants calculate the public debt to the penny each day .

"(CNN) -- A man described as a former employee shot and killed two people and seriously wounded another at a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, construction company before workers wrestled him to the ground, sheriff's officials said. Dianna Tullier, 44, of Walker, Louisiana, and Cheryl D. Boykin, 55, of Denham Springs, Louisiana were pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. They were both clerical workers in the construction office. The suspect, identified as Richard Matthews, 53, of Slaughter, Louisiana, parked outside Grady Crawford Construction Co. shortly before 2 p.m. and entered a building, where he shot a female dispatcher, said Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Casey Rayborn Hicks. Hicks said Matthews then went into a second company building and killed two people inside. Matthews left the second building to reload his weapon, Hicks said. He re-entered that building, shot at and missed a fourth person, Hicks said. Four people then wrestled Matthews to the ground. One of them, a foreman at the construction company, put his finger between Matthews' finger and the trigger guard of Matthews' gun, stopping the gunman from shooting, Hicks said. The four people held Matthews down until police arrived. Matthews was transported to the sheriff's office in downtown Baton Rouge, Hicks said, and was being questioned. Hicks said police are uncertain if Matthews has prior arrests, mental health or substance abuse issues. Matthews will be booked on two counts of first degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, Hicks said. As he was escorted in for questioning, in response to a reporter's question about the shooting, the Matthews replied numerous times: ""I couldn't get my unemployment, they wouldn't give me my unemployment.""

"New York (CNN) -- He was a cold, calculating, ""morally depraved"" man who spent the last years of his socialite and megaphilanthropist mother's life bilking her fortune to line his pockets. That's one way to see Anthony Marshall -- and it's the only way, according to the prosecutors who secured a conviction against him for grand larceny and scheming to defraud his mother, Brooke Astor. Now as the 85-year-old son prepares to be sentenced Monday for his crimes, another portrait of him has emerged -- thanks to close friends and celebrity acquaintances (including Al Roker and Whoopi Goldberg) who sent letters to the court in hopes of saving him from a lengthy prison sentence. The man prosecutors described during the trial is apparently unrecognizable to many of Marshall's friends and acquaintances. He was a loyal, churchgoing man, a Purple Heart recipient wounded in Iwo Jima during World War II and a son who tried mightily but could never live up to the high ideals of his socialite mother, according to letters friends submitted to the court. And now, they say he is a frail and sickly man who has faced extreme humiliation and would essentially be given a death sentence if a judge hands down the maximum sentence allowed. It will be up to Judge A. Kirke Bartley Jr. to decide how to reconcile the two portraits of Tony Marshall. He faces a minimum one to three years, or as much as eight to 25 years in state prison. The drastically differing views have only further heightened interest in the case, which during the trial stage was a tabloid feeding frenzy, fostering headlines such as ""Bad heir day,"" ""Mrs. Astor's disaster"" and ""DA's kick in the Astor."" The witness list was a virtual ""Who's Who"" of New York's social elite -- including Henry Kissinger, Graydon Carter, Barbara Walters, Vartan Gregorian and Annette de la Renta. During the case, prosecutors and witnesses portrayed Marshall as an only son preying on his physically and mentally ill 101-year-old mother. Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann called the case ""disturbing,"" and said the trial told the story of ""how a son, an only son, would stoop so low to steal from his own mother in the sunset years of her life in order to line his own pockets and the pockets of his wife."" His only goal, they said, was to selfishly tap her fortune -- money that prosecutors said Astor intended to donate to ordinary New Yorkers who needed help after she died. He was convicted of the most serious charges against him -- first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud. One of the most serious convictions involved Marshall giving himself a $1 million-a-year raise for handling his mother's affairs, Seidemann said. During trial testimony, Marshall's lawyers called no character witnesses to come to his defense. So the new letters from friends are the first attempts by those who know him to share what they believe is his true character. Whoopi Goldberg told a judge in her letter that she met Tony Marshall and his wife, Charlene, 10 years ago when Goldberg moved into a building on the Upper East Side with Frank Langella. Unlike other residents who turned their nose up at her, Goldberg said she became quick friends with the Marshalls. Her interactions with Tony, she wrote, gave her an insight into his relationship with his mother, and in turn taught her about how fame can affect family dynamics. ""I also understand what it must be like for my own daughter to be around my fame,"" she wrote. ""I am not comparing myself to Mrs. Astor, but I've seen how you can be dismissed as not being good enough, or hip enough, and seeing it happen to Tony made me make sure that it didn't happen to my own daughter."" The humiliation and ugliness of the trial was punishment enough and a prison sentence would be unjust, friends argued in the letters. Marshall's cardiologist, Kenneth W. Franklin, also wrote to urge the judge to consider his age and health in sentencing. A prison sentence ""will accelerate his deterioration from cardiac and neurologic disease and would result in his premature death due to medical complications,"" he wrote. NBC's ""Today"" show weatherman Al Roker came to Marshall's defense too, having met him at his church 10 years ago. He argued Marshall had suffered enough, paying a price greater than any sentence a judge could hand down -- seeing his son turn on him during the trial and being portrayed in a negative light each day. ""Given his advanced age and deteriorating health, justice may be better served by turning a compassionate eye towards this good son, father and patriot and finding it in your heart not to add 'prisoner' to Anthony Marshall's otherwise unblemished resume,"" Roker wrote in his letter to the court. Goldberg too, believed ""breaking this man"" by putting him in prison, was not the right punishment. ""Please don't put him in jail,"" she writes at the end of her letter. ""It would only amount to an unnecessary cruelty that would serve no real purpose. Hasn't Tony been through enough?"" CNN's Beth Karas and Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Whoopi Goldberg, Al Roker among those asking for a compassionate sentence .

"(CNN) -- An anti-abortion activist charged with gunning down a Wichita, Kansas, doctor cannot use the ""necessity defense"" at trial, a judge ruled Tuesday. Scott Roeder, 51, is set to stand trial January 11 on one count of first-degree murder in the death of Dr. George Tiller, who was shot to death at his church May 31. Tiller ran a women's clinic in which he performed abortions. Tiller, 67, was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions. He had already survived one attempt on his life before he was slain. Under a necessity defense, a defendant argues an action was justified because breaking the law was more advantageous to society than following it. Several anti-abortion activists facing criminal charges have attempted to use the defense but none has been successful. In an Associated Press interview last month, Roeder admitted killing Tiller and said he plans to argue at this trial that the shooting was justified. ""Because of the fact preborn children's lives were in imminent danger, this was the action I chose,"" he said. ""... I want to make sure that the focus is, of course, obviously on the preborn children and the necessity to defend them."" Roeder's comments prompted prosecutors to file a motion asking Sedgwick County Judge Warren Wilbert to bar Roeder's attorneys from using the defense. Wilbert noted that the Kansas Supreme Court, in a previous case regarding blocking entrance to an abortion clinic, ruled the necessity defense cannot be used when the harm the defendant claims to be avoiding through his or her actions is a constitutional and legal activity, and the defendant broke the law. That precedent, Wilbert said, required him to rule that the necessity defense is not a viable defense in Kansas or in the Roeder case. Defense attorney Mark Rudy pointed out to Wilbert that the defense team has not yet acknowledged what their tactic might be. Roeder, however, filed a 100-page motion on his own behalf, Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said Tuesday, on the necessity defense, acknowledging it previously has been unsuccessful. Prosecutors also asked Wilbert to bar Roeder's attorneys from claiming his alleged actions were justified because he used force in the defense of another -- the unborn. Wilbert said that would require further argument -- particularly an offering from defense attorneys regarding the evidence they plan to present in support of that premise at trial. ""I will leave the door open on the issues surrounding use of force in defense of another,"" the judge said, adding he does not mean it's ""wide open."" Under the law, such a defense can only be used if a defendant was preventing unlawful conduct. Foulston argued that Tiller posed no threat that would justify his shooting. ""Dr. Tiller was not an aggressor,"" she said. Roeder is also charged with two counts of aggravated assault for threatening two church members. Dressed in a coat and tie, he conferred with his attorneys and listened intently to the arguments on Tuesday. In a June interview with CNN's Ted Rowlands, Roeder would not admit that he killed Tiller, but said that if he is convicted, ""the entire motive was the defense of the unborn."" Roeder's attorneys also argued Tuesday that the trial should be moved outside Wichita because extensive pretrial publicity in the case could have tainted the jury pool. Foulston, meanwhile, noted that Roeder, who has talked often to the media, brought some of that publicity on himself. Wilbert said 300 jury summonses have gone out in the case, and he was optimistic that some impartial jurors could be found. However, he said he would revisit the issue later if the court experienced difficulty in picking jurors. Rudy also asked that the judge prohibit prosecutors from excluding potential jurors because they have anti-abortion beliefs. The judge said he was confident that some individuals who are anti-abortion would still be able to make an impartial decision, but suggested the issue be examined on a juror-by-juror basis if the court recognizes a pattern of exclusion during jury selection. ""I can't make a pretrial ruling and just make a broad-brush approach,"" he said.","Scott Roeder is accused of first-degree murder in the death of Dr. George Tiller .

"London, England (CNN) -- Formula 1 will continue to take place in Britain for the next 17 years after a deal was struck between Silverstone's owners and the sport's chief Bernie Ecclestone. Monday's announcement by the track's owners means the oldest venue on the F1 calendar keeps its place. Silverstone's comeback took place despite rival track Donington Park being awarded the contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010. However, that circuit lost out after failing to secure the $200 million needed to fund redevelopment plans. That had led to fears Ecclestone would look to move the race abroad. Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips told the Press Association: ""We've always had five-year deals and never been able to get the investment we needed to redevelop. ""But 17 years gives us the ability to invest and move forward. We've always had the belief the British Grand Prix was an important cornerstone of Formula One but, with Bernie, you're never quite sure. Phillips described the deal as ""peace in our time"" between the circuit's owners, the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC), and Ecclestone. ""The relationship with Formula One Management has been improving,"" added Phillips. ""There's a good working relationship with him now and we don't have any issues."" Applauding the negotiating team, BRDC president and 1996 F1 world champion Damon Hill told the Press Association: ""It's not easy to enter into an agreement of this magnitude. It's a big commitment. ""But the BRDC felt we wanted this relationship to continue, and we were prepared to back the negotiating team, with the level of risk satisfactory for the deal to go ahead. ""This announcement is tremendous news. It really does cement Silverstone as a motor sport venue and is incredibly satisfying for the BRDC to cement its relationship with F1.""","Formula 1 will continue in Britain after deal between Silverstone and sport's chief Bernie Ecclestone .

Runners take part in the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain on July 9. The death would be the first in the running of the bulls since a 22-year-old American was gored to death in 1995. The latest victim was a Spanish man, Daniel Jimeno Romero, age 27, from the Madrid area who was vacationing in Pamplona with his family, CNN partner station CNN+ reported from the hospital, where authorities identified him. He was rushed to the hospital in cardiac arrest and underwent surgery but died soon after, said the statement from the regional government, whose capital is Pamplona.  Watch man try to scramble away from bull » . Amateur video footage showed the victim falling to the ground toward the end of race, just before the entrance to the bullring, and apparently being gored in the neck. Three other runners were gored and suffered less serious injuries on Friday, and six others went to the hospital with bruises or other injuries, the Navarra government said. Emergency workers and ambulances line the route to quickly attend those who fall. Do you think this tradition should be banned? The run in Pamplona started 400 years ago and became popular worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in the 1920s in his book ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title ""Fiesta."" The event is held July 7-14. Six bulls and a pack of tame steers run from the corrals, through Pamplona's old town, to the bullring -- where the bulls will die later in the day in a bullfight. Including the recent death, 14 people have been killed in the runs since 1924, when record-keeping began.","Victim was a 27-year-old Spanish man from the Madrid area .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new witness in the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann has told investigators he talked with a ""Victoria Beckham look-a-like"" who may have revealed clues about the girl's fate, a family spokesman said Thursday. Sketch shows woman who may hold new clues to disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Investigators would not release what was said in the conversation but the clues have led police to try to find the woman. Madeleine vanished from the family's holiday villa at the Portuguese beach resort of Praia da Luz in May 2007 as her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, dined in a nearby restaurant. She was 3 years old at the time. The suspicious woman was seen outside a bar in Barcelona, Spain, by partygoers on May 7, 2007, and the new witness had a conversation with this woman, said McCann family spokesman Clarence Mitchell.  Watch McCann spokesman describe new lead » . Authorities released a sketch of the person, described as a woman who spoke with an Australian accent and who could also speak fluent Spanish. Former detective inspector Dave Edgar, who was hired by the McCann family, called the new witness a significant movement in the case. Edgar would not say why the witness waited so long to come forward, stating only it was personal reasons. Mitchell described the woman they are looking for as similar in appearance to the former Spice Girl singer and wife of soccer star David Beckham. She was described as in her 30s and about 5 feet 2 inches tall. Madeleine's parents have garnered international support in an effort to find their daughter, enlisting the aid of celebrities and even Pope Benedict XVI. At one point, authorities in Portugal had named the girl's parents as suspects, along with a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor's office said in July 2008 that authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them suspects. Portuguese investigators closed the case in July 2008.","Investigators would not release specific details of new clues .

"Hamid Dabashi is the author of ""Iran: A People Interrupted."" He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York. His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/ . Hamid Dabashi says it's wrong to view the conflict in Iran as a battle of the middle class vs. the poor. (CNN) --   In a short essay that Abbas Amanat, a scholar of 19th-century Iran at Yale University, was asked to write for The New York Times on the current crisis in Iran, he asserted that what we are witnessing is ""the rise of a new middle class whose demands stand in contrast to the radicalism of the incumbent President [Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad and the core conservative values of the clerical elite, which no doubt has the backing of a religiously conservative sector of the population."" This learned position of a leading scholar very much sums up the common wisdom that Iranian expatriate academics are offering an excited public mesmerized by the massive demonstrations they witness on their television sets or computer screens and eager to have someone make sense of them. In part because of these hurried interpretations, the movement that is unfolding in front of our eyes is seen as basically a middle-class uprising against a retrograde theocracy that is banking on backward, conservative and uneducated masses who do not know any better. While the illiterate and ""uncouth"" masses provide the populist basis of Ahmadinejad's support, the middle class is demanding an open-market civil society. Highly educated, pro-Western and progressive Iranians are thus placed on Mir Hossein Moussavi's side, while backward villagers and urban poor are on Ahmadinejad's. The fact that in North America and Western Europe, usually unveiled and fluently English-speaking women are brought to speak on behalf of the women demonstrators further intensifies the impression that if women are veiled or do not speak English fluently then they must be Ahmadinejad supporters. This is a deeply false dichotomy that projects a flawed picture to the outside world. It is predicated on the spin that a very limited pool of expatriate academics are putting on a movement that is quite extraordinary in Iranian political culture, one whose full dimensions have yet to be unpacked. The fact is that given the structural limitations of a nascent democracy that is being crushed and buried in Iran under a particular interpretation of a Shiite juridical citadel, opposition to Ahmadinejad is fractured into the followers of three candidates with deeply divided economic programs and political positions. Moussavi is universally known as a hard-core socialist in his economic platform and a social reformist in his politics. Mehdi Karrubi is far to Moussavi's right in his economic neo-liberalism and social conservatism. Mohsen Rezaie, meanwhile, is even more to the right of Karrubi in his social conservatism but to his left in his economic platform. What above all challenges the reading of this event as a middle-class revolt against ""uncouth radicalism"" is a crucial statistic that professor Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, one of the most reliable Iranian economists in the U.S., provides in the same set of responses that The New York Times solicited from experts. ""Young people ages 15-29,"" Salehi-Isfahani reports, ""make up 35 percent of the population but account for 70 percent of the unemployed."" The overwhelming majority of the people pouring into streets of Tehran and other major cities in support of Moussavi are precisely these 15- to 29-year-olds. How could this then be a middle-class uprising if the overwhelming majority of those who are supporting it and putting their lives on the line are in fact jobless 15- to 29-year-olds who still live with their parents -- who cannot even afford to rent an apartment, let alone marry and raise a family and join the middle class in a principally oil-based economy that is not labor-intensive to begin with? Another crucial statistic that Salehi-Isfahani does not cite is the fact that more than 63 percent of university entrants in Iran are women, but only 12 percent are part of the labor force. That means that the remaining 51 percent are out of a job, and yet the most visible aspect of these anti-Ahmadinejad demonstrations is that women visibly outnumber men. How could jobless men and women be participating in a massive middle-class uprising against their ""uncouth"" leaders? If we were to look closely at Moussavi's campaign commercials, his social and economic platforms since he entered the race, and the presidential debates with all the other candidates, we see that a sizable component of his supporters are indeed university students, young faculty and the urban intellectual elite --such as filmmakers, artists and the literati. But the fact is that a major constituency of Moussavi is also the urban poor and particularly the war veterans who have no respect for Ahmadinejad, believing he had an inglorious war record, but are full of unsurpassed admiration for Moussavi because of his role as a fiercely dedicated prime minister during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988). Conversely, there is a significant segment of the traditional middle class, the bazaaris, that is in fact the beneficiaries of Ahmadinejad's economic policies of governmentally subsidized commodities and services, and thus supports him. As for the ""uncouth"" among the Iranian peasantry, Eric Hooglund, a senior scholar of Iran with decades of experience in rural areas, has recently said that when he hears reports that Ahmadinejad's support base is rural, he is left quite baffled. ""Is it possible that rural Iran,"" he asks pointedly, ""where less than 35 percent of the country's population lives, provided Ahmadinejad the 63 percent of the vote he claims to have won? That would contradict my own research in Iran's villages over the past 30 years, including just recently."" The fact is that we really don't know how this uprising is going to pan out, and yet we seem to be in too much of a rush to assimilate it backward to inherited assumptions that may have lost their validity in face of this new reality. I am convinced that we are witness to something quite extraordinary, perhaps even a social revolution that is overriding its economic roots. Although there are many similarities, this is a much different event than the 1977-1979 Islamic Revolution. I am not sure that this movement either sees itself as a revolution or will actually transmute into one. Given the brutality it faces, it has no choice but opt for a nonviolent civil disobedience route. The age of ideological warfare is over in Iran. If anything, this momentum is the closest event in Iran to the civil rights movement of the 1960s in the United States, and precisely like that movement, its economic dimensions are couched in social demands. We need to adjust our lenses and languages in order to see better, and there is no better adjustment than just cautiously, hopefully and responsibly watching what is unfolding in front of us and reading it accordingly. This movement is ahead of our inherited politics, floating ideologies or mismatched theories. We need to sit back, hope for the best and let this inspirational movement of a whole new generation of hope teach us courage and humility.

"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as president January 20, there will be music -- by, among others, Aretha Franklin, Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman and the U.S. Marine Band. There will be prayers and speeches -- including Obama's inaugural address. And for the fourth time in the nation's 56 inauguration ceremonies, there will be poetry -- by someone far less well-known. Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle. After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion. Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama's. She joins three other poets who have read at inaugural ceremonies -- Robert Frost in 1961 for John F. Kennedy's inauguration and Maya Angelou and Miller Williams, who read at Bill Clinton's 1993 and 1997 inaugurations. Alexander has written five books of poetry, including ""American Sublime,"" a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005. Her father is Clifford Alexander, secretary of the Army in the Carter administration, and her mother teaches history at George Washington University. Her brother is an adviser to Obama's transition team. Alexander's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from ""American Sublime"" (Graywolf Press): . Poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner, . overhear on the bus, God / in the details, the only way . to get from here to there. / Poetry (and now my voice is rising) is not all love, love, love, / and I'm sorry the dog died. Poetry (here I hear myself loudest) / is the human voice, . and are we not of interest to each other? Alexander spoke Friday to CNN.com. CNN: What do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this? Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle. CNN: You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago? Alexander: In the community in Hyde Park, he and Mrs. Obama were just people I'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about, and we were of a generation. ... He was in the law school, and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work didn't really cross so much. ... [We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community. CNN: And you did it by writing? Alexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years. CNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you? Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, ""Isn't that something?"" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, ""I never thought I'd live to see this day."" The fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us. CNN: What's ahead of us? Alexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ... The larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better. CNN: Can poetry help in that regard? Alexander: I do believe that it can. The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful, because after all if we can't be precise with language, how can we share ideas? Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions. You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem, but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it, those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems. CNN: So you're going to write a poem about health care? Alexander: That would be fun. Of course, this [poem for the inauguration] is an occasional poem, it has to serve the moment, it has to serve the day, right? So those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day. But of course, what I hope to do, rather than the laundry list poem, is to find language that will hopefully have a little resonance after the day is done. CNN: Will you show it to anybody before you read it? Alexander: I show it to my husband [artist Ficre Ghebreyesus] , and he is my first, last and best critic. CNN: You wrote an essay about Gwendolyn Brooks [the Pulitzer Prize-winning African-American poet] in which you said that ""the pressure on creative work can be intense for artists who belong to groups still struggling for their fair shake in society."" And then later on you said you've seen your work ""overpraised by narrow-minded white critics"" and ""criticized small-mindedly by more than one black woman elder poet -- the same poets I imagined would be pleased by it."" Your work is read very differently depending on who's reading it? Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received. ... On the one hand, I have devoted much of my work to African-American culture. That's my group, that's who I am, [I'm] proud and unambiguous about that -- but at the same time, one of the really great discoveries of a life in poetry has been that poetry is quirky. It reaches people unexpectedly. You really, really can't predict who is going to connect with various aspects of your work. That's been a real gift to me; it's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work. CNN: You have two children? Alexander: Two sons, 9 and 10. CNN: How do they feel about the poem? Alexander: They are so excited, and that's of course a lovely thing. And in the excitement, we still live in our every day, so mommy is still mommy, and all the mommy things are expected of me, and that's the way I like it. CNN: What are your tastes in music? Alexander: Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most, and I mean jazz across the board because that's an incredibly diverse art, and also I must say, R&B, funk and soul speak very powerfully to me. CNN: Favorite artists? Alexander: Thelonious Monk is quite a favorite artist. Marvin Gaye, John Coltrane, and also the breadth and accomplishment over a career of Duke Ellington. CNN: And Aretha Franklin? Alexander: Can you imagine? I get to hear her at close range. Boy, that's going to be my gift for the year.","Elizabeth Alexander will be fourth poet to read at an inauguration .

"(CNN)  -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was once a student revolutionary himself, perhaps not much different from the thousands of protesters who this week have taken to the streets in Iran. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei became a political activist while a religious scholar studying under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . Khamenei became a political activist while a religious scholar studying under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, among others, according to his biography on his official Web site. He was part of a circle of clerics who opposed the rule of the shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, and was jailed by the shah's secret police, the Savak, at least six times in the 1960s and 1970s. He says he was tortured in prison before being exiled in 1976, three years before the revolution that deposed the shah. Khomeini was in exile in Paris, France, when the shah fled Iran in 1979. He appointed Khamenei to represent him on an Islamic Revolutionary Council, alongside other key figures such as Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. The appointment may have been a career-making moment for Khamenei, who was a fairly low-level scholar at the time, said Iran analyst Shireen Hunter, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University in Washington. Learn more about Iran's recent history . ""He is not qualified to be an ayatollah,"" or top-ranking Islamic scholar, she said, saying he had picked up the title by dint of succeeding Khomeini as supreme leader, ""like an honorary doctorate."" Khamenei, now 70, was briefly minister of defense and head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards in the early 1980s before becoming president, a post he held from 1982 to 1990. In power, he clashed ideologically with Rafsanjani, favoring a more left-wing politics than Rafsanjani, who came from a more bourgeois background than the poor Khamenei. He also locked horns with the man who was prime minister when he was president -- Mir Hossein Moussavi, now the most prominent opposition leader. The two had similar anti-American, left-wing politics but struggled over power in what Hunter called ""the two-headed monster"" that was then the Iranian political structure. ""There were turf battles between the president and the prime minister,"" she said. Khomeini died in 1989, and Khamenei was appointed the next supreme leader. The post of prime minister was abolished. Rafsanjani seems to have been a ""kingmaker"" in the elevation of Khamenei to the top job, Hunter said, perhaps thinking he would be the power behind the throne. But with time, Khamenei has become his own man, she said. Rafsanjani was president in the 1990s, but lost a comeback attempt in 2005 -- defeated by current President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As supreme leader, Khamenei is the ultimate arbiter of policy in Iran. He appoints the Guardian Council, the country's election authority. He also appoints key posts in the intelligence services and the armed forces, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard. Additionally, he confirms the president's election. In theory, the supreme leader is appointed by a body of clerics whom voters elect. But in practice, this body -- the Assembly of Experts -- has answered to the supreme leader. Khamenei's authority has been challenged at times. Nearly half the members of Iran's parliament criticized him openly in 2004 for ordering general elections to go ahead despite a widespread belief that they would not be free or fair. The elections took place as scheduled. Khamenei supports the country's controversial nuclear program, and when President Obama reached out directly to the people of Iran with a video message, it was Khamenei who responded. Khamenei said in March he saw no change in U.S. policy toward Iran despite Obama's promise of a ""new beginning."" He said a change in rhetoric was not enough, and Washington must practice what it preaches, according to the English-language Press TV channel in Iran. He hailed the disputed Iranian presidential election as ""a miracle"" for the record turnout, but that very public enthusiasm for the election may signal a shift that Khamenei failed to anticipate. ""He has now very much become his own man, but the country has changed,"" Hunter said. ""Look at the women's situation. They make a big deal out of saying how many women they have educated. That is true, but then you cannot expect them to keep doing things the same way.""","Post on Islamic Revolutionary Council may have been career-making .

"DIR VALLEY, Pakistan (CNN) -- The rugged beauty of the expansive Dir Valley can mask the detail of what is happening on the ground. Pakistani soldiers look on from a mountain during a patrol in the troubled area of Maidan. In June, the Pakistani military organized a media tour to areas of the Lower Dir in North West Frontier Province that were under their control. The town of Maidan had been at the center of fierce fighting between Pakistan's military forces and militants. Tension was visible on the faces of those escorting us. The IED (improvised explosive device) craters in the road and the bullet holes in our unarmed pickup trucks explained why. The direct fighting had stopped some days before, after opposition forces were reported killed or they disappeared into the surrounding hills and among the population. Under the watchful eye of government forces, anxious local residents were starting to return. A Pakistani army spokesperson now tells us that all of those who fled the town due to the fighting have returned home. They have a lot of rebuilding to do. Most of the structures we saw had some kind of damage to them from bullets or direct hits from artillery fire. One person who will likely not be returning anytime soon is the pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Muhammad, who brokered a short-lived deal between the Taliban and the government that allowed the Taliban to enforce Sharia law in the Swat Valley. But the deal collapsed and the government set off this offensive. Sufi Muhammad was arrested in Peshawar in late July, accused of encouraging violence. His ransacked house was the last stop on our tour.","The beautiful Dir Valley has been the scene of ferocious fighting against the Taliban .

"(CNN)  -- For almost a week, tens of thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in daily protests -- handkerchiefs shielding their faces from the pungency of tear gas, fists punching the air, and chants of ""Down with the dictator"" echoing against buildings. Moussovi supporters rally Wednesday in Tehran, Iran. Released by Fars News Agency of Iran. The massive outpouring is a result of a disputed presidential election that the protesters think coronated the incumbent hard-liner, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, over their candidate, Mir Hossain Moussavi. Context can help put their grievances into perspective: . Q. The Iran that we know today is the result of the Islamic Revolution. What is it? A. The Islamic Revolution is the name given to the Iranian revolution of 1979, when the ruling U.S.-supported monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile.  See timeline of recent Iranian history » . The country held a national referendum to become an Islamic republic and approve a new constitution. The constitution was a hybrid of democracy and unelected religious leadership. It appointed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini -- the leader of the revolution -- the supreme leader of the country. Before he died in 1989, he made it known that he wanted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to succeed him. Q. Is it true that the ultimate power in Iran lies with Khamenei? A. Yes. The supreme leader has the final say in all important matters of the country, such as ties with foreign nations or Iran's nuclear aspirations. He appoints the Guardian Council -- the country's election authority. He also appoints key posts in the intelligence services and the armed forces, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard. Additionally, he confirms the president's election. In theory, the supreme leader is appointed by a body of clerics whom voters elect. But in practice, this body -- the Assembly of Experts -- has answered to the supreme leader. Khamenei, 70, was appointed supreme leader for life in 1989. Q. What is the Guardian Council, which has been in the news, saying it will recount some of the votes in the disputed election? A. The unelected Guardian Council is the second-most influential body in Iran politics. It consists of six theologians whom the supreme leader picks and six jurists nominated by the judiciary and approved by parliament. The council approves all candidates running for office in the country, and verifies election results. It vetoes bills passed by the parliament if they do not conform to the constitution and Islamic law. In the present crisis, opposition leader Moussavi has had to take his grievance to the Guardian Council. It has agreed to some vote recounts.  See galleries of protests in Iran » . Q. So, how much power does the president wield? A. It depends on how nicely he plays with the Guardian Council. The president is elected by direct vote to a four-year term, for a maximum of two terms. He is responsible for economic policy and social programs, but most of the larger decisions are made by the supreme leader. In theory, his powers are second to the supreme leader's. But in practice, he is often hamstrung by the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council has worked with hard-liner Ahmadinejad, a 53-year-old former mayor of Tehran who was elected in 2005. But it thwarted reform attempts by his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami. Q. What is the Revolutionary Guard, who said they will take legal action against pro-Moussavi Web sites? A. The guard was initially created to protect the leaders of the revolution. But over the years, it has broadened its scope. Today, it is directly under the control of the supreme leader and enforces the governments' Islamic codes and morality . With more than 200,000 members, it is tasked with overseeing the country's crucial interests, including guarding its oil fields and missile arsenals. Q. What is the Basij, who are said to be behind most of the violence against opposition supporters? A. The Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force that takes orders from the Revolutionary Guard. It plays the role of de facto morality police and is often summoned to crack down on protests. It is unknown how large the force is, though estimates are in the millions. Q. What evidence is there of ballot fraud? A. There are no concrete examples of fraud, because independent monitors did not oversee polling in Iran, but the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. The government had initially said it would take three days to verify the ballots after Election Day on June 12. But the election authority proclaimed Ahmadinejad the winner two hours after the polls closed. At the same time, the interior ministry said that 85 percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters had cast ballots -- a record turnout. To many, so many ballots could not have been hand-counted in such a short time. Also, the published results showed that Ahmadinejad won even in his opponents' strongholds, including Moussavi's hometown of ethnic Azeri Turks. ""This is the equivalent of Barack Obama losing the African-American vote to John McCain in 2008,"" said Karim Sajadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Furthermore, Moussavi went into the election with massive support from the country's youth, who were unhappy with the faltering economy and an unemployment rate that tops 30 percent by some accounts. The youth make up 60 percent of Iran's population of 70 million. Q. Is it true that Ahmadinejad still enjoys widespread support? A. Yes. Ahmadinejad is popular across Iran's rural areas and among the Basij militia. He presents himself as a populist and a fighter. He has paid attention to the families of the bloody Iran-Iraq war, offering special preferences to veterans' children in university admissions. As president, his hardline approach has won him support among the Guardian Council. He has earned a reputation internationally as a fundamentalist for his Holocaust denials, calls to annihilate Israel, and cat-and-mouse games with the United States and the United Nations over Iran's nuclear activities. Many in the establishment view him as someone who does not cower to big-footing by the West. Q. Why, then, do some analysts think the vote was manipulated? A. Some experts say that even if it is likely that Ahmadinejad won the election, it is unlikely he could have won by the margin the government is claiming -- 62.63 percent of the vote. Time magazine's Joe Klein explains it this way: ""It is entirely possible that Ahmadinejad would have won anyway, but narrowly, perhaps with less than 50 percent of the vote, setting up a runoff election he might have lost as the other candidates united against him. It is possible that his government, perhaps acting in concert with supreme leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, decided to take no chances."" Q. Why is Iran's population so young? A. After the revolution, the leaders encouraged early marriage and large families, rewarding families with cars and television sets for each additional child. During the country's devastating eight-year war with Iraq, which began in 1980, the regime continued encouraging population growth, because more children meant more future soldiers. It is those children who are now coming of age. Q. Why did Iran summon Switzerland's ambassador to complain about perceived U.S. involvement in Iran's election process? A. The United States cut diplomatic ties with Iran following the hostage crisis in 1979, when students in support of the Islamic Revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days. Q. Is this movement a challenge to the Islamic republic? A. The demonstrators say their demand is simple: Hold fresh elections. They say they are not out to challenge the Islamic regime.  Watch protests Wednesday in Tehran » . Furthermore, Moussavi is an unlikely man for the job. Though the 67-year-old former prime minister is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during the Iran-Iraq war, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a ""firm radical."" He, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of the American hostages in 1979. He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents. And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use. The protests have exposed a fissure in the country, however, with tens of thousands of Ahmadinejad backers taking to the streets in a show of force of their own. Q. Are the current protests likely to continue? A. For now, the government seems to be allowing the populace to vent pent-up frustrations. But it also is gradually cracking down, such as blocking Web sites and banning international journalists from filming the rallies. The demonstrations have so far been focused on urban areas. Should the populace in rural areas take up the call for reform, the government might step in quickly to quash the protests, analysts say.  See map of demonstration sites in Tehran » . Q. Is this the first time Iranians have risen up in mass protests against the regime? A. No. Iran has twice seen public calls for reform in recent years: in 1999, after the closing of a reformist newspaper, and after parliamentary elections in 2000. On both occasions, the Revolutionary Guard descended on the streets after a few days and crushed the movements. Q. So, can true reform come to Iran? A. It is possible. Ahmadinejad's predecessor, Khatami, was elected president in 1997 by a landslide, despite being a reformer. During his two terms, he championed freedom of expression, tried to mend diplomatic relations, and supported a free market. He was, however, hamstrung at every step by stiff resistance from the supreme leader and the Guardian Council.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A former Iranian presidential candidate is calling on one of the Islamic republic's most powerful clerics to approve a special committee to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections. Mehdi Karrubi says an ""impartial committee"" is needed to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees. In an open letter to Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani posted Saturday on his party's Web site, reformist Mehdi Karrubi says an ""impartial committee"" is needed to ""investigate these tragedies with transparency until they are resolved."" He said he is willing to lead the investigation in a ""truthful, unbiased fashion."" The letter is dated July 29 and was posted on the Karrubi's Eetemade-Melli (National Trust) party's Web site, called Saham News. The Web site said the letter was posted after Rafsanjani failed to respond. The treatment of detainees at Iran's prisons has increasingly become a high profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions. Iranian media reported that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, ordered one prison, Kahrizak, shut down amid reports it did not measure up to the required standards. Kahrizak's chief was fired and arrested over allegations of detainee mistreatment, according to local reports Saturday. A special parliamentary committee has made rounds at Tehran's Evin prison, but did not find any signs of abuse, according to recent media reports. Hundreds of detainees have since been reportedly released from Evin, though ""political figures"" were held and put on trial. In his plea for an investigation, Karrubi says he has heard descriptions of torture and violence that make his ""body shake,"" though he doesn't specify a prison. ""Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems,"" Karrubi says in the letter. ""Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they [the victims] have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses."" He adds that an investigation will ""teach a lesson to the thugs and criminals in the future and prevent the smearing of the reputation of the Islamic Republic."" Rafsanjani -- a former president and head of the Assembly of Experts, the council responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader -- called for the release of the detainees during a highly anticipated July 17 sermon at Friday prayers. He backed Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi in the presidential election, in which hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. Karrubi and Moussavi unsuccessfully challenged the results for weeks, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term last week. Rafsanjani himself has been accused of helping fuel the post-election unrest as part of recent mass trials of the remaining detainees over the past week.","Mehdi Karrubi calls for investigation in letter to Rafsanjani posted on Web site .

"Editor's note: John Feehery worked as a staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients including the News Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America. John Feehery says Al Franken's victory gives liberal Democrats a dominant position in Washington . (CNN) -- The metric system is the kind of thing that you can expect from the 60-vote filibuster-proof majority Democrats now have in the United States Senate. After the Watergate scandal in 1974, Democrats trounced Republicans in the mid-term elections, getting 61 seats in the Senate and 291 in the House. In the Senate, they adjusted the rules to make it harder for Republicans to filibuster (reducing the magic number from 67 to 60 to invoke cloture, which ends debate). In the House, they passed all kinds of reforms to take power away from senior members and give it to junior members. And Congress mandated that the American people embrace the metric system. The metric system idea never really caught on, and although the pain of Watergate afflicted Republicans for another two elections, they eventually pulled themselves out of their deep hole, with some good ideas and a charismatic leader, who promised to restore America to greatness. Democrats have once again reached the magic number of 60, as Norm Coleman finally threw in the towel against the one-time joke writer for Saturday Night Live, Al Franken. Republicans have little reason to laugh, though, as they look at their diminished ranks and wonder how they have put themselves in such a weakened position. It was only four-and-a-half years ago that the GOP was on the top of the world, and some of their more smug strategists were confidently predicting a permanent Republican majority. This is a good time for such self-reflection. Republicans lost three top-notch senators in the last election -- Norm Coleman, Gordon Smith and John Sununu -- who lost not because they were bad senators, or because they had scandals, or because they had lost touch with constituents. All three lost because they were Republicans. In other words, the brand killed them. And if you look at the latest polls, the GOP brand hasn't gotten any better in the last six months. In fact, according to Gallup, even 38 percent of Republicans have a negative view of the Republican Party. But let's not throw in the towel yet, my Republican friends. Just as in the mid-1970s, when Democratic overreach led to a Republican resurgence, the house that Franken has built will inevitably collapse on its own leftward-self. A new Gallup poll shows that the American people are starting to catch on that Democrats are pushing the country to a place that it doesn't want to go. The poll ""finds a statistically significant increase since last year in the percentage of Americans who describe the Democratic Party's views as being ""too liberal,"" from 39 percent to 46 percent. This is the largest percentage saying so since November 1994, after the party's losses in that year's midterm elections."" It is no surprise that Americans would have that impression of Democrats in the White House and in Congress. When they passed a so-called stimulus bill that Republicans branded as pork-filled, they lost their credibility on fiscal responsibility. When the president assumed control over General Motors, dictated terms to Chrysler, and then refused to allow some banks to pay back their TARP loans, independent voters grew nervous about the government's stepped-up intervention in the private sector. And last week, when Democrats passed a climate change bill that Republicans insist will sharply raise energy prices for middle-class families, moderate Democrats started to jump ship. In fact, 44 Democrats defied intense pressure from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and voted no. Democrats are now making plans to intervene in the health care marketplace, with some liberals insisting on a government-run ""public option"" health insurer. In any event, many won't be satisfied until the government basically sets prices for health insurance and prescription drugs. The arrival of the man from Minnesota will make the Democrats move even more to the left. He will not only be one more vote for the left, but one more loud voice for liberal policies. Because of his celebrity status, he will attract media attention, and because of his philosophy, he will use that attention to move Democrats further left. When Franken first started in politics, he did so as the liberal answer to Rush Limbaugh. Imagine if Rush were the 60th vote for Republicans, with George Bush as president. Now, think how Franken will act as the 60th vote for President Obama. Yes, Democrats will move left by more than a few kilometers, but they will do so at their own peril. Another poll showed that while 40 percent of Americans identify themselves as conservative, only 21 percent think of themselves as liberal. The American people voted for change. They didn't vote for a liberal orthodoxy that promises more government, higher taxes, slower growth, more pork and a liberal social agenda. In 1975, the newly dominant Democratic Congress sent President Gerald Ford a bill that declared that America was going to be metric, which he signed. When Jimmy Carter became president two years later, he signed a law that told Americans that they couldn't drive faster than 55 mph. These measures made perfect sense to the liberal sensibilities of the time. But they didn't make sense to the American people, and are symbols of a philosophy that was out of touch with the people in the 1970s and is still out of touch with the lives of most Americans today. Most Americans still don't use the metric system, and most certainly don't stick to the 55 mile an hour speed limit on the highways of America. And while they may still like Barack Obama and still laugh at jokes written by Al Franken, they will eventually grow weary of the newly dominant liberals who now run Washington. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery.","Feehery: With Franken as 60th vote in Senate, liberals dominant in D.C.

"(CNN)  -- Officials warned Wednesday that the bridge linking the California cities of San Francisco and Oakland will likely remain closed Thursday morning, promising more delays for Bay Area commuters. That work is intended to dampen vibration on the structure. Vibration may have played a role in causing pieces of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to fall Tuesday night from the span onto the roadway, resulting in its closure. The 73-year-old bridge spans the San Francisco Bay and carries an average 280,000 vehicles daily, according to the state's Transportation Department. ""Right now, we do not have a time when the bridge will potentially open,"" said Bart Ney, a spokesman for California Department of Transportation. ""The work has to be completed first."" Once the new steel is in place and the rods have been made tense, at least three hours of testing will be carried out before the bridge will reopen to vehicular traffic, Ney said, refusing to speculate on when that might occur. ""The first thing that I would say to motorists is that you need to be at this point planning other routes over the next day or so,"" he said. The Federal Highway Administration and the Seismic Peer Review Board are scrutinizing the repair plans, he said. Wednesday's commute was a horror show for many. ""My wife actually drives over to the peninsula; she says it's taken her two hours to get to work so far and she's not there yet,"" commuter Seth Carp told CNN affiliate KTVU as he prepared to board a Bay Area Rapid Transit train. ""I tried to take the Golden Gate Bridge,"" said a woman who identified herself only as Yemi. ""It was a big mistake."" She gave up and wound up taking BART. ""It was back-to-back bumper, there were rows of cars everywhere,"" said Christina Chou, who lives in Foster City near the San Mateo Bridge, which served as an alternate route for many. ""It was just horrible."" Ridership increased on ferries, too, with some people finding a silver lining to the snafu. ""I have been looking for an opportunity to go across the bay in the ferry,"" said Jack Pierce of Oakland. ""I'm sorry the cable parted, but I am glad to get the opportunity."" Ney said wind gusts of up to 50 mph slowed repair efforts on Tuesday, but the winds had diminished by Wednesday evening. Winds increased vibration by the rods that were fatigued and ultimately failed, he said. ""It was a contributing factor, but not necessarily the only factor, and we are analyzing what the factors are right now,"" he said. Travelers flocked to BART, which ran longer trains and extra trains. The rail line was on track to exceed its peak ridership of 405,000 in a single day, said BART spokesman Linton Johnson. Were you there? Send photos and video . ""We have called in extra personnel to help us make sure we operate with every available train car we have in order to provide as much capacity as possible,"" said BART's assistant general manager of operations, Paul Oversier. Amtrak was running a shuttle between the San Francisco and Martinez stations for Coast Starlight and California Zephyr passengers. The pieces that fell -- a cross beam and tie rods -- came from the same section that was repaired in September over Labor Day weekend, when crews worked almost around the clock to fix a crack in the span. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake, killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake-tolerant. The whole Bay Bridge is slated to be replaced in 2013, said Patrick Siegman, a transportation planner at Nelson Nygaard Consulting Associates, a national transportation planning firm based in San Francisco. The bridge is ""really showing its age,"" he said. ""It's kind of a race against time to finish the new bridge before the next quake hits.""","San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge closes after parts of it fall to roadway .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday the United States and its allies must have patience if his country is not ready to assume control of its own security by July 2011, when U.S. troops would begin leaving under President Obama's plan. Karzai spoke to CNN's ""Amanpour"" program in his first television interview since Obama's announcement last week that he will deploy an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. Obama also said the U.S. forces would begin withdrawing from Afghanistan in July 2011. The date was not ""an exit announcement,"" but instead a goal for Afghan forces to be able to start assuming security control from U.S.-led allied forces, Karzai said in the interview. ""We will try our best as the Afghan people to do it the soonest possible,"" Karzai said. ""But the international community must have also the patience with us and the realization of the realities in Afghanistan. If it takes longer, then they must be with us."" Karzai also offered his own timeline goal, saying Afghanistan wants to be able to assume security control in some parts of the country in two years, and to lead security for the entire country by the end of his five-year term, which just started after his recent re-election. ""We as Afghans will try our very best to reach that goal, and we hope our allies will back us to reach that goal,"" Karzai said. Later Sunday, Obama's national security adviser, retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the July 2011 date was ""not a cliff"" for U.S. withdrawal, but instead the start of a gradual slope for turning over security responsibility to Afghanistan. Obama ""has also said that we're not leaving Afghanistan,"" Jones noted, adding: ""We are here to make sure that Afghanistan succeeds."" To prepare his country, Karzai said, he would do all he can to root out corruption and improve governance. He has fired corrupt officials already, he said, adding he is prepared to act against anyone proven to be breaking the law. However, he warned against other nations using the corruption as a political tool in making decisions about Afghanistan. And he said the United States and its allies also must halt practices that contribute to corruption from outside the country or create what he called ""parallel"" governance issues. The main objective for Afghanistan and its allies is to defeat terrorism and return peace to the nation, neighboring Pakistan and the region, Karzai said. That means training Afghan security forces, rebuilding the economy and other nation-building efforts, he said. ""I have fired people and I will be firing people,"" Karzai said. He seemed to laugh when he was played a video clip of White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs saying the United States would bypass corrupt government officials if necessary. ""Afghanistan is a sovereign country, it has a sovereign government, it's not an occupied country,"" Karzai said, adding that a foreign power can't undermine or go around the government to deal with whomever it chooses. Top priorities on a ""long list"" of reforms include improving the rule of law, improving the judiciary, reducing bureaucracy that forces people to visit dozens of offices to get licenses, and other steps to make the government more transparent and simpler, Karzai said. However, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in interviews broadcast Sunday that Karzai still must prove he means what he says. ""The proof is in the pudding,"" Clinton said on the ABC program ""This Week."" ""We're going to have to wait to see how it unfolds."" U.S. assistance will be ""based on a certification of accountability and transparency,"" Clinton said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" adding that ""certain ministries ... American money will not be going to."" In his CNN interview, Karzai said his government would welcome Taliban supporters who had no ties to al Qaeda or other terrorist networks, renounced violence and pledged to support the constitution. Clinton told ABC's ""This Week"" that such reintegration might be possible with lower-level Taliban members, but not the hard-core leadership. ""We have no firm information whether any of those leaders would be at all interested in following that kind of a path,"" Clinton said. ""In fact, I'm highly skeptical that any of them would."" Eradicating terrorist networks and helping Karzai's government defeat the Taliban insurgency are main goals of the U.S.-led mission. Approximately 1,000 U.S. Marines are expected to deploy this month as the first wave of the new deployment, military officials say. The Army may not deploy the first soldiers until at least March. Testifying before a congressional committee last week, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a ""significant"" number of troops will arrive in the spring and summer, with the final troops moving to Afghanistan by late summer or early fall. Meanwhile, the White House said Obama would meet with Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, on Monday. Both are expected to testify before Congress this week. Clinton and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Friday that Britain, Italy, Poland, Slovakia and non-NATO member Georgia are among at least 25 countries offering to send a total of 7,000 additional troops. At present, there are 68,000 U.S. troops operating under both NATO and U.S. commands in Afghanistan, and around 42,000 non-U.S. forces under NATO.","NEW: ""Proof is in the pudding"" on Afghan reform promises, Hillary Clinton says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia man who spent a year in jail for nonpayment of child support -- despite the fact he has no children -- has been cleared of the debt, his attorney said Tuesday. Frank Hatley was ordered to make back payments even after he learned a teenager wasn't his son. Frank Hatley, 50, spent 13 months in jail for being a deadbeat dad before his release last month. A judge ordered him jailed in June 2008 for failing to support his ""son"" -- a child who DNA tests proved was not fathered by Hatley. Last week, Cook County Superior Court Judge Dane Perkins signed an order stating, ""defendant is no longer responsible for paying any amount of child support."" The order permits the state's Office of Child Support Services to close its file on Hatley. ""We're satisfied with the result for Mr. Hatley, but still troubled by the state's monumental lapse of judgment in this case,"" attorney Sarah Geraghty with the Atlanta-based Southern Center for Human Rights told CNN in a written statement. Hatley did not immediately return a call from CNN Tuesday. His story dates back to 1986, when Hatley had a relationship with Essie Lee Morrison, who gave birth to a son. According to court documents, Morrison told Hatley the child was his, but the two ended their relationship shortly after the child was born. The couple never married and never lived together, the documents said. When the child turned 2, Morrison applied for public support for the child. Under Georgia law, the state, can recoup the cost of the assistance from a child's non-custodial parent. For 13 years, Hatley made payments to the state until learning in 2000 that the boy might not be his. A DNA test that year confirmed the child was not fathered by Hatley, court documents said. He returned to court and was relieved of any future child support payments, but was ordered to pay more than $16,000 he owed the state before the ruling. Since 2000, Hatley paid that debt down to about $10,000, Geraghty said. Court documents showed he was jailed for six months in 2006 for falling behind on payments during a period of unemployment, but afterward he resumed making payments, continuing to do so even after he lost another job and became homeless in 2008. But last year he became unable to make the payments and was jailed. The argument for keeping Hatley liable for the back payments, according to the attorney who represented him in 2000, was that he signed a consent agreement with the Office of Child Support Services. The court agreed that Hatley had to comply with the consent agreement for the period he believed the child was his son, said attorney Latesha Bradley. But many, including Cook County Sheriff Johnny Daughtrey, didn't think Hatley's incarceration was fair, given that the child was not his. ""I knew the gentleman's plight and didn't know how to help him,"" Daughtrey told CNN last month. When the Southern Center for Human Rights visited the jail earlier this year, Daughtrey told them about Hatley's case. Hatley was released from jail last month after Perkins ruled he was indigent and should not be jailed for failing to make the payments. The Georgia Department of Human Services, which includes the Office of Child Support Services, plans to propose legislation in the next session of the state Legislature that would prevent similar situations in the future, said agency spokeswoman Dena Smith. Two things still remain to be cleared up for Hatley, Geraghty said -- lifting the child-support holds on his driver's license and his income tax. It remains unclear whether he will be reimbursed for the $6,000 in payments he made since 2000, she said -- so far, he has not been. Cook County, Georgia, is in the south-central part of the state, about 200 miles south of Atlanta.","Frank Hatley was jailed last year for falling behind on child support payments .

"COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN)  -- South Carolina Republican Party Chairwoman Karen Floyd seemed to suggest Wednesday that the time had come for GOP Gov. Mark Sanford to consider resigning from office. Gov. Mark Sanford has said it's better for him to keep his governorship to ""learn lessons."" ""For the past two days, I have been speaking with Republican leaders across South Carolina,"" she said in a statement. ""There is clearly a growing view that the time may have come for Governor Sanford to remove himself and his family from the limelight, so that he can devote his efforts full-time to repairing the damage in his personal life."" The statement comes on the same day as a growing number of GOP state senators called for Sanford to step down. CNN has learned that GOP Sens. Daniel Verdin, Shane Martin, Ronnie Cromer and Wes Hayes joined the anti-Sanford chorus Wednesday morning, bringing the total number of Republican senators calling for the governor's resignation to 13. There are 27 Republicans in the state Senate. Another state senator stopped just short of calling for Sanford to step down Wednesday. Glenn McConnell, Senate president pro tempore, didn't explicitly ask Sanford to resign, but he did ask him ""to do the right thing for himself, his family and our state."" Sanford and his staff have said repeatedly this week that he will not resign. He wrote in a message to his political action committee e-mail list Monday that while he considered resigning, ""I would ultimately be a better person and of more service in whatever doors God opened next in life if I stuck around to learn lessons rather than running and hiding down at the farm."" After returning last week from a secret trip to Argentina that his staff and wife didn't know about, Sanford admitted to an extramarital affair with a woman identified as Maria Belen Chapur. Sanford also told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's ""crossed lines"" with other women, although Chapur was the only one he had sex with.  Watch a report on Sanford's situation » . Sanford's support among legislators and grassroots leaders in the state eroded considerably Tuesday after Sanford told The Associated Press he had met with his mistress more times than he had previously disclosed. He also admitted to dalliances with other women. At least four county GOP chairmen have also called for Sanford to go. Glenn McCall, the York County Republican Party chairman who has been leading a grassroots effort against the governor, said Wednesday that he and other conservative activists are postponing a rally at the State House next week because legislators are starting to come out strongly against Sanford. The rally had been scheduled to pressure Senate and House leaders to call for Sanford's resignation and start an investigation into his activities. But now that officials are publicly coming out against the governor and Attorney General Henry McMaster has begun investigating Sanford's travel records, McCall said the rally may not be necessary. ""We are hoping that legislators can quietly, in private talks with the governor, ask him if he would please step down,"" McCall said. A top South Carolina Democrat also called for Sanford's resignation Wednesday. ""While I believe an investigation should still be done to determine the full extent of Mark Sanford's abuse of power, [through] his long stream of confessions he has already revealed enough immoral and reprehensible behavior to justify asking him to step [down],"" state Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said in a statement. ""State officials seem unable to do anything except worry and talk about Governor Sanford's extramarital affair, which we learn more about every few hours. ""... South Carolina can't afford to be at a standstill for the next 18 months with a governor who ignores his job responsibilities while pursuing personal interests,"" the statement said. ""Any other worker in South Carolina would be fired for not showing up at work with no notice."" Late Tuesday, seven GOP senators, including Majority Leader Harvey Peeler, jointly issued a letter demanding that the governor step down because he has lost the trust of South Carolinians. ""The bottom line is that the Governor's private matters should remain private, but his deception and negligence make it impossible for us to trust him, and for him to govern in the future,"" they wrote. Peeler told CNN that Sanford ""has lost his ability to lead, and I'm afraid he has lost his ability to function as a man."" ""He is sitting all alone in that big governor's mansion, totally alone,"" Peeler said. ""It's about leadership and moving forward and it's time for him to resign."" Peeler issued the statement along with Sens. Hugh Leatherman, Paul Campbell, Thomas Alexander, Jake Knotts, Larry Martin and William O'Dell. Earlier Tuesday, two of Sanford's top conservative allies in the senate -- Larry Grooms and Kevin Bryant -- also said Sanford must go. The Greenville News, one of the largest papers in South Carolina, also issued a sharply worded editorial Wednesday telling Sanford to go. It wrote that Sanford has ""acted like a heart-sick school boy, and he's revealed facts that clearly demonstrate he is capable of exceptional deception, arrogance and narcissism."" The State, of Columbia, South Carolina's largest paper, editorialized earlier that he should remain in office.  Watch a reporter from The State comment on the situation » . The attorney general of South Carolina asked the State Law Enforcement Division to review Sanford's travel records after the governor admitted Tuesday to more visits with his mistress than previously disclosed. The review by law enforcement officials would be the first formal investigation into whether Sanford abused his power while carrying on his affair. State Law Enforcement Division Chief Reggie Lloyd said he would not characterize the review as a criminal investigation. He told reporters on a conference call that law enforcement officials are reviewing documents from the governor's office going back to 2003, when Sanford came to power. He said the review should be concluded by the end of the week. Attorney General Henry McMaster, a Republican, had been reluctant to move forward with calls for an investigation into Sanford, saying he is wary of mixing legal matters with political score-settling from longtime Sanford opponents. However, an aide to McMaster told CNN on Tuesday that ""that all changed this morning when the governor disclosed additional trips that were not disclosed last week."" Sanford said in a statement Tuesday that he's ""pleased that [the State Law Enforcement Division] will look into this matter."" ""There's been a lot of speculation and innuendo on whether or not public moneys were used to advance my admitted unfaithfulness. To be very clear: no public money was ever used in connection with this.""","GOP chairwoman suggests Sanford may have to step down .

"(CNN) -- Despite his threats of ""consequences"" and the subsequent beatings and shooting deaths by government agents, the open protests on Iran's streets by hundreds of thousands of people have dented the shield of invincibility of Iran's Supreme religious Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, say sources in Iran. Riot police patrol a Tehran street earlier this week. Chants of ""Death to Khamenei"" broke a state-imposed, and a self-imposed absolute prohibition on criticizing a leader believed to be wielding the wisdom and authority of God himself. But right now, the massive network of Iran's intelligence agents, Revolutionary Guard, paramilitary Basij, and police of all sorts, are cracking down. Sources say they are also going house to house, through email accounts and web postings, through cell phone calls and SMS text messages (when the system is allowed to stay up) and even to taxi agencies whose drivers hoisted Mir Hossein Moussavi posters during the election campaign. They are rounding people up and, as it was chillingly put to me, in Iran's prisons ""we have room for all of them."" In addition protestors are being paraded ""confessing and repenting"" on Iranian state TV. The government also claims to be arresting ""foreign agents"" accused of stirring up the protests. Sources say the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), aligned with Ayatollah Khamenei, plucked Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from total obscurity as presidential candidate in 2005, in order to hold the line against ""reform"" in the country after eight years of the reformist president Mohammad Khatami. Sources in the Iranian government and well-placed analysts inside the country Say the IRGC has taken up influential positions in many major sectors of Iranian society, such as the oil industry, finance, transport, construction and other businesses and politics. Iran has been ""increasingly radicalized over the last four years,"" one told me. While there are divisions within the clerical establishment and in parliament, sources tell me that for now that does not threaten the ruling establishment. I was told the weekend arrests of former president Hashemi Rafsanjani's daughter and other relatives, and their swift release, were a warning to Rafsanjani, who backed Moussavi in the election. So far the powerful mullahs, monitoring it all from the holy city of Qom, are mostly quiet. And finally, for now, while Moussavi has startled the system with his willingness to press the election case, he is also considered, at this moment, no Ayatollah Khomeini. Nowhere near as charismatic and powerful as the leader of the successful revolution in 1979. Sources say Moussavi is not formally arrested or under house arrest. However his movements and words are ""controlled"" by security and intelligence officials. So in effect there is no visible leader for the street protesters today -- unlike 1979, when Khomeini led from exile. Sources say all this could change if mass demonstrations hit the streets and simply remain there all over the country, if the security forces refuse to expand the crackdown, or if people go on nationwide strike, like they did in 1978-79.

"ARNOLD, Missouri (CNN)  -- On his 100th day in office, President Obama said Wednesday that he was ""pleased with the progress we've made but not satisfied."" Obama marked his 100th day in office Wednesday with a town hall meeting and later a news conference. ""I've come back to report to you, the American people, that we have begun to pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off, and we've begun the work of remaking America,"" the president said at a town hall meeting in a high school gymnasium in Arnold, a St. Louis suburb. ""I'm confident in the future, but not I'm not content with the present,"" he said. ""You know the progress comes from hard choices and hard work, not miracles. I'm not a miracle worker,"" he said. Obama acknowledged challenges of ""unprecedented size and scope,"" including the recession. These challenges, he said, could not be met with ""half measures."" ""They demand action that is bold and sustained. They call on us to clear away the wreckage of a painful recession, But also, at the same time, lay the building blocks for a new prosperity. And that's the work that we've begun over these first 100 days,"" he said. He responded to critics who say he is trying to do too much as he works to address the recession as well as health care, energy and education. ""There's no mystery to what we've done; the priorities that we've acted upon were the things that we said we'd do during the campaign,"" he said, prompting loud applause. The president made an opening statement that lasted about 20 minutes before taking questions from the audience. The last question was from a fourth-grade girl who asked about the administration's environmental policies. Later Wednesday, Obama will hold a prime-time news conference in the East Room of the White House. Leading up to the date, White House aides had labeled the 100th day as a ""Hallmark"" holiday. ""They don't mean anything,"" quipped one aide, ""but you have to observe them."" More than six in 10 Americans approve of the job Obama is doing as president, a recent poll of polls shows. According to a CNN Poll of Polls compiled early Wednesday, 63 percent say they approve of how Obama is handling his duties.

"(CNN) -- With the 2010 World Cup being held in South Africa next year CNN takes a look at one of the greatest talents South African football has ever produced, Jomo Sono. Jomo Sono's international career never took off because of South Africa's exclusion from world football. Matsilela Ephraim Sono was born in 1955 in Soweto, but his career as an international player never got off the ground as South Africa were officially expelled by world governing body FIFA in 1976 during the apartheid regime in the country. The Black Prince, as he was known, made his mark as a player of legendary skill who was denied a world stage through circumstances beyond his control. Sono was a midfield general and renowned for his dribbling and accurate passing -- but it is difficult to say how he would have faired against the best players in the world as he was not given the opportunity. Watch CNN's interview with Sono. ""He was one of the first South Africans to play overseas where he played for the New York Cosmos alongside Pele,"" South African football writer Mo Allie told CNN. ""He played at a time when South Africa was internationally isolated so there was no opportunity for players to showcase their skills to the world. ""But he was fortunate in that he got the opportunity to go to the U.S. and he did very well there, playing alongside greats such as Pele."" After accomplishing everything that he set out to do at home club Orlando Pirates, Sono starred for the New York Cosmos, Colorado Caribous and Toronto Blizzard in the United States. On his return to South Africa after his retirement, Sono bought the Highlands Park Club in Johannesburg in 1982 and renamed it Jomo Cosmos in honor of his old team in New York, before becoming coach of the South African national side. ""So many of today's South African players would have heard a lot about Jomo Sono but many wouldn't have seen him in action apart from a few snippets of TV highlights,"" Allie added. ""They will identify more with him as a coach because he led the national side in the 1998 African Cup of Nations and took them to the 2002 World Cup finals."" Sono has proved to be as astute off the pitch as he was on it and has become a successful businessman, owning a number of companies around Johannesburg. And the current South African squad will be looking to carry on his footballing legacy when they attempt to become the first African team to win the World Cup next year.","Jomo Sono is one of the greatest footballers South Africa has ever produced .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- American U2 reconnaissance planes have been flying over the Turkey-Iraq border to observe military movements, said three U.S. military sources Wednesday. A Turkish army convoy heads toward the Turkey-Iraq border on Monday. Word of the flights comes a day before top-level meetings between U.S. and Turkish government officials and prior to a regional conference aimed at easing tensions between Ankara and Kurdish rebels across Turkey's border with Iraq. Turkey -- which shares its Incirlik air base with U.S. forces -- is a key member of  NATO and acts as a vital conduit for U.S. military supplies. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell confirmed Wednesday that U.S. military and intelligence communities are sharing information with Turkey to help them fight members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, who have made cross-border attacks.  See location of key U.S.-Turkish air base » . ""We are assisting by supplying them, the Turks, with intelligence, lots of intelligence,"" said Morrell. ""There has been an increased level"" of intelligence sharing. Turkey has urged Washington to offer more support against the rebels and Ankara has threatened to launch a full-scale offensive if Iraqi and Kurdish officials fail to neutralize the PKK. U.S. and Iraqi diplomats have been working to restrain Turkey from such a response. Recent limited fighting in southeastern Turkey has spilled into northern Iraq. During operations near the border on Monday, Turkish forces fired on suspected rebel positions.  Watch Turkish helicopters fire on rebels » . On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is set to meet with Turkish officials in Ankara and President Bush holds talks in Washington with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Also, a conference of regional officials, including Iraq, is scheduled Thursday and Friday in Istanbul. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has joined efforts to ease cross-border tensions. Mottaki met in Iraq Wednesday with his Iraqi counterpart, Hoshyar Zebari, and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Mottaki's involvement prompted him to delay a scheduled visit to Lebanon, according to Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, which quoted Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon Mohammad Reza Sheibani. Iran's foreign minister is offering his ""full support"" to the regional conference in Istanbul, said a statement from al-Maliki's office. The statement also said Mottaki wants to help ""solve the border crisis between Turkey and the PKK."" Earlier this month, proposed legislation in the U.S. Congress prompted Turkey to threaten to restrict U.S. access to Turkish airspace or cut off access to the air base at Incirlik. Some lawmakers wanted a vote on legislation that would have officially declared that the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in World War I was ""genocide."" Turkey recalled its ambassador to the United States and warned of repercussions in the growing dispute. Sponsors of the congressional resolution have asked for a delay in the vote.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday that the United States ""will never turn our back"" on Afghanistan. Gates, who is on an unannounced visit in the war zone, held a joint news conference with Karzai. ""President Obama is sending 30,000 more U.S. troops, the first of which are scheduled to arrive within days,"" Gates said. ""Afghanistan's international partners have pledged at least 7,000 additional troops; when all is said and done, some 43 nations will make up a force."" Gates also was scheduled to meet with Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak, as well as American military officials. Karzai has asked for patience as his nation struggles to take control of its own security. ""A number of years Afghanistan will not be able to sustain our force with our own resources, "" Karzai told reporters. ""We hope the international community and the U.S. will help Afghanistan reach the ability to sustain our force with numbers and equipment."" Obama has said that U.S. forces will begin withdrawing from Afghanistan in July 2011 -- at which point international troops would begin to turn over security responsibility to Afghan forces. Gates spoke about the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan on Tuesday. ""Our relationship with Afghanistan is a long-term commitment,"" Gates said. ""As security improves our relationship grows ... especially with economic and political development. As President Obama said, we will never turn our back on the region."" Karzai also offered his own timeline goal, saying Afghanistan wants to be able to assume security control in some parts of the country in two years, and to lead security for the entire country by the end of his five-year term, which just started after his recent re-election. ""We as Afghans will try our very best to reach that goal, and we hope our allies will back us to reach that goal,"" Karzai said. Building and developing Afghan security forces will be a continuing challenge, Gates said, and is an effort that has involved some trial and error. ""One of the eye-openers for us was learning that the Taliban for the most part are better paid than the Afghan security forces, so that's something that we and the Afghans have already taken steps to correct,"" Gates told reporters on the way to Afghanistan. ""I think, frankly, that's the biggest obstacle."" The Afghan president is under intense pressure to clean up government corruption, a task he said is under way. ""I have fired people and I will be firing people,"" Karzai said. Some of those changes will become known when Karzai announces his new Cabinet. The Afghan president said at the news conference with Gates that he would try to get a list to parliament by the middle of next week.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Airline pilots and cabin crew across Europe are holding demonstrations Monday to protest over rules governing their flying hours which they say are putting the lives of passengers at risk. European pilots and cabin crew are calling for shorter flying times to protect passenger safety. Organized by the European Cockpit Association (ECA), and the European Transport Workers' Federation (ETF), protesters are demanding that European Union rules on flying times are brought into line with scientific evidence. The Moebus Report -- mandated by the EU in September 2008 -- recommends that an airline crew should not operate for more than 13 hours during the day and 10 hours at night. Current EU rules stipulate pilots work up to a maximum of 14 hours during the day and nearly 12 hours at night. Are you concerned at the hours worked by airline pilots? Tell us. Speaking from one of the protests outside the European Parliament in Brussels, Captain Martin Chalk, President of the ECA told CNN: ""At the moment, the EU level is not adequate. That's not our view that is the view of experts employed to review the EU's own level of protection."" Chalk said that despite being in possession of the report, the EU completely ignored the recommendations when they produced new fatigue proposals in January 2009. The ECA and the ETF have printed over 100,000 dummy airline tickets which they will hand out to airline passengers. The tickets contain cigarette-style warnings giving details on crew fatigue and an explanation as to why the EU current legislation needs to be changed. ""All we are trying to do at this stage is raise public's awareness. We're not trying to get in anyone's way,"" Chalk said. Hundreds of protesters are attending events taking place at 22 airports across Europe. 400 ECA members are expected to attend the protests at Madrid airport. ""What we are saying today is that they need to listen to the safety review,"" Chalk said. ""It was conducted by the best scientists in this field in Europe. It was commissioned by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and therefore it should not be ignored when writing the rules."" Francois Ballestero, Political Secretary of the ETF echoed Chalk's concerns. ""Flight safety is the core mission of every cabin crew member. But EU law is insufficient to ensure that air crew can perform their safety role in an alert and effective way,"" he said. But the EASA were critical of the protests and their timing. ""This is jumping the gun. It is not a constructive contribution to a debate which is yet to happen,"" Daniel Hoeltgen, EASA communications director told CNN. Hoeltgen believes that the pilots are simply setting up stall for an industrial debate between the unions and the airlines. ""It's got nothing to do with safety regulations. We have made it clear that we will invite the unions and the airlines to take part in a review of the current rules and the timeframe for that has been made clear."" The current law in Europe on air crew fatigue is set at two different levels. There is a minimum level set by EU and then there is a level set by individual countries that can be better than that minimum level. In 2012 the EU level is due to come into force. ""There needs to be a change in the law to protect passengers and our members from the insidious effects of airport fatigue,"" Chalk said. The ECA represents over 38,000 pilots and flight engineers in 36 European countries.","Hundreds of pilots across Europe are protesting about flying hours and safety .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday. The exact cause of Nico's sudden death on Saturday is inconclusive from the initial necropsy or animal autopsy. The Georgia Aquarium hopes to find out more information in the months ahead from a more detailed necropsy. ""As we work with and care for the many animals at the Georgia Aquarium, we become attached emotionally,"" said Dr. Gregory D. Bossart, chief veterinary officer at the aquarium. ""The loss is not unlike that of faithful dog or special horse that has been a part your life for years."" Nico died at Sea World in San Antonio, where he and two other beluga whales had been moved temporarily while the Georgia Aquarium is undergoing renovation. Nico was scheduled to return home to Atlanta next month with companions Maris and Natasha. Nico arrived in Atlanta with Gaspar, two whales obtained from a park in Mexico. Both animals suffered ""significant health issues"" from their times in a foreign park and were essentially ""living on borrowed time,"" said Bossart, who had been caring for the two whales as far as nine years ago, while they were still in Mexico. ""We rescued Nico knowing that he had health issues due to his prior home, but we were confident that we could provide a better quality of life for his final years,"" Bossart said. Gaspar was suffering from a bone disease contracted before arriving at the downtown Atlanta aquarium and was euthanized in January 2007. Another beluga whale, Marina, died 11 months later from complications of old age. Beluga whales or white whales, whose name is derived from a Russian word meaning white, typically live in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions including Canada, Russia, Greenland and the U.S. state of Alaska. They can live up to 35 years. The belugas are not the only high-profile deaths at the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in late 2005. A pair of whale sharks have also died at the eight-million-gallon facility, the only one outside Asia to display the giant fish. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","After autopsy, the cause of Nico's sudden death Saturday is inconclusive .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- In her first television interview since Mel Gibson went public with their relationship in April, his girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, made it clear to CNN: ""I'd like to be known for my music."" Oksana Grigorieva and Mel Gibson are expecting a child this year. Still, the 39-year-old singer was willing to talk about her beau and her pregnancy, as well as her new album, ""Beautiful Heartache."" ""Beautiful Heartache"" was released to iTunes on July 23 by Icon Distribution, Gibson's company, which up until now has handled only soundtracks for his movies. ""He's an incredible artist,"" Grigorieva said. ""A visionary. He enabled me to produce this album, for my music to live."" The Oscar-winning (""Braveheart"") filmmaker also directed four music videos for Grigorieva during a whirlwind week in Mexico.  Watch Grigorieva talk about Gibson, love » . ""They're like dramatic miniature films -- a whirlpool of different, exciting, bright images. That's quite rare,"" she said. The music videos and music are available on her Web site, www.oksana.fm. Grigorieva has a background in music. She said she was classically trained as a pianist in her native Russia, and both her parents are musicians. In 2006, a song she penned called ""Un Dia Llegara"" was recorded by Josh Groban for his album ""Awake."" Though she describes her album as being about ""different facets of love,"" she cautions that listeners shouldn't overthink the lyrics. ""This album is not autobiographical -- maybe only partially so. It's not a diary."" Gibson, 53, and his wife of nearly 30 years, Robyn, filed for divorce in April. The two have seven children. Grigorieva and Gibson were first photographed together on the set of his movie ""Edge of Darkness,"" according to People magazine. Grigorieva is pregnant with Gibson's child and is to give birth this year. She said the couple has opted not to learn the sex of the child. It will be her second child, after Alexander, her 12-year-old son with actor Timothy Dalton. ""I'm already buying things in gender-neutral colors. It's very cute,"" she chuckled. Alexander, she added, is excited about having a sibling. ""He's like a little man, protecting me. He's looking forward to it very much."" Grigorieva says she and Gibson have no immediate plans for marriage. ""We don't know yet. We haven't really talked about it,"" she admitted. She acknowledged that her relationship with Gibson has given her a unique opportunity to present her skills. ""If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful,"" she said. ""You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all."" In the meantime, Grigorieva is adapting to life in the public eye. ""It hasn't been too bad, actually. There was a period of time where it was a little bit difficult, but now it's much better,"" she said. Before embarking on limited press for the new album, Gibson did offer a few words of advice, she added: ""Just be myself and speak the truth.

"CAVITE CITY, Philippines (CNN)  -- At 16, Rhandolf Fajardo reflects on his former life as a gang member. Efren Peñaflorida's Dynamic Teen Company offers Filipino youth an alternative to gangs through education. ""My gang mates were the most influential thing in my life,"" says Fajardo, who joined a gang when he was in sixth grade. ""We were pressured to join."" He's not alone. In the Philippines, teenage membership in urban gangs has surged to an estimated 130,000 in the past 10 years, according to the Preda Foundation, a local human rights charity. ""I thought I'd get stuck in that situation and that my life would never improve,"" recalls Fajardo. ""I would probably be in jail right now, most likely a drug addict -- if I hadn't met Efren."" Efren Peñaflorida, 28, also was bullied by gangs in high school. Today, he offers Filipino youth an alternative to gang membership through education. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""Gang members are groomed in the slums as early as 9 years old,"" says Peñaflorida. ""They are all victims of poverty."" For the past 12 years, Peñaflorida and his team of teen volunteers have taught basic reading and writing to children living on the streets. Their main tool: A pushcart classroom. Stocked with books, pens, tables and chairs, his Dynamic Teen Company recreates a school setting in unconventional locations such as the cemetery and municipal trash dump. Peñaflorida knows firsthand the adversity faced by these children. Born into a poor family, he lived in a shanty near the city dump site. But he says he refused to allow his circumstances to define his future. ""Instead of being discouraged, I promised myself that I would pursue education,"" he recalls. ""I will strive hard; I will do my best."" In high school, Peñaflorida faced a new set of challenges. Gang activity was rampant; they terrorized the student body, vandalized the school and inducted members by forcing them to rape young girls, he says. ""I felt the social discrimination. I was afraid to walk down the street."" Peñaflorida remembers standing up to a gang leader, refusing to join his gang. That confrontation proved fateful. At 16, he and his friends ""got the idea to divert teenagers like us to be productive,"" he says. He created the Dynamic Teen Company to offer his classmates an outlet to lift up themselves and their community. For Peñaflorida, that meant returning to the slums of his childhood to give kids the education he felt they deserved. ""They need education to be successful in life. It's just giving them what others gave to me,"" he says. Today, children ranging from ages 2 to 14 flock to the pushcart every Saturday to learn reading, writing, arithmetic and English from Peñaflorida and his trained teen volunteers.  Watch Peñaflorida and his group in action with their push cart classroom » . ""Our volunteers serve as an inspiration to other children,"" he says. The group also runs a hygiene clinic, where children can get a bath and learn how to brush their teeth. Since 1997, an estimated 10,000 members have helped teach more than 1,500 children living in the slums. The organization supports its efforts by making and selling crafts and collecting items to recycle.  Take a look at the slums where Peñaflorida and his group spend their Saturdays » . Through his group, Peñaflorida has successfully mentored former gang members, addicts and dropouts, seeing potential where others see problems.

"Editor's note: Since 2007, CNN and CNN.com have followed the story of Youssif, an Iraqi boy disfigured when he was burned by attackers. Today, CNN's Arwa Damon catches up with the boy and his family, now living in California where Youssif is undergoing treatment. Today Youssif goes to school in California and continues to have treatment to help his scars. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Youssif stands on stage beaming as he belts out ""Jingle Bell Rock,"" his tiny burned hands waving in sync with his classmates at Hamlin Street School. His mother, Zaineb, stands at the back, cradling his little sister, Aya, tears rolling down her face. ""I am so proud of him,"" she says. ""It reminds me of what he was like in Iraq when he used to sing in kindergarten. I felt for a moment that none of this had happened. My son was back, without fear, strong."" Youssif spots us, and waves wildly. Little appears to remain of the sullen and withdrawn dark-eyed boy we first met in Baghdad more than a year ago. It has been almost two years since masked men in Baghdad doused Youssif, then just 4 years old, in gasoline and set him on fire. His mother still doesn't sleep at night. ""I still blame myself. I should have protected him. Sometimes I say to myself that I wish it had happened to me, just not to him."" Zaineb says, her voice starting to quiver. ""If only I hadn't let him go out to play that day."" Today Youssif plays freely, without fear. ""Let's race"" he shouts to his friend Brandon as the two boys dash across the schoolyard. A couple of minutes later the two are playfully jostling over a rubber ball. Youssif shrieks and bursts into laughter as the two play catch. ""It's like this weight has been lifted off of me, off of him,"" his father, Wissam, says. ""It's like we've left this dark, depressing state where we were consumed by Youssif and the attack that had happened. You know, it's so hard to see a child, my child, go through something like this. When I see him like this, I feel like he's coming back.""  Watch more on Youssif's recovery » . After CNN and CNN.com first reported Youssif's story in 2007, more than 12,000 CNN.com users contributed to a fund set up by the Children's Burn Foundation of Sherman Oaks California, enabling the boy and his family to travel to the United States for treatment. Youssif has undergone more than a dozen surgeries. Much of the thick scar tissue around his eyes, mouth and nose -- left by his treatment in Baghdad -- has been removed. He currently has yet another tissue expander in his left cheek, intended to stretch out ""good skin"" to be used to replace his scar tissue. Youssif has grown used to the sometimes painful treatments. ""When I started this process of tissue expansion, I would have to chase him around the room,"" Dr. Peter Grossman, Youssif's surgeon, tells us as he injects more liquid into the expander. ""We'd need three people to hold him down for these injections."" Youssif will probably have many more surgeries stretched out over time. ""The problem we have with Youssif is that every operation we do tends to heal well after surgery, but then a month after, he starts to form these really thick scars,"" Grossman said. ""It's probably best at this time to let his body relax, let these scars mature over a period of a year or two years."" Today, Youssif grimaces in pain but braves it alone, refusing to take his father's hand. ""Seven or eight times put water,"" Youssif says back at home, explaining how the tissue expansion works. ""I am not scared. It goes here,"" he says pointing to the scarring over his lip. He's not all that interested in talking about medical procedures. ""When I sharpen this it broke,"" he says, trotting over with his new pencils. We all smile. ""You cut it like this"" he orders, handing me scissors and what is meant to be a snowman he's just drawn. A few moments later I am being berated for coloring ""wrong."" ""Great, I am taking orders from a 6-year-old"" I think to myself, laughing. Keely Quinn with the Children's Burn Foundation comes by for an extra reading lesson. They are reading one of the ""Five Little Monkeys"" books, Youssif's favorite. By the time I join them on the couch, Youssif's got Dr. Seuss' ""Foot Book."" ""What's the biggest change you've seen in him in the last year?"" I ask her.

"(CNN) -- Earlier this year, Matt Keller sat down with officials in Afghanistan -- not to discuss troop deployments, suicide bombings or opium traffickers. He was there to talk about getting laptop computers into the hands of little girls. Girls in India take a seat on the floor and get to work on their new laptops. As Taliban insurgents continue to crack down on girls who go to school and women who dare to teach them, Keller was awestruck by the Afghan government's determination to educate all children, even if it means finding tools that allow them to intellectually grow in the privacy of their own homes. ""For them to propose this was astounding,"" said Keller, who works for One Laptop per Child, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, nonprofit committed to creating and distributing affordable, durable and solar-powered laptops to the world's poorest children. ""That hunger for knowledge, that desire to learn, is pretty profound."" From Uruguay, Haiti and Mexico to Mongolia, Ghana and the small Polynesian island of Niue, at least 750,000 kids -- a number that will double by June, Chairman Nicholas Negroponte said -- are tapping away on One Laptop per Child-produced XO laptop keyboards. They're exploring mathematics, composing music and art, learning new languages, designing animation, collecting data, collaborating with peers across borders and accessing learning tools (including textbooks) that they would never see otherwise. Targeting current and historic conflict zones, including Iraq, Rwanda and most recently the Gaza Strip, not only fulfills the group's mission to offer equal-access education to the most isolated children, it may also promote world peace, Keller said. By putting laptops ""into the hands of kids who would otherwise be indoctrinated,"" he explained, ""we can make the case pretty successfully that doing this is a long-term solution to root causes."" When the laptops, which incorporate free wireless Internet connectivity and open-source programming, first rolled out in 2007, they cost $205 each. Now, they're down to $180. The price is higher than Negroponte's original goal of $100 a pop, but it's a figure he believes will keep going down as One Laptop per Child finds ways to engineer the product with fewer components. The hope is that with corporate sponsorships and donations, collected through a program called Give One Get One, the computers can be delivered to kids at no cost to the poorest host-country governments. The laptops allow students to engage in learning differently, enjoy a customized approach and hone critical thinking skills, explained David Cavallo, One Laptop per Child's vice president of learning. And their mere existence, he said, keeps kids coming to school. Cavallo spoke of a school in Rwanda that lacks electricity and traditionally had a 50 percent attendance rate. It is now drawing 1,000 more students than its previous full capacity, he said, and is even attracting kids -- who in turn are teaching their parents and grandparents -- on weekends. ""Rwanda is recovering from genocide,"" he said. This is a ""real engagement of a society directing itself to a different future."" And the kids, no matter their previous exposure to technology, immediately gravitate to the machines. Keller, the group's director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recalled a visit to rural Ethiopia. As he passed out the laptops, he kept one eye on the children, the other on his watch. Seven seconds was all it took for an 8-year-old boy to flip open the never-seen-before computer, find and then hit the power button. Within two weeks, that boy and his classmates would be programming. Meanwhile, the nearby adults stared at the oddball objects and flashed the international look of, ""What the hell is this thing?"" Keller said. ""Kids are technology natives, and adults are technology immigrants."" Despite its ongoing successes, the downturn in the economy has taken a toll on the nonprofit. The last Give One Get One promotion brought in $2.5 million, while the first incarnation brought in $37.5 million, Negroponte said. And corporate sponsors fell from 11 to three in the span of 30 days, he added. Early this year, the organization laid off half of its staff, bringing the total on payroll to just 32. These economic realities, though disappointing, won't impede the mission, said Negroponte, who created One Laptop per Child with others from the MIT Media Lab. Thousands of volunteers around the world offer technical support and training, and serve as translators and programmers. ""If we could get all the children in the world -- 1.2 billion of them between 6 and 12 -- to have a connected laptop, that would be success,"" Negroponte said. ""Roughly half of those children have no electricity at home or school. The poverty is so extreme, and the environmental conditions are so extreme, we have to focus on them."" The push has been to reach out to developing nations, but that hasn't precluded the group from serving American communities that can pursue the program at a scale that makes sense financially. Birmingham City Schools in Alabama, for example, now has 14,000 of the group's laptops in students' hands. Michael Wilson, principal of Glen Iris Elementary School in Birmingham, opened his building's doors last year as the district's pilot school for the free laptop program. ""It's been an overwhelming success at our school,"" which has a poverty rate of 83 percent, Wilson said. Through professional development and a summer camp for kids, the school is learning how to best utilize the computers. And the students, who own their laptops, are learning about responsibility. They're ""totally engaged in what they're doing,"" Wilson said. ""I have kids getting out of cars in the morning with their laptops open."" One of those kids might be Amicah Bitten, a fourth-grader who is using the computer on her own time to learn Spanish with her mother, Kamonia Bates. ""It gets me more interested because she's interested. ... She doesn't put it down,"" said Bates, who used to take her daughter to the library when she needed a computer. ""I like it because people can learn stuff,"" Amicah, 9, said after school. ""You can listen to music. You can take pictures. You can also learn how to make different things. I can learn Spanish. I can learn French. I can learn how to use the keyboard. ... Yes ma'am, my laptop can do many things.""","One Laptop per Child targets kids in poorest and most conflicted regions .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai bowed to Western pressure Tuesday, agreeing to take part in a presidential runoff vote in two weeks. Hamid Karzai failed to score a first round win in August's election. Karzai, who will face his main challenger Abdullah Abdullah in the November 7 second round, said he was putting his country's interests over his own. ""It was not important who the winner is, and we need to leave this to the people of Afghanistan to judge who the winner was,"" Karzai said at a news conference through an interpreter. ""Whether I am the winner or not, it's probably in my interest, but I prefer the national interest of Afghanistan over my personal interests."" Western powers, particularly the United States, had been pushing Karzai to accept the final election results in order to ensure Afghanistan has a legitimate government, particularly as Washington considers beefing up its military presence there. Karzai spoke shortly after Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission certified the election results, which gave him less than the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff. The U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission had invalidated nearly a third of Karzai's votes from the August 20 presidential election because of ""clear and convincing evidence of fraud."" Last month, final uncertified results showed Karzai with 54 percent. ""We welcome the decision made by the Independent Election Commission, we believe the session is legitimate, legal and according to the constitution of Afghanistan,"" Karzai said Tuesday. ""It's going to be a historic period that we all are waiting to go through."" The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan said that it would ""support the Afghan National Security Forces' preparations to ensure a safe runoff election."" Spokesman Col. Wayne Shanks said that ISAF had been preparing for a possible runoff election ""for some time."" ""As in the election's first round, ISAF will only provide third-layer of security, reinforcing the Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army in line with the security plan signed by the chairman of the Afghan Independent Election Commission along with representatives from the Afghan Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Defense, and ISAF in 2008,"" Shanks said. Karzai's decision was immediately hailed by U.S. Sen. John Kerry, one of several Western representatives who appeared alongside the Afghan president at Tuesday's delayed news conference. Kerry, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Karzai's decision to participate in the runoff ""will allow the national leadership to govern with legitimacy."" ""We believe with this decision by the president today that a time of enormous uncertainty has been transformed into a great opportunity,"" Kerry said.  Watch President Karzai and Sen. John Kerry discuss runoff elections » . Minutes after the news conference concluded, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement praising Karzai for accepting the election results and agreeing to a second round of voting. ""While this election could have remained unresolved to the detriment of the country, President Karzai's constructive actions established an important precedent for Afghanistan's new democracy,"" Obama said. Obama is considering sending more troops to Afghanistan, and Kerry has said the results of the country's election should be settled before the United States makes any decision on troop levels.  Watch Nic Robertson discuss pressure President Karzai is under » . Abdullah told CNN on Monday he was prepared to participate in a runoff, but said ""the door is open"" to other alternatives. ""There are some practical questions ahead,"" Abdullah told CNN's Christiane Amanpour, citing winter, the security situation ""and other realities on the ground."" If the election were not held by early November, winter weather would make voting impossible in some areas and force a delay until spring of 2010, according to Afghanistan's ambassador to the United States, Said Jawad. Such a delay, he warned, would be a ""recipe for disaster"" that would create confusion in Afghanistan and heighten tension between the United States and Karzai's government.","Afghan runoff election scheduled for November 7, officials say .

"(CNN) -- ""All politics is local."" That four-word statement, originally uttered by former Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill, is one of the favorite clichés of political pundits everywhere. But it's seldom respected when it matters most. Consider, for instance, the special election in New York's 23rd Congressional District, which conservative Democrat Bill Owens won in spite of partisan and nonpartisan polling that had shown Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman with a solid lead. Almost overnight, Hoffman became a sort of folk hero among conservative activists around the country, a decidedly ordinary-looking man who seemed poised to take an extraordinary path into Washington. Some 95 percent of his fundraising came from outside the district. Hoffman, indeed, had some initial success. The original Republican nominee, Dede Scozzafava, dropped out of the race after polling showed her trailing both Hoffman and Owens. But when push came to shove, Hoffman lost. Why? Because those activists -- however well-meaning they might have been -- misunderstood the district. The 23rd is a Republican district, but it is not a particularly conservative one, having split its vote between Barack Obama and the moderate Republican John McHugh last November. If Nancy Pelosi is regarded suspiciously in the 23rd, so are Sarah Palin and Fred Thompson, who cut commercials and robocalls on behalf of Hoffman. What the voters there wanted was a candidate who understood them. Owens -- superior to Hoffman in his command of local issues -- provided the best approximation. Alternatively, consider the outcome in New Jersey, where Republican Chris Christie knocked off incumbent Gov. Jon Corzine. This election is being touted as a referendum on Obama, who took a risk -- a bad one, indeed -- by campaigning on behalf of Corzine. But Obama was the least of Corzine's problems: Voters in Tuesday's election approved of Obama's performance 57 percent to 43 percent, according to exit polling. It was Corzine they didn't like; 27 percent of the voters who approved of Obama nevertheless found someone other than the Democratic incumbent to vote for. Corzine, for his part, ran a polarizing campaign; every time Christie's name appeared in one of his commercials, it came with a scarlet (R) -- for Republican -- attached. Republicans are not popular in New Jersey, but local issues drove the race. Whereas three-quarters of Corzine's voters cited a national issue -- health care or the economy -- as their primary reason for voting for him, two-thirds of Christie's picked a local one (property taxes and corruption). There is a much stronger case that national factors were in play in Virginia. The voters who turned out there Tuesday were more likely to have supported John McCain than Obama last year. Obama carried the state by 6 percentage points last year. But exit polls found that 51 percent of this year's voters in Virginia were people who had voted for McCain. Even a strong Democratic candidate would have struggled under the circumstances. But Democrats also made a mistake in thinking that Creigh Deeds, who hails from rural Bath County on the West Virginia border and wears his upbringing on his sleeve, would be the best candidate to represent them in the state. In many other states -- Ohio, say --  it's the rural, working-class vote that swings elections. But that's not the case in Virginia, which is one of the wealthiest and most suburban states in the country. There, suburban moderates such as Mark Warner tend to do better. Deeds might have been the right candidate -- but he was in the wrong state. State-level politics, indeed, routinely differ from national ones. That's why you have Democratic governors in red states such as Oklahoma and Wyoming, but Republican ones in blue states such as Vermont and Hawaii. That does not mean that local elections can't tell us anything about national trends -- the White House would be feeling better, certainly, if Democrats had won New Jersey, and likewise Republicans if they'd won NY-23. But usually the party that applies a one-size-fits-all approach to local races is the losing one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nate Silver.","This year's elections more about local concerns than national ones, says Nate Silver .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A restaurateur has gone to great lengths to tackle the spread of the H1N1 virus in his eatery, including taking staff's temperatures before they start work and preventing them from touching plates directly. Kitchen staff at Silk and Soya restaurant in Spain wear face masks and gloves while preparing food. Silk and Soya, a Thai-themed restaurant in Madrid, Spain, implemented the measures to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, in the upscale locale. ""We implemented these measures so that our employees would serve only food, not a virus,"" restaurant owner Cipri Quintas told CNN.   As well as employees having their temperatures taken before starting their shifts, windows are opened to aerate the restaurant before meals. Each table is set at least one meter -- 3.2 feet -- from any other table.   Any member of the kitchen staff involved in food preparation must wear a mask and gloves, and waiters are required to hold napkins when carrying plates to avoid touching them directly with their hands. Upon entering the elevators leading to the top-floor restaurant, customers find an automatic disinfectant gel dispenser.  At each table, diners find a packet of gel next to their silverware. The restaurant's restroom doors are propped open, the lights turn on automatically and the faucets are hands-free -- measures intended to keep customers from having to touch surfaces after they've washed their hands.   Similar initiatives are under way around the world. Last spring, during the peak of the scare in Mexico City, restaurants were closed for 12 days. When the restaurants reopened, the government ordered owners to put extra space between the tables and not to allow more than half of seats to be filled at any given time; cooks and waiters were mandated to wear surgical masks.   The World Health Organization's Web site states that hand-washing is one of the best ways to prevent infection and provides instructions with drawings that can be printed and posted in public places, such as restaurants. Silk and Soya's Quintas started his anti-H1N1 measures in August and has already proved popular with some customers. Simona Savin, who was having lunch, told CNN, ""These are measures you don't see everywhere. Here you have everything. They are great because there's a need for hygiene.""   Another diner, swimming coach Fernando Barea, said, ""We came to the restaurant because we heard good things about it and I wanted to see these measures against the H1N1 flu. These measures should be used by other restaurants.""   Quintas predicted they soon will be. ""People from other businesses like hotels and theaters have called us asking, 'What have you done? Can we come see your setup?' There's been a big response,"" said Quintas.   He insisted that his goal is not solely to garner publicity, but to protect his customers and staff -- a responsibility, he said, that the business community at large should undertake.   One expert on the disease applauded the efforts and recommended they be broadened.  ""They should implement them every winter against all respiratory diseases,"" said Dr. Tom Jefferson, a medical epidemiologist with the Cochrane Collaboration. The international organization reviews health care interventions and ""promotes the search for evidence in the form of clinical trials and other studies of interventions,"" according to its Web site.   As of September 13, the WHO had tallied more than 296,000 cases worldwide, 3,486 of them fatal.","Thai-themed restaurant in Madrid implements anti H1N1 flu measures .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Is the United States the ""greatest country on earth""? You hear that a lot, or phrases like that, during this presidential campaign. Candidates may attack other candidates, or the sitting president, but they never attack the idea that America is special, a ""city upon a hill."" ""The last, best hope of Earth."" It's part of America's ideology and its tradition of political rhetoric. To many Americans' ears, it sounds normal. But to citizens of other countries it's sometimes jarring, as if Americans put their country ahead of any other, as if the United States thinks it has the right to tell the rest of the world what to do. We went to the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. and asked visitors if they agree America ""knows best"" and the United States has an obligation to spread its values around the world. Almost everyone we talked with did not agree. Rachel Army, a teacher with a Washington, D.C. non-governmental organization, said: ""I have a lot of pride in our government however, at the same time, it is ours and I don't think that it is right to force it on other people."" Jermane Bonilla, from Los Angeles, said he thinks the United States is a special country, ""the most powerful nation on earth and the most beautiful country on earth, in my mind."" But, he told us ""it might not be the same model that everybody should be using."" They're not the exception, it turns out. In their book, ""America Against the World,"" Pew Research Center President Andrew Kohut and journalist Bruce Stokes say it's more often U.S. leaders who want to impose American values in other countries -- not the American people. The authors analyzed international surveys of people around the globe going back to the 1980's as well as more than 100,000 interviews in 60 countries. Their conclusion? ""Contrary to widespread misconceptions, Americans' pride in their country is not evangelistic. The American people, as opposed to some of their leaders, seek no converts to their ideology."" Citizens of many other countries, too, may think their national way of life is the best but, these authors say, ""they don't dominate the globe.""

Bliss does change her name, at least at the Roller Derby rink. She sneaks away from her square parents (Marcia Gay Harden as the U.S. Postal Service's least likely mail carrier and Daniel Stern as a nice schlub who likes beer) to roll with a sisterly Austin team who call themselves the Hurl Scouts. There, she dubs herself Babe Ruthless, making up in speed what she lacks in muscled aggression. She's heck on wheels, or so we are asked to believe: The rink footage is pretty un-whippy.

"(CNN) -- There will be no criminal charges filed in the death of a Green Beret who was electrocuted in his quarters in Iraq last year, the Department of Defense said Friday. Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, a 24-year-old Green Beret, died in a shower at his base in Iraq in January 2008. The Army's 11-month investigation ""concluded that there is insufficient evidence to prove or disprove that any one person, persons or entity was criminally culpable"" in the death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, the Department of Defense said in a written statement. Maseth, a 24-year-old decorated Green Beret from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was electrocuted in a shower in his Baghdad quarters -- a former palace of deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- in January 2008. ""The investigation revealed that there were numerous entities, individuals, both contractors and government employees, who breached their respective duties of care; however, none of those breaches, in and of themselves, were the proximate cause of his death,"" the Army said. A report released last month from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Maseth's death stemmed from failures both by the U.S. military and by military contractor KBR. The company did not properly ground and inspect electrical equipment, the inspector general's report found, while Maseth's commanders failed to ensure that renovations to the building where he was based had been properly done. The Army did not set electrical standards for jobs or contractors. KBR has said the palace was not properly grounded by contractors when it was built. The Pentagon report concluded that KBR failed to ground a water pump at the building, and the company did not report improperly grounded equipment during routine maintenance. Maseth's family is suing the company. After the Pentagon inspector general's report Sens. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, both Democrats, called on the Pentagon last month to take back more than $83 million in bonuses paid to KBR. Casey said the Pentagon should fine KBR: ""Make it hurt and make it count."" The Department of Defense said there were 18 reported deaths caused by electrocution in Iraq since the war began and that a task force designed to assess fire and electrical safety issues in Iraq was created ""after a series of electrical accidents and incidents."" The task force has inspected more than 67,000 of the approximately 90,000 pieces of equipment and facilities in Iraq. Almost 14,000 deficiencies have been corrected, the department said.","Army: Probe reveals ""numerous entities ... breached their respective duties""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Actor Tim Roth is in an abandoned building near downtown Los Angeles, and he's about to mix things up. British actor Tim Roth plays a human lie detector on the hit series ""Lie to Me."" ""This is a scene where the FBI is interrogating a suspect,"" Roth said. ""I'm breaking into the interrogation to get information out of him using the sort of techniques that my character espouses as opposed to pressuring him."" Roth, who plays Dr. Cal Lightman on the hit Fox series ""Lie to Me,"" is shooting scenes for the season finale, which will air May 13. His character is an expert on body language and the detection of deception. ""Our series is based on the idea that we can read what's going on across your face and if it's contradicting what you're actually saying,"" Roth said. Lightman and his colleague, Dr. Gillian Foster -- played by Kelli Williams -- run ""The Lightman Group."" They observe body language and interpret what it means in order to help law enforcement agencies see through the bull. His character is based on Dr. Paul Ekman, a specialist who reads clues embedded in the human face, body and voice to expose the truth in criminal investigations. Ekman, who in 2001 was named as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century by the American Psychological Association, is a scientific consultant for the show. Roth says Ekman can be intimidating. ""He makes me very, very nervous, Paul, you know,"" he said. ""I mean, he's the sweetest man, as sweet as can be, but when he's around, you feel like your acting is really being judged."" Roth is perhaps best known for his outings with famed director Quentin Tarantino. The British actor pulled off a convincing American accent in the cult classics ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" He uses his true-Brit accent in ""Lie to Me,"" which debuted in January and is one of the season's few successful new dramas. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, critic-at-large Ken Tucker wrote that ""Like 'Monk' and 'Psych' and 'The Mentalist,' 'Lie' offers us an eccentric who's brought in by law enforcement to solve crimes."" Though he gave the show a B-minus, Tucker praised Roth for ""resist[ing] the cuddly/cranky."" The show has quickly found its fan base, though ratings have declined slightly since the show was put in its 8 p.m. Wednesday time slot, ahead of ""American Idol."" (The first five episodes aired after ""Idol."") ""I got stopped because one of my lights was out and I was coming back from work and the guy, the cop that stopped me said 'Oh, we watch your show' and they seemed to enjoy it,"" said Roth. ""ER"" alum Mekhi Phifer is set to join the cast as an FBI agent for two episodes this season, starting Thursday. ""I'm here to kick ass and take names, you know. So it's kind of different,"" Phifer said. ""It's fun, you know. Obviously, I carry a gun and I'm in law enforcement rather than being a doctor."" Phifer particularly likes acting in intense scenes with Roth. ""I have my own way of doing it,"" he said. ""It's a little different than the way Tim does it. It's a lot of fun, and we're having a great time."" And will time spent on the show help Phifer better detect when people are lying to him in real life? ""It's going to take a few more episodes, but I'm pretty perceptive,"" he said. Roth, however, makes no claims of special powers -- at least when he's away from the set. ""I try not to know too much, because it actually is quite extraordinary,"" he says. ""When you watch politicians on TV, you can use the stuff that Paul does to see if they're lying or not. I try not to take it home.""","British actor Tim Roth stars in the hit Fox series ""Lie to Me""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has been asked to investigate whether Panama tortured an Ecuadorian citizen who was being held as an illegal immigrant, an official hemispheric human rights organization said. Jesus Tranquilino Velez Loor was arrested November 11, 2002, and deported to Ecuador on September 10, 2003. During that time, he was held without receiving procedural guarantees, the right to be heard and the right to present a defense, said the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. ""The case also involves the lack of investigation of complaints of torture presented by Mr. Velez Loor before the Panamanian authorities, as well as the inhumane conditions of detention under which he was held in several Panamanian penitentiaries,"" the human rights commission said in a release Tuesday. The human rights panel, which is part of the 35-nation Organization of American States, said it referred the case to the court last week because Panama did not adopt sufficient measures to address issues raised in a previous commission report. Velez Loor ""was sentenced to a prison term for having repeatedly entered Panama illegally. ... Panamanian law provides that foreign nationals, who repeatedly enter Panama, without the necessary papers, will be imprisoned for two years and then deported,"" Panama said in a 2006 report. Velez Loor admitted he had gone into Panama without proper papers or visas. The commission said it received an e-mailed complaint from Velez Loor on February 10, 2004, ""in which he claims to have undergone torture, forced isolation, and mistreatment at the hands of Panamanian police officers at two Panamanian detention centers without being given the opportunity to defend himself, without the benefit of any court of law, without being allowed to make a telephone call and while being deprived of all medical care."" Panama denied those allegations in the 2006 human rights commission report. Officials at the Panamanian embassy in Washington did not return a telephone request Tuesday from CNN for comment on the latest development. The human rights commission consists of seven members who act in a personal capacity, without representing any country, and who are elected by the OAS General Assembly.","Commission says it received complaint from Velez Loor in 2004 of alleged torture .

"BROOKLYN, New York (CNN) -- Every Friday evening, the Nunez family sits down to a traditional religious dinner. Moshe Nunez and his family moved to Crown Heights, a New York neighborhood with thousands of Hasidic Jews. Like most families in their Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, their Jewish Sabbath meal includes blessings over the wine and bread, the company of family and friends and excellent food. But for the Nunez family, the Sabbath table would not be complete without salsa picada and jalapeno dip. Moshe Nunez, an information technology consultant and motivational speaker, was born to a Mexican father and American mother and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico. His wife, ChanaLeah, grew up in Panama, the daughter of a Salvadoran mother and American-born father. ""Our home is a Latin American home,"" Nunez says. ""We bring into our home a mixture of the American and Latin culture, and that's reflected in the way we eat. We also enjoy hosting guests, so it's a very Hispanic thing, and a Jewish thing."" The couple and their two children moved to Brooklyn's Crown Heights area about five years ago so their son, Michael, 17, and daughter, Simcha, 18, could have ""the best Jewish education available,"" Nunez says. Crown Heights is the headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a branch of Hasidism that is itself a form of Orthodox Judaism. Among the thousands of Hasidic families in the neighborhood, a significant number are also Latinos, Nunez says. ""There are a lot of Latin American Jews here,"" Nunez says. ""Some of them have moved from countries like Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina, where there's political unrest. We make a life here, settle down and become part of the fabric of American society, but we still don't lose our roots."" Join the conversation: How has America changed Latinos? Many non-Jewish Latinos are surprised to see Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn who speak Spanish, carry on their Hispanic traditions and even keep up with soccer scores from their home countries, Nunez says. Although Moshe and ChanaLeah Nunez were raised in Christian homes, they believe that Moshe's family name is proof that his ancestors are Marranos -- Jews who were forced to denounce or abandon their faith centuries ago in Europe. Moshe Nunez began studying his family genealogy about 13 years ago, while the family was living in Atlanta, Georgia. He met Lorraine Nunez, a woman raised as a Christian who believed she was a direct descendant of Samuel Nunez, a Portuguese physician who fled Europe in the early 1700s to help start one of the oldest Jewish synagogues in the United States, Congregation Mikve Israel in Savannah, Georgia. Like other Marranos living in Europe, Samuel Nunez pretended to be Catholic and practiced Judaism in secret, according to Chabad.org, the Chabad-Lubavitch movement's Web site. Meeting Lorraine Nunez inspired Moshe Nunez -- who was still going by his Christian name, Marco -- to further explore his own genealogy. ChanaLeah -- who was going by her Christian name, Jacqueline -- had already known that her grandfather, a well-known army colonel in El Salvador, was Jewish. Like many Jews of his time, he hid his Judaism and married a non-Jewish woman. Marco and Jacqueline believed that their descendants were also Marranos from Spain and Portugal who had to hide their Judaism for fear of persecution. ""The Nunez family started as a Jewish name,"" Moshe Nunez says. ""During the Inquisition they were forced to convert or practice their faith in secret. Most of the Nunez family... like mine assimilated and lost their Judaism.""  Watch Nunez talk about his life in Crown Heights » . While researching his genealogy, Moshe Nunez also began to study the Bible more closely, including the Torah, the first five books of the Old Testament. ""When I began studying the Torah, I saw that the Sabbath was on Saturday and not Sunday,"" he says. ""That opened [a] Pandora's Box,"" he says, figuring that ""if the Jews had the Sabbath right, maybe they have other stuff right, too."" Around that time, the Nunez family relocated to Milan, Italy, for Nunez' work as a consultant. Marco and Jacqueline -- who changed their names to the Hebrew Moshe and ChanaLeah while in Italy -- continued their Judaic studies under the tutelage of Orthodox rabbis and decided to undergo an Orthodox conversion to Judaism. ""When I got to Italy and continued to research our family name and studied the Torah, I decided we were going to live a Jewish life,"" Nunez says. The Jewish community in Milan welcomed the family ""with open arms,"" Moshe said. ""The rabbi said to me, 'Moshe, you are Jewish, you were always Jewish.'"" Moshe says he and ChanaLeah ""took every step together,"" going through a formal conversion process. As part of the process Moshe and his son had ritual circumcisions. (They had both been circumcised at birth.) The final step was for the family to appear before a Beit Din, or religious council, to approve the conversion. ""We decided we had to make our full return to Judaism, and we had such good mazal (luck) because the rabbis made it relatively easy. They saw that we were serious people that had studied the religion,"" Nunez says. The Nunez family's story is not out of the ordinary, says Rabbi Shea Rubenstein, an Argentine rabbi who leads the Jewish Latin American Connection at The Shul in Surfside, Florida. ""We have a very vibrant synagogue, and a very large percentage happen to be from Spanish background from countries such as Venezuela, Peru, Argentina, Mexico and Cuba,"" the rabbi says. Rubenstein says that quite a few non-Jewish Hispanics come to The Shul to learn more about Judaism, and while they may not be able to prove they are Jewish, they believe they are descendants of Jews and seek to reconnect with their Jewish roots. If a person wants to practice Judaism but cannot verify their Jewish roots, Rubenstein recommends they go through a formal conversion as the Nunez family did. ""It's difficult to verify because there's some 400 or 500 years of history that people cannot trace, especially since Judaism is passed through the mother and the last name reflects that of the father,"" Rubenstein says. Inspired by their experiences, Moshe and ChanaLeah -- both songwriters and musicians -- wrote a song called ""Jews of Spain,"" with lyrics in Spanish, English and Hebrew. Nunez recorded the song, part of the album ""Kol Haneshema (Every Soul)."" Aside from his work as a consultant and musician, Nunez leads seminars, conducts a weekly program called Quality Life Now at the Empire State Building and teaches weekly Webinars from his Brooklyn home. His seminars, taught in both Spanish and English, focus on seven core values found in the Old Testament. The seven values are often referred to as the Noahide Laws. According to the Bible, the laws were given from God to Noah to serve as a moral code for all humankind. ""I've taken the seven Noahide Laws and I teach them as universal core values, so everyday people can apply them to their lifestyle,"" Nunez says. He says he hopes to share his teachings with all of mankind, regardless of religion, to help them lead a more meaningful life. ""Sharing the knowledge of Torah to the world through education, songs and acts of kindness will help ensure that what happened to the Marranos during the Inquisition will never happen again.""","Moshe and ChanaLeah Nunez are Latino Jews who were raised in Christian homes .

"PRETORIA, South Africa (CNN)  -- The president of Athletics South Africa has admitted that he lied about gender tests on runner Caster Semenya before her gold-medal win at the World Athletics Championships last month. Caster Semenya celebrates her gold at the world championships in Berlin. The national sports body has always denied that it agreed to the tests before the race in Berlin, Germany -- an event that kicked off international controversy over the 18-year-old Semenya's gender. But after South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper printed e-mails on Friday showing that ASA President Leonard Chuene was aware of the tests, he held a news conference to apologize. ""I now realize that it was an error of judgment and I would like to apologize unconditionally,"" Chuene said on Saturday, according to South Africa's SAPA news agency. After receiving the results of the tests, the South Africa team doctor requested the 18-year-old Semenya be withdrawn from the 800-meter race she ended up winning, Chuene said. But Chuene said he refused to do it because the sport's international governing body did not request withdrawal. He also said withdrawing Semenya might have looked bad. ""If we did not let her run, we would be confirming that she is not normal,"" Chuene told the news conference in the capital, Pretoria. The e-mails printed by the Mail & Guardian are an exchange between team doctor Harold Adams and ASA General Manager Molatelo Malehopo, with Chuene copied in. ""After thinking about the current confidential matter I would suggest that we make the following decisions,"" Adams wrote on August 5, more than a week before the Berlin race. ""1. We get a (gynecological) opinion and take it to Berlin. 2. We do nothing and I will handle these issues if they come up in Berlin. Please think and get back to me ASAP."" An e-mail response from Malehopo to Adams, sent the same day, says: ""I will suggest that you go ahead with the necessary tests that the IAAF might need."" The controversy over Semenya erupted after she crushed her rivals in the 800 meters and secured victory in one minute, 55.45 seconds -- the best women's time in the world this year. Semenya's masculine build and dominant performance fueled existing questions about her gender, and the International Association of Athletics Federations -- which oversees the sport worldwide -- ordered tests on her. Reports in two newspapers last week said the results of the tests showed Semenya has both male and female characteristics. The IAAF declined to confirm those reports and said a decision in the case would come in late November. The IAAF said it sought tests on Semenya's gender before the Berlin championships because questions had been raised after her winning performance at the African junior championships in July. South Africans have rallied behind Semenya, angrily dismissing reports about her gender. Semenya's relatives and the South Africa team manager have maintained she is female. This week, South Africa's minister for women, children and people with disabilities wrote to the United Nations to complain that Semenya had not been treated in line with international protocols on gender and quality. Noluthando Mayende-Sibiya sent a letter to the U.N. Division for the Advancement of Women, urging it to investigate, SAPA reported. ""The questioning of her gender is based on a stereotypic view of the physical features and abilities attributable to women,"" she wrote in the letter, according to SAPA. ""Such stereotypes demonstrate the extent of patriarchy within the world's sporting community."" The process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s, the IAAF said. The first mechanism involved ""rather crude and perhaps humiliating physical examinations,"" which soon gave way to mouth swabs to collect chromosomes. There were too many uncertainties with mouth swabs, so the IAAF abandoned them in 1991 and the International Olympic Committee discontinued them in 2000. A proper test has yet to be found, the IAAF said, and the current tests are considered a good interim solution.","President of Athletics South Africa admits that he lied about gender tests .

"(CNN) -- The solution to ending an abusive relationship seems simple: Walk out the door. But for an abused woman, leaving can be a confusing process, complex at every step, said a newly published article in an University of Illinois journal. Co-author and graduate student Lyndal Khaw told CNN that abused women actually go through a five-step process of leaving that involves denial, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance. And the transition from one step to another is hardly seamless, Khaw said. ""Some women can skip stages, some repeat a cycle of going back and forth to other steps and others go through the motions -- going from one stage to another"", she said. In their study, Khaw and co-author Jennifer Hardesty, an assistant professor of human and community development, applied their model to 25 abused women. The report was published recently in the Journal of Family Theory and Review. Khaw said that moving from step to step can put a strain on those who are being supportive to an abused woman because they can have a hard time understanding why she returns or refuses to leave. Hardesty said that physically leaving a relationship entails more than a woman's decision to embrace change and prioritizing her own safety. The abuser can affect her decisions, as can children, who can motivate her to return to the relationship, Hardesty said. Even though a woman may return to the abuser at some point, practitioners and women themselves need to understand that every time the woman disengages she gains additional resources and support, Hardesty said. ""So next time she is contemplating and preparing she'll be stronger and perhaps more likely to stay out of that relationship,"" she said. Khaw said service providers, family members and other sources of support need to recognize the stages of what can be a lengthy -- and risky -- process. ""When trying to leave, abusers may get more violent,"" Khaw said. Recognition of the five-step process can be helpful to abused women, Hardesty said. ""Not all women are ready to leave, but recognizing it's a process can be empowering,"" she said.","Authors say leaving abuse can be a confusing process, complex at every step .
