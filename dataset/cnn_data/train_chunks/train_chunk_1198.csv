"The United States tortured al-Qaeda detainees captured after the 9/11 attacks, President Obama said Friday, in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of CIA practices that he banned after taking office. 'We tortured some folks,' Obama said at a televised news conference at the White House. 'We did some things that were contrary to our values.' Addressing the impending release of a Senate report that criticizes CIA treatment of detainees, Obama said he believed the mistreatment stemmed from the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack. He said Americans should not be quick to pass judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day. ''It's important not for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect,' he said. Obama said Friday that a forthcoming Senate report will confirm that the U.S. tortured al-Qaeda detainees after 9/11 . In a picture that became emblematic of U.S. torture, an unidentified detainee was forced to stand on a box with a bag on his head and wires attatched to him in late 2003 . Hooded protesters were common sights in front of the White House in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration, after methods of torture practiced against al-Qaeada detainees were first aired publicly and then-Vice President Dick Cheney worked to exempt the CIA from a ban on 'enhanced interrogation' techniques . 'I understand why it happened. I think it's important to recall ... how afraid people were' after the 9/11 attacks, Obama added. 'People did not know if more attacks were imminent.' That view, which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency, explains why Obama did not push to pursue criminal charges against the Bush era officials who carried out the CIA program. To this day, many of those officials insist that what they did was not torture, which is a felony under U.S. law. The president's comments are a blow to those former officials, as well as an estimated 200 people currently working at the CIA who played some role in the interrogation program. In 2009, Obama said he preferred to 'look forward, not backwards,' on the issue, and he decided that no CIA officer who was following legal guidance_however flawed that guidance turned out to be – should be prosecuted. A long-running criminal investigation into whether the CIA exceeded the guidance – which is an allegation of the Senate report – was closed in 2012 without charges. Still, Obama's remarks on Friday were more emphatic than his previous comments on the subject, including a May 2009 speech in which he trumpeted his ban of 'so-called enhanced interrogation techniques,' and 'brutal methods,' but did not flatly say the U.S. had engaged in torture. At an April 2009 new conference, he said, 'I believe that waterboarding was torture and, whatever legal rationales were used, it was a mistake.' In addition to water boarding, the CIA used stress positions, sleep deprivation, nudity, humiliation, cold and other tactics that, taken together, were extremely brutal, the Senate report is expected to say. Obama on Friday did not mention a specific method, but he said the CIA used techniques that 'any fair minded person would believe were torture.' Obama banned torture techniques after he took office in 2009, but acknowledged the nature of the interrogation methods on Friday, saying Americans shouldn't be 'sanctimonious' about them in retrospect . 'Against our values' and not just by the CIA: American soldiers were filmed posing with nude, hooded Iraqi prisoners at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison . 'We crossed a line,' he said. 'That needs to be understood and accepted...We did some things that were wrong, and thats what that report reflects.' Obama on Friday did not address two other central arguments of the soon-to-be-released Senate report – that the brutal interrogations didn't produce life-saving intelligence, and that the CIA lied to other elements of the U.S. government about exactly what it was doing. The president also expressed confidence in his CIA director, John Brennan, in the wake of an internal CIA report documenting that the spy agency improperly accessed Senate computers. There have been calls for his resignation on Capitol Hill. Obama said the internal report made clear that ""some very poor judgment was shown,"" but he seemed to say it wasn't Brennan's fault, and he praised his director for ordering the inquiry in the first place.","CIA used water boarding, stress positions, sleep deprivation, nudity, humiliation, cold and other tactics against al-Qaeda detainees .

"A chip shop owner has removed a ‘racist’ banner boasting that the business now had ‘English owners’, after his predecessor received threats to burn it down. Previous owner Paul Bradbury - who put the sign up at the Chippy on the Green in Padiham, Lancashire, after taking it over last August - has gone back to Liverpool with his wife Rachel after shutting up shop. The couple had put a banner outside which said ‘Under new management with English owners’ - but Mr Bradbury said that he received two threatening phone calls from people calling him racist. Edited: Sotos Orfanides, the new owner of the Chippy on the Green, has adapted the sign to read 'Under new management with English meals' Gone: Original owner Paul Bradbury (pictured last year) - who put the sign up at the Chippy on the Green in Padiham, Lancashire, after they took it over last August - has gone back to Liverpool with his wife Rachel . They left the shop and moved away from the area earlier this year - and new owner Sotos Orfanides has now adapted the sign to read ‘Under new management with English meals’. Mr Orfanides, who is originally from Cyprus and also owns a Greek restaurant in Liverpool, had previously been renting the Chippy on the Green to Mr and Mrs Bradbury. Sign: The Bradburys had put a banner outside which said 'Under new management with English owners' He said: ‘I don’t think the original sign was racist, but there was a big thing about it being racist. No one is racist in this shop. They were English and they were serving some English food. ‘I changed the sign because people were calling and threatening to burn the shop down. I care about the business, so I changed it. Paul and Rachel went back to Liverpool because of the threats. They weren’t racist.’ The shop had previously been run by . English people of East Asian and of Greek descent. It used to sell . English and Chinese food, kebabs and pizza under Mr and Mrs Bradbury but . is now going to mainly sell fish and chips. A . Lancashire Police spokesman said at the time of the threats: ‘Police . officers from the Padiham neighbourhood team went to the shop after . becoming aware of the threats. ‘The owner told officers he did not want to pursue the matter and so we can’t take any further action.’ The shop was reopened last week after a refurbishment and is being managed by one of Mr Orfanides’s relatives. Mr . Bradbury’s story was featured in MailOnline last August, and he said: . ‘I’m not racist. Anyone who thinks I’m a bigot is narrow-minded. ‘People . want to know they are going to be served by somebody English. People . have said to us that they are glad somebody English is serving them and . that the sign made them want to come in. In the past: The shop had previously been run by English people of East Asian and of Greek descent. It is pictured here in September 2009, four years before Mr and Mrs Bradbury took over in August 2013 . ‘They’ve never had anyone in the shop before. We are advertising that we are English.

"They hired some of the most famous women in the country and a celebrity photographer to showcase their latest collection – forking out £5million for  the privilege. But Marks & Spencer’s make-or-break advertising campaign has failed to deliver a much-needed boost to sales. M&S yesterday revealed that its sales of fashion and general merchandise have fallen, a trend that has hampered the firm for more than two years. Meanwhile, budget brand Primark is faring much better announcing record profits of £154million last year. Flop? The leading ladies show off the M&S collection, but but clothing and general merchandise sales are down yet again . Mixed fortunes: Primark has today announced record profits as struggling rival Marks & Spencer revealed its ninth consecutive quarter of falling clothing sales and a drop in profits . Christmas hope: This week M&S launches its Christmas 'Believe in Magic and Sparkle' advertisement which has a glossy Alice in Wonderland theme and stars Rosie Huntington-Whiteley . The store's total sales rose by 22 per cent, while its like-for-like figures were also up five per cent  in the year to 14 September, pushing up their profits 44 per cent. Unlike M&S, it relied on a reputation for low prices rather than expensive marketing campaigns to drive sales. M&S . figures come despite its ‘Leading Ladies’ initiative, starring the . likes of Dame Helen Mirren and Tracey Emin and photographed by Annie . Leibovitz, which was meant to propel the firm in a new direction. The . chain faces a make-or-break Christmas to turn round its fortunes as as . its first-half pre-tax profits for 2013 declined by nine per cent to . £261.1million, well down on the £289.5million the previous year. The High Street stalwart also revealed that like-for-like clothing and homeware sales fell 1.3 per cent during its July to September quarter. However, . M&S' food halls continue to do a roaring trade with like-for-like . sales up 3.2 per cent, and its share price was up 15p this morning. The numbers will increase the pressure . on chief executive Marc Bolland, who will be disappointed that clothing . sales have refused to recover and will blame the unseasonably warm . autumn weather and fierce competition on the High Street. Bolland . attempted to revive clothes sales, particularly womenswear, earlier . this year when he unveiled a new autumn/winter collection that analysts . described as 'make or break' for M&S and its chief executive. He said of the latest results: '‘This is a journey. We’ve been clear that people should look at it from season to season. It will take a few collections to get a positive momentum behind it.’ The latest sales figures cover the period up to the end of September, so Bolland will defend performance and say that a fuller picture of its autumn/winter collection’s success will be due in January. This week M&S launches its Christmas ‘Believe in Magic and Sparkle’ advertisement with a glossy Alice in Wonderland theme. It stars Rosie Huntingdon-Whitely as Alice, David Gandy as the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Wizard of Oz. It makes this year’s Christmas trading period even more crucial, and if it did not go well his job may be under threat. In contrast to the struggles of M&S as it tries to kickstart its clothing sales, AB Foods paid tribute to Primark's buying teams after autumn/winter and spring/summer ranges sold out with little discount. Primark's expansion in the UK has been focused on increasing selling space in major cities, with the opening of its second store on London's Oxford Street and extensions to shops in Newcastle and Manchester. The company expects to add more than a million square feet of space in the current year, including its first store in France, which will open in Marseille. It said its new store formats provided an 'exciting, fashionable and fun shopping experience'. Embarrassing: The retailer, which has just reported a  9.1 per cent slump in half-year profits, blamed a supplier for the mistake that lists Father's Day as June 22 instead of June 15 . Glamour: Welcome to the Mad Hatter's tea party, hosted by model David Gandy in Autograph menswear . Pressure: The numbers will increase the pressure on chief executive Marc Bolland, who will be disappointed that clothing sales have refused to recover . The company added: 'Strategically-placed mannequins help to inspire customers to choose outfits that are readily available on adjacent fixtures, and prominent signage and wider aisles enable easy navigation through the store. 'We are also enhancing customer service by providing a higher ratio of fitting rooms and cash registers to ensure a smoother experience when trying on outfits and paying for them.' In April, a building in Bangladesh occupied on one of its floors by a Primark supplier collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people. Another disastrous festive trading period will further test shareholders’ patience who have become disillusioned with the retail giant’s performance since Bolland took over in May 2010. Freddie George, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, believes although the company is adopting the right strategy to revitalise its womenswear, he continues to have a number of concerns. He says: ‘It will take a number of seasons before there is a marked improvement in performance in womenswear.’","Primark hails 'outstanding year' as profits up 44% after sales boom of 22% .

"Jon Stewart has been attacking the Republicans all week over the government shutdown but he took aim at a member of his own party on Monday night. Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, was probably expecting a soft-ball interview about the roll out of President Obama's signature health care plan but instead she was left backpedalling to try to recover from his pointed criticisms. The Comedy Central host started by poking fun at how long the online marketplace takes to load, saying that it was comparable to the amount of time it would take to download all of the movies ever created. WATCH THE VIDEOS HERE . Making sense of it all: Jon Stewart could hardly contain his laugh as Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius tried to explain why it was acceptable for businesses to get a delay and not individuals . After going for the easy laugh, things turned much more serious when he brought up a 'legitimate criticism' that Republicans have made. Businesses with more than 50 full time employees have been given a delay so that they don't have to provide health insurance for their employees for another year, whereas individuals have to sign up by December 15 or face a fine. He asked the question repeatedly and Sebelius gave no clear answer, touting the benefits instead and saying that this program will give people more freedom to choose between affordable plans than ever before. 'Let me ask you this- am I a stupid man?' Stewart said at one point. She attempted to explain that 15 per cent of the country that is made up of individuals who are not already covered due to their existing company plans- as 85 per cent of the country that is already insured. Both those 15 per cent and the already-covered 85 per cent have no control over when they get sick, and everyone has to be able to walk into an emergency room and be treated. That explanation fell short, however, but at one point Stewart got her to confirm the following synopsis regarding the fee that individuals face come December: 'What you're saying to the American public is that some of you will face a penalty for the greater good,' he said and Sebelius agreed. Talking points: Sebelius touted the same line throughout, saying that the health care law gives people more choices than they've ever had but doesn't account for the fine they will pay if they are slow in signing up . Unimpressed: Stewart made it clear that he found Sebelius' explanations insufficient . 'Let me tell you why it may seem that I'm a little hard on this: for those of us who are somewhat believing that the opposition right now in Washington are crazy people... it feels like it's frustrating to have to defend something that is less than ideal, or is functioning at what seems to be a level of incompetence that is larger that’s larger than what it should be,' he said later. She tried her own version of sarcastic, deadpan comedy but it didn't go very far on stage. 'As you know, we’re facing the end of the Western Civilization by having a market-based strategy,' Sebelius said. 'We’re bringing Western Civilization its knees by having a private insurance plan on a website where people pick and choose.' Many have been anxious about the enrollment numbers so far, and Sebelius was careful not to reveal too much, saying only that 'hundreds of thousands' of accounts have been created but that does not necessarily transition into the number of people who have actually bought a health insurance plan. None of this met Stewart's standards, however, as used his final sign off to call the Secretary a liar. 'I still don’t understand why individuals have to sign up and businesses don’t, because if the businesses — if she’s saying, ""well, they get a delay because that doesn’t matter anyway because they already give health care,"" then you think to yourself, ""f*** it, then why do they have to sign up at all,""' he said. 'And then I think to myself, ""well, maybe she’s just lying to me?""'","Jon Stewart interviewed Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius about the roll out of Obamacare .

"David Cameron and Nick Clegg are set to create up to 50 new peers this week – packing the House of Lords with political cronies after promising to slash its size. The Prime Minister and his Liberal Democrat deputy proposed legislation that would have cut the 800-strong Lords to only 450. But senior Whitehall sources say the reform plans have been scrapped and the Coalition is set to announce around 50 new peers – including high-profile party donors. Packed: David Cameron and Nick Clegg are set to create 50 new peers this week and 100 over two years . Around 15 are expected to be Lib Dems, . including Rumi Verjee, the businessman who brought Domino's Pizza to . Britain and gave £775,000 to the party. The plans put Mr Cameron on course to create the most peers in a Parliament of any Prime Minister in recent memory. He has already ennobled 125 at a rate of nearly 50 a year, compared with an average of 35 for Tony Blair and only 15 for Margaret Thatcher. A further 100 Lords will be created over the next two years in pursuit of the Coalition's goal of making the composition of the Upper House match the result of the general election. Cronies: Businessman Rumi Verjee is set to become a Lib Dem peer, having donated £775,000 to the party . This will raise the Lords to a bloated talking shop of more than 900 members. Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett today brands the move an insult to the intelligence of the public after the reduction plans were ditched because Mr Clegg did not get his wish of an elected second chamber. Critic: Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett has branded the move an insult to the intelligence of the public . In an article for the Daily Mail, Mr Blunkett writes: 'As it happens, the House of Lords is already creaking at the seams. There are not enough coat pegs, never mind enough desks for their Lordships to sit at.' Mr Cameron confirmed earlier this month that it is still his goal to make the political balance of the Lords match that of the Commons. To ensure that the distribution of seats between the three main parties in the 2010 general election is mirrored in the Lords would require 67 new Conservative peers and 88 Liberal Democrats – 155 in all. That would give the Tories 297, Labour their current 224 and the Liberal Democrats 178. Tory and Lib Dem sources both confirmed that around 50 peers was the 'right ballpark' for nominations this week, leaving another 100 or so for the period before the general election. Controversially, the Government has also overturned a ban introduced after the cash for peerages scandal on people being nominated solely for work done in the political arena. Sources close to the deputy prime minister defended him against a charge of hypocrisy for creating new peers despite his wishes to slash the size of the Lords. A source said: 'You have to deal with the world as you find it, rather than the world as you would like it to be. 'If it was up to us we would have an entirely democratically elected House of Lords.'

"Jailed: Bhadresh Gohil was convicted of money laundering and given a 10-year prison sentence . A mother-of-three has won the right to demand a bigger divorce payout from her ex-husband - after he was jailed for handling cash for a £50million fraudster. Varsha Gohil accepted £270,000 and the family Peugeot from solicitor Bhadresh Gohil in 2004 after divorcing him for alleged adultery and unreasonable behaviour. But in 2010 he was jailed for ten years for money laundering after a court heard he helped millionaire Nigerian politician James Ibori steal around £50million from the oil-rich state he governed. Now she has been granted permission to seek a bigger payout in Britain's highest court after claiming he had not disclosed his full wealth when she agreed to the original settlement. It is the latest stage in a lengthy legal battle by Mrs Gohil. In June 2012 a High Court judge agreed she could fight the case, and a hearing was fixed for June this year. But in March three Appeal Court judges unanimously quashed that ruling and the hearing was cancelled. Now, however, Mrs Gohil has now won permission to take her case to the Supreme Court - where she will stand alongside a second woman fighting her own ex-husband. Mrs Gohill, from London, will fight the case next June with 46-year-old Alison Sharland, who is battling her software millionaire ex-husband. Mrs Sharland accepted £10.35million from AppSense founder Charles Sharland two years ago after their marriage of 17 years broke down. She agreed to the payout thinking it was worth half his fortune - yet his stake in the firm was estimated wildly higher at £150million soon afterwards, London's Court of Appeal heard. Ros Bever, a specialist divorce lawyer with Mrs Gohil's solicitors Irwin Mitchell, said: 'Dishonesty in any legal proceedings should not be tolerated; the family court should not be an exception. 'This is yet another case in which an unfair settlement has been agreed because of one party being dishonest and not sharing all the details of their wealth to the courts. 'We are pleased that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear this case alongside Alison Sharland's. Battle: Mrs Gohil will fight alongside Alison Sharland, 46 (left), who accepted £10.35m from her ex-husband Charles (right) in the belief it was half his fortune. His firm AppSense was later valued wildly higher . 'Both cases raise serious issues about how the courts should handle cases where information shared with the court and used to agree a divorce settlement is later found to be false or incomplete. 'We believe the situation that both women find themselves in is unfair and that is why we applied for permission to take their cases to the Supreme Court. 'In this case the Court of Appeal judges admitted having sympathy with Mrs Gohil's situation. In our view if family law judges, who are given broad discretion to ensure fairness in proceedings, are having to acknowledge this then something in the letter of the law has stopped that fairness from prevailing. 'There are numerous legal arguments to be heard by the Supreme Court but we hope that ultimately justice will be done and will be seen to be done.' In the previous hearing, Lord Justice McFarlane offered Mrs Gohil his 'sympathy' but said it was 'simply not open to the court' to decide in 2012 about an issue discussed in 2004. The judge said that it was apparent that at some stage prior to 2007 'the husband became involved in offences of fraud and money laundering on an astonishing scale.' 'Mr Gohil was an out and out rogue involved in financial criminality on an eye-watering scale,' Lord Justice McFarlane said. Landmark: Mrs Gohil's case will be heard alongside that of Alison Sharland at the Supreme Court (pictured) 'To the eyes of the wife, and it seems the judge, it was possible to discern at least the outlines of a ""smoking gun"" indicating that the husband must have had substantial assets in and prior to 2004, which he deviously failed to disclose in the financial relief proceedings.' But there was no evidence Gohil had met Ibori before the middle of 2005 - more than a year after the payout was settled, the judge added. According to the judge, the jailed ex-husband said his wealth related only to a period after mid-2005 - and besides, as they have been found to represent proceeds of crime, they cannot be taken by his wife. The case will be decided after a Supreme Court hearing next June.","Varsha Gohil accepted £270k and Peugeot car from Bhadresh in 2004 .

"Even in victory, these are strange times at Old Trafford. The natives are restless and it will take more than a win over the 10 men of Sunderland to convince them that all is well at Manchester United under Louis van Gaal. Supporters booed when Jonny Evans passed the ball back to his goalkeeper David de Gea in the first half. They made no secret of their disapproval in the second when Van Gaal took off Radamel Falcao immediately after he had won a penalty. Until then, United had struggled to land a glove on a stubborn Sunderland side who played with Lee Cattermole sandwiched between two banks of four. Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 but Louis van Gaal still has a lot to do before the natives are happy . Gus Poyet isn’t the first to try it at Old Trafford and he certainly won’t be the last. But the way United struggled to break down their opponents for so long was not lost on their fans. They chanted ‘4-4-2’ when United laboured to victory at QPR in January, and ‘attack, attack, attack’ here after Evans had sent a long pass back to De Gea. The frustration is never far from the surface. One can sympathise with both Van Gaal and the supporters whom he is paid to please. At times this season United’s performances have not only fallen short of the cavalier football under Sir Alex Ferguson, they have been positively joyless. An exercise in attrition. Wayne Rooney celebrates his opened alongside Ashley Young as Manchester United beat Sunderland . While Van Gaal has tinkered with his tactics and personnel, the outcome has been largely the same. The 2-0 win over Sunderland followed an equally uninspiring 3-1 win over Burnley on United’s last home appearance when Chris Smalling scored two of the goals. Despite spending more than a £150million last summer on a squad that was far from shoddy in the first place – bringing the likes of Angel di Maria and Falcao with him to Manchester – the Dutchman has clearly struggled to make United a sum of their parts. Di Maria was awful here, Falcao full of running but offering little threat until he won the penalty with his last contribution of the game. Angel di Maria yet again struggled to impress for Manchester United and was subbed at half time . A generation of fans brought up on the thrills and spills of the Ferguson era are having to make do with something altogether less entertaining and a lot of them simply don’t like it. Even Van Gaal admits he is surprised they have been so patient at times. ‘In Barcelona, the white handkerchiefs would have come out,’ he said in December, reflecting on his first six months in English football. ‘In Bayern Munich, they would have been whistling. In Amsterdam, Ajax, they would have been shouting for my “friend” Cruyff. Here they stand up and applaud. Unbelievable.’ A relieved Manchester United celebrate Wayne Rooney's opener against Sunderland at Old Trafford . That goodwill has since become a little strained, but here’s the question. Performances or points? Ferguson delivered both but, for now, United fans may have choose one or the other. Van Gaal has been hired to get United back into the Champions League. They are in third place with 11 games to go and through to the FA Cup quarter-finals after losing just two of their last 21 games. The alarming decline of the David Moyes era has been arrested, at least in terms of results. Van Gaal has won a trophy in his first season everywhere else, and you wouldn’t bet against him doing it with United at Wembley in May. Just don’t expect the FA Cup final to be a classic. Rooney looks at Sunderland defender Wes Brown as Brown is sent off after he was shown a red card . If there’s any consolation for supporters, Van Gaal knows they deserve better. He has talked before about finding the ‘perfect game’, about the players needing time to buy into his ‘philosophy’ before it all comes good. In his programme notes for this game he wrote: ‘The signs in training, and also in some of the matches, show me that we are improving.

"Hillary Clinton left her post at the top of the U.S. State Department on Feb. 1, 2013, but the federal government spent more than $55,000 on travel expenses related to her book tour just last month, procurement documents show. The expenses included a $3,668 charge for her to enjoy a single night's lodging in a suite at the posh Four Seasons George V hotel in Paris. That rate corresponds to the cost of a suite with a 'large and superbly appointed marble bathroom,' a 'deep soaking tub,' 'sparkling chandeliers' and 'elegant period furniture,' according to the Four Seasons website. Double-whammy: Taxpayers forked over thousands for Mrs. Clinton to stay in the lap of luxury while she promoted her book overseas . Hardback diplomacy: Hillary was photographed with French President Francois Hollande -- and her book -- in Paris last month . Only the finest: The Four Seasons in Paris boasts rooms that start at about $1,400 per night . Should taxpayer money fund Hillary Clinton's book tour? Should taxpayer money fund Hillary Clinton's book tour? Now share your opinion . Purchase orders also show that taxpayers footed the bill for a $5,100 rental of three Mercedes-Benz executive limousine vans during a single day in Berlin. MailOnline could not locate records of hotel costs in the German capital. Rental cars for Secret Service agents in Paris totaled a whopping $11,291. The government spent another $35,183 on lodging there, but the purchase order doesn't say where Clinton's personal protection detail stayed. The one-time first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state was conducting interviews in Europe related to her book 'Hard Choices,' and was not traveling on official government business. In Paris, she was photographed repeatedly with French President Francois Hollande – and the 635-page tome. Tim Miller, executive director of the America Rising PAC, told MailOnline that the expense seems odd considering the size of Mrs. Clinton's well-publicized speaking fees, which often top $200,000 per appearance. 'Hillary's book tour through Europe was a fiscal double whammy – lining her pockets with outrageous speaking fees and billing the taxpayers for thousands in travel,' Miller said on Monday. The Department of Homeland Security paid for the van rentals in Berlin, billing the cost to its Office of Inspector General (OIG) – which normally has control over investigators, not bodyguards. 'I don't understand that,' Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told MailOnline. He said that sometimes the State Department arranges for foreign travel for dignitaries who get Secret Service protection. 'We would have requested the cars' in . Berlin and Paris, he added, 'because we want to have control of that car . that she rides in.' But 'I don't understand that OIG thing at all,' he said. Doing some inspecting? Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General -- not the Secret Service -- paid for Hillary's limousine rides in Berlin while she promoted a German translation of her book ('Entscheidungen') during an appearance at the State Opera Theatre . Expensive ride: DHS rented three custom Mercedes-Benz Viano vans like this one to ferry Clinton and her entourage around Berlin . First ladies have historically enjoyed Secret Service protection for life after they leave the White House. The same can't be said, however, for former cabinet secretaries, making it curious that the State Department's Paris Embassy was on the hook for the other costs. 'On a . foreign trip like that, State Department sometimes pays the original . bill and Secret Service might reimburse it later,' said Donovan. He added, however, that he couldn't say whether that would happen in this case. A press officer at State said she would hunt for information, including answers to the thorny question of whether her agency had paid for Clinton's private travel on other non-government trips.","$3,668 hotel suite at the posh Four Seasons George V hotel in Paris .

"As anger continues to swirl around syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh after referring to a law student as a 'slut,' even the president can't keep from weighing in. The backlash against Limbaugh has intensified in recent days, as an eighth advertiser has dropped its support of his radio program and two stations have pulled the plug on it. Limbaugh called Georgetown student Sandra Fluke a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' last week after she urged lawmakers to consider the importance of contraception coverage in health care policy. During President Obama's press conference today at the White House, he had little to say about the controversy at first. Scroll down for video... Controvery: During his first press conference of 2012, President Obama weighed in on the uproar surrounding radio host Rush Limbaugh, right, after he called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' on the air . 'I'm not going to comment on what sponsors decide to . do.  I'm not going to comment on either . the economics or the politics of it.  I . don't know what's in Rush Limbaugh's heart, so I'm not going to comment on the . sincerity of his apology.' But he said that he was compelled to offer his support to Fluke after . considering his own children, daughters Malia, 13, and Sasha, 10. Obama said: 'The reason I called Ms Fluke is because I . thought about Malia and Sasha, and one of the things I want them to do as they . get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree . with them on'. Reaction: Georgetown University law student and activist Sandra Fluke speaks during an appearance on the daytime talk show, 'The View' about the comments he made on his programme . He added: 'I want them to be able to speak their mind in a . civil and thoughtful way.  And I don't . want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good . citizens'. And I wanted Sandra to know . that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a . message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves . argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and . there's a way to do it that doesn't involve you being demeaned and insulted, . particularly when you’re a private citizen'. Meanwhile, firms are pulling sponsorship deals from Limbaugh's radio show, fans are refusing to tune in and a couple of stations have dropped its broadcast. Carbonite, Proflowers, Tax Resolution . Services, Legal Zoom, Citrix Success, All State, Heart and Body . Extract, AutoZone, Quicken Loans, Sleep Train, Sleep Number, Oreck and AOL have all stopped advertising with the show. KPUA in Hilo, Hawaii, and WBEC in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, are no longer airing it. Listeners of smaller, local radio stations that broadcast the syndicated show are being called on to pressure advertisers to cut all ties. Twitter users are also spreading the message using the hashtags #BoycottRush, #StopRush and #BoycottHate. Several Facebook pages also have thousands of fans supporting the action. Limbaugh made a rare public apology on Saturday in the wake of the uproar caused by his comments. But Fluke, who became Limbaugh's target after she testified about birth control before a Congressional panel, questioned the sincerity of the apology, adding that she did not want to hear from Limbaugh personally. 'The statements he’s made about me over the air are personal enough, so I’d rather not have a personal phone call with him,' Fluke said on ABC’s 'The View.' Anger: Many advertisers reacted to Limbaugh's controversial 'slut' comments by suspending adverts on the programme . Decision: Citrix Systems has also decided to boycott the show . Limbaugh admitted that his 'choice of words was not the best' and couldn’t resist taking a swipe at his opponents. 'I acted too much like the leftists who despise me. I descended to their level, using names and exaggerations,' he said. 'It’s what we’ve come to expect from them, but it’s way beneath me.' The comments have amplified an election-year clash over Obama’s plan to require health insurers to cover contraception. Republican presidential candidates have cast the plan as an attack on religion as they court socially conservative voters before tonight’s 10-state 'Super Tuesday' primary contest. But they have distanced themselves from Limbaugh’s incendiary rhetoric as polls show that nearly two-thirds of voters support Obama’s plan. Limbaugh apologised again yesterday, but continued to criticize Fluke’s efforts to force the Catholic university to include contraception in its health insurance coverage. 'If birth control insurance is important to you as an enrolling student … you might want to attend or work at a school that isn’t run by Catholics,' he said. Limbaugh’s show is broadcast for three hours each weekday. Talkers Magazine, a broadcast industry trade publication, estimates that Limbaugh reaches at least 15million people a week, the most of any U.S. radio talk show. Boycott: Sleep Number Sara has also decided to suspend all advertising on the show . His comments are the latest wrinkle in a battle over birth control and religious freedom that have emerged as a surprise hot-button issue in the 2012 presidential contest. Religious organizations, the Catholic Church and social conservatives have protested Obama’s policy, which originally required all employers that provide health insurance to cover contraceptives, as an infringement on religious liberty. Obama subsequently tweaked the policy so that religiously affiliated employers like hospitals, universities and charities would not be required to cover the cost. That did not satisfy Catholic bishops, who reject artificial contraceptives. Republicans in Congress have unsuccessfully tried to repeal the new birth control rule, an effort that Democrats, in turn, have cast as a Republican 'war on women'. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says it has raised $1.6million since Fluke testified on Capitol Hill two weeks ago, tying the flurry of donations to outrage over the Republicans’ action. 'It’s a dramatic loser for the Republicans, because the vast majority of American women use birth control at some point in their lives,' said Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson.","Right-wing host labelled student Sandra Fluke a 'prostitute' on the air .

"As the debate continues to drag on about Wayne Rooney’s midfield role at Manchester United, one man could be forgiven for wondering just what he has done wrong. Ander Herrera cost United £29million. Sir Alex Ferguson identified his potential, David Moyes did the donkey work to extricate the Basque star from his complex contract at Athletic Bilbao, and Louis van Gaal rubber-stamped his signing before officially taking over at Old Trafford last summer. Herrera has made just six Premier League starts under the Dutchman, however, and none since playing against Stoke at the start of December. Ander Herrera cost Manchester United £29million, but he has spent more time watching than playing so far . Herrera has been told he must fight for his place, but United fans have called for him to get more playing time . Herrera makes a point to team-mates Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling during some rare time on the pitch . The situation has mystified many United fans who hope that Herrera will be given a chance at Preston North End in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday night having done well in the competition so far this season. The Spaniard scored with a wonder strike to break the deadlock at Yeovil in the fourth round – his only other start in the last two-and-a-half months – and then came off the bench to set up a goal for James Wilson in the fourth round replay against Cambridge United. Yet he still seems to have some way to go to win the trust of Van Gaal and his coaching staff. There is a feeling around the club that he has not bought into the manager’s strict ‘philosophy’ quite as well as some of his teammates. Herrara congratulates Smalling and Angel di Maria after the central defender had scored a goal . Louis van Gaal has not started Herrera in 2015, and is in the market for another creative midfielder . It appears as though Herrera is paying the price for his below-par performances against Leicester City in September, when United fell apart in a 5-3 defeat, and West Brom the following month when he was taken off at half-time. Van Gaal has challenged Herrera to improve, warning that competition for places in his midfield diamond could limit his opportunities. Daley Blind and Angel Di Maria followed the Spaniard into Old Trafford last summer, Michael Carrick, Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj were already in situ, and that was before the decision came to re-deploy Rooney. ‘I have to compare him with people like Rooney and Mata, for example, so that’s difficult,’ said Van Gaal earlier this month. ‘They are all at a high level, he has to improve. ‘He’s a great guy, a very great professional also, so that’s not the problem. His problem is he has to compete with high level players and Rooney is also the captain so he has a privilege. With the arrival of Di Maria to join Juan Mata in the creative midfield role, Herrera has been sidelined . Wayne Rooney (far left) and Daley Blind (right) complete Van Gaal's first choice diamond . ‘We are playing now with a No.10 and that’s Mata and Di Maria. That’s difficult to compete against, but he already knew that when he signed for Manchester United. ‘When you sign for a top club like he did he knows that he is had to fight but he is fighting.’ It’s only four months, however, since Herrera was deemed so important to United that he was hurried back from a rib injury and Van Gaal allowed him to play in a protective corset on that disappointing night at the Hawthorns when he was replaced by Marouane Fellaini for the second half. Van Gaal has kept Herrera on the bench but the Spaniard could get his chance against Preston on Monday . Now, Herrera must warm the bench while Van Gaal claims he has to play Rooney in midfield because there are no better options. It is quite a snub, and the manager’s admission that he will look to sign a world-class midfielder in the summer to release the England striker back to the front line does little to ease concerns that his future at Old Trafford is increasingly uncertain. Herrera, who has also been forced to protest his innocence after being caught up in a match-fixing scandal in Spain since his move to Manchester, must wonder if he is in danger of going the same way as Shinji Kagawa. For the time being, a player who arrived in England with such great expectations last summer just has to be patient – and hope for a chance to play against Preston.","Manchester United paid £29million for the Spaniard last summer .

"The gunman who opened fire at a Delaware courthouse on Monday killed his son's ex-wife and her friend, who were preparing to appear in court to continue a long-running legal battle over the shooter's three granddaughters. Thomas S Matusiewicz, 68, was reportedly furious with Christine Belford - who had gained full custody of his three granddaughters after his son was sent to prison for kidnapping them in 2007 and taking them to Central America for 18 months. Belford and her friend Laura Elizabeth 'Beth' Mulford were at the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday morning for a child support hearing against Ms Belford's ex-husband, David T Matusiewcz. Murdered: Christine Belford, center, was killed when her ex-husband's father opened fire in a Wilmington, Delaware, courthouse. Her ex-husband abducted the couple's three daughters in 2007 . Tragedy: Matusiewicz opened fire in the lobby of the courthouse, before he had to pass through metal detectors. He shot four people, two of them fatally . Victims: Laura Elizabeth 'Beth' Mulford (right) had accompanied her friend Belford (left) to court for a child support hearing. Both women were shot dead by the father of Belford's ex-husband . David Matusiewicz was in the lobby of the courthouse when his father opened fire with a .45-caliber pistol and shot dead Ms Belford and Ms Mulford. Thomas Matusiewicz also shot two Capitol police guards in the chest before he was killed in an exchange of fire with the officers. The officers were saved by their bulletproof vests and sustained only minor injuries. Police detained David Matusiewcz on Monday and questioned him for several hours. It is unknown whether he played any role in the shooting. On Tuesday, he was scheduled to appear in federal court for an unrelated probation violation hearing. Released: The dead woman's husband was David T. Matusiewicz, who served four years in federal prison and was released in April . Thomas Matusiewicz watched both his son, who was once a promising optometrist, and his wife Lenore go to federal prison for the 2007 kidnapping of his grandchildren from Ms Belford. The Wilmington News-Journal reports that Matusiewicz seemed convinced that his former daughter-in-law was abusing his granddaughters. He told the newspaper in 2009 that he had hired a private detective to investigate their home life. 'Once that stuff seemed to start happening, he wasn’t shy about accusing his daughter(-in-law), talking about drugs and saying all kinds of things, like ""She shouldn’t have the kids"" and, ""They’re no good,""' former neighbor Walter Rieth told the News-Journal. He said Thomas Matusiewicz owned several guns and talked about hunting on property he own in New Jersey. Ms Belford's neighbors say she was terrified of her ex-husband's family. They say she installed cameras and a security system at her house and took other steps to protect her children. 'She had all the windows changed with special locks. She had cameras around the house. She had two huge dogs. She didn’t know whether she should get a gun. Her house is like Fort Knox, so I thought she was safe,' neighbor Lois Dawson told the News-Journal. Witnesses said Thomas Matusiewicz's rampage had deadly efficiency. He stepped off the elevated leading from the parking garage to the lobby of the courthouse and immediately pulled out a pistol and opened fire on Ms Belford and Ms Mulford. He then fired on two officers who were guarding the entrance to the courthouse. The shooting occurred about 8.10am in the lobby, where up to 60 people had lined up to pass through metal detectors to enter the main part of the building. David Matusiewic's 2007 kidnapping of his daughters became national news and was featured on programs like 'America's Most Wanted.' Deployed: Heavily-armed SWAT officers fanned out around the courthouse to ensure there were no other shooters . Secured: The New Castle County Courthouse has rows of metal detectors and up to ten security guards. However, the gunmen opened fire in a lobby while people were waiting to pass through security . In March 2009, authorities found the . girls living with Matusiewicz and his mother in a squalid, cramped . trailer in Nicaragua along with Lenore. The daughters were ages 4, 6 and 7 at the time. One of the girls is autistic. Matusiewicz . was arrested for kidnapping and also convicted of forging his wife's . signature so he could take out a $249,000 home equity loan. He served . four years in federal prison. He was released in April 2012. Ms .

"A Tennessee man who was accused of using a racial slur on a receipt at a Red Lobster restaurant last year is suing the restaurant chain and the waitress who cashed in on the incident after she posted a copy of the receipt on the Internet. Devin Barnes, 21, claims he never wrote the racial slur on the receipt, and that the negative attention he received as a result of the way Toni Christina Jenkins - the waitress who claims to have received the slur - publicized the incident is slanderous. In Barnes' suit, filed in Williamson County . Circuit Court, he claims Jenkins slandered him by misusing his personal information, and that Red Lobster's 'willful and malicious ... omissions to act' by failing to prevent Jenkins . from using his name and information 'to gain publicity and money' has caused lasting damage to his reputation. Scroll down for Video . Not guilty: Devin Barnes, 20, says he didn't write the n-word on his Red Lobster check and he's got a forensic expert's opinion to back him up . Bad tipper: A forensics expert compared the writing on the total line with a sample of both Mr Barnes and his wife's handwriting and ruled that there were no similarities . On the receipt, a photo of which was . posted on Facebook and Youtube in September by the 19-year-old waitress, . the line designated for a tip read 'none.' On the line for the total, . it read 'n***er.' Jenkins left a caption on the photo that was uploaded to her Facebook page that read 'This . is what I got as a tip last night...so happy to live in the proud . southern states...God Bless America, land of the free and home of the . low class racists of Tennessee.' Barnes' signature is visible in the photo directly below the offensive slur. In . the weeks following Jenkins' posting the photo on the web, the . left-wing blog AddictingInfo.org started an online fundraiser for her . that raised more than $10,000 - money Jenkins later said she planned to . use to buy a car. Barnes . admits that he didn't tip Jenkins, but says he didn't tip her because . the order was a takeout order - but he adamant that he never wrote the . slurs on the receipt, and even hired a hand-writing analyst to take . analyze the receipt. Miss Jenkins served Mr Barnes and his wife last month at the Red Lobster location in Cool Springs, Tennessee . Trouble customers: Speaking last month with MailOnline, Miss Jenkins described Mr and Mrs Barnes as being very rude when she served them . Apology: Mr Barnes wrote a note saying he was sorry for the incident, but admitted that it wasn't him that wrote 'n*****' on the check . The handwriting analyst found that 'no significant handwriting . characteristics similarities' were found between the questioned 'total' entry line and the handwriting samples provided by Barnes and his wife, the Tennessean reports. Barnes . even wrote a note to the waitress explaining that he never uses the . 'n-word' and that he has no idea how it ended up written on the receipt. Speaking . exclusively to MailOnline shortly after the incident, Jenkins said she . believes Barnes when he says he didn't write the slur. She says she only . posted the picture at all 'to make a comment about racism,' not to draw . attention to herself. 'I . know I didn't write it. If he's claiming he didn't write it, I believe . him wholeheartedly. I'm just that kind of person. I have nothing against . him or his family,' Miss Jenkins said. After . he began receiving negative attention online, Barnes says he turned to . his pastor, Richard Dugger - who also is his attorney - and filed the . suit against both the waitress and the restaurant chain. After hearing that Mr Barnes denied writing the n-word on his check, Miss Jenkins said that she believes him wholeheartedly. She says she posted the check on her Facebook to make a statement about racism, not draw attention to herself . According . to Duggar, Barnes and his family have been getting 'threats from all . over the world,' and that the incident has caused his client 'great harm . and mental anguish.' 'The . plaintiff is not now, nor has he ever been, a ""racist;"" but now as a . result of the defendant's acts and omissions to act, your plaintiff has . been tagged a ""racist"" world wide,' the suit says. The . suit goes on to say that Jenkins exploited Barnes and purposefully . dramatized the incident 'to a point that she profited from it.' In all, AddictingInfo.org raised $10,719 in its 'Tips for Toni' campaign from more than 1,000 contributors across the globe. Red . Lobster, the suit claims, is equally responsible for the anguish Barnes . claims he's suffered as a result of Jenkins' actions because it failed . to take action against Jenkins and it did nothing to resolve the matter . with Barnes. 'As we shared before, it is against our . policy to post guest information online. Our standard procedure is to . suspend the employee involved with pay while we determine what happened,' Red Lobster said in a statement issued Friday. 'After the completion of a full investigation into this matter, Miss . Jenkins returned to work. As we also shared, we were disgusted by the . language used on this guest check as it has no place in our restaurant . or anywhere else.' Barnes is seeking $1 million in his suit against Jenkins and the restaurant. Reward: In wake of the viral photo more than 1,000 people contributed to give Miss Jenkins 10,000 in 'tips' which she says she is using to buy a car, pay for school and help her church .","Red Lobster waitress Christina Jenkins posted a picture of a check she received last month with 'none n*****' written on the tip line .

"Critique: Wolf Blitzer said government should delay Obamacare until website is fixed . Wolf Blitzer has hit out at the White House over the launch of Obamacare saying the health insurance marketplace is not ready for the programme. The CNN anchor urged the government to listen to advice from the Republican party and hold off on the health insurance scheme until the website providing the care cover plans work properly. Since the launch on October 1, the state website Healthcare.gov has experienced problems which has resulted in thousands left unable to sign up for affordable health cover. ‘If they weren’t fully ready, they should accept the advice that a lot of Republicans are giving them. 'Delay it another year, get it ready, and make sure it works,” Blitzer said on CNN yesterday. ‘They know how to do it, but if they didn’t get it ready on time, then maybe fix the problem and make sure people don’t have to worry about it,’ he added. Despite efforts by thee Health and Human Service Department to fix HealthCare.gov and other associated websites glitches have frustrated millions of consumers unable to complete their applications. The website problems gave Republicans reason to hit back at the Affordable Care Act, known better under the name given to it by the opposition – ‘Obamacare’. 'Americans have seen once again that Obamacare is not ready for prime time,' Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 House Republican, said in a statement on Friday. 'A dysfunctional website is the least of that law's problems,' he added. The government made an attempt to turn the online issues into positive coverage, blaming the glitches on high demands. 'Americans are excited to look at their options for health coverage, with record demand in the first days of the marketplaces,' said the release announcing the planned fixes. The statement was headlined: 'Health Insurance Marketplace Open for Business - Week One Success.' Problems: Ms Hill says the 'terminate' button on the Health Insurance Marketplace did not work . Confused: Technology experts and government officials are stumped about the reasons for the computer glitches plaguing the Obama administration's launch of new health insurance exchanges . The . state-level markets were designed to be the gateway to health insurance . for people who don't have access to coverage on the job. Middle-class . consumers will be able to buy government-subsidized private plans, . while the poor and near-poor will be steered to Medicaid in states . agreeing to expand the program. Glitch in the plan: The launch of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplace has not been a smooth ride for Obama . Federal . and state websites experienced problems this week. Some states, . including Maryland, have also announced they are scheduling repairs. The . federal site, which serves 36 states, drew millions of users, an . indication of strong consumer interest. Yet many people were unable to . get on the site. They encountered a screen that told them to wait, and . they did, sometimes for hours. Refreshing the screen only sent them to . the back of the line. Quite a . few got hung up trying to create security questions to protect their . accounts. The drop-down menus providing the questions would not . populate. As a result, . consumers could not advance through the application process and learn if . they were eligible for a tax credit to help pay premiums, much less . pick a plan. Some who did make it through were timed out because they took too long comparing plans. To . add insult to injury, the first days of Obamacare saw a lukewarm . interest in signing up for cover. California, the ultimate blue state . whose federal lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in support of Obamacare, . turned less than 1 per cent of its Web visits into 'Covered California' participants on Tuesday. Connecticut . saw a similarly low rate of interest with 28,000 visitors, and took 167 . applications for health insurance, indicating just 0.59 per cent of .

"Brendan Rodgers insisted that Dejan Lovren was happy to take a penalty before his miss ended Liverpool's Europa League hopes in Istanbul on Thursday. Liverpool, who famously won the Champions League in a shootout at the Ataturk Stadium in 2005, suffered their first ever European defeat on penalties at the fourth attempt.

"Robin van Persie admits his form has been poor this season and says he does not know if Manchester United will keep him after his contract ends in 18 months. Van Persie’s close relationship with Louis van Gaal was tested to the limit in the first half of the campaign and the United manager considered dropping him after a ‘very bad game’ against Arsenal in November. The Holland striker’s form has improved since but he has scored only eight goals and missed one of the few chances United created in Friday’s goalless draw at Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round.

Van Persie, who fired United to the title with 26 Premier League goals after moving to Old Trafford for £24million in 2012, admits he can do much better and revealed that he is constantly questioning his contribution to the team. He said: ‘This year I have played something like 20 games and I have scored eight goals – I am not happy with that. I want to score more. I will do everything, every day in training and during the games, I will keep doing what I have been doing for the last 10 years to make those goals. ‘Obviously we are not scoring enough goals, including me. I have to be honest. I think everyone in the team is responsible. Everyone feels responsible. I do definitely. ‘It is a very thin line between scoring a load of goals and only a couple. I know what I have to do to create those opportunities. I will keep doing that. At the moment, it is not enough. I know that. I will do everything I can to improve that. ‘In my last couple of games I didn't score. Can I really blame myself for that? I am always asking myself that question. ‘Even in games against Cambridge and top games, how many chances do strikers get. One? Two? So you have to take them. Van Persie poses with his Manchester United team-mates at a press conference on Monday afternoon . Van Perise spurned this second-half chance against Cambridge on Friday . The Holland international squares up to Victor Wanyama during United's shock defeat by Southampton . Van Persie, in action against Tottenham, has failed to hit the heights of his opening season at Old Trafford . ‘Sometimes it is a thin line between winning 1-0, 2-0, 3-0 or drawing or losing because it is just based on those little chances. We could have won 4-2, 3-1, 3-0 against Cambridge. Then we would be having a different conversation. ‘Against Cambridge, I don’t think I can blame (Angel) di Maria for the great pass or blame myself for the way I hit it. ‘Against Spurs, there was that ball from (Michael) Carrick and I had one touch, another touch and another. I went to finish with my right leg. Normally, nine out of 10 keepers will make a move and it will be a goal. But not that day. If I scored that goal we would have won the game. ‘But I’m convinced that if we keep doing what we are doing, because we do create chances, if the strikers just take those chances I think we have a chance.’ Van Persie will turn 32 in August and is out of contract at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016. United have yet to open talks over a new deal and he admits that the situation is out of his hands. Van Persie revealed he has been disappointed with his form this season and is unsure about his future . Van Persie is convinced United will be able to adapt to Van Gaal's tactical philosophy in the long haul . ‘It is not up to me,’ he said. ‘For the moment I am staying here for 18 months. That is it really. I can’t look into the future. I don’t know what is going to happen after that. We shall have to wait and see.’ United have struggled to adapt to Van Gaal’s tactics at times this season, notably his preference for playing a three-man defence. It has led to some insipid performances but they remain on course for his primary objective of Champions League qualification and Van Persie is convinced it will come right in time. ‘I have known him for over two years now,’ he added. ‘I know how he works. We believe in him. Everyone has his own thing to do. Him and his coaching staff and we as players. We are trying everything we can to win games, not only win games but win them in a nice way as well. That is a process. In that process we have to be honest. We have to give everything we can. ‘Our belief is there and also with the players who have been working with him only for six months. Everyone believes in ourselves, our team-mates and our staff. We are confident it will change. Van Perise scored 26 goals in his debut season at United, including this strike against Aston Villa . The Dutchman celebrates winning the Premier League with Manchester United in 2012-13 . ‘In the last 15 games, if I am correct, we are one of the best teams regarding results. So we are having a good run. Of course, games against Cambridge don't really help because for the picture of everyone in the world, we should have won four or five nil. It depends whether or not the ball falls for us. But we have to create our own luck and work even harder.’ Van Persie also that the United players were down about Friday’s surprise draw at the Abbey Stadium, but soon perked up when they saw Manchester City and Chelsea crash out to lower league clubs. ‘After the game against Cambridge, everyone was a little bit down,’ he said. ‘Although they played well so from their point of view, you have to be honest, you have to give them credit because it is quite a stunt what they did. It was very nice for them. ‘But in a way on Saturday the whole mood changed. City were out. Chelsea were out and suddenly we are in it with a home tie against Cambridge. And the so-called big clubs, it is just us, Arsenal, Liverpool and West Ham but we are the highest left in the competition. So does that make us favourite? I don't know. But I am very happy that we are in it. ‘It has been 11 years since United won the FA Cup last. Since I am here that was actually the first thing that Sir Alex Ferguson said as well. He said “I want to win that cup”. I think we have a big chance this year. We want to win it. But again we have to look at the first game only because that is the next game against Cambridge.' Real Madrid's new teenage signing Martin Odegaard was presented at Valdebebas training ground last week . Meanwhile, the chances of United goalkeeper David de Gea moving to Real Madrid in the summer receded on Monday as FIFA launched an investigation into their signing of under-age players that could see them incur a transfer ban. Barcelona have been banned from signing players in 2015 and Real have now been asked to provide the game’s governing body with documentation for around 60 boys signed by the club since 2009, on the suspicion that they have broken the same rules. De Gea’s agent Jorge Mendes admitted last week that his client could end up at the Bernabeu Stadium, but a transfer ban would put an end to that move. Real are also one of several clubs hopeful of signing Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus at the end of the season and their removal from the 2015 transfer market would drastically alter the prospects of an English club landing the midfielder. The ban could scupper Madrid's reported transfer bid for Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea . Club official Emilio Butragueno said Real are not worried about the investigation, which focuses on two 12-year-olds brought to Madrid from Venezuela in 2012. Manuel Godoy and Fernando Macias were on a tour of trials with big clubs but before they could reach River Plate and Inter Milan, Madrid snapped them up. Real’s defence centres on an insistence that neither youngster played for the club. There is also a suggestion that Godoy was withdrawn in 2013 when the club were alerted to the possibility that they had broken the rules, while Macias has since moved to Rayo Vallecano. Madrid have filed all relevant documentation and believe it will show they have not contravened the rule which allows the signing of under 18s from outside the EU only if the player’s parents have had to relocate to the country where the club is based, for non-football reasons.

"Manchester United came from behind to beat plucky Preston on Monday night and set up an FA Cup quarter-final clash with Arsenal. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player for their performance at Deepdale. PRESTON (3-4-1-2) Thorsten Stuckmann 6 – Sound performance but will be cursing Rooney for getting in his eye-line for the first goal and then going down under little or contact for the penalty he converted. Tom Clarke 7 – Captain’s performance from Clarke and led by example but it just wasn’t quite enough in the end. Tom Clarke (centre) put in a captain's performance for Preston North End against Manchester United . Paul Huntington 7 – Towering display summed up by a challenge on Fellaini in the second half, blocking the Belgian’s shot when he looked certain to score from close-range. Bailey Wright 6 - Combative approach typified by his collision with Fellaini in the first half, but came under increasing pressure as the match wore on. Chris Humphrey 6.5 – His powerful running down the right-flank for Preston gave Shaw plenty to worry about. Neil Kilkenny runs away from Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo with the ball . Jon Welsh 6.5 – Vital role sat in front of the back-four and one superbly-timed challenge on Di Maria brought a roar from the crowd. Neil Kilkenny 6.5 – A veteran of Leeds’ cup upset at Old Trafford under Grayson five years, he couldn’t be faulted before going off 15 minutes from the end. Scott Laird 7.5 – Scored a memorable goal that sent Deepdale into raptures and almost grabbed a second in added time when his header was cleared off the line by Young. Preston North End left back Scott Laird fires the League One side in front in the FA Cup sixth round . Laird jumps over the advertising hoardings to celebrate with his fans and team-mates at Deepdale . Paul Gallagher 7 – Preston’s man of the match, he produced a number of impressive set-pieces including one that went inches over in the second half. Kevin Davies 6.5 – Still a handful at 37, United had two or even three players competing with him for high balls at times, and he was not surprisingly booked for flattening Herrera. Joe Garner 7 – Simon Grayson said that he’d ruffle feathers and he certainly did. Preston’s top scorer went close to another with a header in the second half.

David de Gea will be unhappy at the way he allowed Laird's deflected effort spin through his grasp . Antonio Valencia 6.5 – The man who deflected Laird’s shot, and the Ecuadorian could be faulted for not getting tighter on his opponent as he tried his luck from range. Helped set up Fellaini’s goal though. Chris Smalling 5.5 – Looked uncomfortable again with the awkward combination of Kevin Davies’s power and Joe Garner’s sheer persistence causing him plenty of problems. Marcos Rojo 6 – The Argentine also had his hands full with Preston’s front two and was booked for bringing down Garner in the second half. Luke Shaw 6 – Back after suspension but is still yet to offer the kind of marauding presence United hoped they were getting when they signed him for £28m in the summer. Daley Blind 7 – Screened the United defence capably and it was his determination to keep possession and pass that led to the equaliser. Ander Herrera 6.5 – Given only his third start since the beginning of December and the man who came up with the breakthrough goal against Yeovil in the third round struck again here. Ander Herrera celebrates after equalising at Deepdale as United went on to win . Marouane Fellaini 7 – Found that his powerful presence was less effective against the League One side, and ended up with a bloody nose after a clash with Bailey Wright, but came up with United’s crucial second goal.

"A schoolboy could make a gross profit after stumbling across a rare piece of whale vomit on a beach - which could by worth as much as £40,000. Charlie Naysmith, 8, discovered the 600 grams solid piece of sick after taking a stroll along Hengistbury Head, near Bournemouth. He came across a big chunk that looked . like a yellowish beige rock with a waxy finish and picked it up, . according to the Daily Echo newspaper. One whale's sick is a schoolboy's treasure: Charlie Naysmith with the chunk of ambergris that he found on the beach at Hengistbury Head near Bournemouth . With the help of his parents he discovered his find was not a rock, but a substance vomited or excreted by sperm whales. But it appears that one whale's trash is another person's treasure. Decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt have turned the substance, technically called ambergris, into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell. As repulsive as it my sound, the substance is highly sought after with perfume makers as it helps prolong the scent of perfume. A pound of the whale waste sells for as much as £6,300. Worth it's weight in gold: Ambergris is the polite term for whale vomit and is worth thousands of pounds to the perfume industry . Lucky find: The schoolboy was taking a walk along Hengistbury Beach, pictured, when he spotted the sick . The principal historical use of ambergris was as a fixative in perfumery, though it has now been largely displaced by synthetics. Ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like musk, according to Wikipedia. Although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today, American companies usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use. As it comes from sperm whale, which is classed as a vulnerable species, cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling. But the sweet-smelling sick has been used in a variety of ways throughout history, according to the information website . Ancient Egyptians found a use for it by burned ambergris as incense and the country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes. Worried people thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris during The Black Death in Europe because the vomit masked the smell, which they thought was the root of the illness. And Wikipedia said that one monarch particularly loved the taste of the whale vomit - Charles II would eat it with eggs. His father, Alex, said they have contacted authorities to help them with their find: 'He is into nature and is really interested in it. 'We have discovered it is quite rare and are waiting for some more information from marine biology experts,' AsianTown.net reported. Charlie, of Christchurch, is a pupil of . St Katharine’s school in Southbourne and has been on nature walks with . his class in the area - but the chances of him discovering any more finds are slim. While perfumes can still be found with . ambergris around the world, many perfumers usually avoid it because it is associated with whaling and the sperm whale is a vulnerable species. The family has been told it is unlikely that more ambergris will be found in the same area. That isn't stopping the schoolboy from dreaming . about how to spend his newfound riches. Currently, he is considering . building some kind of a shelter for animals. Charlie is not the only one to discover the foul - if lucrative - find. Beachcombers Sean Kane and, 24, and Ian Foster, 39, discovered a 110lb of whale vomit washed up on the beach in 2008. Known as 'floating gold', because of its high value, the waxy haul was estimated to be worth £500,000. However, . in recent times the perfume industry has largely switched to synthetic . versions instead of using the vomit as it is seen as a by-product of the . whaling industry. Sean, . from Penrhyndeudraeth in North Wales, said the pair were on the beach . walking a dog at nearby Criccieth when they made their discovery. 'We . just came across this white, like waxy lump. I said to Ian: ""It looks a . bit like whale sick."" He had never heard of anything like it' he said. It is rarely found on British beaches, usually being washed up in America and Australia. Open wide! The vomit of a sperm whale is a precious commodity and could have floated on the sea for decades before its discovery by the schoolboy .","Ambergris - the technical term for when whales vomit solidifies over decades - used in perfumes .

"The antique dealer jokes that his photo is proof Nicolas Cage is more than just an a-list actor - he’s also a vampire who lived during the American Civil War. An eBay seller claims to have a 4” by 2.5” carte de visite photo from around 1870 of a man who looks exactly like the 47-year-old star of Con Air, Ghost Rider and The Rock.

The man who put the photo on eBay is Jack Mörd, of Seattle, Washington, whose Facebook page says he is originally from Los Angeles, California, and owns ‘The Thanatos Archive’. 'My theory is that he allows himself to age to a certain point, maybe 70, 80 or so, then the actor “Nicolas Cage” will “die”,’ Mr Mörd joked. ‘But in reality, the undead vampire “Nicolas Cage” will have rejuvenated himself and appeared in some other part of the world, young again, and ready to start all over.’ Listing: The seller, who has put the starting price at $1million, says the photo is 100 per cent genuine and was taken of a man from Bristol, Tennessee, around the time of the Civil War .

The 47-year-old Californian has clearly aged since his appearances in Con Air in 1997, top right, and then Adaptation in 2002, right. Mr Cage's wife Alice Kim is around . half his age at 27.

The picture was found in the back of an . album that contained many unusual death portraits from the Civil War era . - but the Nicolas Cage lookalike was not identified by name, Mr Mörd . said.

'It's an original photo of a man who lived in Bristol, TN, sometime around the Civil War.' It is believed the photo was taken by a confederate Civil War prisoner of war photographer called Professor G.B. Smith.

"'Kindly': Rudolf Hoess, commandant of Auschwitz Concentration camp, (pictured here at his war crimes trial) was kind to animals and to his children according to a new book . By day he ordered the deaths of thousands of people - but at home he was a loving father and husband who enjoyed playing games with his children. These are the two faces of Rudolf Hoess, the ruthless commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland during World War II as remembered by the Polish maid who once worked in his family's house. Her memories of life in the Hoess home are revealed in a new book which has given a chilling insight into the family lives of Nazi officers at the infamous prison camp whose day jobs involved mass murder. 'The Private Life of the SS in Auschwitz' by historian Piotr Setkiewicz attempts to give a human face to inhumane people in those hours when they were off duty in one of the world's most horrific places. The testimony about the killers is unique because it comes from the Polish maids assigned to keep their houses and witnessed at first hand their interaction with their families on a day to day basis. Hoess, who was hanged after the war at . Auschwitz by the Polish authorities for overseeing the extermination of . at least 1.2 million people and the enslavement of at least that number, . was obsessively kind to animals and his five children. He . would have no moral qualms about ordering the gassing of child inmates . of his camp, but in his garden he would play hide-and-seek with his five . children and recited poetry to them. Shocking: The book contains the memories of Polish maids who once served the SS officers at Auschwitz. Here Hoess (centre) socialises with (left) Dr Josef Mengele and (right) Josef Kramer (Commandant of Birkenau concentration camp) Relaxing: Enjoying a cigarette, Hoess does not display a hint of guilt or concern, despite regularly sending thousands to their death . Maid Janina Szczurek, 32, said; 'He . tucked his children into bed every night and he kissed his wife each . morning. He wrote poems about the 'beauty of Auschwitz.' 'On . one occasion, the children came to me and asked me to sew bands with . signs for them, just like the ones worn by the prisoners. I was not . aware of what the consequences would be from this. 'Klaus put a 'capo [trusty]' band on his sleeve, and the other children had the coloured triangle sewn to their clothing. 'The . happy children, running around the garden, met their father, who . noticed the signs and took them into the house. I don't know what . happened but he was not pleased.' Included among the stories are those . of Hoess's deputy Karl Fritsch and Gerhard . Palitzsch who personally killed hundreds of prisoners at the Wall of . Death - the execution site where inmates were murdered. Horror: The main gate of Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, which was liberated by the Russians, in January 1945. The sign over the gate reads: 'Arbeit macht frei' (Work Sets You Free) Revelations: Gerhard Palitzsch (right) carried out executions of prisoners by shooting them against a wall in Auschwitz. The book reveals that his wife had numerous affairs . Domestic: The wife and children of Auschwitz SS-Unterschafuhrer (junior leader) Ernst Scholz. The new book gives an insight into the family lives of those whose day jobs was to assist in mass murder . Palitzsch illustrates perfectly the duality of the lives of the SS at Auschwitz. At the wall of death he beat prisoners and tormented them . before they were killed - while off duty, he was obsessed with being a 'good . father' to his children and made them tea and bread. A . portrait of him was supplied by Helena Klysowa, his 19-year-old Polish . maid, who testifed to authorities after the war that the Palitzch family . 'lived quietly and they loved each other. They didn't receive guests, . they didn't organise drinking parties. 'I . arrived each day at 8.00 am. I looked after the children. I would go on . walks with the girl. When Palitzsch was at home, I could not speak to . the prisoners who worked in the house or garden. 'The . prisoners themselves warned me against this.They were afraid that he . would write down their number and they would die in the camp. Family: Dr Horst Fischer (right) with his wife.

Loved ones: Auschwitz doctor Werna Rohde with her daughter (left). The wife and daughter of SS-Unterschafuhrer (junior leader) Ernst Scholz are pictured right . Revealing: The book casts new light on the ordinary lives of SS officers who worked at Auschwitz, including their relationships with their wives and children . Perspective: The book's author said he wanted to examine the lives of the prison camp staff in an 'unemotional way.' Here, an SS officer plays with his pet dog . 'I spoke to them anyway and found . that the terror of the camp was Palitzsch. I could not believe it. At . home, he was a wonderful man, so kind and loving to his children who he . gave tea and bread to. He loved his children madly.' Palitzsch died in 1944 after being transferred to the Russian front. SS officer Wolfgang Guessgen, who . took turns at 'the ramp' selecting those Jews who were to be gassed upon . arrival and those who were to be allowed to live as slave labourers, . was a cuckolded man whose wife cheated on him at every turn according to . the book. He rewarded her with beatings. Danuta Rzempiel, who was 16 when she worked at his home on the camp periphery, said; 'Mrs. Guessgen was not a faithful wife. 'When he went away somewhere,various SS . men would appear at the house, or a trusty prisoner from the locksmith . shop who won her favour. 'She was not embarrassed by my presence at all . and would lead her guests straight to her bedroom. 'It . would happen that Guessgen, upon returning home, would find one of . these guests. Then he would order me to go do the laundry or to the . basement, and when I returned, the guest would not be in the house. Two sides to the story: The Private Life Of The SS, left, takes a unique look at the men who oversaw the death and torture of inmates at Auschwitz, many of whom were children, pictured right . 'Mrs . Guessgen was often covered in bruises, so I guessed that it was Mr . Guessgen. 'This didn't seen to dissuade her, and she exploited every opportunity. It got to the point that Guessgen shot a certain SS man, and as . punishment, he was transferred to Oranienburg, and shortly after from . there to the front.' Other . stories feature the domestic lives of doctors who carried out selection . processes of Jews and who performed horrific experiments, as well as . the day-to-day lives of camp guards and lower SS ranks. 'The purpose of the book is to try and show the lives of SS men objectively,' Mr Setkiewicz told local media. 'Their image has forever been written in dark colours and in the . pursuit of objective truth I wanted to view the subject unemotionally,' he said.

"It has long been thought that the hip bones of whales and dolphins are essentially useless. But scientists have now discovered that in fact the opposite is true and that they are very important for mating in the species. Experts also believe that their shape and size even influences how sexually attractive a cetacean is. No bones about it: Scientists Matthew Dean (pictured left) and Jim Dines (right) have discovered that the pelvic bones of whales and dolphins (which they are holding) are important for mating and are not useless as previously thought . Both whales and dolphins have pelvic bones, which are evolutionary remnants from when their ancestors walked on land more than 40 million years ago. Common wisdom has long held that those bones are simply vestigial - slowly withering away like tailbones on humans. ‘Everyone's always assumed that if you gave whales and dolphins a few more million years of evolution, the pelvic bones would disappear. But it appears that's not the case,’ said Matthew Dean, assistant professor at the University of Southern California (USC). For four years, he and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County’s Collections Manager, Jim Dines, have painstakingly analysed cetacean pelvic bones. Having a whale of a time! Experts say the shape and size of a whale's pelvic bone  influences how sexually attractive they are to females. They found  that the bigger the testes, the bigger the cetacean’s pelvic bone . Most whale species don't maintain fixed partnerships and females have several mates each season. Whales use a mating call to attract a partner and some that travel in pods perform specicic rituals to snag a mate. Baleen whales such as humpback and blue whales sing a unique songs to woo a partner potentially miles away. Sperm whale pods find each other with calls and clicks and when they find each ther battle one another to attract a female. Killer whales develop dialects distinct to pods. They do this so they can locate a suitable mate from outside their own community. They wrote in the journal Evolution, the muscles that control a cetacean’s highly flexible penis, attach directly to its pelvic bones. The scientist theorised that the pelvic bones could affect the level of control over the penis that an individual cetacean has, perhaps offering an evolutionary advantage. To test their idea, they examined hundreds of pelvic bones and used a 3D scanner to make digital models of the curved bones in order to gain an unprecedented level of detail about their shape and size, as well as to compare them. They then gathered data about testis size relative to the mass of whales. In the natural world, more ‘promiscuous’ species where females mate with many males, create a more competitive mating environment and the males develop larger testes as a way of attracting females. Size matters: Males from more promiscuous species such as dolphins evolve larger penises, so larger pelvic bones appear necessary to attach larger muscles for penis control, the experts said. A couple of mating whales are pictured along with others . For years humans have wondered what the high pitched noises made by dolphins and whales mean. And now scientists believe that the marine animals squeal with delight to express their happiness. Initially, noises emitted by the animals when offered fish treats were thought to be signals communicating the presence of food. Whales and dolphins are known to squeal when they hear a whistle or buzzer associated with a food reward. But . when dolphins and beluga whales were trained to switch off a sound . after making a deep dive, they announced a successful mission by . producing the same squeals. It was the equivalent of a human 'whoop' of triumph, according to U.S. cetacean expert and author Dr Sam Ridgway. 'The [squealing] behaviour had transferred over to another stimulus that wasn't food,' he said. To . investigate further, Dr Ridgway and his colleagues at the National . Marine Mammal Foundation in San Diego, California, analysed decades of . recordings of experiments involving dolphins and beluga whales. They . wanted to understand if the delay before a squeal was mirrored by the . release of dopamine, a brain chemical that stimulates sensations of . pleasure. Dopamine . release takes 100 milliseconds, so if the delay between a reward . promise and a squeal was longer than this amount of time it would . suggest a connection. In dolphins, the delay was 151 milliseconds and in beluga whales 250 milliseconds. 'We . think we have demonstrated that it [the victory squeal] has emotional . content,' said Dr Ridgway, whose findings appear in the Journal of . Experimental Biology. The experts compared the size of pelvic bones to the size of an animal's testes, relative its body size, and found that the bigger the testes, the bigger the cetacean’s pelvic bone. Males from more promiscuous species also evolve larger penises, so larger pelvic bones appear necessary to attach larger muscles for penis control, they said. ‘Our research really changes the way we think about the evolution of whale pelvic bones in particular, but more generally about structures we call vestigial,’ Professor Dean said. ‘As a parallel, we are now learning that our appendix is actually quite important in several immune processes, not a functionally useless structure,’ he added. The duo believe that their new way of measuring and quantifying the complicated 3D structures of bones, could be used to record and study bones held by museums. Squealing with delight:  Last month, scientists found that dolphins squeal with delight to express their happiness and likened it to a human 'whoop' of triumph .","Whales and dolphins have pelvic bones, which are evolutionary remnants from when their ancestors walked on land more than 40 million years ago .

"Food firms have been warned about the presence of a cancer-risk chemical in everyday products ranging from crisps and chips to instant coffee and ginger biscuits. A biscuit designed for babies and toddlers has also been caught up in the alert. Experts are even warning families to only lightly toast their bread at home, as the chemical, called acrylamide, is more likely to form the longer and darker foods cook. A study by the Food Standards Agency has identified 13 products containing raised levels of the chemical. In each case, officials at the local council where the supplier is based have been told to notify them. Study: The Food Standards Agency has identified 13 products containing raised levels of the chemical acrylamide . Acrylamide, which is still being investigated by scientists, is a cooking by-product associated with frying, baking, roasting or toasting foods at very high temperatures, usually greater than 120c. The FSA insists its findings raise no immediate risk to the public and there is no need for people to change their diet. However, it is putting pressure on all food companies to reduce acrylamide levels because long-term consumption could increase the risk of cancer. Its official advice is also that families should ensure bread and chips they eat are only toasted or baked to the 'lightest colour possible'. The FSA said its study of levels of acrylamide and furan – another cancer-risk chemical – is used to identify which firms need to take action. Acrylamide is formed by a reaction between natural components in food as it cooks. In reality it has probably been in the diet for as long as man has fried, roasted or toasted food. Manufacturers including Heinz and McVitie's have already responded by changing their recipes. Warned: Food firms have been cautioned that everyday products such as crisps, biscuits and instant coffee could contain the cancer-risk chemical acrylamide . But others, including Nestle, makers of Nescafe, say it is impossible to do so without harming the flavour and quality of their products. It added: 'There is currently no scientific evidence to suggest any particular product has any negative impact on health in the context of acrylamide exposure.' The FSA is required by the EU and the European Food Safety Authority to carry out the annual tests. It looked at 248 samples, from chips sold by fast-food outlets to supermarket own-label and big brand ranges. In 13 cases levels were above  the 'indicative value' – a trigger point to tell the firm it should examine its production process. At risk: The FSA has warned food firms that everyday products such as instant coffee could contain the cancer chemical acrylamide . European watchdogs have been putting pressure on food manufacturers to reduce acrylamide for almost a decade. In 2002 Swedish studies revealed high levels formed during the frying or baking of potato or cereal products. The FSA said: 'This raised worldwide public concern because studies in laboratory animals suggest acrylamide has the potential to cause cancer in humans by interacting with the DNA in cells. 'The Agency believes exposure to such chemicals should be as low as reasonably practicable.' The latest survey found 'an upward trend' in acrylamide levels in processed cereal-based baby foods, excluding rusks. Importantly however, the FSA said this did not mean parents should stop giving these products to youngsters. The Food and Drink Federation,  which represents manufacturers,  said members are 'ensuring levels are as low as reasonably achievable'. Heinz changed its Banana Biscotti recipe this year to reduce acrylamide to trace levels. United Biscuits, which makes McVitie's Gingernuts, said it has cut acrylamide by 70 per cent. The firm also pledged to cut levels in its McCoy’s crisps.","Acrylamide also likely to form in burned toast .

"White British pupils have become a minority in many secondary schools in England, according to a study. The research found that the number of ethnic minority pupils has sharply risen by 57 per cent in ten years. In some areas, including inner London boroughs, up to 67 per cent – just over two thirds – are from ethnic minorities. Study: Black and Asian pupils now outnumber white children in London schools. Experts have warned of 'very high' levels of segregation (file picture) In some individual secondary schools, the figure rises to 98 per cent of pupils, said the survey by King’s College London. The trend is seen right across England, showing that ethnic minority families are moving out of town centres to the suburbs. Professor Chris Hamnett, a geographer who conducted the study, said the increase is not due to children who have recently arrived but pupils who were born in England. He said patterns of birth rates indicate that the proportion of ethnic minority pupils will  continue to increase in future decades. Such changes have become a lasting feature of the ethnic make-up of England’s population, added the professor. He said his data reveals a ‘very substantial’ shift in the population, representing an ‘irrevocable’ change. Surge: The percentage of ethnic minority pupils in 1999 compared to 2009 . The study examined the changing demographics of schools from 1999 to 2009 following decades of migration to this country. The 57 per cent increase in  ethnic minority pupils came as the overall secondary school population rose 4.7 per cent. There has also been a slight decline in the number of white pupils, a figure which also includes migrants from Eastern Europe. Across the country, the proportion of ethnic minority pupils has risen in a decade from 11.5 per cent to 17 per cent. Professor Hamnett forecasts that it is set to continue increasing to 20 per cent. He found that London has the highest proportion of ethnic minority pupils at 67 per cent. Segregation: Brick Lane in the London area of Tower Hamlets. More than 90 per cent of pupils there are from an ethnic minority background . The capital was followed by Slough with 64 per cent, Leicester at 58 per cent, Birmingham at 52 per cent and Luton with 51 per cent. Manchester and Bradford both have 43 per cent. There are also wide differences in the ethnic breakdowns of schools in different parts of the country. In places such as Knowsley, near Liverpool, Cumbria and Durham, fewer than two per cent of secondary pupils are from ethnic minorities. In the London boroughs of Brent, Tower Hamlets and Newham, the figure is above 80 per cent. In primary schools, the government’s annual school census this year showed that 862,735 children, more than a quarter of pupils, are from an ethnic minority. The figure is up from 22 per cent in 2007. When Labour took power in 1997, the total was 380,954. In Newham, only eight per cent of primary pupils are from a white British background.","Study author describes 'irrevocable change'

"A thug has admitted knocking a 16-year-old girl unconscious in an unprovoked street attack that left her with broken teeth and a split lip. A court heard Michael Ayoade, 34, who smacked petite teenager Tasneem Kabir around the head as she was walking to college in east London, told police: 'She started it'.

Ms Batra said: 'He said he admitted to doing it, it was a misunderstanding on his part. He had had too much to drink and smoke that day.' 'He said he was going about his business and was intimidated by her look, she looked like she wanted a fight. She looked about 19 or 20. He did not approve of the way she looked so he went back and punched her....He said ""Nah, that hurt, I can’t go further in my day taking an insult from a little person like that"".' 'He thought to himself “No, no I am not taking this”,' the lawyer said. 'He never spoke to her, just punched her.' Marianna Christou, defending, said that Ayoade had come to the UK from Nigeria when he was just three years old, and had to fend from himself from young age. He was said to have no contact with his family. Ms Christou said: 'He has drunk since he was 16 and smokes up to 10 joints a day which in my submission is excessive and perhaps this causes some degree of paranoia and low self esteem.'

"From the Birth of Venus to the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, the naked human form has long been a source of artistic inspiration. Now some of the best have been gathered together in a stunning new book, which draws on the extensive photo archive at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Edited by associate curatorm Paul Martineau, The Nude in Photography includes 78 works, ranging from classic shots by the likes of Man Ray to the glossy modern nudes created by Chinese artist, Hiro. Knowing: Felix Jacques Moulin's 1856 nude nods to Manet's famous portrait of a prostitute, Olympia . Iconic: Herbs Ritts' famous photo of nude supermodels, among them Cindy Crawford and Christy Turlington . But it's not all photography. The book also contains images of classical Greek and Roman sculpture, the source of some of the world's earliest nudes, as well as references to the likes of Titian's Venus D'Urbino. Much, however, focuses on the nude in photography and its surprisingly lengthy history, which began with the invention of the camera in the mid 1800s. Indeed, according to historians, the history of photography actually pre-dates the invention of the camera, with camera obscura techniques used by the ancient Greeks. The first photograph of the sort modern viewers would recognise was a partially successful image taken in 1816 by French inventor, Nicéphore Niépce. Niépce was also the first to create a box camera, using one, in 1826, to photograph a 17th century Flemish relief of a man using a horse. Spectacular: Chinese artist Hiro created this work, Bodyscape, in New York in 1971 . Pioneering: Jeremiah Gurney's 1852 Portrait of an American Youth is one of the earliest photographic nudes . Musical: Man Ray's 1924 Le Violen d'Ingres is one of the most famous nude photographs ever taken . When, in 1839, Louis Daguerre invented the first practical method of fixing photographs, the stage was set for a new type of artwork - the photographic nude. Some of the most beautiful date from the early days of the art form, with 19th century masters such as Julia Margaret Cameron, Edgar Degas and Thomas Eakins combining the new technology with classical composition. One especially lovely effort is Felix Jacques Moulin's 1856 nude which, with her knowing glance and draped couch, nods firmly to Manet's Olympia. More still are the work of 20th-century artists Man Ray, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward . Weston, as well as innovative photographers Bill Brandt, Harry Callahan, and Minor White. The latter half of the 20th century is represented by the likes of Diane Arbus, Robert Mapplethorpe and Herb Ritts, and contemporary artists Chuck Close, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, and Mona Kuhn. Whether Hiro's glossy technicolour shots or Moulin's robust nudes, the beauty of the naked human form continues to fascinate and inspire photographers even to this day. The Nude in Photography, edited by Paul Martineau, £18.95, is published by Getty and is available from Amazon . Striking: Robert Mapplethorpe's Thomas was taken in 1987 and nods to Leonardo's Vitruvian Man . Light-hearted: Not all early shots were posed, as this 1884 work by Thomas Eakins reveals . Clever: Charles Swedlund created images using multiple exposures, among them 1969's Three Graces . Bleakly beautiful: Wynn Bullock's seminal 1957 photograph, Navigation Without Numbers .

"Click here for our brilliant Match Zone including David Luiz's stunning free-kick . Order and progress it says on the Brazilian flag. It’s impossible not to avoid the green, yellow and blue colours which decorate this vast country from the bunting in the streets to the paint on the faces of children. On Friday night, there was progress into the last four, thanks to an early strike by Thiago Silva and a delicious free-kick by David Luiz, but there was very little order in evidence, at least not on the pitch. The game was a frantic spectacle where hearts ruled heads, unleashed like a 90-minute sugar-rush. It could have been a runaway home win or quite easily another tear-jerker for the host nation, as Colombia summoned a noble finish. Ultimately, the progress of Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team into the last four of the World Cup will ensure order on the cities of Brazil, and that may be for the best.

The fears and anxieties of 200 million people are soothed for the time being. Colombia have added rhythm and flair to this tournament but could not overcome the collective will inside Fortaleza’s Castelao Stadium, a collective will which at times, it has to be said, seemed to include the officials. Before the game, Colombian fans suspected they would not be allowed to win; a feeling reinforced when they had a goal by Mario Yepes controversially ruled out for offside when 1-0 down. No-one was off when Yepes shot, but there was a marginal call earlier in the sequence which unfolded from a free-kick. Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo could not avoid awarding them a penalty, however, when Julio Cesar completely wiped-out substitute Carlos Bacca and James Rodriguez scored, his sixth of the World Cup. It made for a tense finish. Brazil clung on, although not without collateral damage. Silva is out of the semi-final against Germany after a yellow card and Neymar was carried off late in the game after falling awkwardly. As it is, Colombia’s 23-year winless run against their neighbours goes on, and so does Brazil’s Samba beat. Scolari’s players collapsed at the final whistle and raised their hands to the sky. They must be on the brink of nervous exhaustion but into the semi-finals they go. That it should be Silva who struck first was a sweet twist in the narrative of the campaign. He caught Carlos Sanchez napping at the back post to turn in with his left knee a corner won and delivered by Neymar. Less than seven minutes were gone and Brazil had the nerve-settler of an early lead but, just as they in the previous round against Chile, they were unable to make it count. Nerves would still be in shreds by the final whistle. Making a point: David Luiz and Dani Alves console a tearful James Rodriguez at the full-time whistle .

Tough tackler: Fernandinho and fellow midfielder Fredy Guarin both slide to challenge for the ball . High foot: Fernandinho attempts to rob the ball from the boot of Colombia's James Rodriguez . Late: James Rodriguez goes flying following Fernandinho's challenge but the Brazilian protests his innocence . Still, after a week of questions, it was impossible not to share Silva’s relief. Off he ran to the opposite corner flag, beating his chest, soon to be mobbed by delirious team-mates as the roof lifted off the Castelao, freed by a rapid response to a week of debate in Brazil, when some claimed he should be stripped of the captaincy. Emotions had got the better of him in against Chile and his ability to focus was questioned but here his mind was clear. He intercepted a cross and twice hurled his body in the line of shots from Juan Cuadrado. When Rodriguez slipped Fernandinho and Colombia threatened to swamp Brazil in the first half, who was on the edge of the penalty area, winning back the ball? It was the captain. Silva was superb. As was Fernandinho. Colombia’s greatest threat came from Rodriguez, drifting into spaces behind Teofilo Gutierrez and Brazil were without Luiz Gustavo, who was banned.

Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo intervenes to stop an argument from ensuing . Aerial duel: Goalscorer Thiago Silva gets the better of Colombia frontman Victor Ibarbo in the air . On the march: Colombia frontman James Rodriguez marauds forward as three Brazilians watch on . Fernandinho started well, winning the ball and passing it well, both long and short. It was the Manchester City midfielder who unzipped Colombia and released Neymar to win the corner for the first goal. He didn’t always have Rodriguez under control, although that is no disgrace. Few people in this tournament have contained him. Fernandinho did it well, and he was making crucial tackles deep in stoppage time. At times, Referee Caballo was too lenient. Rodriguez was targeted, and then booked when he made his first foul, one which led the free-kick scored by Luiz from 30 yards. Jose Pekerman’s side leave with credit. They refused to roll over after their early setback in a suffocating atmosphere with the game locked in a frantic tempo, pinging back and forth like table-tennis. A break by Luiz summed everything up. Charging up-field the over-lapping centre-half seemed set on a slalom wonder-goal, only to lose the ball to Christian Zapata and hurtle back in pursuit of the full-back, head back, hair trailing, until he had landed a little physical contact after the ball had moved on. The crowd cheered but and the Colombia bench leapt to their feet in fury but the breathless game had moved on. Luiz is incredibly popular and will probably be captain on Tuesday in Silva’s absence, but he flexes between pure majesty and total liability. Where he goes, chaos usually follows, but what a free-kick he fired into the top corner to settle the game.

"Caused offence: Stan Collymore described the archipelago as a 'f***ing island with sheep' Football pundit Stan Collymore was today criticised by a Royal Navy veteran after he claimed Britain had ‘thieved’ the Falklands. The 43-year-old former Liverpool player, who now works as a Talksport radio commentator, described the archipelago to his 565,000 Twitter followers as a ‘f***ing island with sheep’. He said: ‘Falklands? Wasn't anyone's. We just thieved it, as we do. What glory, what triumph. A f***ing island with sheep. Rule Britannia.’ The tweet - which was posted on Saturday night - has since been deleted, but there have been calls for Collymore to issue a public apology. Chris 'Kenny' Swain, 50, who served as Petty Officer Gunner in the Royal Navy from 1980 to 2003, said Collymore should be sacked from Talksport. Mr Swain, of Plymouth, Devon said: ‘I had a lot of friends that died in the Falklands. I think it's just an absolute outrage. I don't know whether he did it to raise his profile, but it's just an outrage. ‘There are so many upset people. He needs to be sacked from Talksport for a start - you can't have somebody with opinions like that addressing the public. I am just so angry. ‘Everybody fought for what they believed in, whether as a young man or an officer it doesn't matter. You are following orders and you believe in what you're doing.’ And a post of the official Twitter feed of the Falkland Islands Government said: 'Very disappointed to hear Mr Collymore's views on the Falklands - factually incorrect and hurtful.' Argentina claims it inherited the islands from Spain in the 1800s. But the UK says it has . carried out long-term administration of the Falklands and almost all of . the islanders are of British descent. Tweet: Collymore said on Twitter: 'Falklands? Wasn't anyone's.

Rule Britannia' War: The Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano sinks amid orange life rafts holding survivors in the South Atlantic Ocean, after being torpedoed by the British Royal Navy in this photograph from May 1, 1982 . In response to a request from Falklands Radio on Twitter for Collymore to explain his comments in an interview, he replied: 'The tweets are unambiguous enough for you to use common sense.' Collymore, who said he had voted Labour . in every election since his first in 1990, also published an image of a . tweet he posted in 2012 that encouraged people to wear a poppy on Remembrance Day. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a remote UK colony, in April 1982. It engaged British and Argentinian forces in the biggest naval conflict since the Second World War. Argentinian junta leader General Leopoldo Galtieri wanted to reclaim sovereignty of the islands, and sent 600 troops to take them. But the UK fought back, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saying the 1,800 residents there were ‘of British tradition and stock’. The battle ended 74 days after the initial invasion, on June 14. Some 655 Argentine and 255 British servicemen lost their lives in the conflict, as well as three Falkland Islanders. In a referendum in March 2013, which saw a 92 per cent turnout, 1,513 islanders vote to retain their status as British overseas territory, with just three voting against. In addition, he retweeted supportive messages from current and former servicemen, describing this as 'sanity at last'. The pundit - a prolific Tweeter who has posted more than 37,000 messages - briefly quit Twitter in January after complaining about receiving abusive tweets. He reported a barrage of death threats and racist taunts to Staffordshire Police, but he said the social networking website did not go far enough to help police identify the culprits. The ex-striker said officers were ‘banging their heads against the wall’ because Twitter was dragging its feet over revealing the trolls’ identities. The former Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest player said he had no problem with ‘honestly held opinion’. But he pointed out that people would be arrested immediately if they used the same threats and racist language in public that he faced on Twitter. Collymore, who also complained to police about abusive tweets last December, said officers had been ‘brilliant’, but said it was wrong that they had to go through a laborious process to identify abusive users.

"Developers want to bulldoze a 12th-century forest to make way for a motorway petrol station - in the first attempt to use a possible new planning loophole. In a crucial test case, Extra MSA Group has submitted a formal planning application to destroy 20 acres of ancient woodland, and offered to plant twice as many new trees nearby. The firm, which specialises in building motorway services, is the first to attempt to use the controversial process, known as ‘biodiversity offsetting’, for ancient woodland. Smithy Wood is a haven for a variety of ancient woodland plants, fungi and butterflies. But developers want to bulldoze the 12th-century forest to make way for a motorway petrol station . In a crucial test case, Extra MSA Group has submitted a formal planning application to destroy 20 acres of ancient woodland, and offered to plant twice as many new trees nearby . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is very keen on the idea of offsetting as a way to balance economic development with environmental concerns. In January he proposed the idea of ‘mandatory’ offsetting, in order to force developers to plant new trees. But wildlife groups say it is a travesty to suggest that ancient woodlands, which in this case are 850 years old, could be replaced overnight. They are worried the proposals will create a loophole that allows developers to freely concrete over Britain’s forests. The new planning application is for £40million development at Smithy Woods near Sheffield, an ancient forest that dates back to 1161. The plan for the site at junction 35 of the M1 includes filling stations, shops, a food court, an 80-bedroom hotel and a huge car park with space for 639 vehicles. Smithy Wood is designated as a local wildlife site within Sheffield’s Green Belt, and is a haven for plants, fungi, butterflies and threatened birds including the song thrush, dunnock, bullfinch and stock dove. The firm, which specialises in building motorway services, is the first to attempt to use the controversial process, known as 'biodiversity offsetting', for ancient woodland . Sheffield City Council’s treatment of the application will be a vital test of offsetting - and of the ability of the Government’s planning rules to protect ancient woodland. Penistone and Stocksbridge MP Angela Smith, whose constituency includes Smithy Woods, said: ‘This application is a cynical attempt to overcome objections to the proposed destruction of ancient woodland by making use of “offsetting”. ‘Local people, however, will not be easily bought and will fight hard to defend this precious habitat. ‘Once lost, this woodland can never be replaced. ‘Surely it’s time to strengthen the protection of ancient woodland, given that we’ve lost so much of it already; what we have left, we must conserve rather than destroy.’ The Environment Secretary recently said destroying ancient woodlands would be a ‘travesty’ but admitted that offsetting could be used for even the most cherished sites. Crucially, he has said that planning regulations should be sufficient to protect ancient forests - something that will be put to the test in Sheffield. Mr Paterson told the House of Commons in January: ‘Should we bring in offsetting, all the regulations remain. Only at the last moment would we consider offsetting.’ But wildlife groups say it is a travesty to suggest that ancient woodlands, which in this case are 850 years old, could be replaced overnight . The Government has launched a consultation on the idea, which is due back this summer, but the Sheffield proposal will provide an early indication as to whether planning rules are robust enough to stop it being used for ancient woods. Nikki Williams, campaigner at the Woodland Trust, said: ‘The plans revealed by Extra Motorway Services might look at first glance to be very grand and environmentally friendly, but you need only scratch the surface to discover that this is an example of the attempted use of biodiversity offsetting at its very worst. ‘There is no escaping that 21 acres of ancient woodland will be destroyed should this application be approved and no amount of compensation will ever make up for the loss of this irreplaceable habitat.’ Extra MSA Group chief executive Andrew Long said: ‘Having established a clear requirement for a new motorway services area at Junction 35 of the M1, we are confident that our proposals can facilitate another flagship, job-creating development that will significantly enhance the local economy.’ The firm has pledged to create a new 39-acre woodland with 60,000 new trees open to the public for recreational use. Another 172 acres of privately owned woodland will be opened up to the public. A Government spokesman said: ‘Ancient woodlands are safeguarded and the planning rules are very clear that development should be avoided.’","Extra MSA Group has submitted formal planning application in test case .

"A baby girl born out of wedlock must be adopted to save her from the risk of being slaughtered in an ‘honour killing’, a court ruled yesterday. If the unmarried Muslim woman’s father found out about the child, he would feel such ‘unimaginable shame’ he could unleash a vengeful bloodbath by killing the baby and his whole family, three senior judges agreed. So they made the extraordinary order to have the one-year-old girl – known as Baby Q – adopted for her own safety. Safe: Baby Q has settled well with her adoptive parents (picture posed by models) She will now grow up with adoptive . parents and, when she is older, they will explain to her why she could . not have been brought up by her biological parents. It is believed to be the first time an English court has ordered an adoption to prevent a murder. The baby’s maternal grandmother told . police that if her husband ever found out about the little girl, ‘he . would consider himself honour-bound to kill the child, the mother, the . grandmother herself and the grandmother’s other children’, the court . heard. The identities of all those involved . have been kept anonymous to ensure the girl can grow up safe from her . apparently murderous grandfather – who still has no idea his daughter . was ever pregnant. The astonishing background to the case was set out at the Appeal Court in London yesterday. The baby’s mother – referred to as M – . conceived the child at the end of 2009 when she was having an affair . with a married man, known as F. Neither the mother nor the father . were born in the UK and both came to live here separately within the . past ten years. They are both Muslims, but from different cultures. At the time of his infidelity, F’s wife was still waiting for permission to join him in the UK, though she is now here. Lord Justice Munby and Mrs Justice Black, pictured left and right, along with Lord Justice Kitchin said that the child must be adopted . When M suspected she was pregnant, in . the spring of 2010, she was so ‘terrified’ of how her ‘traditional . Muslim’ father would react that she concealed her pregnancy by wearing . loose clothes. She continued living at home and was confident her growing bump would not show unless someone ‘was looking’. She travelled to ‘the other side of . town’ for her antenatal care, to avoid her parents finding out, and only . had her pregnancy confirmed at 23 weeks. Eventually she confided in her mother . and a sister, and they hatched a secret plan that when she went into . labour, someone would call her father away on a pretext, to ensure he . never found out. She also told social services she wanted the baby to be adopted straight away. Baby Q was born in the autumn of . 2010. At just a few hours old, baby and mother were parted as M was . discharged from hospital and baby Q was left in the care of nursing . staff. By December, she was placed in the . care of the Muslim couple who are now about to adopt her. The court case . came about because the baby’s natural father, F, discovered he had a . daughter and wanted to take custody of her himself. But a High Court judge, Mrs Justice . Parker, rejected him as unsuitable in July this year, and said the baby . would still be ‘at risk’ of an honour killing because ‘two and two might . easily be put together’ by the maternal grandfather or someone who knew . him. The baby was ‘quite obviously’ not . the child of F’s wife, the judge said, adding: ‘If the grandfather’s . community were thus to find out about the relationship between M and F, . it would be a matter of intense almost unimaginable shame to him and his . family.’ There was a ‘very significant risk’ he might launch a violent attack to preserve the family’s honour. Adoption: The Court of Appeal ruled the risk was so grave that the baby could not be looked after by her natural father . The court heard Mrs Justice Parker . had been ‘persuaded by the evidence of the police’ that the mother and . baby Q could be at ‘a very high level of risk’ if the baby’s birth was . to become known in the wider community. The police force in question was not . identified, nor the social services department involved in the case. But . the court was told that social workers, police and the mother of baby Q . were all in agreement that she should be adopted. Still hopeful of taking custody of . his child, F launched an appeal, but this was rejected yesterday by . three senior judges, Lord Justice Munby, Lady Justice Black and Lord . Justice Kitchin. They agreed with the first judge that . there were several good reasons why F and his wife – who now have a . baby of their own – should not be allowed to bring up baby Q. Among them was the ‘tension’ that . would be caused by F’s wife looking after her philandering husband’s . illegitimate child as well as her own. Both F and his wife also lacked . ‘empathy and insight’, and were criticised as being incapable of dealing . with the little girl’s feelings as she grew older and wanted to learn . the details of her ‘very unfortunate start in life’. The judges concluded: ‘The risks – . physical, emotional, short and long term – are too great for Q to be . brought up by her father.’ Although F and his wife’s ‘care and . warmth’ towards their own child was taken into account, the judges . concluded there was ‘a high likelihood’ they would feel differently . about baby Q. By contrast, baby Q had quickly . developed a deep attachment to her adoptive parents, known as Mr and Mrs . A, Muslims who live in the UK but come from the same country as the . baby’s mother. They had a ‘high degree of empathy, . sympathy, insight and maturity’, and the judges said they had ‘absolute . confidence in Mr and Mrs A to give Q information about her background, . her life, what happened to her mother, the feelings of her father, her . father’s wishes for her, and the fact she has another family.’ Mr and Mrs A have taken baby Q ‘into their family and community...and into their hearts’, it was said. Every year in the UK, officials . estimate that at least a dozen women are victims of honour killings, . almost exclusively within Asian and Middle  Eastern families. A 2006 BBC poll for the Asian Network . in the UK found that one in ten of the 500 young Asians polled said . that they could condone the killing of someone who dishonoured their . family.","Unmarried mother ran away after becoming pregnant because she feared what her father would do .

"There was also trouble with the 'special relationship' during the Falklands when the US threatened to tell Argentina that UK troops were landing on South Georgia. Newly declassified files reveal that Britain's historic allies wanted to tell Argentina that the task force was planning to retake South Georgia, the first of the islands to be invaded by Argentina, on April 21. The operation on South Georgia was the first stage of the campaign to retake the Falklands and it would have been disastrous had Argentina been forewarned. Strained relationship: President Ronald Reagan and British PM Margaret Thatcher in 1982 . But US secretary of state Al Haig told the British ambassador to Washington, Sir Nicholas Henderson, that informing Britain's enemy was the only way it could stay neutral and negotiate a peace deal. Henderson reported Haig as saying: 'If the Americans acted in this way they would be able to show even-handedness to the Argentines and this would enable them to continue their role as go-between.' But Henderson told Haig he was going beyond the obligations of neutrality and that the information could be used by the Argentines to mount attacks on the British Task Force. Haig eventually promised to keep quiet. The files also reveal that US President Ronald Reagan urged a 'negotiated settlement' right up to the last moments of the war as Britain battled to win the upper hand. He issued a last minute appeal to Margaret Thatcher to hand the islands over to international peacekeepers as the British neared victory. Mrs Thatcher responded: 'Britain had not lost precious lives in battle and sent an enormous Task Force to hand over The Queen's Islands.

The resources we had were finite and most of the resources were involved in the Cold War.' An emergency cabinet meeting was held to discuss Britain’s response to the invasion. Lord Armstrong said: 'There was great concern about what could be done about it. Our forces in the area were very scant confined to a small troop of marines and the HMS Endurance. 'If there was going to be an invasion there was little we could do to stop it. People were sitting round wondering what on Earth one could do about it.

"A pub holding a competition to find the ‘Ugliest Woman’ got a visit from the police after someone reported them for sexism. An unknown complainant demanded the competition be cancelled and wanted the owners of Islay Inn prosecuted. However, when police arrived at the Glasgow venue they gave manager George Hogg the go ahead after discovering it was, in fact, a competition for men dressed as women. 'Ugly Women': Manager George Hogg (right) with regular punter Kenny Barra with their outfits ready for the competition in Glasgow pub The Islay Inn, which was reported to the police for sexism . Mr Hogg told of his disbelief of the complaint and accused the protestor of being ‘over the top with political correctness.’ He said: ‘I have no idea who made the complaint and the police wouldn’t tell me - but if he or she had bothered to read the advert properly, they would have realised that it was not ugly women we were looking for - but ugly men dressed up as women. ‘The first we knew of a potential problem was when two female officers from Maryhill Police Station came into the bar on Thursday night. ‘They told me they had received a complaint about us holding a competition to find the ugliest woman in the bar and that it might constitute some kind of sexist offence. ‘But when I pointed out the facts, the policewomen were clearly amused and quickly told me the matter would go no further.' All good: The Islay Inn was visited by two police officers who allowed the 'Ugliest Woman' competition to go ahead after it was explained that it would be one with male contestants . Mr Hogg added: 'It was a totally over the top reaction by whoever went to the bother of reporting us - political correctness gone mad!’ The event was advertised on the Facebook page of the pub, located in the city’s Kelvingrove area. OTT complaint: Manager George Hogg, sans outfit, called the complaint political correctness gone mad . Earlier today the page was updated to clear up the 'misunderstanding' regarding the 'Ugliest Woman' competition, which is set to go ahead on Sunday. The Islay Inn apologised for causing any offense adding: ‘Just so it’s clear to all, our ugly women will be men dressed as women, beard stubble and all.’ The pub offers a £50 cash prize for the ugliest ‘woman’ and in the spirit of equality, the ‘bonniest’ woman dressed as a man will receive a bottle of vodka. The posting attracted several comments from customers, saying a competition for ugly men would not have been met with the same reaction. Andrew Parr wrote: ‘Ridiculous getting the police involved. Some people are pathetic. Mark McCarrick added: ‘As if our overstretched police service haven’t got enough to do without being bothered by some silly complaint. ‘I bet the silly fart wouldn’t have moaned had it been an ugly man competition. ‘Get yourself a life whoever you are, its a bit of fun in these dark and gloomy times!’ Jennifer Forde said: ‘Goodness! Some people get offended very easily - sounds like a good laugh.’ Randi Carlson posted: ‘Well, I did think it was maybe a bit un-PC - but calling the police? That is a bit much.’ Gordon Gillies joked: ‘I bet it was a right ugly one who contacted the police.’ Although the competition has been allowed to take place, Strathclyde Police confirmed to the MailOnline that an inquiry into the complaint is still ongoing.","Unknown complainant reported Glasgow pub for sexism .

"A seven-seat space taxi backed by Nasa to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station will make a high-altitude test flight next summer, officials said this week. Sierra Nevada Corp's ‘Dream Chaser’ space plane, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, is one of four space taxis being developed by private industry with backing from the U.S. government. For the unmanned test flight, it will be carried into the skies by WhiteKnightTwo, the carrier aircraft for the commercial suborbital passenger ship SpaceShipTwo, backed by Virgin Galactic, a U.S. company owned by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Space taxis: An artist's impression of the Dream Chaser craft that may one day be used to take astronauts to the International Space Station . The test flight was added after privately held Sierra Nevada got a $25.6-million (£16million) boost to its existing $80 million contract with Nasa. The test flight will take place from either Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert, or from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, according to Ed Mango, manager of Nasa's Commercial Crew Program. With the retirement of the space shuttles this summer, Nasa is now dependent on Russia to fly astronauts to the space station, at a cost of more than $50million per person. Blast off: The test flight will take place from either Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert, or from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico . The agency hopes to turn over crew transportation services to one or more commercial firms before the end of 2016, Mango said. In addition to Sierra Nevada, Nasa is funding spaceship development work at Boeing Co, Space Exploration Technologies, and Blue Origin, a start-up firm owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. ‘Having only one way to get crew to the station is a limitation,’ Nasa astronaut Mike Fossum, who is currently living aboard the outpost, said during an in-flight interview last week. Sky's not the limit: Dream Chaser will be launched using WhiteKnightTwo, the carrier aircraft for Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo . The station, a $100billion project of 16 nations, was finished this year after more than a decade of construction 225 miles (350 km) above the planet. The outpost, which is about the size of a five-bedroom house, supports a variety of scientific research and technology demonstrations. Along with helping to develop commercial space taxis, Nasa is working on a heavy-lift rocket and capsule to fly astronauts and cargo to asteroids, the Moon, Mars and other destinations beyond the space station's orbit. Drawing heavily on equipment originally built for predecessor programs, including the space shuttle and the cancelled Constellation Moon exploration initiative, the new rocket, called the Space Launch System or SLS, is scheduled to debut in 2017. That unmanned test flight would be followed in 2021 by a trial run with astronauts, said Kennedy Space Center director Bob Cabana.

"Promise: BBC director of television Danny Cohen has pledged to include more women on comedy panel shows . All-male comedy panel shows will be consigned to the history books, after BBC bosses told producers that female guests must now be involved with the programmes. Danny Cohen, BBC director of television, this week promised a better gender mix on such shows as Have I Got News For You, Mock The Week and Never Mind the Buzzcocks, which typically comprise all-male panels. The move is part of a drive by the BBC Trust to address gender imbalance on our television screens. In December BBC director general Tony Hall was tasked with getting more women on air 'as a matter of urgency'. Cohen has been looking for simple ways to achieve this and it is understood comedy panel shows were top of his list. BBC entertainment controller Mark Linsey said: 'Comedy panel shows are always better for having a good mix of people and of course that must include women. 'I’m making it clear to production teams that there’s just no excuse for delivering all male guest lists.' The changes have come about following the publication of a report last year, which was commissioned by the BBC for the Cultural Diversity Network. BBC2’s QI and Mock the Week came under fire for 'rarely having women represented or only having ""token women"" on their programmes.' Female comedians, including Victoria Wood, have in the past criticised BBC panel shows for being a 'male preserve'. In 2011, Wood said of panel shows: 'I don’t . like them. They are a male preserve. That’s all right, that’s how they . are. It is more of a male characteristic to want to top somebody’s . gags.’ Meanwhile, Lee Mack, who is a team captain on BBC1’s Would I Lie To You?, said men are better . suited to being stand-up comedians as they are more competitive - and therefore dominate TV panel shows as a result. Speaking on Desert Island Discs last September, Mack said: ‘When . men sit around and talk, they are very competitive. One person will . tell an anecdote and the next person will try to top that. When you get . six women together, they share a lot more. Under fire: Shows such as Would I Lie To You? featuring David Mitchell, Rob Brydon and Lee Mack have been criticised for all-male panels . 'They . will be far more interested in what the other person has to say. The . conservation is more interactive and less about individually showing . off.’ The 45-year-old, who . wrote and starred in the BBC1 sitcom Not Going Out, added: ‘The problem . isn’t that there’s not enough women in panel games. 'The problem is . there’s not enough women in comedy in general.’ Criticism: Victoria Wood has said in the past that BBC's panel shows are a 'male preserve'","BBC bosses say there's 'no excuse' for all male guests on shows .

"For more than 100 years, butchers in the market town of Sudbury have proudly displayed their meats in their shop windows. But now one has been forced to stop hanging game such as pheasants, partridges and rabbits in his shopfront after a vicious campaign, blamed on ‘townies’ who have recently moved in. Staff at JBS Family Butchers, which has sawdust on the floor and takes great pride in its link to local suppliers and the countryside way of life, spent hours every week perfecting their window displays featuring meat and game. JBS Family Butchers in Suffolk buckled to pressure and removed its traditional window display, after shoppers mounted a campaign saying they were offended by the sight of bits of dead animals . Those behind the hate campaign mounted against JBS Family Butchers of Sudbury said they were trying to protect their children from the ugliness of 'mutilated carcasses' Unplucked birds and the occasional pig or deer head were hung up in its shopfront in a small precinct in the Suffolk town. But . it has reluctantly had to remove the display after it became the target . of a campaign including anonymous hate mail and people hurling abuse in . the shop. Others wrote to the local papers and posted remarks on Facebook calling for a boycott of the shop and its neighbours. Assistant manager Richard Nicholson, 25, said staff had been stunned. Traditional: The display at another butcher's in the Suffolk town of Sudbury in 1955 . ‘We really put a lot of effort into the window display to make it look special and attract customers,’ he said. 'It is tough trading against the big supermarkets so we are up against it already without this happening' Richard Nicholson, JBS Family Butchers assistant manager . ‘There . have been pheasants, partridge, rabbits and even half a pig. We live in . a market town in the countryside, so I am surprised people feel this . way. ‘It is tough trading against the big supermarkets so we are up against it already without this happening.’ After . the call to boycott neighbouring shops, the butcher’s replaced its . display with a small sign saying simply: ‘Due to complaints, there is no . window display.’ JBS Family Butchers had reluctantly removed the display after it became the target of a campaign including anonymous hate mail and people hurling abuse in the shop . Mr Nicholson said: ‘We have had . anonymous hate mail and people have come into the shop and said stuff. We feel we’ve been persecuted for being proud of our trade and . tradition.’ In a letter to a . local paper Ben Mowles, 34, said the ‘needless display of multiple . mutilated carcasses’ had stopped him taking his 12-year-old daughter to . the nearby sweet shop. 'Their display looks more like a scene from a horror movie. They even had a line of squirrels across a bar. Who eats squirrel?' Keith Lewis, petrol station worker . ‘We . avoid the entire precinct as we’d rather not look at bloody severed . pigs’ heads when buying sweets,’ he wrote. ‘I am asking for JBS to be . more considerate with what they display in their window.’ Daniel . Cudmore, 25, wrote: ‘As someone who breeds rabbits, I find the display . of animals hanging in the window disgusting. It has continental giant . rabbits, pigs’ heads and ducks.

But owner John Sawyer and his right-hand man Richard Nicholson (pictured) have been so encouraged by the outpouring of support that they are determined to create a proper display in the shop window on Saturday . ‘Everyone knows animals are killed to get meat but you don’t need it shoved in your face like this.’ 'So-called rural Suffolk will have large numbers of townies with weekend retreats... who may be importing their values into the community' Roger Kelsey, National Federation of Meat and Food Traders chief executive .

"A surge in the number of parents giving their children late baptisms has been linked to competition for places in popular Roman Catholic schools. New figures from the church show the number of children baptised between the ages of one and 13 has soared by a third in ten years. In the same period, between 2001 and 2011, the number of children baptised before their first birthdays decreased. There has been a surge in the number of children given late baptisms in the Catholic church (stock picture) The figures, released by the Pastoral Research Centre Trust, show that 67,724 children were baptised in 2001. This increased to 74,767 in 2011, and decreased slightly to 71,380 in 2012. The trust also revealed that 44,130 babies under the age of one were baptised in 2001, and that this fell by 2.6 per cent to 42,986 in 2011. This figure fell by a further 2.4 per cent – to 41,937 – in 2012. But in this time the number of late baptisms soared by 36.2 per cent from 19,528 in 2001 to 26,601 in 2011. This then fell by 5.25 per cent to 25,225 in 2012, but this still represents a 30 per cent increase from 2001. The Sutton Trust last month suggested parents 'get religion' so their children can go to faith schools . A report by the Telegraph suggested the trend – which has been shown in the Church of England as well – has been linked to ‘pew jumping’, where parents feign religion to get their children into faith schools. Last month the Sutton Trust education charity highlighted a trend in which parents ‘get religion’ in order to help their children into good schools. A survey of more than 1,000 parents revealed 10 per cent of upper middle-class parents admitted to going to church services in order to aid their children’s chances. Jonathan Romain, chairman of the Accord Coalition, suggested to the paper that baptism can act as a ‘significant entry ticket’ into a Catholic school. Following the release of the Sutton Trust report, he said: ‘These findings are highly revealing. For the first time they shine a light on the way the faith school admissions system is being abused towards serving the affluent, when most Church schools were originally establish to provide education for the poor.’","New figures show the number of babies baptised between the ages of one and 13 has risen by a third since 2001 .

"PEOPLE can expect to live into their mid-sixties before ill-health begins to strike, according to an official analysis yesterday. Girls born in recent years should pass their 66th birthday before they are no longer in the best of health, it found, and boys can expect to enjoy unfettered fitness until they are 64. The healthy life expectancy predictions mark a major increase in the prospects for older people in less than a decade. The likelihood of 66.1 years of life in good health for girls and 64.2 for boys applies to those born between 2009 and 2011, and marks a notable advance on the expectations of those born just nine years earlier, between 2000 and 2002. The increase for girls is 3.9 years, and for boys 4.1 years. But the news is not all positive: the good health span even of the youngest generation will have run out by the time they can claim their pensions. The children whose healthy lives are estimated in the report from the Office for National Statistics will have to wait until they are 68 before they can claim a state pension, some time in the 2070s. Analysis found girls born in recent years should pass their 66th birthday before they are no longer in the best of health  ( file picture) And a leading older people’s charity warned that men’s healthy lives are not advancing as fast as their overall life expectancy. Simon Bottery of Independent Age said that for men ‘time spent free of chronic illness or disability hasn’t improved as we would have hoped over the past decade. The numbers of older men are increasing overall but sadly more of these men may in time need more health and social care support.’ The ONS analysis was produced using replies given to large-scale state lifestyle surveys. People were asked to classify their health according to one of five labels, from very good and good, through fair, to bad and very bad. The findings said that people who have already reached the age of 65 without disability or chronic illness can expect their good health to continue for longer than did predecessor generations of older people. The study found boys could expect to to enjoy unfettered fitness until they are 64 years of age . Women who were 65 between 2009 and 2011 could expect a further 12.1 years of good health, the report said, and for men of the same age healthy life expectancy was another 10.7 years. The healthy life expectancy figure at age 65 are up since 2000/2002 by 1.3 per cent for women and 1.2 per cent for men. The increases for men, both calculated from birth for the youngest generation, and from age 65, disappointed some commentators. They come at a time when men are catching up quickly with women in terms of overall life expectancy. While men aged 65 could expect more years of healthy life, the proportion of their lives spent in good health went down, from 59.6 per cent to 59.3 per cent. Mr Bottery said: ‘We welcome the new evidence revealing how we can expect to live for longer in the UK. This is to be celebrated. But, alongside lengthening life expectancies, a person’s quality of life and overall health must also be seen to increase. Any years people spend in poorer health will have significant new implications for public services and family life. ‘Such evidence supports calls for a new approach to funding a health and social care system fit for our ageing population, one that looks to ensure people live healthier, disability-free lives.’","Girls should pass 66th birthday before they are no longer in best of health .

"Hearing: Jim Davies is suing Thames Valley Police over colleagues' use of the word 'traveller' A policeman is suing his bosses after colleagues allegedly offended him by referring to Romany people as 'travellers'. Jim Davies, an Englishman of Romany descent, accuses police staff of using the word 'pikey' to describe other members of the Romany community. The speed enforcement officer is suing Thames Valley Police for racial discrimination over the use of the terms. He outlined his case at a preliminary hearing today, where a panel is set to rule which parts of his evidence will be admissable at the full tribunal. The officer, who lives in Brackley, Northamptonshire, told the hearing in reading that he was offended by hearing Romany people described as 'travellers'. He claimed the term had been 'institutionalised' at the force over the 20 years he has worked there, and was a discriminatory reference to his own ethnicity. Mr Davies said he could not remember the details of every alleged use of the word, but insisted that it was used 'on a frequent basis.' At the preliminary hearing, a section from Mr Davies' claim was read out that said: 'I have continuously witnessed colleagues making offensive comments about travellers.' He also claimed colleagues used the word 'pikey' as a derogatory term for Romany people. A representative of Thames Valley Police argued that the use of the word 'traveller' referred to the whole community, not just those of Romany origin. Claim: Mr Davies insists the word is offensive to Romany people and is suing for racial discrimination . James Arnold told the panel: 'What we have got is a generic use of the word traveller to describe those people living on traveller sites, regardless of ethnicity.' However, the claimant is to argue that there were incidents when the term was used in a more specific context when it was likely to refer to Romany people. Members of the Romany community are legally protected from unfair treatment under laws forbidding racial discrimination. The Romany people live mostly in Europe and the Americas and have often suffered from discrimination. Police officers regularly make offensive comments about travellers, the employment tribunal heard. Mr Davies pointed the finger at nine colleagues he accused of making the derogatory remarks but claimed there had been countless insults aimed at travellers during his 20 years as a policeman, amounting to racial discrimination. James Arnold, the TVP representative at the tribunal compared the case with a Scottish person being offended by the word 'gingers.' Instituionalised: He claimed the term had been 'institutionalised' at the force over the 20 years he has worked there, and was a discriminatory reference to his own ethnicity . However, Jack Feeny, representing Mr Davies, said: 'If everyone in the office is using the word ginger to describe Celtics that would be direct discrimination because they are attacking Celticism through a code word. 'There will be evidence to show that the use of the term ‘traveller’ by Thames Valley Police is synonymous with an ethnic group. 'Those police officers were not referring to new age travellers when they made the comments that the complainant complained about.' Mr Arnold claimed that as soon as officers gave evidence that they did not know the term traveller related specifically to Romany people, the case would collapse. Mr Davies is seeking compensation for injuries to his feelings by racial discrimination. Nine colleagues of Pc Davies who have had allegations against them and expert witnesses on the use of the word traveller, were expected to be called to give evidence at the full 10-day hearing, which is due to start on June 30.","Jim Davies claims Thames Valley Police staff call Romany people 'pikeys'

"Governor Chris Christie has been accused of exacting still more political revenge after his administration shut down the DMV office in a large New Jersey city three years ago – and Democratic politicians say it was because they opposed his tax policies and worked for his Election Day opponent. 'He shut it down, plain and simple, and of course this was political,' New Jersey state Assemblyman Joe Cryan told MailOnline of the Motor Vehicle Commission office in Elizabeth, the fourth-largest city in New Jersey. 'This was complete retribution. ... There was no other possible explanation for it.' Cryan's district includes Elizabeth. He was former Gov. John Corzine's state Democratic chairman when he ran for re-election in 2009, unsuccessfully, against Christie. Ray Lesniak, Cryan's state Senate counterpart representing the city, had been a top Corzine strategist since the future Democratic governor was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000. And Elizabeth's longtime mayor, Chris Bollwage, got under Christie's skin soon after he took Corzine's job, joining Cryan and Lesniak to publicly oppose what they called a 'flawed' plan to cap the rate of annual property tax increases in New Jersey. The three Democrats now say closing the motor vehicle bureau in Elizabeth was a way for Christie to crush three political adversaries with a single stroke of his pen. Christie and his insiders, Bollwage told . MailOnline, 'are used to getting their way no matter the consequence to . constituents and families.' 65 Jefferson Avenue in Elizabeth was once the location of a busy New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission office, but taxpayers in the region now have to trek to other cities to get their plates or licenses renewed, and politicians say wait times have skyrocketed . Mayor Chris Bollwage says the closure of his town's motor vehicle bureau office was an act of political retribution from Gov. Chris Christie . Governor Chris Christie has begun his second term in office under a cloud of scandal related to traffic bottlenecks whose alleged political subtext sounds familiar to Democrats in Elizabeth and surrounding Union County . The mayor added that he suspects foul play in the Christie administration's awarding of money to fund red-light traffic safety cameras. Three towns near Elizabeth have received the funds, but 'high volume' intersections in Elizabeth 'with numerous accidents and near-misses' didn't make the cut. 'Just another retaliation by this administration,' said Bollwage of Gov. Christie. 'And some folks think its a good idea that he gets the nuclear codes.' The swipe is a reference to Christie's ambition to make a run at the White House in 2016. While the moderate Republican has not yet said if he will enter the race, pollsters are already fond of taking the public's temperature with scenarios that pit him against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the next presidential contest. But Christie's road to Washington, D.C. has become bumpy of late. Need a state ID renewed but take mass-transit from your home in Elizabeth, NJ? Good luck finding the Newark Motor Vehicle Agency without a car . New Jersey state Senator Ray Lesniak, shown campaigning with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, said the 'predominately minority, low-income' people of Elizabeth were left behind by the Christie administration . He fired two aides this month and watched as two political appointees resigned from the Port Authority in December, following an alleged plot to manufacture traffic jams leading from the town of Fort Lee to the George Washington Bridge during four days in September. Democrats in Trenton are feverishly investigating the possibility that Christie personally gave the order as punishment for Democratic Mayor Mark Sokolich's failure to endorse his re-election bid. Cryan compared the experience of frustrated Fort Lee commuters with Elizabeth's largely lower-income population after their local MVC office disappeared. 'Same thing,' he offered. 'And there was no logical reason to do it other than to be a vindictive – I don't want to use the word ""prick"" – but a vindictive individual.' Christie spokesman Colin Reed defended the closing in a statement. NJ Assemblyman Joseph Cryan said 'there was no logical reason' to close the Elizabeth MVC office, 'other than to be a vindictive -- I don't want to use the word ""prick"" -- but a vindictive individual.' The governor, he said, 'immediately acted' when he took office 'to eliminate wasteful spending and ensure all government agencies were operating efficiently.' 'The Elizabeth agency was not only the least used of the three in Union County, but its consolidation saved New Jersey taxpayers nearly $300,000.' Bollwage scoffed at that idea, saying in a little-noticed MSNBC interview that 'the salaries of the folks who worked there were relocated or assumed by others, and therefore all you were left with was lease payments.' 'And we wanted to work with the DMV, and move them into a building that may have even been owned by the city – because the service is important. Our demographics, our community needs a DMV that's located on bus lines.' The closure of MVC offices in Elizabeth and two other towns came at the end of 2010, ten weeks after the governor's office notified local officials that the decision had been made. Whispers had circulated around Trenton for months about a plan to consolidate locations, but insiders tell MailOnline that no one expected Elizabeth to be on the short list. 'We heard at the time that Christie was stupid, that he made poor blacks think he didn't sympathize with them,' a veteran New Jersey Republican strategist said Wednesday, 'and in retrospect that's probably what happened.' 'I mean, look – these are folks who need to take the bus to renew their ID. They may have an old car, but they take the train to work. The Elizabeth location was on all the transit routes. And the one in Newark? You have to drive there.' 'Maybe Christie's people were a little tone-deaf,' the political insider said. Lesniak sounded a similar note at the time, calling his home town 'predominately minority, low-income.' 'I think it’s a cold, cruel and, ... despicable thing for them to do this,' he said, noting that Elizabeth's taxpayers were less likely than New Jerseyans in wealthier areas to be able to conduct their MVC business online. Scene of the crime? These George Washington Bridge toll booths were the location of the man-made 'Bridgegate' traffic bottlenecks that backed up commuters across the town of Fort Lee, New Jersey in September. Investigators are probing how high up in the governor's office the plot reached . Heads roll: Bridget Kelly (R) was a fixture alongside Christie as he toured disaster areas following the devastating Hurricane Sandy in 2013, but got the axe this month when emails from her emerged in which she appeared to orchestrate the bridge toll lane closures . Months later, with the Elizabeth office shuttered, Lesniak said his constituents were finding 3- and 4-hour wait times at other MVC locations, more than 5 miles away, that absorbed the overflow. 'The agencies around us got all that . foot traffic from the shut-down Elizabeth office,' Cryan recalled, . He and Lesniak introduced a bill forcing the Motor Vehicles Commission to find a way to limit wait times to just 15 minutes system-wide. It passed in the Senate but never got a vote on the Assembly floor. In one public hearing, Assemblyman Gary Schaer, a Passaic Democrat, quickly calculated that the Elizabeth MVC's 23 employees were already meeting that 15-minute standard when they lost their jobs. 'Why in the name of whatever would we want to be eliminating one of the branch divisions of your organization that is already achieving that?' Schaer asked a hearing witness from the Motor Vehicle Commission. 'And I did this on the back of a napkin.' Mayor Bollwage added Wednesday via email – he's recovering from surgery on his vocal cords – that Gov. Christie saw the reorganization as an opportune moment to appoint two political allies as managers of the nearest MVC locations to survive. Bollwage named Carlos Trujillo and Armando Da Silva, current and former members of the Elizabeth Board of Education who have supported Christie in both of his statewide elections. Their MVC jobs pay in excess of $70,000 each, according to public records. 'This administration is not one to deal with unless you want to get hurt in the future,' Mayor Bollwage said of Gov. Chris Christie's GOP inner circle in Trenton . The decision to close his city's MVC office, Bollwage said, came after a drawn-out legislative battle over annual increases on property tax rates. Christie ran for governor on a platform of capping those rate hikes at 2 per cent. The mayor objected, he said, because 'tax bills in New Jersey are comprised of local taxes, county taxes and school taxes, and some have fire district taxes too.' 'All of those entities have a 2 per cent cap on their tax levy,' he explained, 'which in essence amounts to a 6 per cent tax increase to the property tax payer.' More slights? A budget for red-light cameras in Elizabeth fell on deaf ears -- another sign, says the town's Democratic mayor, of political favoritism at work . And, Bollwage said, the Christie administration has given legal exemptions to some municipalities – allowing Elizabeth's school board, for instance, to push through a 7.5 per cent tax hike last year. After the mayor objected, a Christie administration official in charge of education finances wrote to the city government insisting that despite the law's plain text, 'the tax levy cap for school districts ... is not a hard 2 percent cap.' The mayor cited that episode as another indication that New Jerseyans in Democratic strongholds like Elizabeth and Fort Lee aren't served well by their governor. 'This administration is not one to deal with unless you want to get hurt in the future,' he said. But the motor vehicle department office closure still stings three years later, he said. 'We have had a DMV since Henry Ford was building cars,' Bollwage said. And Cryan told MailOnline that he knew right away when the announcement came in October 2010 that he had been 'Christied.' 'It wasn't hard to figure it out,' the assemblyman said. 'We knew the deal' Christie, he said, 'was always one of those guys who punished individual legislators for not supporting the way he thinks. That's just who he is.'","Elizabeth, NJ lost its Motor Vehicle Commission office at the end of 2010, leaving locals without a place for licenses and vehicle tags .

"Accidentally exposing yourself in pictures posted on eBay may sound like a tricky thing to do - but it appears to happen much more frequently than you would think. These embarrassing images were all posted online for the world to see by eBay sellers who thought it was a good idea to take pictures of their merchandise in the nude. Unfortunately for them, their reflections have been caught in mirrors, CD covers, TV and computer screens as they took pictures for the website. TV star: This eBay seller has captured themselves on the small screen while taking a picture of a television they wanted to sell on the website . One eBay seller even managed to capture his entirely naked body in the reflection of a metal kettle but his manhood was strategically covered by his tripod and camera. And once these photos go up online, it won't be long before some eagle-eyed shoppers spot the blunder, as eBay seller Aimi Jones recently discovered. The 21-year-old had accidentally included a naked view of herself when she posted a picture of a dress for sale on the website.

A cheeky shot: This photographer didn't seem to notice someone exposing themselves in the background of the picture . But when viewing the picture, she failed to notice her own reflection in the door mirror, camera in hand, and in just a black bra and no knickers. The post soon went viral and despite Miss Jones' attempt to have it removed, it is now all over the internet. Miss Jones, from Oxfordshire, told The Sun: 'It's so embarrassing. It is such a dizzy, stupid thing to do and now the whole world's seen me in the nude. 'I put it on eBay last Saturday morning and realised straight away so ended the sale. But what I didn't realise was that people could still it on the site. That picture's a little bit overexposed: This eBay seller doesn't take the reflection from the camera flash into account in this image . Not the sharpest image: A seller tries to demonstrate the quality of the TV but ends up also sharing the contents of their living room . Snap happy: This seller got so carried away with taking pictures for the site, they failed to notice the very clear naked view of themselves . 'I reported it to eBay and they took it down, but by then it had gone viral. My boyfriend Andy thinks the whole thing is hilarious.' The blunder sparked a flurry of fake eBay sale ads for the yellow dress with fictional characters accidentally making an appearance earlier this week.

"A 26-year-old Colorado man has pleaded guilty to causing the death of his ex-girlfriend's toddler son after beating the child so aggressively that his intestines ruptured. Justin Keel faces 24 to 36 years in prison for child abuse resulting in the death of 19-month-old Owen Reak, who passed away on April 11 of internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to his abdomen. Social services had investigated reported abuse at the home just 19 days before Owen's death, after he was rushed to hospital with a broken leg while in Keel's care. Keel claimed the boy's leg got stuck in his high chair and the child was allowed to continue living with his mother, Amber Reak, and Keel. Tragic: Owen Reak, pictured, died on April 11 of internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to his abdomen . Reak, who was in the process of obtaining a divorce from Owen's father, agreed that she wouldn't leave the child alone in Keel's care again. But less than three weeks later, Owen suffered fatal injuries at the hands of the man, while his mother was in the shower. According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, Reak said she heard two 'booms' while she was in the bathroom on the morning of April 10. She found Keel holding the boy who he described as being 'fussy' after falling off his bed. Horrific abuse: Owen, 19 months, had been beaten so aggressively that his intestines ruptured . Broken leg: Little Owen, pictured left and right, had been rushed to hospital with a broken leg while in the care of Justin Keel 19 days before his death . Keel initially denied hurting the . child to authorities and later claimed his dog, a boxer named Rusty, could have been . responsible for the Owen's injuries. After the incident, the couple dropped the boy off at daycare at around 10.30am. But shortly after, the daycare provider, who happened to be Reak's father Jim Milligan, called and insisted Owen be taken to hospital. Doctors at Community Hospital in Grand Junction gave him an X-ray but said everything looked OK and that he likely had a stomach flu. Owen eventually succumbed to his . injuries while sleeping that night at his grandparents home. Guilty: Justin Keel, pictured left, faces 24 to 36 years in prison after pleading guilty to child abuse resulting in the death of Amber Reak's, right, son Owen . Abuse not picked up: Social securities investigated reported abuse at the home 19 days before Owen, pictured with Santa, died . According to the Daily Sentinel, his grandparents said Owen appeared sick and kept a close eye on him the night of April 10 after he wouldn't eat, had been throwing up and 'appeared in abdominal pain.' They also noted . bruises around his face. They last checked on him around 1:30am on April 11, and the child was breathing at the time. But at around 4am they called 911 and reported Owen was cold to the touch and stiff in his crib. A forensic pathologist later determined that Owen's internal bleeding may have been missed 'if the X-rays were done shortly after the time of injury,' according to The Denver Post. The pathologist said the injuries could have been caused by someone punching or kicking the child's stomach, or being struck with an object. Hospital blunder: After the beating, Owen, pictured, was taken to hospital where doctors diagnosed him with stomach flu . Mother: Owen, pictured right, suffered the fatal injuries while his mother, Amber Reaks, left, was in the shower . On Tuesday, Keel pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in death after prosecutors added a first-degree murder charge to his list of charges. If convicted of the murder charge, Keel could have been sentenced to life without parole. The charge Keel pleaded guilty to . referred to abuse stretching for about six weeks, from the beginning of .

"An advert for a SodaStream machine due to air in a prime slot on ITV was pulled at the last minute - because it encouraged viewers to shun bottled soft drinks to help save the environment. The commercial for the soda maker was to be screened during a break in last night's episode of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here, but a watchdog decided it could not be aired because it was unfairly critical of the soft drinks industry. SodaStream UK branded the decision to pull its ad - which shows familiar looking plastic bottles of fizzy drinks exploding as people hit the button on the machine - 'absurd'. Scroll down for video . Pulled: The advert shows a woman hitting the button on her SodaStream machine . As she hits the button, the scene cuts to some familiar looking plastic bottles disappearing . The advert sees various people using a SodaStream machine to create their own carbonated drinks. Each time somebody presses the button on the soda maker, rows of plastic bottles are seen disappearing, sending the fizzy contents pouring on to the ground. The firm said it had hoped to deliver a 'powerful message' about waste and sustainability with its new campaign, which ends with the line: 'With SodaStream, you can save 2,000 bottles per year'. But just before the campaign was due to hit screens, Clearcast, the organisation that pre-approves UK TV advertising, decided the commercial was unsuitable. 'Absurd': SodaStream UK said it would push to get Clearcast to reverse its decision not to approve the commercial . Disappearing bottles: Clearcast said the commercial 'denigrated' the bottled drinks industry . Sustainable: SodaStream UK insisted it had not named or disparaged any competitors in its advert . The advert was due to air during last night's episode of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here . SodaStream said it was told by Clearcast that the advert could be seen to encourage consumers not to go to supermarkets and buy soft drinks, but instead to help save the environment by buying a soda making machine. Fiona Hope, managing director of SodaStream UK, said: 'This decision is absurd. We have neither named nor disparaged any of our competitors in the industry and cannot see how this makes any sense. She said the decision appeared to give priority to 'soft drink giants' over concern for the environment. 'Through the ad, we are simply displaying an alternative way to living more sustainably and illustrating one of our product's benefits - the reduction of plastic bottle wastage,' she said. 'The consumer should be allowed to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and the products to choose.' The company intends to push for the decision to be reversed. Although SodaStream said it was informed the environmental message in its advert was partly to blame for it being pulled, Clearcast said last night that environmental issues were 'not relevant' to its decision. Clearcast said in a statement: 'SodaStream submitted a finished filmed ad to us for approval on Tuesday 20th November without a pre-production script. 'On Thursday 22nd November we had been able to review it against the BCAP code and concluded we were unable to approve it. 'In our view, its visual treatment denigrated other soft drinks which put it in breach of the BCAP code.' The organisation said that should SodaStream put forward an amended version it would work with the firm to agree an 'acceptable treatment'.

"Stephen Colbert last night got his revenge on Mormons posthumously baptising Holocaust victims in a practice causing outrage among Jews. The Catholic comedian gave his own take on the issue by ‘converting all dead Mormons to Judaism’ using a hot dog sausage and a cigar cutter. His ‘proxy circumcision’ came after it was revealed Anne Frank has been posthumously baptised by a Mormon for the tenth time in 23 years. Scroll down for video . Joke: Stephen Colbert gave his own take on the baptism issue by 'converting all dead Mormons to Judaism' using a hot dog sausage and a cigar-cutter . 'Proxy circumcision' Mr Colbert said 600,000 dead Jews have now received . posthumous baptisms from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day . Saints . Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel recently learned several of his relatives who died under the Nazis were posthumously baptised by Mormons. But Mr Colbert, 47, told a Comedy Central audience that the 83-year-old author should not be so upset about a ‘name being on a list’. He added that 600,000 dead Jews have now received posthumous baptisms from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. ‘This controversy just seems like it will not die - and, if it did, the Mormons would posthumously baptise it,’ Mr Colbert said on his show. Done: Mr Colbert told a Comedy Central audience that Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel should not be so upset about a 'name being on a list' He went on to invite his Jewish intern . ‘Jay’ onto the set to help him perform the ‘proxy circumcision’, . reported the Los Angeles Times. 'This controversy just seems like it will not die - and, if it did, the Mormons would posthumously baptise it' Stephen Colbert . Mr Colbert claimed he was given the . power to do this by renting Yentl, the 1983 Barbra Streisand film about a . Jewish girl disguised as a boy. ‘Congratulations dead Mormons, you’re now dead Jews,’ he said. ‘I just pray that no one baptises you without your permission.’ The Mormon Church is coming under more scrutiny thanks to Broadway show The Book of Mormon and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. Furious: Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel recently learned several of his relatives who died under the Nazis were posthumously baptised by Mormons . Mr Romney helped baptise his staunch . atheist relative Edward Roderick Davies, father of his wife Ann, years . after the man had died in 1992. 'Congratulations dead Mormons, you’re now dead Jews. I just pray that no one baptises you without your permission' Stephen Colbert . Mr Wiesel told Mr Romney to renounce the practice of posthumously baptising Holocaust victims in the Mormon church last week. Holocaust victim Anne Frank was . posthumously baptised by a Mormon at a Dominican Republic temple last . weekend for the first time in 13 years. The . Jewish girl and her diary rose to fame after she died during the World . War Two Holocaust in 1945 at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany. Involved: Holocaust victim Anne Frank, left, who died in 1945, and . survivor Simon Wiesenthal, right, who died in 2005, have both been . victims of the scandal . Researcher Helen Radkey made the . discovery after she found the same was done to the parents of Nazi . hunter Simon Wiesenthal two weeks ago. An agreement from 1995 required Mormons to avoid submitting names of Holocaust victims for baptism unless they are their direct ancestors. But Anne, who died aged 15, was baptised by proxy an astonishing nine times between 1989 and 1999, Ms Radkey told the Huffington Post. Mormons often perform the baptisms, saying people who died that did not get the chance to be baptised while living can choose to deny it. A spokesman for the Mormon Church said it was ‘distressed’ by the finding on Anne and ‘keeps its word’ in not baptising Holocaust victims. See video here .

"A German opera has been cancelled amid a storm of criticism after it featured performers dressed in Nazi uniform, a Jewish family being massacred and a brutal rape scene. Members of the audience began walking out of Burkhard C. Kosminski's interpretation of Wagner's classic 'Tannhaeuser' after only 30 minutes and some required medical attention for 'psychological trauma'. The Rhine Opera House in Duesseldorf said although it knew the concert would be 'controversial' it had not expected such an extreme reaction. Criticism: The opera upset some members of the audience because it featured performers in Nazi uniform . Controversial: In one scene the character Wolfram, left, brutally rapes Elisabeth, right . Kosminksi said he had wanted to 'address' the anti-Semitic attitude of composers like Wagner, who was known to be one of Adolf Hitler's favourites. In one scene, naked performers came onto the stage in smoke-filled gas chambers to kill the character Venus, dressed as an S.S. officer, and a Jewish family in a parody of a WW2 massacre. In another, a character . called Elisabeth was brutally raped by Tannhauser’s rival Wolfram and left . bloodied and crying on stage. And finally, a mother, father and daughter were led up by . members of the Wehrmacht - their clothes were removed, they were shaved and . shot. Kosminski was reportedly confronted at the first night after-party by angry critics who told him he had made 'a travesty of German culture'. Anger: Many members of the audience walked out in disgust at the interpretation of Wagner's 'Tannhaeuser' The Rhine Opera House has cancelled the stage production for the remainder of the dates following the outcry . Israel’s ambassador to Germany voiced his displeasure, and . some left the theatre 'bathed in sweat' according to a report in the online . edition of the local Rheinische Post. Oded Horowitz, head of the Jewish community of North Rhine, . said; 'Survivors are likely to find the provocative handling of Nazi history in . this Tannhaeuser production quite painful.' 'While remembrance of Nazi crimes is . important', he said, 'a theatre scandal is not our preferred form of confronting . the past.' The Rhine Opera House has confirmed that the production will be performed as a concert only for the remaining dates. Last July, Russian opera singer Evgeny Nikitin was pressured . to withdraw from Germany’s famous Bayreuth Opera Festival because of Nazi . tattoos on his chest and arm.

"A Utah man driving a motorboat on Lake Powell was apparently distracted by his young passengers when he hit a houseboat and flipped the craft, leaving his wife dead and his daughter and his son's girlfriend missing, deputies said. Adrian Jackman, 59, of South Jordan, apparently tried to swerve when he noticed the moving houseboat but hit the front corner, authorities said. The accident that happened at around 8am Thursday killed his wife, Marilyn Jackman, 57. His daughter, Jessica Jackman, 22, and his son's girlfriend, Valerie Rae Bradshaw, 29, of Sandy, Utah, are missing in the water.

Family horror: Marilyn Jackman (left), 57, was killed when her husband, Adrian (right), crashed the powerboat he was driving . Aftermath: The motorboat, which was carrying 13 passengers, slammed into a houseboat and flipped over last Thursday . Crews brought a robot equipped with a camera to search for the missing women Friday in the 400-foot-deep water near Dangling Rope Marina. But they ran into technical problems and had to call off the effort, according to Denise Shultz, spokeswoman for the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that encompasses Lake Powell. She said the Utah Highway Patrol has been asked to bring in equipment from the Salt Lake City area, and the search is expected to resume Saturday. Most of the people aboard the motorboat, which was carrying 13 passengers, were family members from northern Utah, deputies said. Nobody on the houseboat was injured. It's not uncommon for boaters to venture out early in the morning while the waters of Lake Powell are smooth, said Kane County sheriff's Sgt. Alan Alldredge. Search: Divers are still looking for Miss Jackman who was thrown from a boat that crashed in Dangling Rope Marina, pictured . The vast man-made lake, bordered . by sandstone walls and colorful rock formations, is a popular . destination for houseboat vacations. Deputies . said the group was headed to Rainbow Bridge — touted as the largest . known natural bridge in the world — when the crash happened. Crews had . to rescue some victims from the water, Shultz said. All . of the six children aboard were wearing life jackets, officials said. Adrian Jackman and his 11-year-old granddaughter were airlifted to a . hospital in Flagstaff, Ariz., while a third person was taken to the . hospital by ambulance. The Jackmans' family and friends in the town of South Jordan were left reeling from the news of the tragedy. Big dreams: Family friends say Jessica Jackman (far left) aspired to be Miss America and a social worker when she grew up . Keeping the faith: Jessica Jackman grew up in the Mormon Church, and her father serves as a local bishop for the Latter Day Saints church . 'It's been pretty hard to take,' neighbor Rick Wahlquist told the station KSL. 'And I know there's a lot of people that are really just struggling and . in shock over the whole thing. Marilyn is a saint and would do anything . for anybody at anytime.' Adrian . Jackman serves as the bishop of the Later Day Saints Church's Parkway . 1st Ward in South Jordan. Friends say the whole family are avid boaters . and vacationed on Lake Powell often. Mr Wahlquist, who lived near the . Jackmans for 20 years, said as a young girl, Jessica wanted to be a wife . and Miss America when she grew up. she also aspired to become a social . worker. 'Just a great young woman,' Wahlquist said. 'And what a tragedy to see this happen.' Bradshaw's friends said she was extremely outgoing and loved having fun. Life of the party: Valerie Rae Bradshaw (right) was described by those who knew her as an outgoing and fun-loving young woman . Getaway gone awry: Valerie's roommates said the 29-year-old loved spending time on Lake Powell and had been looking forward to her vacation with the Jackmans for months . 'She will be so missed because when . she enters the room, it becomes full,' said roommate Aloyse Robertson. 'It becomes bright. And we love her.' Friend . Auri Root said Valerie had been lookign forward to the Lake Powell trip . for weeks and months. She leaves behind a twin sister. The . crash happened in a channel a couple of hundred yards wide in Lake . Powell. Police believe the driver may have looked away from where he was . headed after a child moved from the front to the back of the boat, KSL said. Alan Alldredge, from Kane County Sheriff's Department, said that as someone yelled 'Boat' the driver looked up to see a houseboat in their path. As he tried to swerve, Jackman clipped the houseboat with enough force to throw his 12 passengers overboard. Police confirmed the six children on board had been wearing life jackets. Vacation: Lake Powell, where the powerboat carrying 13 people flipped over, is a popular destination for boating holidays . A dive team searched for the missing women until 7pm last night. The search will resume tomorrow. . The water in Lake Powell is about 400ft deep at the crash site, according to Center Daily News. Rescue teams may have to use sonar equipment to find the women. 'This time of year, the lake can get busy and these kinds of accidents, even though they’re not rare, they do have a great potential for happening out there,' Mr Alldredge said.","Two missing women identified as 22-year-old Jessica Jackman and 29-year-old Valerie Rae Bradshaw .

"She is a 71-year-old Dame, a businesswoman with a fortune of millions and mother to two sons. But just as nothing stopped Vivienne Westwood from living her life the way she chose back in the punk era when she was setting out as a fashion designer, nothing will stop her now. And as two large-than-life nude portraits of the flame-haired designer were revealed to a well-heeled crowd at the ICA last night, it was clear that she may have been picking up her pension for 11 years now, Vivienne Westwood is anything but retiring. Dame Vivienne was very much the star of the show - in more ways than one - as she attended the launch of close friend Juergen Teller's first major UK exhibition in 10 years, held at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London yesterday. Scroll down for video . Striking: The portraits of Dame Vivienne, taken three years ago, went on show in the UK for the first time today at London's Institute of Contemporary Art . Not only was her presence at the party very much felt when she arrived in her typical flamboyant style on the arm of her rugged, bearded husband Andreas, but the exhibition itself was dominated by two larger than life nudes of Dame Westwood in various states of repose. One colourful shot sees Dame Vivienne sitting naked on a couch, smiling cheerfully for the camera as if she cared not a jot that the world would one day see the image. And given Dame Vivienne's notorious approach to establishment and conformity, you can be sure she really couldn't give a fig (leaf). Teller's first exhibition in the UK in over ten years also included nude portraits of models Lily Cole (pictured here) and Kristen McMenamy . Star of the show: Dame Vivienne with her husband, Andreas Kronthaler, far left, photographer Juergen Teller, centre, and model Kristen McMenamy, who also features in the exhibition, right, dining at Ill Bottaccio after the unveiling . Flamboyant: Dame Vivienne Westwood, pictured with Stella McCartney at last night's launch, has been friends with Teller for many years and is a great admirer of his work . Impressive: 'I've worked with her a long time and I'm always amazed at how wonderful her skin is,' Teller said of the work . The portrait was taken three years ago when Vivienne was 68 years old. Speaking . to New York magazine when it was first revealed in an exhibition at the . Lehmann Maupin gallery in the city, Teller said photographing Vivienne . was an amazing experience - and he was blown away, as ever, by her . beauty. 'It was . lovely,' said Teller at the time, 'in her house, on a Sunday evening. I’ve worked with her a long time, and I’m always amazed at how wonderful . her skin is. 'She . looks amazing and she’s, like, 70 now [Vivienne has since turned 71]. She was 68 when I did the pictures (...) and I was just curious about . how she would look naked. 'If you think of naked pictures of old people, they’re all wrinkled – and they are not! So I like it a lot. 'And . then when she said, ‘Okay, let’s do it,’ and she was sitting there I . was thinking, ‘Oh my f****** hell, man!’ I didn’t quite expect it. So . that was great!' Elsewhere in the exhibition, his . first in the UK in over 10 years, Teller showed nude portraits of models . Lily Cole and Kristen McMenamy. The exhibition, which opens today at the The Institute of Contemporary Art, is a visual narrative of the man who has become one of the most important photographers . of his generation. The iconic images take in Teller's landmark . fashion, art, personal and commercial photography from the Nineties . through to the current day, as well as some landscapes and family . portraits from his family collection. The man of the moment: Juergen Teller at the ICA last night, where along with his portraits were ads he has shot for various big fashion brands . Special guests: Nancy Dell'Olio and model Laura Bailey at last night's unveiling . The 49-year-old German-born . photographer, who has also photographed famous names from  Victoria . Beckham to Helena Bonham Carter and One Direction, entered the London . photography scene by taking pictures for use on record covers. It was his iconic photograph of Sinéad O’Connor for her single Nothing . Compares 2 You that brought him into the commercial big time - and his career has . gone from strength to strength ever since. Teller’s photographs first appeared . in fashion magazines in the late 80s, and included portraits of Kate . Moss when she was just fifteen years old.

"One of San Francisco's most famous and smelly tourist attractions has gone under - water that is - but it seems inevitable the boisterous star-attractions will come sliding right back. A colony of sea lions who have resided on the wooded decks of Pier 39 for more than 20 have made a sudden exit, just as they made an expected arrival in October 1989. Shortly after the Loma Prieta earthquake hit San Francisco, the sea lions began taking up residence at the pier and forming an urban colony. Scroll down for video . The pier was this week abandoned by the barking mammals who are thought to have gone south to breed . The decks of San Francisco's Pier 39, seen here in 2012, were once home to hundreds of sea lions . Previously, sea lions barely had enough room to stretch out on the wood pier decks during peak times . By January the following year they had taken over the area, much to the displeasure of marina tenants, and there was soon more than 300 of them lounging about and barking. The pier soon became a tourist attraction and by November 2009, the colony reached an all-time high of 1,701. This week the decks, once full of the blubbery sun bathers, were empty with tourists left to look out over rows of empty wooden decks. It is thought the sea lions may have headed south to breed, as this isn't the first time the colony has disappeared on mass. Tourists look out over the empty wooden decks of Pier 39 where not a single sea lion can be seen . Scientists believe the sea lions went south to breed . In 2009 their numbers rose to more than 1,500, but a month later only 10 remained. At the time experts said the length of their stay, rather than their exit, was surprising. Sea lions are migratory animals so it is in their nature to move around, San Francisco's The Marine Mammal Centre said at that time.","San Francisco pier was once home to more than 1,700 sea lions .

"Immigration into Germany has soared as people from crisis-hit southern European countries join waves of Poles, Romanians and Bulgarians seeking jobs and homes in the EU's economic powerhouse. Official figures show immigration reached a 17-year high, a sign of what Britain can expect when borders are opened to workers from new EU countries in January next year. And as in the UK, they have fuelled a debate about new strains on the Germany's welfare system and the long term consequences for the country's economy. New arrivals: Residents of the estate on In . Den Peschen in Duisburg, Germany, where up to 400 Romanian and Bulgarian . immigrants have moved in since last February. Immigration to Germany . has reached a 17-year high . In all, 1.08million people moved to Germany last year, according to the Federal Statistics Office, a 13 per cent increase on 2011. The numbers reveal how the eurozone's debt crisis is reshaping the fabric of European society as well as individual national economies. The biggest increases came from people moving from the stricken economies of Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy, but the most people came from Poland (68,100), while 45,700 came from Romania, and 51,500 from from Hungary and Bulgaria. 'Until recently, Germany was an emigration country, but now people are flocking to Germany in search of work, as their home countries are mired in recession,' said Wolfgang Nagl, a labour market expert at the Ifo institute. The number of people moving to Germany from Spain jumped 45 per cent in 2012 from a year earlier to 30,000. Some 42,000 people moved to Germany from Italy - a 40 per cent spike - while the number of immigrants to Germany from Greece and Portugal rose 43 per cent for each country, highlighting an acceleration which started in 2010 after the Greek economy imploded. Social pressures: A man sticks his finger up at . the photographer on the In Den Peschen estate. The local mayor claims . migrants are causing havoc, committing crimes and costing his authority  £15million a year . Strains are already being felt. In Duisburg, an old industrial city on the Rhine, Roma people are accused of turning neighbourhoods into rubbish-strewn ghettos. Mayor Soren Link claims Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are causing havoc, committing crimes and costing his authority close to £15million a year to house, feed and police. He claims prostitution and robberies have spiked since the EU's latest members began arriving last year. 'We are massively affected,' said the mayor, confirming the fears of the Association of German Cities which recently warned of 'social unrest' in many places because of the economic refugees. Crisis: Protesters hold flags in front of the Greek parliament during a May Day rally. Migrants from countries in the south are on average 10 years younger than German natives and more likely to have a university degree . On the other hand, many of those from southern countries are welcomed because they contribute to the economy. According to the Expert Council of German Foundations on Integration and Migration, immigrants are on average 10 years younger than German natives and more likely to have a university degree. 'Germany is reaping the measurable rewards of free movement thanks to skilled immigrants from other EU countries. This has received too little attention to date,' said the group's chairman Christine Langenfeld. Immigration from Slovenia was up 62 per cent as the transition period toward free labour movement ended in May 2011. The number of Hungarians moving to Germany rose 31 per cent.","Immigration reaches 17-year high with a million moving to Germany last year .

"Margarine giant Flora has become embroiled in a homophobia row after launching an advertising campaign that appears to liken a parent's perceived anguish at being told their child is gay to a bullet through the heart. On a pink background, the advert depicts the words 'uhh dad, I'm gay' fashioned into the shape of a bullet as it flies through the air towards a human heart made of china. At the bottom of the poster, next to Flora's famous logo, appear the words: 'You need a strong heart today.' Homophobic: On a pink background, the advert depicts the words 'uhh dad, I'm gay' fashioned into the shape of a bullet as it flies through the air towards a human heart made of china . 'Edgy': The campaign, by Lowe + Partners Johannesburg, also has a similar advert referencing the Kama Sutra . Flora, which is owned by consumer goods firm Unilever, has come under a barrage of criticism from gay rights groups who claim the advert, which is believed to be from South Africa, is homophobic. A spokesman for gay rights group Stonewall said: 'Many people will clearly find this advert offensive and inappropriate. 'Perhaps Flora should have a chat with their Unilever colleagues, Ben & Jerry, about how best to produce gay friendly advertising fit for the 21st century.' Last month ice cream maker Ben&Jerry's renamed their Cookie Dough flavour to 'I Dough, I dough', in support of same-sex marriage in Australia. Some people took to Twitter yesterday to vent their frustration at the advert's connotations. Jamie Rowe wrote: 'Dear @Unilever - great work with the homophobic Flora advert, d****ebags.

Australia, has for years been marketed as containing ingredients that provide for a healthy heart. A Unilever spokesperson said: 'This advert was prepared by an external agency in South Africa and was not approved by anyone at Unilever.

Holding hands: Brian Clough (left) and Terry Venables when they were managers of Nottingham Forest and Spurs respectively, at the start of the 1991 FA Cup Final . The Dagenham-born 71-year-old said: 'As I come out he grips my right hand with his left hand and I'm clamped, I'm clamped.' Venables appears to say they looked like a 'pair of woofters'. Sky Sports presenter and former footballer Chris Kamara, sitting on the sofa opposite, then laughed loudly, while the show's host Ben Shephard looked uncomfortable.

"The controversy over ammonia-treated beef - or what critics dub ‘pink slime’ - broadened this week as it was revealed that the caustic cleaning chemical is also used in cheese. Related compounds are also used in baked goods and chocolate. Ammonia, known for its noxious odor, . became a hot topic with the uproar over what the meat . industry calls ‘finely textured beef’ and what a former U.S. government . scientist first called ‘pink slime’. Backlash: Meat industry experts have struck back after the 'pink slime' controversy by pointing out that the chemical is also used in cheese . The caustic cleaning chemical is also used widely in cheese and similar chemicals are used in baking products . Ammonia is a nitrogen compound with a distinctive pungent smell of urine. It's used widely as a cleaning agent - although it's highly caustic in its pure form. 'Pink slime' beef is made from fatty trimmings sprayed with ammonium hydroxide - ammonia mixed with water - to remove pathogens such as salmonella and E.coli. Ammonia compounds are used as leavening agents in baked goods and as an acidity controller in cheese and sometimes chocolate.     Kraft Foods, whose brands include Chips Ahoy cookies and Velveeta cheese, is one company that uses very small amounts of ammonium compounds in some of its products. It declined to specify which products. ‘Sometimes ingredient names sound more complicated than they are,’ said Kraft spokeswoman Angela Wiggins.Wiggins said that in turning milk to cheese, a tiny amount of ammonium hydroxide is added to a starter dairy culture to reduce the culture's acidity and encourage cheese cultures to grow. The meat industry has been trying to . raise awareness of other foods that contain ammonia, in response to what . it has characterized as an unfair attack on a safe and healthy . product. For example, ammonia compounds are . used as leavening agents in baked goods and as an acidity controller in . cheese and sometimes chocolate. ‘Ammonia's not an unusual product to . find added to food,’ Gary Acuff, director of Texas A&M University's . Center for Food Safety, told a recent press conference hosted by Beef . Products Inc. ‘We use ammonia in all kinds of foods in the food . industry.’ After critics highlighted the product . on social media websites and showed unappetizing photos on television, . calling it ‘pink slime,’ the nation's leading fast-food chains and . supermarkets spurned the product, even though U.S. public health . officials deem it safe to eat. Hundreds of U.S. school districts also . demanded it be removed from school lunch programs. One producer, Beef Products Inc, has since idled three factories. Another, AFA Foods, filed for bankruptcy protection. Ammonia - often associated with . cleaning products - was cleared by U.S. health officials nearly 40 years . ago and is used in making many foods, including cheese. Related . compounds have a role in baked goods and chocolate products. Using small amounts of ammonia to make . food is not unusual to those expert in high-tech food production. Now . that little known world is coming under increasing pressure from . concerned consumers who want to know more about what they are eating. ‘I think we're seeing a . sea change today in consumers' concerns about the presence of . ingredients in foods, and this is just one example,’ said Michael Doyle, . director of the University of Georgia's Center for Food Safety. 'Slime': The meat industry has retaliated to complaints over its use of ammonia by pointing out that other foods including cheese also use the chemical . Support: Texas Gov. Rick Perry showed his support for Beef Products Inc by tucking into a 'pink slime' burger during a tour of one of their plants . The outrage, which many experts say has been fueled by the term ‘pink slime,’ seems more about the unsavoriness of the product rather than its safety. ‘This is not a health issue,’ said Bill Marler, a prominent food safety lawyer. ‘This is an 'I'm grossed out by this' issue.’ Still, critics of so-called ‘Big Food’ point out that while ‘pink slime’ and the ammonia in it may not be harmful, consumer shock over their presence points to a wider issue. ‘The food supply is full of all sorts of chemical additives that people don't know about,’ said Michele Simon, a public health lawyer and president of industry watchdog consulting firm Eat Drink Politics. Wiggins said that in turning milk to cheese, a tiny amount of ammonium hydroxide is added to a starter dairy culture to reduce the culture's acidity and encourage cheese cultures to grow. ‘It is somewhat similar to activating yeast for dough by adding warm water, sugar and salt to create the proper environment for yeast growth,’ Wiggins said. In the case of ammonium phosphate, used as a leavening agent in baking, she said the heat during baking causes the gas to evaporate.","Caustic cleaning chemical is also used to turn milk to cheese .

"An Italian teenager has died after falling 60 feet on to jagged rocks as she tried to take a ‘selfie’. Sixteen-year-old Isabella Fracchiolla was trying to take a photograph of herself on the seafront during a school trip to the seaside town of Taranto, in south-eastern Italy. The schoolgirl who suffered injuries to her femur, pelvis and head was rushed to hospital where she underwent a major operation. The teenager fell while taking a selfie during a school trip to the town of Taranto, pictured, in south eastern Italy . But doctors were unable to save her life, Italian newspaper Corriere del Mezzogiorno said. The craze for ‘selfies’ has gained global popularity and has fans as wide ranging as Pope Francis and Ellen de Generes. But experts have warned people are increasingly putting themselves at risk as they try to take more spectacular and risky self portraits to outdo their friends. The drive to put more and more outlandish pictures on social media sites has already had tragic consequences. The 16-year-old fell near to Taranto's seafront, pictured, suffering multiple injuries and doctors were unable to save her . In April a 17-year-old Russian girl plunged 30 feet to her death after climbing onto a railway bridge and getting electrocuted by live wires. The same month a 32-year-old woman in South Carolina, who was posting selfies online as she drove, died when she crashed her car head-on into a truck.

"David Miliband earned a staggering £20,000 a day as an adviser for a company investing in green technology, it has been revealed. The former Foreign Secretary was paid £70,000 for just three-and-a-half days spent working for VantagePoint CleanTech in California. The post with the American venture capitalists is the latest in a series of lucrative part-time positions Mr Miliband has taken up since being beaten by his brother in the Labour leadership contest. Bumper pay days: David Miliband has earned more than £500,000 since being beaten by his brother in the Labour leadership election 18 months ago . On top of that he also pocketed £125,000 for delivering eight speeches around the world in the last year, according to the House of Commons register of financial interests. News of Mr Miliband’s staggering earnings comes after his brother has led a populist attack on 'fat cat' executives in a bid to turn round his flagging political fortunes. How David Miliband has built up his fortune since losing the Labour leadership election in September 2010. His pay includes: . In total, David Miliband earned in excess of £380,000 in the last 12 months - on top of his annual MP's salary of £65,000. Since losing the leadership poll 18 months ago he has earned more than £500,000. There is no suggestion that he has broken any rules by taking up the highly-paid positions. VantagePoint paid him to travel over to the U.S. to carry out his three days work in August and September last year. He was recruited to advise the company's investment team on international opportunities and policy innovations. Alan Salzman, VantagePoint chief-executive, said as he was appointed last year: 'David brings a truly unique perspective and world-class experience that will help us navigate complex energy markets.' Mr Miliband said: 'In a world shifting from resource plenty to resource scarcity I am looking forward to working with VantagePoint towards real solutions to global energy needs.' The company have invested £2.5billion in IT, digital media, energy efficiency and green industries. Last month David Miliband took another lucrative job with Pakistan-based City firm Indus Basin Holdings. The firm, set up to funnel investment into Pakistani agriculture, boasts a number of colourful backers, including a Swiss aristocrat playboy called Baron Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza. Fat cat attack: Ed Miliband, left, has criticised high executive pay while his brother has taken on a series of high-paying part-time roles . Mr Miliband, who will earn about £50,000 a year from the part-time position – which is not expected to occupy him for more than a few days a month. He also earns £75,000 a year as a non-executive director at Sunderland Football Club for just 12 to 15 days work a year. The politician has constructed his business affairs in a way that appears to limit tax liability. Mr Miliband would pay income tax at the normal rate on his £65,000 salary for being an MP. But his non-parliamentary earnings, however, are paid into a company called The Office Of David Miliband Limited, which is subject to corporation tax of between 20 per cent and 27.5 per cent – substantially less than the 50 per cent rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000.","Mr Miliband earns more than £500,000 since being beaten by his brother in Labour leadership election .

"Read Martin Samuel's match report from the pulsating Capital One Cup semi-final first leg draw at Anfield . Liverpool's Capital One Cup semi-final with Chelsea is evenly poised going into next week’s decisive second leg at Stamford Bridge, but there is little doubt that Brendan Rodgers’s side edged a 1-1 draw at Anfield on Tuesday night. A return to the high-octane displays of last season had the Premier League leaders rocking on their heels in the second half as Rodgers out-manoeuvred his old Chelsea mentor Jose Mourinho in most aspects of the game. Sportsmail looks at how Liverpool’s tactics have not only given them a real chance of reaching Wembley but may also serve as a blueprint for the rest of the league in how to tackle Mourinho’s men in the second half of the season.

Cesc Fabregas (left) chases Philippe Coutinho during the Capital One Cup semi-final . MAGIC OVER MATIC . Nemanja Matic has been outstanding in his defensive midfield role this season, but the movement and trickery of Philippe Coutinho disrupted the axis of Matic and John Obi Mikel in much the same way that Christian Eriksen wreaked havoc with the Serb and Cesc Fabregas when Tottenham hammered Chelsea 5-3 on New Year’s Day. On Tuesday night, they had no answer to Coutinho as he pulled them out of position, and it was no surprise that his pass split the pair in the build-up to Liverpool’s equaliser. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded in 341 minutes since Nacer Chadli’s effort for Spurs. John Obi Mikel lunges in on Raheem Sterling (left) during a pulsating match at Anfield . Gary Cahill had another difficult night at the heart of the Chelsea defence . UNCOMFORTABLE CAHILL . Raheem Sterling might have been recharging his batteries in Jamaica recently but it was Gary Cahill who looked like he was running on sand when his England team-mate scored a memorable goal to level the tie in the second half. Again there were comparisons with the Spurs game in the way that the direct running of Harry Kane and Sterling unsettled Cahill. The Chelsea defender inexplicably backed off Sterling and failed to make a challenge as the Liverpool man powered past him en route to goal. It exposed a more general weakness on the right-hand side of Mourinho’s defence with full-back Branislav Ivanovic caught out of position on several occasions.

Diego Costa was in awesome form in Chelsea’s 5-0 drubbing of Swansea at the weekend as the Premier League’s top scorer added another two to go even further ahead with 17 goals. However, Liverpool shut down the Spain striker with Martin Skrtel particularly effective at anticipating balls into him and giving Costa little time or space. As a consequence, Chelsea’s £32million man cut an increasingly frustrated figure as he became involved in spats with several Liverpool players and was taunted by the home supporters. Diego Costa (left) was brilliantly marshalled by Martin Skrtel and failed to register a shot on target . Chelsea's star striker, seen here arguing with Jordan Henderson, cut a frustrated figure at Anfield . HALT HAZARD .

Liverpool trod a fine line at times and Steven Gerrard and Lucas Leiva were both booked for taking down the mercurial Belgian. However, Rodgers showed that Hazard can be stopped by putting two men – sometimes three – on him to close him down every time he got the ball. The result was that Hazard had surprisingly little impact on the game after winning and converting a penalty in the first half.

Few teams can press as well as Chelsea, but Liverpool provided a masterclass in the art as they returned to the high-energy performances of last season. Insatiable in attack as they powered towards The Kop in the second half, Rodgers’ side were equally breathless in defence as they swarmed all over Chelsea like an army of red ants. Anfield reverberated in its appreciation of the effort and Mourinho’s side were simply not allowed to have the time on the ball or the composure to establish their normal tempo and control over the game.

"Samir Nasri will miss Manchester City's clash with his old club Arsenal on Sunday with a calf injury that is expected to keep him out for up to a month. The news is a major blow to the Premier League champions as they try to keep pace with leaders Chelsea at the top of the table. Nasri, who has been in top form this season, is set to miss four league games and the FA Cup fourth round tie against Middlesbrough, but he should be fit to face Barcelona in the Champions League first knockout round on February 24. ‘We have some problems during the week with Samir Nasri,’ said manager Manuel Pellegrini. ‘He has a calf injury so he will not be fit for the next game. He will be out for around three weeks or a month. Before that is difficult. All the rest of the team are fit.’ Samir Nasri has been ruled out for up to a month and will miss Saturday's clash against old club Arsenal . Nasri played 89 minutes of City's last game against Everton but sustained a calf injury . Manuel Pellegrini won Premier League Manager of the Month for December after winning five of six matches . Pellegrini rejected suggestions that the signing of Swansea striker Wilfried Bony in a £15million deal this week will signal the end of Stevan Jovetic’s City career. The Montenegro star has been linked with a return to Italy with Juventus just 18 months after joining City, but Pellegrini insists that Bony has been signed as a replacement for Alvaro Negredo, who joined Valencia on loan in the summer. ‘Stevan is a very important player for us,’ he added. ‘Bony arrives now in the window. It was a decision we took after we sold Alvaro Negredo, and he is replacing Negredo. We sold him because he had personal problems and did not want to continue here. Bony is replacing Alvaro, not Jovetic. ‘It was important to replace Negredo. When we sold him we said we were going to have the decision in December after seeing these four months. We have too many injuries so it was important to have a fourth striker. After that, when you have the squad, it depends on the performance. ‘I think that Bony is similar to Negredo. He is strong, he supports the ball so in the way we play it is important to have that support, so players can arrive from midfield in the second line. He is an important striker inside the box, same as Alvaro, so I think he is more similar to him than Edin (Dzeko) or Kun (Aguero) or Jovetic.’ Jovetic and Bacary Sagna are among the candidates to drop out of City’s Champions League squad to accommodate Bony, but Pellegrini would not be drawn on the issue. ‘I don’t need to do it,’ he added. ‘Maybe in February we need to give the squad list for the Champions League and we will see what happens in that moment and decide which is the player who will not be in the list.’ Pellegrini insisted that Yaya Toure (left) is '100% committed' to Manchester City . Aguero returned on the bench against Everton last weekend after a month out with a knee injury. Pellegrini confirmed that the Argentina striker is ‘100 per cent fit’ with fans looking forward to his duel with Alexis Sanchez who has been outstanding for Arsenal since his arrival from Barcelona in the summer. ‘I think Alexis is a very good player, and he is having a very good season in England,’ said Pellegrini of his Chilean compatriot. ‘It is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals. Alexis is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at Barcelona and scoring a lot of goals. ‘I am very happy for him because he is a young player and very enthusiastic player and improving. But I don’t want to compare with Sergio. ‘It is not the first year from Alexis here in Europe. Alexis has eight or nine years, when he was very young first in Italy with Udinese and then returned on loan to South America. He played really well in Barcelona the last two years and now in England. The football fans in Chile are very happy for him and for the country.’ Pellegrini's side picked up 16 points from a possible 18 in the month of December . City beat Arsenal 6-3 in a thrilling game at the Etihad last season when they were almost unstoppable in front of goal. Pellegrini added: ‘It is difficult to score six and three goals again but I think for fans it will be a very attractive game,’ he said. ‘I hope we can score the same amount of goals and Arsenal have more problems to score three goals. ‘It is difficult to compare one season with another. Last season we scored more. We have big scores here at Etihad but it is not easy to repeat. We are always trying to do it, that is very important. 'This season there is more merit because in the last month we have no strikers and we continue scoring two or three goals every game we play. Last season was more easy.’","Manuel Pellegrini has confirmed that Samir Nasri will miss Sunday's match .

"Joey Barton apologised to his QPR team-mates and the club's supporters after he was sent off for violent conduct in the defeat at fellow Premier League strugglers Hull. The QPR captain was shown the ninth red card of his controversial career for pushing Hull's Alex Bruce and then aiming a low blow into Tom Huddlestone's groin in a 32nd-minute melee. Barton, who came into the game on seven successive yellow cards in the league, claimed that he was trying to defend debutant Darnell Furlong after the youngster had landed himself in trouble for fouling Nikica Jelavic. QPR captain Joey Barton was sent off during his side's 2-1 defeat to fellow Premier League strugglers Hull . The midfielder pushed Hull's defender Alex Bruce before attempting a low blow on Tom Huddlestone . Barton's red card was the ninth dismissal he has received over the course of a controversial career . He wrote on Twitter: 'Young kid making his debut has made a good tackle. Couple of Hull players trying to get him sent off. My job as captain is to protect him. I've tried to prevent Hull's players influencing referee as u can see by me pushing Bruce away. 'I've apologised to the lads and would like to apologise to all QPR fans who travelled today. 'I'm gutted I got sent off. I've let my teammates down today and being someone who puts the team above everything else I'm gutted about that. 'My actions towards Huddlestone were certainly not malicious, it was a stupid reaction to being barged but I can appreciate it wasn't right.'

"Liverpool want to cut short Divock Origi’s loan at Lille and have recalled highly-rated winger Jordon Ibe from Derby. Manager Brendan Rodgers is determined not to rush England striker Daniel Sturridge back from injury and is trying to boost his attacking options. Rodgers insisted that Mario Balotelli will not be sold in this transfer window just six months after a £16million move from AC Milan. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: Determined to find a solution with Balotelli . Divock Origi could be on his way to Anfield this month following his season-long loan spell with Lille . Brendan Rodgers has ruled out the possibility of Mario Balotelli leaving Liverpool in January . Jordan Ibe (left) has been recalled from his loan spell at Derby to add to Liverpool's attack . And Liverpool later confirmed that they had activated a break clause in Ibe’s season-long loan at Derby to bring the teenager back to Anfield for the second half of the campaign. They are also in talks with Lille to negotiate an early return for Origi, who was loaned back to the French club for this season under the terms of his £10million transfer last summer. Lille are demanding an extra £5m to release the Belgium World Cup star and have lined up Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson as a £4m replacement. Origi, 19, has struggled at Lille, where he has been booed by supporters after failing to score for the last 14 games. ‘He will certainly be here next summer,’ said Rodgers. ‘Whether he’ll be here in January, there have been discussions. The agreement is with Lille for him to stay there, so we’ll see how that works. ‘If not we’ll work with what we’ve got.’ Balotelli posted a video on his Instagram account of himself and Desmond N'Ze (above) Balotelli and N'Ze spend the afternoon playing video games at the Liverpool striker's home . Asked about Balotelli, who is yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League, he added: ‘He certainly won’t be going anywhere in January. Mario hasn’t scored the goals that he or we would have wanted, but we’re determined to help him find the solution here.’ Rodgers is wary of putting too much pressure on Sturridge, who has not played for Liverpool since August due to thigh and calf injuries. The 25-year-old has broken down twice while attempting to come back from injury, and spent Christmas with the Boston Red Sox medical staff trying to get to the root of his persistent thigh problems. ‘He’s been out so long there’s no point putting a timeline on it when we don’t know exactly what that is,’ said Rodgers. ‘He’s into the final stages of his rehab and hopefully over the next few weeks he will improve on that. Rodgers is refusing to put too much pressure on Daniel Sturridge after returning from a long lay-off . Inter Milan have no chance of prising Lucas Leiva (left) away from Anfield in January . ‘People do have to be more realistic. First he has to get fit, generally. There’s match fitness and football fitness, so it will take a wee bit of time. ‘Just having him on the field to begin with will be critical to the team because his threat is obvious. It’s the only way we will get him back up to speed. ‘We have called in experts from different parts of the world, so we’re hoping it will allow him to stay fit for longer and a more consistent period.’ Rodgers also told Inter Milan that they would be wasting their time following up interest in Lucas Leiva with a formal offer this month. ‘It’s not something I would be willing to do in January,’ he said. ‘Of course, at the end of the season everything is looked at again but the team is in a good momentum.’ Rodgers confirmed that England and Liverpool defender Glen Johnson is making good progress from his injury . Reds midfielder Joe Allen (left) is also continuing his recovery from a knee injury . Meanwhile, Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre has insisted that the prospect of reduced playing time and not contract issues was behind Steven Gerrard’s decision to reject a new deal. The Liverpool captain is leaving for LA Galaxy at the end of the season. Ayre claimed that the club made Gerrard a ‘substantial’ offer, adding: ‘The fact that he would have signed a contract last season actually doesn’t make any difference. ‘His point was that after playing every week, playing a bit-part role is not how he wanted to finish his career.’","Divock Origi could be brought to Liverpool ahead of schedule .

"Liverpool are ready to exploit a little-known Premier League rule to sign Danny Ings despite failing with a bid for Burnley’s striker in the transfer window. The Merseyside club were prepared to pay £4million for Ings and loan him back to Burnley for the rest of the season, but were told that such a deal is against the regulations. However, it has emerged that, under Rule U8, Liverpool can sign a pre- contract with Ings and his club — subject to the approval of the Premier League Board — which guarantees the player a transfer to Anfield in the summer while allowing him to stay at Burnley for the rest of this season. Liverpool want to sign Burnley striker Danny Ings, who is out of contract in the summer . The Merseyside club are ready to exploit a Premier League loophole to sign the player on a pre-contract . The rule is designed to ensure transparency. While such an agreement is unusual, a similar deal was struck between Manchester United and Fulham for Chris Smalling in January 2010 which set out the defender’s £10m move to Old Trafford six months later. Smalling never played against United in that time, however, while Ings is set to face Liverpool when Burnley visit Anfield in a month. One of the criteria the board will examine is that there is no conflict of interest, such as undue pressure being put on Ings or Burnley for him to miss that game. Burnley were determined not to let Ings leave in the January window as they fight to stay in the Premier League, but have accepted he will not sign a new contract when his four-year deal runs out at the end of the season. They stand to receive about £3m in compensation if he joins another English club in the summer but only £200,000 if he moves abroad. There was speculation on deadline day that the England Under 21 striker was close to agreeing a pre- contract with Real Sociedad. Manager Sean Dyche admitted after Saturday’s defeat at Sunderland that the speculation had affected Ings’s performance. Ings has impressed during his debut season in the Premier League with Burnley . The striker, who was also linked heavily with Tottenham,  has netted seven times in the Premier League . The 22-year-old is known to favour a move to Liverpool and the feeling at Turf Moor is that he will perform better for the remainder of the season if his future is resolved. Liverpool are prepared to pay up to £5m to keep Ings out of the clutches of their rivals. First on the agenda for Liverpool tonight is the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Bolton. They may start with Daniel Sturridge — once a popular loan player at Bolton — as they look to advance in a competition manager Brendan Rodgers desperately wants to win after last week’s narrow Capital One Cup semi-final defeat at Chelsea. ‘If anything, that defeat has only promoted the development and momentum that we have,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘Of course we wanted to get to the final but the performance level from the two games has given us great encouragement. ‘Our best football is yet to come. We have got our identity back. We want to take that into the games and get to cup finals. ‘It will be a tough game for us. We have a big month coming up and we want to continue in the cup competitions as well as keeping the momentum going in the league.’","Liverpool are hoping to sign Danny Ings on pre-contract agreement .

"When it was announced that Che Adams was joining Sheffield United from Ilkeston of the Evo Stik League Premier Division in November, the news was largely overshadowed by the club’s interest in another striker. Ched Evans may have a vaguely similar name to the teenager, but the circumstances surrounding the two players could not have been more different. While United were forced to abandon plans to offer Evans a route back into football following his release from prison amid a blaze of bad publicity, Adams slipped quietly into Bramall Lane on a two-year-deal. Che Adams spearheaded a fightback from Sheffield United that nearly took them to the Capital One Cup final . Adams arrival went largey unnoticed as United were being criticised for reports linking them with Ched Evans . Nigel Clough's side were moments away from taking the tie with Tottenham into extra time . Everyone will know who he is this morning, though, after the 18-year-old so nearly turned the second leg of this Capital One Cup semi-final on its head last night. Ultimately, Tottenham booked their place at Wembley, but the Premier League club were left rocking on their heels by the introduction of Adams in place of Jamal Campbell-Ryce in the 74th minute. His two coolly taken goals in the space of just 140 seconds put the Blades level on aggregate and on course for extra-time until Christian Eriksen broke their hearts with his second goal of the night. It was a stunning performance from the youngster, even if his manager Nigel Clough was less than impressed with his goal celebration. ‘He’s got to learn not to slide in the corner and celebrate when we’ve still got to get another goal!’ said Clough. ‘Get the ball out of the net and get back to the centre-spot and we can go again. ‘Hopefully we’ll be talking about him for the next few years. We’ve been delighted since he’s come in. Just a few months ago he was playing a few leagues down. ‘We like the look of him. He’s still quite raw, only 18 years old, but he’s got a lot of potential. ‘He’s cup-tied in the FA Cup but he’ll get plenty of chances in the league now.’ Adams celebrates scoring his first goal for Clough's side against Tottenham . Christian Eriksen (right) scores the winner for Tottenham in the closing minutes of the game . Andros Townsend (left) celebrates reaching the cup final with two-goal hero Eriksen (right) Adams made his debut for United when they upset Southampton in this competition here last month – one of five Premier League victims beaten by Clough’s side in the cup competitions since he took over at Bramall Lane 15 months ago. Towards the end of his time at Ilkeston, 45 scouts turned up at the club’s Manor Ground to see a young man who was earning a burgeoning reputation for his blistering pace. But Clough beat off competition from Leicester City, Newcastle and Sunderland to sign him for a nominal fee and the promise of a friendly against the League One side. Adams, who has been approached by Antigua Barbuda to represent them internationally, played for Coventry Under-14s as a youngster. A boyhood Arsenal fan, last night’s exploits meant even more to him. ‘It’s been a really good night for me,’ he said. ‘It’s horrible losing but it’s a good team that we lost to and hopefully they can win it now. ‘There weren’t really any nerves tonight. A lot of people dream of doing that and fortunately I can. ‘The manager didn’t really say anything when he sent me on but he knows what I can do and I showed him. He just wanted me to go back to the halfway line after the goal. It got to my head and I didn’t know want to do.’ Being cup-tied means that Adams will not be eligible to face Manchester United in the fifth round of the FA Cup if Louis van Gaal’s side beat Cambridge in their replay and Sheffield United overcome Preston North End.

An Eriksen free kick handed Tottenham the lead in the first half in spectacular style . Given the opportunity, you would not rule out Clough’s side producing another shock after last night’s efforts. ‘At half-time just told players to go for one and see what would happen,’ said the manager. ‘If they had played us off the park for two games and beat us easily, we would hold up our hands but losing after being so close just makes it worse. ‘Now have a game against Preston to try to get a tie against Manchester United here, so that is the objective.’","Che Adams signed when Sheffield United were linked with Ched Evans .

"Why always me? It was Mario Balotelli who first asked the question of himself, and years later we’re still no closer to finding an answer. The man just seems to be a magnet for everything: good and bad. The centre of attention, like he’s involved in a little exhibition game all of his own. And if we thought the white-hot atmosphere of Istanbul’s Ataturk Stadium would make Mario rein himself in a little after those penalty shenanigans in the first leg at Anfield last week, we were very much mistaken. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli looks over at manager Brendan Rodgers after being substituted . Rodgers failed to acknowledge Balotelli after the striker was taken off in the 82nd minute .

Balotelli with team-mates and coaching staff during the penalty shootout . Balotelli and Sturridge could only watch the penalty shootout as they had been substituted . Even before a ball had been kicked, as Liverpool’s players walked out on to the pitch in their tracksuits 90 minutes before kick-off to a cacophony of boos and whistles from a typically hostile Besiktas crowd, the television cameras inevitably zoomed in on the volatile Italian. Balotelli stared impassively ahead, blocking out the noise with the music on his headphones, and then spat on to the pitch as if on cue. At that stage we didn’t know that he would be starting alongside Daniel Sturridge in attack for only the second time, and the first since a 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur at the end of August. There are many who have written off Balotelli since then, and who’s to say Liverpool wouldn’t have considered cutting their losses and bringing in a replacement in January had Sturridge not missed most of the season through injury? But Brendan Rodgers has persevered with a young man who exasperated even his old mentor Roberto Mancini at Manchester City and there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks, a late winner against Tottenham preceding the only goal against Besiktas at Anfield. Mario Balotelli of Liverpool is pushed by Serdar Kurtulus of Besiktas after accusing Necip Uysal of diving . Balotelli remonstrates with Besiktas defender Necip Uysal during the Europa League tie . Balotelli was booked by referee Damir Skomina in the 11th minute for lunge at Veli Kavlak . Even when he does well, however, Balotelli often finds himself in bother and the talking point after the game wasn’t so much his winning penalty as the way he snatched the ball off captain Jordan Henderson to take it and the subsequent criticism from Steven Gerrard. Having ended the first leg in controversy, Balotelli was soon at it again here. The game was only moments old when he forgot Rodgers’s pre-match instructions to be patient and pursued Serdar Kurtulus towards the Besiktas corner flag, giving the defender a little nudge in the process. When Kurtulus went sprawling on the turf, Balotelli leaned down to remonstrate with him, raising the decibel level among the home fans even higher, if that were possible. The Ataturk is not a place to go looking for trouble at any time, but particularly not on nights like this. At times Balotelli seemed to be spoiling for it. When he was caught in possession deep inside his own half early on, he responded with a lunging challenge on Veli Kavlak which quite rightly earned him the first yellow card of the night from Slovenian referee Damir Skomina. Soon afterwards, he went stumbling backwards and fell on his backside while trying to control a relatively simple pass from Sturridge. Balotelli’s confidence never wanes, however, even when things aren’t going his way. It is a quality of his, even though it didn’t feel that way when he wastefully sent a freekick out of play and then followed it up by firing wildly over the bar from fully 40 yards before half-time. Balotelli goes down under the challenge by Besiktas defender Serdar Kurtulus . Balotelli (left) appeals to the referee after being fouled in the second half in Istanbul . Besiktas midfielder Veli Kavlak feels full force of Balotelli on Thursday night . It was a more subdued Balotelli after that, even more so when he limped to the touchline after an hour with a foot injury. The shoulders began to slump, the head went down. We’ve seen the signs before. Perhaps restricted by his earlier booking, it was no surprise that his half-hearted attempt at a challenge preceded the goal from Tolgay Arslan that levelled the tie in the 72nd minute. Balotelli allowed Gokhan Tore to breeze past him on the left, failing to put in even a hint of a challenge as the Besiktas danger man broke into the box and squared for substitute Arslan to beat Simon Mignolet with a cracking effort. Ten minutes later the board went up and Mario was off, making way for Adam Lallana. There was a disbelieving look to the bench and a disconsolate walk to the touchline, helped on his way by a sympathetic pat on the arm from Emre Can. Even though Liverpool needed a goal at that stage, or very possibly a trusted penalty-taker for the shootout, Balotelli’s contribution had dwindled to such a level that it appeared as if he had little left to offer. The look on his face told a different story. The same old story. Why always me?","Mario Balotelli received a yellow card after just 11 minutes .

"A devastating plagiarism scandal ended the career of a Democratic U.S. senator on Thursday as he announced he will not seek re-election to a full term in office this November. Sen. John Walsh, then Montana's lieutenant governor, was appointed in February to serve out the term of Max Baucus, a longtime lawmaker who stepped down to take the post of U.S. ambassador to China. But Walsh's few months in office will be his only foray into national politics, following accusations in late July that he lifted large portions – as much as two-thirds – of his 2007 master's degree thesis at the U.S. Army War College from other published sources. Montana Democratic Sen. John Walsh has decided to pull out of his November Senate race amid allegations that he plagiarized a research paper in 2007 . Awful timing: Walsh was among the most vocal proponents of a bill, signed into law by President Barack Obama on Thursday, aimed at improving medical care for military veterans . His decision came on the same day President Obama signed into law Walsh's most impressive legislative achievement: a bill creating an independent commission to probe the Department of Veterans Affairs following reports that it delayed medical care for thousands of war veterans. Walsh received a Master of Strategic Studies degree and then was named the adjutant general overseeing Montana's National Guard and its Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. The New York Times first exposed his alleged academic dishonesty on July 23. 'Most strikingly,' the Times report read, 'each of the six recommendations Mr. Walsh laid out at the conclusion of his 14-page paper, titled ""The Case for Democracy as a Long Term National Strategy,"" is taken nearly word-for-word without attribution from a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace document on the same topic.' Walsh will remain in the Senate until his term ends in January 2015. Republican Rep. Steve Daines was already considered a heavy favorite to win the seat this fall. Recent polls show he was holding a 13 point lead over Walsh. The Billings Gazette reported on Thursday that Walsh won't be on the ballot. The Montana Democratic Party has not announced a replacement candidate, and has until its August 20 nominating convention to sort out the mess. The Times reported Thursday that Montana Democrats said the party was leaning toward nominating Nancy Keenan, a pro-abortion activist who once led Naral Pro-Choice America. 'I am proud that with your support, we held our opponent [Daines] accountable for his hurtful record to privatize Medicare, to deny women the freedom to make their own health decisions and to sell off our public lands,' Walsh said in a statement Thursday, which did not acknowledge any wrongdoing. 'I know how important it is to continue the fight for these Montana values, and it is time for us all to return to the real issues of this election.' The Army War College's handbook describes punishments for academic cheating. Among them, according to a tweet from one New York Times reporter: Past students who have been caught after graduation are to names their scraped off the school's bronze plaques honoring successful degree recipients. Harsh: A New York Times reporter found that Army War College policy is to remove Sen. Walsh's name from plaques in its halls honoring past graduates if he is found to have cheated . Walsh initially denied the Times' charges in July, and then briefly proposed an excuse for his actions seven years ago, saying that Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder linked to his National Guard service in Iraq had been a factor. But he later said he took 'full responsibility' for his actions, leading to widespread speculation that he would either step down or leave the Senate after November's elections. Montana Democratic Party chairman Jim Larson said Thursday in a statement that Walsh's life 'has been and continues to be service to our nation and all Montanans. From 33 years in the National Guard, to serving as Lt. Governor to his time in the U.S. Senate, John Walsh has sacrificed significantly for our country and is to be commended.' But the editorial board of the Gazette was less sanguine, writing on Sunday that 'Sen. John Walsh's response to plagiarism has destroyed our faith in him.' 'Haunted by a serious lapse in academic honesty, Walsh is finished as a U.S. Senate candidate.'","Sen. John Walsh will not stand for election following his appointment to the U.S. Senate to serve out the term of Ambassador to China Max Baucus .

"Now the strains and stresses of his failed bid for the White House are over, Mitt Romney has no doubt enjoyed time unwinding with his family.

"A Serbian fisherman has designed and built a coal-powered backpack which can cook his catch while keeping him warm in sub-zero temperatures. Aleks Mijatovic, 45, said he created his unique piece of equipment so he could  remain at the riverbank in the depths of winter without freezing to death. The angler from Leskovac, southern Serbia, used a few pieces of scrap metal lying around his home to create his masterpiece. Scroll down for video . Aleks Mijatovic designed his coal-fired backpack to cook his catch and keep him warm while out fishing . Mr Mijatovic, from Leskovac, pictured, said he had his epiphany one night while he was in bed . The intrepid fisherman said he found an old drum and welded it to a piece of pipe after his dream . He said: 'I tend to go early in the mornings or even at night when the temperatures are well into igloo conditions and warm clothes weren't really doing the job. 'I had stacks of jumpers on and a load of pants but after a couple of hours I was still freezing. 'Then, one night in bed, I had an epiphany.

"Foreign Office files kept secret for more than 70 years have revealed details of how MI6 kidnapped and killed a French double agent during World War Two - and ordered the creator of James Bond to help them cover it up. In July 1941 British Intelligence learned that 'deeply trusted' Captain Pierre Lablache-Combier - a Royal Navy commander recruited by M16 and posted to Spain - had divulged secrets to the Nazi-backed French Vichy government. James Bond writer Ian Fleming - then a Naval Intelligence officer - issued an official report stating the officer was 'missing believed drowned'. In fact, the 'complete double-crosser' was killed as Secret Service operatives scrambled to smuggle him out of Spain. 'Most secret': Sir Samuel Hoare, Britain's ambassador to Spain, sent an urgent telegram to the Secretary of State for War after realising French spy Captain Pierre Lablache-Combier was a 'complete double-crosser' The truth about what happened to the spy, who is still listed on the French wartime roll of honour, has finally come to light in previously classified Foreign and Commonwealth Office files released this week. 'Pierre disappeared during the war, but we never knew under what circumstances,' Edouard Benois, Lablache-Combier’s son-in-law, told the Times. Fury: The newly released files reveal Sir Samuel Hoare's anger over the situation . The First World War veteran came to Britain after the fall of France and joined the Navy, where he was earmarked for secret service. He was deployed to Spain by MI6, which was unaware the 44-year-old - who worked under the cover name Paul Lewis Claire - remained loyal to the Vichy Government. The files reveal that, in July 1941, British Intelligence learned the French officer was planning to flee to his home country, having contacted the naval attaché at the Vichy Embassy in Madrid and 'divulged many secrets of British secret service activities in Spain and elsewhere'. An alarmed Sir Samuel Hoare, then Britain's Ambassador to Spain, swiftly dispatched a 'Most Secret' telegram to the Secretary of State for War, Anthony Eden to warn him of the 'serious situation'. He wrote: “I am accordingly faced with the dilemma: 1. Capturing or killing him [or] 2. Letting him get to France with information that will destroy our present intelligence organisation in Spain and do even greater harm elsewhere... this will be the last chance of dealing with him.' The head of MI6 instructed that the traitor be brought to Gibraltar, and the Frenchman was subsequently lured to the British Embassy as 'Action Gibraltar' got underway. Lablache-Combier was knocked out and sedated with morphine before being bundled into a diplomatic car by a team of secret service operatives and driven away under cover of darkness. All went smoothly until the spy regained consciousness and began shouting for help from the back seat of the car, and a struggle is believed to have ensued as the kidnappers tried to avoid attracting attention. At some point the spy was hit on the head with a revolver and killed. His body was taken on to Gibraltar and 'quietly disposed of' - most likely buried at sea. An authorised history of MI6 refers to the doomed spy by his cover name and includes a coded telegram sent by the secret service reporting his death. It said: 'Consignment arrived completely destroyed owing to over attention in transit... salvage being quietly disposed of tonight... damage regretted but I submit it is for the best.' Cover-up: Plans were put in place to smuggle the spy out of Spain in 'Action Gibraltar' (left), but Lablache-Combier was killed en-route, prompting the head of MI6 to order that the 'whole story be denied' (right) So began the cover-up, with Ian Fleming informing the Red Cross that naval officer had been aboard the SS Empire Hurst when it was sunk by the Luftwaffe off Gibraltar in August 1941. But Lablache-Combier's relatives demanded to know what had happened to him, and the Vichy Government complained to Spanish authorities. An article correctly reporting that a French naval officer had been abducted by the British was published by Nazi media - and promptly dismissed by the British press as a 'flight of fancy from the Nazi propaganda department. Despite his treachery, the spy's widow was paid a war pension to ensure the secret remained buried. 'It . is true that my mother-in-law received a pension from the British Navy . until her death, but she never knew exactly why,' Mr Benois said. Scandal: James Bond creator Ian Fleming, left, then a Naval Intelligence officer, issued an official death announcement stating that Lablache-Combier was 'missing believed drowned' Lablache-Combier’s widow died in 1968 and his daughter died last . December, both unaware of his true fate. Correspondence between Hoare and Eden contained within the formerly secret files reveal the ambassador - who slammed 'clumsy, dangerous and irresponsible Secret Service methods -  was enraged by the incident. Eden's reply outlined his 'deep regret' that Hoare had had to deal with the situation, adding of Lablache-Combier: 'His goose is cooked'.","Naval officer Captain Pierre Lablache-Combier was a spy for M16 in Spain .

"Smog swallows up the London skyline. The European Court of Justice has said the Government must urgently do something to halt Britain's terrible air pollution . Ministers must urgently tackle Britain’s abysmal air pollution, the European Court of Justice ruled yesterday. The UK has repeatedly failed to meet clean air targets, leaving most of our cities clogged with pollution that is estimated to kill 29,000 people a year. The European court yesterday found that the UK was in breach of EU law and should have created plans to tackle air pollution in 16 cities by January 2015 at the latest. Under existing plans, the worst areas - including London, Birmingham and Leeds - would not meet the pollution limits until 2030, campaigners say. Britain breached EU targets in 2010 for levels of nitrogen dioxide, a gas particle from car engines and factories which causes breathing and heart problems. It is still nowhere near adequate levels, and has repeatedly asked to be granted extensions to the EU deadline. The European court, which is based in Luxembourg, ruled that the UK’s Supreme Court now has jurisdiction over the matter and must order the Government to take action to meet the legal limits in a much shorter time frame. The Government is also facing a separate £300million fine for failing to meet the EU’s air quality directive on pollution. Some 16 areas including Greater London, Greater Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and the West Midlands are currently in breach of the targets. The problem was dramatically illustrated in April when a thick smog enveloped the country, forcing people to stop exercising and schools to keep their children inside. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth, who brought the case against Defra, the Government’s environment department, said the ruling is likely to mean rolling out London’s planned ‘ultralow emissions zone’ to cities across the country. The plan, drawn up by Boris Johnson, will mean charging diesel car owners £10 to enter the city centre and scrapping old taxis. ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews said: ‘Thousands of people die because of air pollution every year. This ruling will save lives by forcing the Government to finally take this issue seriously.’ London's St Paul's Cathedral is barely visible due to the heavy pollution blanketing the capital . Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘This European Court of Justice judgement is a damning indictment of the Tory-led Government’s total failure to tackle the UK’s air pollution. ‘Air pollution is a serious public health issue facing our towns and cities, tens of thousands of lives are lost each year and yet David Cameron’s government has done nothing to solve the problem. ‘The European Court of Justice has now demanded that the UK take urgent action to address dangerous levels of air pollution.’ Manchester city  (pictured) is among the worst centres for smog and pollution in Britain . Maura Gillespie, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘This judgement means the UK Government is finally being held to account for their breach of air pollution limits. ‘Breathing certain pollutants is proven to exacerbate existing heart conditions and put vulnerable people at greater risk of a heart attack. ‘The public expect the air we breathe to be safe. Officials must act now to improve the quality of the air we breathe.’ And Friends of the Earth Campaigner Jenny Bates said: ‘UK air quality is a national disgrace - tough measures are long overdue.’ The ruling came as the European Environment Agency published its latest annual air quality report, which showed that almost a fifth of people living in British cities are exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels up to 50 per cent above EU limits. A picture taken in 2007 shows factories in Stirlingshire, Scotland, belching out smoke . MP Joan Walley, chair of the parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee, added: ‘Ministers have complacently carried on with business as usual and put off serious efforts to deal with the problem for another decade. ‘It is not acceptable for ministers who live in leafy suburbs to tell people living next to busy roads in towns and cities that they have to wait until 2030 to breath clean air.’ A Defra spokesman said: ‘Air quality has improved significantly in recent years and average roadside concentrations of NO2 levels have fallen 15 per cent since 2010. ‘We have built on this by committing £2 billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles, green transport initiatives and supporting local authorities to take action.’","Government ordered to urgently tackle Britain's pollution problem .

"A disabled pensioner claims she has been banned from using the Sainsbury’s home delivery service after describing one of their drivers as a ‘coloured gentleman’. Marian Burke, 73, says she used the term entirely innocently to refer to a ‘lovely’ deliveryman who works for the supermarket. But she says a manager at Sainsbury’s immediately branded her a racist for saying the word and said her custom was no longer welcome. Osteoporosis sufferer Marian Burke, 73, claims she has been banned from using the Sainsbury's home delivery service after describing one of their drivers as a 'coloured gentleman' Last night the supermarket insisted the ban was justified and accused Mrs Burke of using a ‘racial slur’ on three separate occasions while being aggressive towards staff. But wheelchair-bound Mrs Burke, who has a Kenyan carer, strenuously denied the charge and said Sainsbury’s should be ashamed of its actions. Mrs Burke, who suffers from osteoporosis and cannot leave the house, says she is completely dependent on the delivery service for her £80 weekly shop. Being unfamiliar with computers means online delivery is not an option, so for the last ten years she has phoned the supermarket with her shopping list of food and household goods. After a string of mistakes in recent weeks with deliveries arriving without several essentials, she called the shop to inform them of their error. She recalled: ‘When the manager asked me what the name of the delivery driver was, I had to tell him that I didn’t know. I said to him, “I don’t know his name, but he was a lovely coloured gentleman”.’ She continued: ‘Then all hell broke loose. The man on the other end of the phone called me a racist, and said they would never again take an order from me.’ Last night a Sainsbury’s spokesman claimed the company’s ban came after Mrs Burke had been ‘aggressive’ and used ‘racial slurs’. He said: 'Mrs Burke's version of events does not reflect our experience of her. She was not solely banned for the use of the word 'coloured' but for a range of racial slurs on three separate occasions, used in an aggressive manner against our colleagues. Mrs Burke says she is completely dependent on the delivery service from the Finchley Road branch (above) for her £80 weekly shop . 'As you would expect we don't take action . like this lightly but have a duty of care to protect our colleagues . from racial and abusive language and any form of aggression.' But Mrs Burke denied the firm’s version of events, saying: ‘That’s absolute lies. How dare they call me a racist? They should be ashamed.’ Last night one of Mrs Burke’s two carers said: ‘I heard the phone call. She was not rude and she was not racist at all.’ The Sainsbury’s telephone ordering service – which is not offered by her other local supermarkets – had previously been a lifeline for Mrs Burke, who is separated and does not have children. She says she wept after the staff member’s outburst earlier this month and is now relying on a friend who lives nearby for her shopping needs. She said: ‘There’s not a racist bone in my body. What’s wrong with referring to someone as coloured? It’s political correctness gone mad.’ The retired secretary, who lives in Highgate, North London, was dependent on her weekly delivery from the nearby Finchley Road branch which processed her order from a call centre – although not always correctly. ‘They were always forgetting things, and it’s so hard for me to get out,’ said Mrs Burke. ‘Also, the delivery costs me nearly £10, so I felt that I wasn’t getting the service I deserved.’ She went on: ‘As a loyal customer, I had had enough, so I rang my local store, not to shout at them or anything, but because I wanted to tell them that I’m very frail and if they could try to remember everything I order, I’d be very grateful. ‘Sainsbury’s was my lifeline, and now it’s been taken away from me.’ Using the term ‘coloured’ to refer to black people is considered to be offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same. The term was in widespread use in Britain in the 1960s but is now viewed by many to be racist.","Marian Burke, 73, from Highgate, north London, says she used the term entirely innocently to refer to a ‘lovely’ deliveryman .

"David Cameron today promised to take a 'tough approach' on negotiations with insurers over homes in danger of flooding as pictures emerged of its devastating effects in a town that has already been hit once this year. Residents in Tewkesbury are once again counting the cost of being hit by flooding from the River Severn and its tributaries following heavy rainfall - and it's just five years since the town was home to similar watery scenes. As a result people in the town could face excess on their damage claims of £20,000 as well as a rise in their insurance premium but the Prime Minister has said he will come down hard on insurers who fail to provide affordable cover. In 2007 Tewkesbury Abbey became a symbol of the town's plight as water crept ever closer to its foundations and now it looks like the town is suffering from the same fate. Scroll down for video . Waters get dangerously close to Tewkesbury Abbey after the nearby river burst its banks for the second time this year . Businesses and home-owners face yet another clean-up bill as property became flooded and defence systems failed under the sheer volume of water . Caravans in Forthampton, near Tewkesbury were tossed around like boxes after the floodwaters swallowed up the ground around them . St Asaph was under water today after the River Elwy burst its banks and hundreds of people were evacuated . The scale of the flooding was visible from the skies with huge bodies of water covering the land around the city . This picture shows how deep the water went in some places in the North Wales city . This time, however, the river was expected to peak at 4.8m - one metre lower than the peak five years ago. As this is the third time that the . town has witnessed such flooding insurers will once again facing picking . up the bill for damage done to many buildings. In turn it is likely that home and . business owners will face a rise in the amount they pay for their . interest and, more worryingly, a rise in the amount they pay for their . excess. In 2007 a couple in Powick, . Worcestershire, had their house flooded twice in the same summer. Chris . and Wendy Wreghitt were told their insurance excess would be £20,000 . after a 4ft wave of water washed across the road through their home. The six-bedroom detached house . suffered hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of flood damage to the . kitchen, living room and study. At the time Mr Wreghitt, 53, said Axa . dealt with them efficiently but when he went to renew his home . insurance a year later his premium jumped from £1,000 to £1,638. Then in . 2009 it more than doubled to £3,747. Initially Axa said their excess . would be £20,000 but once he complained it was lowered to £10,000. Here to help: Rescue services, visited by Mr Cameron, have been working together to tackle the flooding that has hit the area . The PM attended a Silver Command meeting at Gloucestershire Police HQ to see how they have been working to tackle the flooding . Prime Minister David Cameron meets staff at Gloucestershire Tri-Services, Gloucester, who are dealing with the flooding . Although the devastation is not yet as bad as that seen in 2007, these pictures show why insurers ask residents for a £20,000 excess . Flooding can be seen stretching for miles away from Tewkesbury after heavy downpours broke the banks of the River Severn . There is hope, however, after Prime . Minister David Cameron today promised to take a 'tough approach' on . negotiations with insurers over homes in danger of flooding. Up to 200,000 high risk properties are . at risk of being priced out of affordable cover when a deal struck in . 2000 between the then Labour government and insurers ends next summer. The Government has been in talks for two years but as yet an agreement . has not been reached. 'I'm sure we will do a deal,' Mr Cameron said. 'We are in negotiations at the moment. 'We need to take a tough approach . frankly and it's important insurance companies do what they are meant . to, which is provide insurance to households and we are going to make . sure that happens.' Mr Cameron said he was determined to reach an agreement. 'I am personally involved,' he said. '(Cabinet Office Minister) Oliver . Letwin is doing this negotiation on my behalf. The current situation we . have lasts until the middle of next year and we have some time to sort . it out. 'But I want to get it sorted. I've . seen myself in my own constituency the difficulty people have when they . can't get insurance. It's not just it makes them feel unsafe in their . own home but they can't sell their own home, so it's very important we . get this sorted on their behalf.' David Cameron speaks with Musky Kendall in Buckfastleigh, near Exeter, as she tells him how quickly the floods rose inside her house . Hedgerows are the only sign that this is flooded farmland and not a huge lake . David Cameron has vowed to get tough on insurers who charge people too much for cover for when they are flooded . Mr Cameron was speaking after he met . householders in the village of Buckfastleigh, Devon, which was struck by . flash flooding at the weekend. 'It is obviously very traumatic when . communities are hit by flooding like this but what I found are people . are incredibly steadfast and have behaved incredibly bravely at handling . the flood and now we need to help them with the recovery,' he said. 'We have to make sure their insurance . pays out, make sure the Environment Agency puts in place good flood . defences, make sure there are better warning schemes. There are always . lessons to learn and I wanted to come here and hear it for myself.' Mr Cameron also visited recently-built . flood defences on the River Dart, which have helped protect the local . area from worse flooding. The Prime Minister defended his Government’s . record on providing flood defences despite a cut in the budget. 'We are spending over £2 billion on . flood defences over the current four-year period, which is 6% less than . was spent over the last four years,' he said. 'But as well as that, we . are actually encouraging private and other money into flood defences and . making sure they are more efficient as we build them. 'I am quite convinced we are going to . provide flood defences for another extra 145,000 homes over the period . ahead and that’s very important.'

Pavlov, who goes by the call sign Motorola, dressed in battle fatigues and sported a broken arm in a sling for his wedding ceremony . Donetsk has been the scene of fierce clashes between separatist factions loyal to Moscow and Ukrainian government forces. Intense fighting was reported today at the city's airport. A total of 23 troops were said to have been killed during an attempt to regain control of eastern regions close to the city. In the worst incident, 19 soldiers were killed in a multiple rocket attack staged by insurgents close to the Russian border. A further 93 soldiers sustained 'wounds and contusions of varying severity'. Rockets were fired from a Grad missile launcher nearly 10 miles away, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said. The operating base was located near one of three border crossings whose closure Russian officials had announced Friday.

Military . spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov said: 'While performing special . assignments in various regions where the active phase of anti-terrorist . operations is underway, 23 servicemen from the Ukrainian armed forces . and state border service were killed.' President Poroshenko said that Kiev would 'find and destroy' the . pro-Russian separatists responsible for a high-powered missile attack. 'For . every soldier's life, the militants will pay with scores and hundreds . of their own. Not a single terrorist will avoid responsibility, each . will get what they deserve,' he said in a statement on his website . following an emergency meeting of security chiefs. The . heavy toll is a major blow after Ukraine's forces appeared to be . gaining ground against insurgents who Kiev alleges are funded and . supplied by Moscow.

Gubarev said: 'We would like to receive help in the form of Russian forces. But we are realists and understand that's impossible.' Rebels in the Donetsk region and the adjacent Luhansk region have repeatedly called for Russia to send in 'peacekeeping' troops as the fight against them intensifies. Russia has shown no inclination to do so, and officials have said that a peacekeeping mission could take place only with U.N. authorization. A family boards a train to leave Donetsk at the city's railway station. Ukrainian government troops have been fighting for more than three months against separatists in eastern Ukraine . Gubarev suggested that Russian tycoons are opposed to military action, fearing their businesses would be affected. Russia already has been hit with Western sanctions for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March and for allegedly fomenting the unrest in eastern Ukraine, in which more than 400 people have reportedly been killed. Sending forces into Ukraine would almost certainly prompt even harsher sanctions. 'Their selfish interests are understandable,' Gubarev said. Gubarev vowed that his group would stand up to any attempt by Ukrainian forces to take the city. 'There is nowhere to retreat to,' he said. 'For us, it's either victory of death.' Hundreds of people have been abducted and tortured in eastern Ukraine, according to human rights group Amnesty International. While the vast majority of allegations have been levelled against separatist pro-Russian . groups, pro-Kiev forces, including self-defence groups, have also been . implicated in the ill-treatment of captives. Victims are said to include police, . business people, activists, protesters, journalists, politicians, . activists, members of electoral business people. In one disturbing case a young female pro-Kiev activist was savagely beaten and slashed with a knife before being made to write separatist slogan in her own blood . Hanna, a pro-Kiev activist who had provided first aid to protesters at demonstrations, said she was abducted by armed men in the eastern city of Donetsk on 27 May. She was held for six days before being released in a prisoner exchange. She described how she was violently interrogated. 'My face was smashed, he punched me in the face with his fist, he was trying to beat me everywhere, I was covering myself with my hands… I was huddled in the corner, curled up in a ball with my hands around my knees. 'He was angry that I was trying to protect myself. He went out and came back with a knife.' Hanna showed scars on her neck, arms and legs where she was sliced with the blade. There is a stab wound in her knee, her right index finger is still heavily bandaged in a plastic splint. She also described how her interrogator made her write a separatist slogan on the wall in her own blood. Amnesty’s research team travelled from Kiev to the south-eastern sea port of Mariupol which has 'changed hands' twice in the last two months. On 13 June Ukrainian forces took back control of the city from an armed group calling itself the Donetsk People’s Republic. One local government official in Mariupol, who wished to remain anonymous, told Amnesty how they heard a captive separatist fighter wailing in pain at the hands of pro-Kiev forces who were seemingly trying to extract information about the separatists. Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty’s Deputy Director of Europe and Central Asia, said: 'With hundreds abducted over the last three months, the time has come to take stock of what has happened, and stop this abhorrent ongoing practice. 'The bulk of the abductions are being perpetrated by armed separatists, with the victims often subjected to stomach-turning beatings and torture. There is also evidence of a smaller number of abuses by pro-Kiev forces. 'Now that pro-Kiev forces are re-establishing control over Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and various other places in eastern Ukraine, new captives are being released almost daily with an increasing number of disturbing cases emerging. 'It is time that these are meticulously documented with perpetrators brought to justice and victims awarded compensation.'","Arsen .

"Iranian leader Ahmadinejad, known for past fiery denunciations of the U.S. and Israel, spoke at length about his vision for a `'new world order' during his speech at the U.N., but it was not heard by U.S. delegation, who decided 'not to attend' his speech, a blatant rejection of his controversial outbursts in recent days. His speech Wednesday happened to fall on Yom Kippur, the most sacred day on the Jewish calendar, devoted to fasting, prayer and introspection. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement condemning the speech soon after the fast ended. `'On the day when we pray to be inscribed in the book of life a platform was given to a dictatorial regime that strives, at every opportunity, to sentence us to death,' Netanyahu said. Scroll down for video . Addressing the nations: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks at the U.N. HQ in New York . Empty seats: Many chairs were left empty as Ahmadinejad, President of Iran, addressed the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly Wednesday . ‘In my remarks to the UN General Assembly, they will hear my response. History has proven that those who have wanted to wipe us off the map have failed, as the Jewish People have overcome all obstacles,' Netanyahu concluded. Netanyahu has said he is going to the U.N. to draw attention to what Israel perceives as the Iranian threat. Speaking to his Cabinet on Sunday, he said at the U.N. he would 'reiterate that the most dangerous country in the world must not be allowed to arm itself with the most dangerous weapon in the world.' He did not elaborate. Meanwhile, thousands of protesters in yellow vests emblazoned with photos of Iranian dissidents they said were killed by the Iranian regime gathered outside U.N. headquarters Wednesday during Ahmadinejad’s speech. Speakers included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, and former Rep. Patrick Kennedy. In his speech on Wednesday, Ahmadinejad did not refer to Iran's nuclear program. Israel and Western nations contend that Tehran is using what it insists is a peaceful nuclear program as a cover for developing the ability to build atomic weapons. Tough sanctions have been imposed on Iran as punishment for its failure to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to prove the peaceful nature of its drive to enrich uranium to levels that could be used to build a nuclear weapon.

Israel has threatened a military strike against Iranian nuclear installations, but Obama insists there is still time to solve the dispute through diplomacy. He has vowed, however, to stop Tehran from obtaining a nuclear arsenal. 'Over the past couple of days, we've seen Mr. Ahmadinejad once again . use his trip to the U.N. not to address the legitimate aspirations of . the Iranian people but to instead spout paranoid theories and repulsive . slurs against Israel,' Erin Pelton, spokeswoman for the . U.S. Mission to the U.N., said. 'It's particularly unfortunate that Mr. Ahmadinejad will have the platform of the U.N. General Assembly on Yom Kippur, which is why the United States has decided not to attend.' The rejection came as Ahmadinejad stepped up to the podium on Wednesday to deliver his last speech as Iranian President before the body, as he is set to leave office next June. In his speech he accused the West of nuclear 'intimidation' and claimed Iran is under threat of military action from 'uncivilized Zionists' - in a reference to Israel - saying that such threats are designed to force nations into submission. Empty streets: A woman runs along the car-free Ayalon expressway, during the holiday of Yom Kippur in Tel Aviv, Wednesday, the Day of Atonement . 'Continued threat by the uncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against our great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality,' he said. As he spoke, protesters swarmed the streets outside the UN building, many of them Iranian-Americans, demanding that Iran's UN seat be taken away. During his stay in the U.S., Ahmadinejad has . continued to taunt the West, calling for America to stop bullying and . encroaching on his nation's sovereignty, in his trademark inflammatory . style. The Iranian leader chided the U.S. for . its imperious antics and called the international hoopla over Iran's . nuclear program a 'non-issue,' speaking to the Associated Press on . Tuesday. The Iranian leader discussed solutions for the Syrian civil war, dismissed the question of Iran's nuclear ambition and claimed that despite Western sanctions his country is better off than it was when he took office in 2005.

'God willing, a new order will come . together and we'll do away with everything that distances us,' Ahmadinejad said, speaking through a translator. 'I do believe the . system of empires has reached the end of the road. The world can no . longer see an emperor commanding it.' 'Now . even elementary school kids throughout the world have understood that . the United States government is following an international policy of . bullying,' he said. President Barack Obama warned Iran earlier on Tuesday that time is running out to resolve the dispute over its nuclear program. In a speech to the General Assembly, Obama said the United States could not tolerate an Iran with atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad would not respond . directly to the president's remarks, saying he did not want to influence . the U.S. presidential election in November. But . he argued that the international outcry over Iran's nuclear enrichment . program was just an excuse by the West to dominate his country. Outspoken: He accused the West of nuclear 'intimidation' but steered clear of toxic remarks about Israel . He claimed that the United States has never accepted Iran's choice of government after the 1979 Islamic revolution. 'Everyone is aware the nuclear issue . is the imposition of the will of the United States,' he said. 'I see the . nuclear issue as a non-issue. It has become a form of one-upmanship.' Ahmadinejad . said he favored more dialogue, even though negotiations with world . powers remain stalled after three rounds of high-level meetings since . April. He said some world . leaders have suggested to him that Iran would be better off holding . nuclear talks only with the United States. 'Of . course I am not dismissing such talks,' he said, asked if he were open . to discussions with the winner of the American presidential election.

Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only. 'I see the nuclear issue as a non-issue. It has become a form of one-upmanship' Ahmadinejad also proposed forming a . new group of 10 or 11 countries to work to end the 18-month Syrian civil . war. Representatives of the nations in the Middle East and elsewhere . would meet in New York 'very soon,' he said. Critics have accused Tehran of giving support to Syrian President Bashar Assad in carrying out massacres and other human rights violations in an attempt to crush the uprising against his rule. Activists say nearly 30,000 people have died. He said the so-called contact group hopes to get the Syrian government and opposition to sit across from each other. 'I will do everything in my power to create stability, peace and understanding in Syria,' Ahmadinejad said. Outrage: Men wearing masks of Ahmadinejad, left, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, center, and Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei take part in a protest led by Iranian and Syrian Americans outside the U.N. Earlier . this month, Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi announced the formation . of a four-member contact group with Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. But . Saudi Arabia so far has not participated. He denied Iranian involvement in plotting attacks on Israelis abroad, despite arrests and accusations by police in various countries. He also vehemently disputed the U.S. claim that Iranian agents played a role in a foiled plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States last year. In the course of the interview, the leader also threw out numbers and statistics to show that Iran's economy and the lives of average Iranians have improved under his watch. Since his 2005 election, he claimed, Iran went from being the world's 22nd-largest economy to the 17th-largest; non-petroleum related exports increased sevenfold; and the basic production of goods has doubled. Median income increased by $4,000, he said. 'Today's conditions in Iran are . completely different to where they were seven years ago in the economy, . in technical achievement, in scientific know-how,' Ahmadinejad said. 'All of these achievements, though, have been reached under conditions . in which we were brought under heavy sanctions.' Sit-down: Piers Morgan spoke with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a contentious CNN interview aired on Tuesday . Iran has called for the U.S. and its European allies to ease the sanctions that have hit its critical oil exports and left it blackballed from key international banking networks. Ahmadinejad said he had no knowledge of the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a private investigator and former FBI agent who vanished in Iran five years ago. He said he directed Iranian intelligence services two years ago to work with their counterparts in the U.S. to locate him. 'And if any help there is that I can bring to bear, I would be happy to do so,' he said. He also claimed never to have heard of Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine who is imprisoned on espionage charges in Iran. Hekmati was arrested while visiting his grandmothers in Iran in August 2011, and his family has been using Ahmadinejad's visit to New York to plead for his release.","U.S. delegates decided not to attend Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech at UN .

"The scale of Britain’s dependence on foreign energy was laid bare yesterday in a set of official figures. According to a report from the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the amount of coal, oil and gas imported by the UK hit a record high in 2012. At the same time domestic production dwindled, falling by more than 10 per cent last year after a slump in output from the North Sea. Last year the UK imported 173million tons of oil equivalent – a measure of energy potential that covers all fuels including gas, coal and oil. This was 7.1 per cent more than 2011 and is the highest level ever recorded. Last week the UK had only 36 hours of domestic gas reserves left, after plummeting temperatures saw a surge in demand . But the amount exported fell 5 per cent to 80million tons – the lowest level since 1989. Overall some 43 per cent of the energy used in the UK came from overseas – the most since 1976, when the country was on the cusp of its own oil boom. Energy analyst Angelos Anastasiou, from Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ‘We’re rolling towards a crisis scenario. ‘We do need new generating capacity, and the likelihood is we’ll end with more gas-fired power stations. ‘But the problem is at the moment they’re not economical to build because of the returns.’ He added: ‘That’s the way of world now, because sadly we are running out of North Sea oil and gas. The situation is unlikely to improve.’ Last week, the UK had only 36 hours of domestic gas reserves left, after plunging temperatures saw millions of homes switch on the heating.","43 per cent of energy used came from abroad last year .

"Failed bid: UK Border Agency staff remove a man hidden in a lorry in the French port of Calais . Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers were allowed to stay in the UK without proper checks in yet another borders scandal, it emerged last night. A Government inspector found that thousands of foreign nationals were granted an ‘amnesty’ without their files even being looked at. Officials at the shambolic UK Border Agency (UKBA) also ignored evidence of deception and fraud by applicants whose cases dated back up to 17 years. Some 124,000 cases were put in  cold storage without proper checks to see if the applicant could be found. It has since emerged 37,500 people involved could have been easily located and potentially booted out. A further 10,000 cases classified as having ‘legal barriers to removal’ had, in fact, just never been opened. Officials also repeatedly misled Parliament over what was happening, according to John Vine, the chief inspector of Borders and Immigration. The grave charge has infuriated MPs and could trigger a new inquiry by the home affairs select committee. Its chairman, Keith Vaz, said last night: ‘This is a devastating report. The failure to properly check asylum cases means UKBA is in danger of overseeing an effective amnesty for many of them. 'The failure to properly check asylum cases means UKBA is in danger of overseeing an effective amnesty for many of them' Home affairs select committee chairman Keith Vaz . ‘It appears that senior officials of the UKBA have misled the committee about facts and figures. To mislead a committee of the House is an extremely serious matter. ‘Those same officials . . . have all received bonuses. On the basis of this report, they should hand them back immediately.’ One official who gave false information to the committee, Lin Homer, has since been promoted to chief executive at HM Revenue and Customs on £175,000 a year. Mr Vine’s explosive report lays bare the incompetence and confusion which took hold in the Home Office when 450,000 historic claims were unearthed by former Home Secretary John Reid in 2006. A deadline of April 2011 was set to clear the so-called legacy backlog, which involved 500,000 files. 'Devastating report': Officials at the UK Border Agency ignored evidence of deception and fraud by applicants whose cases dated back up to 17 years . The Mail has repeatedly highlighted how a huge number of the applications were being rubber-stamped. Mr Vine’s report puts a final figure on the number officially given asylum under this amnesty – an astonishing 172,000. But he also reveals what happened to the tens of thousands of cases where UKBA officials insisted the applicants could not be found. In November 2010, then agency chief executive Miss Homer told MPs that 100,000 cases were put in a controlled archive only after a ‘significant number of checks’. Miss Homer left the agency in January 2011. 'We have known for some time that UKBA is a troubled organisation with a poor record of delivery' Home Office spokesman . In April that year, acting chief executive Jonathan Sedgwick told the home affairs committee that each controlled archive case had been checked ‘against 19 databases – Government, Home Office, private sector databases’. But a sample of cases examined by Mr Vine found that just 4 per cent had been subject to external checks. In the months leading up to April . 2011, cases were put in the archive on the basis that no trace could be . found of the asylum seeker. But, the report found, in many such cases . that was simply because officials in the unit processing them – the Case . Resolution Directorate – had not opened the post to find letters from . lawyers. In April . 2011, the remaining cases were moved to the Case Assurance and Audit . Unit, based in Liverpool, which quickly became ‘overwhelmed’. It took on . 147,000 cases, with fewer that 100 staff. Such . was the chaos that 150 boxes of post were found unopened in the new . unit. In the following months, vast numbers of cases were fast-tracked, . with just 13 per cent of applicants refused the right to remain here. Some were allowed to stay despite ‘multiple examples of deception’ and . even imprisonment for fraud. 'Shambles': A Government inspector found thousands of foreign nationals were granted an 'amnesty' by the UK Border Agency without their files even being looked at . Case workers routinely granted migrants the right to stay under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act because they had been here so long, and applicants’ statements were accepted at face value. There was, the report said, ‘little evidence in a number of cases to demonstrate that they were being considered on their individual merits’. In a desperate bid to clear the cases, managers allowed case workers to grant the right to stay without even opening the file. Some 3,750 cases were decided this way. Of the controlled archive cases examined by the inspectors, on average they were not dealt with for more than seven years and one was not opened for 17 years. Once external checks were finally carried out this year, 31,000 migrants whose cases had been archived were ‘found’. Even now, many individuals are not being chased down immediately because of ‘insufficient resources’. Mr Vine said: ‘I found that updates given by the agency to Parliament in the summer of 2011, stating that the legacy of unresolved asylum cases was resolved, were inaccurate.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We have known for some time that UKBA is a troubled organisation with a poor record of delivery. Turning the agency around will take time, but we are making progress.’ James Slack's ANALYSIS . Five years ago, when the Mail revealed on its front page that ‘as many as 165,000 asylum seekers are to be granted an “amnesty” to live in Britain’, there were howls of protest from the Home Office. Officials insisted it was nothing of the sort and that each and every case would be judged exhaustively on its merits, while the pro-immigration lobby dismissed the 165,000 figure as ‘scare-mongering’. Today, we discover the truth. Of 479,000 historic cases considered by the Home Office under the so-called ‘legacy exercise’, 172,000 have been granted asylum, while only 37,500 people have been removed. A further 268,000 files were bundled into a category marked ‘other’. In some cases the files were duplicates, but more than 100,000 applications were flung into what officials called a ‘controlled archive’. As today’s report reveals, it was anything but ‘controlled’ – with few or no checks being carried out to trace the illegal immigrants and asylum seekers involved. Thousands of people – including criminals and people who told blatant lies on their asylum claims – are walking the streets years after they should have been kicked out. Over-stretched staff were rubber-stamping thousands of claims to stay without even opening the paper files. UK Border Agency staff dealt with the backlog of cases so inefficiently that at one point 100,000 pieces of post from lawyers, MPs and others were unopened. As an exercise in incompetence, it can hardly be bettered. But to make matters worse we now learn how Home Office officials repeatedly misled Parliament over the scale of the scandal. Checks which MPs were assured had taken place simply did not happen.And the official who presided over much of this shambles? Lin Homer, the one-time £200,000-a-year head of the UKBA, has not been dismissed or even disciplined. Indeed, she has been promoted to chief executive and permanent secretary of the HMRC – which collects the tax required for the country to function. Chancellor George Osborne should be very afraid.","UK Border Agency allowed tens of thousands of illegal immigrants to remain in UK without proper checks .

"Sitting in the waiting room of the antenatal clinic I was aghast at the sight of the women around me. To my left, a lady awaiting a 20-week scan munched her way through an enormous bag of crisps. It was barely 10am. Another woman had spread a napkin over her expansive thighs and was devouring an oversized 'breakfast muffin'. These, as any self-respecting woman knows, are just calorie-laden cakes masquerading as a healthy meal. This is a ruse that only ever seems to fool the overweight. All around me I spotted arms, chins, thighs and bottoms. Dimpled, corpulent flesh was everywhere. If it weren't for the pregnancy bumps, this easily could be mistaken for a slimming club meeting. Only at a slimming club, there is a sense of shame, or responsibility and desire to change. Scroll down for video . No excess weight gain: Sadie at three months pregnant, left, and two months later at five months pregnant, right, she doesn't look much different . 'When are you due?' a woman asked me. 'Four weeks,' I replied proudly. Her eyes dropped immediately to my compact bump, and I could see her mental processes working overtime. Her initial incredulity rapidly morphed into anger at me and pity for my unborn child. 'Anorexic,' I could tell she was thinking. 'Obsessive. Narcissistic. Putting her own vanity before the health of her baby.' In a word, she was seized by jealousy - the green-eyed monster that seems to turn the most sensible and intelligent of women into bile-spitting harpies when faced with something they wish they had. I suspect that was the real reason behind 75-year-old feminist Germaine Greer's attack on the Duchess of Cambridge this week. Her argument was that Kate, who happens to be suffering again from chronic morning sickness, was 'too thin', and that she 'shouldn't have been made to go through all this again so soon [after the birth of Prince George]'. Her outburst infuriated me, as I too came in for constant criticism just because I chose not to put on mountains of blubber during my own pregnancy, which culminated a year ago in the birth of my bouncy, happy, healthy son, Albie. Despite the bleatings of all those who attacked me for refusing to eat for two, we were both declared to be in perfect health just hours after the birth. Why won't people wake up and acknowledge that the real risk to unborn babies comes when their mothers are obese? Staying healthy: Sadie had a small bump at six months, left, causing her friends and even strangers to criticise her for not eating enough. Kate also had a neat bump when she was pregnant with Prince George at six months, right . Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, recently warned: 'Obesity in pregnant women can lead to all sorts of problems, including the death of the mother, or of the baby through stillbirth, or the baby having foetal abnormalities, or the woman suffering pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, or requiring a caesarean because either she or the baby is too big.' I firmly believe that if more mothers adopted my - and Kate's - approach to pregnancy, scant NHS resources would not be wasted treating the problems associated with maternal obesity. Every woman has a duty to exercise and eat healthily before and during pregnancy - for her own good and the good of her unborn child. The morning of that antenatal appointment for example, I'd already done an hour's workout in the gym and eaten a bowl of organic porridge for breakfast. This was all part of my campaign to ensure I only gained minimal weight during pregnancy. And, I'm pleased to say, it worked. Four weeks before having my baby boy by caesarean section - essential due to complications with the placenta - I was still wearing my pre-pregnancy size 10 tops. I never bought any maternity wear at all - except for some pregnancy jeans with stretchy waistbands. My pregnancy coincided with Kate's first and I would examine photos of her forensically. I felt absolutely inspired by her mini-bump and otherwise slim frame. Of course, the mummy-tummy mafia weren't so keen, branding her selfish for remaining trim and claiming this put pressure on ordinary mums not to pile on the pounds. For me, Kate - known for her love of sport - was welcome proof that not every mother-to-be has to turn into an overweight, out-of-shape slob. And like Kate, I was seven months pregnant before my bump even started to show in my clothes. Starting to bloom: A more noticeable bump at seven months, right, and seven-and-a-half-months, left, but she was still slim compared to the other expectant women she met who had seen pregnancy as an excuse to pile on the pounds . According to my midwife, it was the legacy of my tight abdominal muscles, developed through years of regular exercise. She estimated I'd gained just a stone-and-a-half when I was full term. I was well within the healthy weight-gain boundaries. Experts recommend you should put on no more than 21 to 28lb while expecting, a combination of baby, placenta, amniotic fluid, extra blood and around half a stone of fat laid down naturally in preparation for breastfeeding. But, just like poor Kate, I had to defend myself throughout, to everyone from friends to other pregnant women and even strangers. At five months, when I still had no visible baby bump, friends started to voice their concern, telling me sanctimoniously that I was failing my unborn baby. This went on right up until the moment I gave birth last September. 'Are you eating properly?' one old friend demanded when I met her for dinner at seven months. 'Isn't it time you let go of your need to be slim for once?' snarled another. One close girlfriend was particularly vociferous, exclaiming: 'You've not put on nearly enough weight, you need to concentrate on nourishing your baby.' That hurt, as it insinuated that I wasn't putting my son's health first when that couldn't have been further from the truth. In the gym there were looks of disdain on the faces of other members at the sight of a pregnant woman lifting weights. And out powerwalking - I stopped running outdoors at 17 weeks - the disapproving tuts of passers-by were audible. When I wrote in this newspaper last year about exercising till I was eight months pregnant, I was vilified, with critics even suggesting my child would be born underweight or with shaken baby syndrome. Yet when did you ever hear anyone berate a pregnant woman for putting her feet up, gorging herself on cream cakes and chips and whacking on a pile of unnecessary weight? All I did was continue to exercise daily and eat a diet rich in chicken, turkey and fish, lots of fresh vegetables and homemade soups. Full-term: Sadie had gained just a stone-and-a-half - and she was back in her size 10 jeans just over a fortnight after giving birth . Proud: Despite the mummy mafia's reservations, Albie was born weighing a very healthy 7lb 6oz . All of this was done with the blessing of my obstetrician, who said that she wished more women would take the approach I had. My priority was to be the healthiest I could be for the good of my baby. But I'm not ashamed to admit that I was also terrified of losing my figure out of vanity. What's wrong with that? Why would I suddenly want to be fat just because I was pregnant? My husband's only concern was that I and our baby were healthy. But I've always taken pride in my appearance and would have seen it as disrespectful to him to let myself go. All the research backs up my sensible approach, even though the mummy mafia won't agree. Countless studies have proved that a sensible diet and being active throughout pregnancy are good for the woman and her unborn child. The Royal College of Midwives' policy adviser, Janet Fyle, is unequivocal regarding nutrition and the dangerous 'eating for two' myth. 'In the womb, babies take what they need in terms of nutrition, leaving the mother with the remainder. Therefore eating more than the baby requires results in excessive weight gain and that will be the mother's problem in the end.' Weighing in: Germaine Greer has said the Duchess, pictured left shortly before it was announced she's pregnant again, is  too thin . In fact, no extra calories are needed until the final three months of a pregnancy, and even then only a further 200 a day are recommended, the equivalent of one extra slice of toast or a small bowl of cereal. My argument with the 'thin haters' was well and truly won when my beautiful son Albie was born weighing a very healthy 7lb 6oz. And just 16 days later, I was back in my size 10 pre-pregnancy jeans and gleefully stuffing those maternity skinnies into a cupboard. Unfortunately, the jealousy didn't end there - as it didn't with Kate, whose body recovered very quickly after the birth of Prince George too. One friend told me, with a distinct sniff, that I would doubtless gain weight over the coming months as I sat around feeding and cuddling my baby. I didn't. Would I find it more comforting to see Kate porking out and straining at the seams of her maternity wear during her second pregnancy? Absolutely not.

"Supermarket giant Tesco has apologised for using a 'motivational' poster of a man pretending to shoot himself in the head. The store has come under fire from mental health campaigners after it put the poster up in the staffroom of a supermarket where sales were falling. The poster features a man holding a gun to his head along with the words: 'Goodbye Haverfordwest, it's been nice knowing you!' Tesco has apologised after this 'motivational' poster was put up in the staffroom of a store where sales were falling . Staff at the supermarket, in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, saw the poster above the monthly sales report every day when they clocked in and out of work. But one Tesco worker took a picture of it and complained to his managers. A worker at the supermarket said: 'It was supposed to get us motivated - but you just felt like they were holding a gun to your head. 'It wasn't funny or inspirational - it was just a bit sick.' Tesco received widespread condemnation last month for trivialising and stigmatising mental health issues by selling 'mental patient' costumes. Tesco withdrew its £18.45 'Psycho Ward' costume, which came complete with an orange boiler suit and Hannibal Lecter-style mask, and agreed to make a donation to mental health charity Mind. Staff at the supermarket, in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, saw the poster above the monthly sales report every day . The poster was yesterday withdrawn from the Haverfordwest store. Ruth Coombs, Mind Cymru manager for influence and change said: 'We're very disappointed to see this image and the lack of mental health awareness shown by Tesco with its use. 'Suicide is a very serious issue, which affects hundreds of people each year. 'We'd certainly urge Tesco to reconsider using imagery of this kind and think about the effect it can have on staff.' A Tesco spokesman said: 'This was clearly an error of judgement, in one store. 'The person responsible for the poster has apologised and it has been removed.","Poster was put up in Pembrokeshire supermarket where sales are falling .

"Australian scientists have developed a pair of anti-shark wetsuits that make divers appear invisible by camouflaging their bodies in the sea and trick sharks into thinking surfers are poisonous. A team of researchers from the University of Western Australia joined forces with designers from  Shark Attack Mitigation Systems (SAMS) to create the suits. The blue pattern of the Elude suit can't be seen by the shark because the fish are colour blind. While the stripes on the Diverter suit mimic the colours of poisonous fish to warn the sharks off. Scroll down for video . The Elude wetsuit (pictured) with its unusual design of jagged blue shapes, conceals divers from sharks by exploiting the predator's colour blindness. Scientists and shark experts took two years to develop the wetsuit which acts like an invisibility cloak underwater in a bid to keep swimmers safe . A surfer (left) and a diver (right) wear the two styles of wetsuits with the surfer holding a surfboard. The technology was designed by SAMS in collaboration with the Oceans Institute at the University of Western Australia . The creators claim the suits could save lives. The Elude wetsuit is designed to be used by swimmers and divers and are covered in a jagged blue pattern, which works to conceal divers from sharks. The predators were recently found to be colour blind. While sharks are known to have a keen sense of smell, scientists believe that they rely heavily on their vision in the final - often deadly - phase of a shark attack. The pattern uses disruptive coloration and shaping, which is difficult for a shark to see and also blends in with background colours. The combination of contrasting colours and differing sizes of the shapes on the Elude wetsuits (pictured) ensures optimal effect at various depths and distances,' according to SAMS. The company believes that while a shark might smell or sense a person in the water, it is much less likely to attack if it cannot see the target . The new wetsuit designs, aimed at making a surfer look less like a seal - a favorite food for sharks - have been launched and tested in Perth . This combination of contrasting colours and differing types and sizes of the shapes 'ensures optimal effect at various depths and distances,' according to SAMS. The company believes that while a shark might smell or sense a person in the water, it is much less likely to attack if it cannot see the target. Scientists at SAMS and the university also developed a wetsuit called Diverter that works in the opposite way. It is designed to scare off sharks. The Diverter wetsuit has navy and white stripes that are seen on some poisonous animals and fish to make the shark think they diver is dangerous. The designers have also created matching surfboard stickers. According to SAMS, years of anecdotal evidence . suggests that a stripe pattern acts as a deterrent or repellent to . sharks. But the scientists found that very . specific contrasting colours, shapes and dimensions work together for . maximum effect. The reflective spectrum or light . reflective properties of various colours that change at different water . depths were of huge interest to the scientists. 'By . disrupting the sharks visual perception, an attack can either be . diverted altogether, or at least delayed, allowing time for evasive . action,' SAMS said. The Diverter wetsuit (pictured) is designed for surfers and has bold navy and white stripes that mirror nature's warning signs to present the wearer as something poisonous or unpalatable. According to SAMS, years of anecdotal evidence suggests that a stripe pattern acts as a deterrent or repellent to sharks . The team undertook extensive research to examine how sharks see and hunt underwater to create the wetsuits (pictured). Scientists used molecular biology techniques to study the genes responsible for coding the retinal visual pigments found in sharks' eyes to help them develop the patterns . The team undertook extensive research to examine how sharks see and hunt underwater. Professor Shaun Collin and . Professor Nathan Hart from the university used molecular biology techniques to study . the genes responsible for coding the retinal visual pigments found in . the eyes of selected species of large sharks. They wanted to isolate the effect that certain colours and shapes have on sharks' sensory systems as well as if certain combinations were particularly conspicuous or unrecognisable to the underwater predators. They modelled various underwater light fields to determine the spatial resolving power, spectral sensitivity and light gathering ability of the shark visual system by using specialist research software. Their findings led to the development of a patterned surface that seems either unrecognisable or dangerous to sharks - which is a lot more useful that the reflectance of a traditional wetsuit. Sharks such as the great white (pictured) are some of nature's most feared predators. The £300 wetsuits were developed by scientists in a bid to protect people from deadly shark attacks. There have been five fatal attacks off the coast of Western Australia in the last 12 months . Using their findings, they tested the patterns on computer models where divers swam at different depths, to determine the optimum . contrasting stripe width and spacing. Talking about the Diverter design for surfers, Professor Collin told The Guardian: 'Many animals in biology are repelled . by noxious animals – prey that provide a signal that somehow says ‘Don't . eat me’ – and that has been manifest in a striped pattern. 'We are using a lot of nature's technology, based on high-contrast-based banding patterns. 'The wearer will be obvious, and the idea is the shark will see that as an unpalatable food item and swim right by.' It is hoped that the wetsuit can reduce the number of people who are fatally attacked by sharks. Western Australia has suffered five fatal attacks in the last year, which gave the state its unfortunate reputation of shark attack capital of the world. The wetsuits took around two years to develop and cost around £300 ($495) from Radiator Wetsuits. SAMS has also developed stickers for surfboards (pictured) that are designed to be shark repellant in an effort to keep surfers safer .","Australian scientists have developed wetsuits that prevent shark attacks .

"Shocking: Christian woman Asia Bibi, pictured, has seen her appeal against the death sentence denied . A Pakistani Christian woman has been sentenced to hang after she was accused of making 'blasphemous' comments about the prophet Mohammed during an argument. While working as a berry picker in 2009, 46-year-old Asia Bibi got into a dispute with a group of Muslim women who objected to her drinking their water because as a Christian she was considered 'unclean'. Hours after the incident one of the women reported mother-of-five Ms Bibi to a local cleric, claiming she had made disparaging remarks about the prophet Mohammed during the row. As a result of the allegations, a furious mob arrived at Ms Bibi's home and savagely beat her and members of her family. She was later arrested, charged with blasphemy and eventually sentenced to death - with her entire family forced to go into hiding after receiving threats on their lives. This week, despite international outrage and hundreds of thousands of people signing a petition for her release, Ms Bibi lost an appeal to have her sentence overturned, meaning she now faces death by hanging. The shocking case hit global headlines after two prominent politicians who tried to help Ms Bibi were assassinated, one by his own bodyguard. Lawyers showered the killer with rose petals when he appeared in court and the judge who convicted him of murder had to flee the country. Ms Bibi's lawyer, Naeem Shakir, said her accusers have contradicted themselves many times since first raising their complaint. Two witnesses allegedly involved in the incident did not appear in court, he said. A Muslim prayer leader did appear, saying he did not witness the original altercation, but that Ms Bibi had confessed to the supposed crime in front of him. Speaking of Ms Bibi's failed appeal against her death sentence, Mr Shakir said: 'I was expecting the opposite decision. We will file an appeal to the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a few days.' But Gulam Mustafa, the lawyer for the complainant, said the court's decision was correct. 'Asia's lawyer tried to prove that the case was registered on a personal enmity but he failed to prove that,' he said. Support: Ashiq Maseeh, husband of Asia Bibi, along with his daughters Sidra, second left, and Esham, left, speak to Pakistani Minister of Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti, right. He was later murdered . Human rights groups say Pakistan's blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores. The law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence. There are also no penalties for false accusations. Those accused are sometimes lynched on the spot. If they are arrested, police and the courts often allow trials to drag on for years, as in the case of Ms Bibi. The delays tend to be caused because officials are afraid of being physically attacked if they release anyone they feel had been wrongly accused of blasphemy. Only one person has been executed since Pakistan imposed a de facto moratorium on executions in 2008. This year has seen a record number of blasphemy cases as well as increasing violence against the accused. Mrs Bibi - a farm worker from rural Punjab - released a memoir called 'Blasphemy' last year, in which she described her torment at not knowing how long she has left to live. Talking about how she ended up being accused of blasphemy, she says: 'I drank water from a well belonging to Muslim women, using 'their' cup, in the burning heat of the midday sun. Worried: The daughters of Mrs Bibi pose with an image of their mother who faces death by hanging . The crime of blasphemy was sealed into Pakistani law under British rule but strengthened during the years of military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who died in a plane crash in 1988. In recent years, however, the country - which is 96 per cent Muslim - has seen a surge in accusations of insulting Islam, says Islamabad-based think-tank, the Center for Research and Security Studies. But many analysts see the claims as score-settling or a front for property grabs, and in fact have nothing to do with Islam. If found guilty, defendants can expect the death penalty. The charges are hard to fight because the law does not define blasphemy so presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement. It can also be very difficult to find a lawyer willing to defend those accused of the crime. Blasphemy carries the death penalty in Pakistan but the accused are often lynched or languish for years in jail without trial because lawyers are too afraid to defend them. Judges have previously been attacked in Pakistan for acquitting blasphemy defendants and two politicians who discussed reforming the law were shot dead. 'I, Asia Bibi, have been sentenced to death because I was thirsty. I'm a prisoner because I used the same cup as those Muslim women, because water served by a Christian woman was regarded as unclean by my stupid fellow fruit-pickers.' In the book, Mrs Bibi describes how - tired of being considered a second-class citizen simply because of her religion and insulted by constant calls for her to convert to Islam - she decided to stand up to the crowd and defend Christianity. Pushing and shoving ensued, forcing Ms Bibi to flee the scene. When she returned to work five days later she was attacked again, but this time the crowd were accusing her of having insulted the Prophet Mohammed. Battered and bruised, Ms Bibi was dragged before the local Islamic teacher who told her the only way she could redeem herself was by converting to Islam. Otherwise, he said, she would face death. In November 2010 Ms Bibi was sentenced to death in a Sharia law court, becoming the first woman in Pakistan's history to be given the death penalty for blasphemy. Over the past four years Ms Bibi has languished in the high-security District Jail Seikhupura, 22 miles north-west of Lahore, before being moved to a more remote prison. Officials now make her cook her own food every day because they fear that Ms Bibi has so many enemies - within both the prison population and its staff - that she is at serious risk of poisoning. Anger: Protesters hold up placards while demanding the release of Mrs Bibi at a rally in Lahore in 2010 . Ms Bibi's death sentence has drawn international outrage from human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch who say Pakistan's blasphemy laws amount to form of religious persecution. On news that Ms Bibi's appeal against her conviction had been overturned, Kate Allen, UK Director of Amnesty International, said: 'This is the latest blasphemy outrage to come out of Pakistan. It seems obvious that this is a case of religious persecution, and it’s very likely the result of a squabble which escalated out of all proportion.' 'Blasphemy accusations in Pakistan are often used to settle petty vendettas and persecute minority groups. It’s a complete disgrace that the courts are complicit in these vendettas.' Meanwhile a spokesperson for Christian Solidarity Worldwide said: 'Asiya Bibi’s sentence is a tragic reminder of the continued abuse of the dysfunctional blasphemy laws and the underlying weaknesses in Pakistan's justice system.' 'Deeply-rooted problems of prejudice, inefficiency, corruption, and under-resourcing are amplified in blasphemy cases, and even more so for religious minorities,' the spokesperson added. 'The only hope she has for justice is when the case is heard in the Supreme Court, and we urge Chief Justice Nasirul Mulk to consider Asiya Bibi’s case with the utmost urgency,' they went on to say. Pope Benedict XVI publicly called for clemency for Ms Bibi, describing his 'spiritual closeness' with her and urging that 'human dignity and fundamental rights of everyone in similar situations' be respected. Her case also attracted the attention of a number of online petitions calling for her release, one of which attracted over 400,000 signatures from the citizens of over 100 countries.","Asia Bibi, 46, was accused of blasphemy after dispute with Muslim women .

In a statement, Chiles said: 'I made the remark in relation to the nice Polish builders currently working at my place, who I knew would already be fed up having watched their team lose to Ukraine.

Many of the tweets were more abusive towards the presenter, who was a trending subject on the social media site after the match. This is not the first time the presenter, who has been with ITV Sport since 2010, has made a comment about Polish people in the UK. After the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland in May he commented that when Poland visited Wembley it would 'be like a home game' for them. Chiles is no stranger to controversy, the West Brom supporter called former Albion player Peter Odemwingie a 't**t' at the club's awards evening at the end of last season - he later rang the player to apologise. Police expect a quarter of the 90,000 crowd will be cheering Poland when they meet England at Wembley in the vital World Cup qualifying game on Tuesday. In addition to the country’s official allocation, a huge number of UK-based Poles have snapped up tickets. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the force was ‘not overly concerned’ about the large number  of away fans, despite the potential for violence. England head into the final set of fixtures leading Group H by a point. They must win the game to qualify automatically for next year’s finals in Brazil. The alternative is that they will face the hazardous play-offs as any other result would mean relying on winless San Marino to take points from Ukraine, who are second in in the group.","Pundit Lee Dixon said he hoped 15,000 Poles would be 'crying' if England beat them, to which Chiles responded: ' I'm trying to get some building work done at the moment, be careful'

"Penny Nadal (left) is suing a care company after her daughter Lisa Conisbee (right) suffered horrific facial injuries when her wheelchair rolled down a steep hill . A mother is suing her disabled daughter's carers after her wheelchair rolled 200ft down a steep hill and crashed into a main road. Lisa Conisbee, 27, who suffers from cerebral palsy, received horrific facial injuries after her chair rolled down the hill before hitting a kerb and throwing her into the road. Two carers had pushed her to the top of Skinners Hill, in Rushden, Northamptonshire, where they waited for a bus while out on a day trip. It is believed the brakes on her wheelchair may not have been applied as they were waiting, allowing it to roll down the steep incline. Her mother Penny Nadal, 53, is now taking legal action against Olympus Care Services - claiming her daughter’s carers forgot to apply the brakes to the wheelchair. Ms Conisbee - who was left with a scar above her eye and several cuts and bruises to her face - took two months to recover after the fall on April 23 last year. Yesterday, her teaching assistant mother said her daughter, who also suffers from spinal problems, epilepsy and partial blindness, was 'lucky to be alive'.

"Clothing giant American Apparel has been branded 'sexist' and 'sleazy' over a series of 'degrading' adverts for a unisex shirt.

"Girls as young as 11 'expect' to have to perform sex acts on rows of boys for up to two hours at a time in parts of London, a watchdog said as they warned child abuse is rife across Britain. Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz said there 'isn’t a town, village or hamlet in which children are not being sexually exploited'. In one vile abuse case she uncovered, boys aged 14 and 15 were . 'summoned' via BlackBerry Messenger to the gang rape of a 'very, very . young girl' which lasted several days. Horrendous: Thousands of children the country are being sexually exploited, stunned MPs were told today (picture posed by model) She told MPs today: 'Boys were being called while some . were raping the girl to say ""come, come, come, you can join in too"" and . they were arriving and elbowing each other out of the way to rape her.' Ms Berelowitz said the recent sex abuse case in Rochdale - which involved mostly men of Pakistani origin abusing white girls - was just part of a wider picture of exploitation involving victims and abusers of all races and cultures. Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee, she said: 'What I am uncovering is that sexual exploitation of children is happening all over the country. 'As one police officer who was the . lead in a very big investigation in a very lovely, leafy, rural part of . the country said to me: ""there isn’t a town, village or hamlet in which . children are not being sexually exploited"". 'The evidence that has come to the fore during the course of my inquiry is that that, unfortunately, appears to be the case. 'We should start from the assumption that children are being sexually exploited right the way across the country. 'In urban, rural and metropolitan . areas, I have hard evidence of children being sexually exploited. That . is part of what is going on in some parts of our country. It is very . sadistic, it is very violent it is very ugly.' Her report into the scale of child abuse is due out in September. Giving examples from the capital, she . said: 'There are parts of London where certainly children expect to have . to perform oral sex on line-ups of boys, up to two hours at a time from . the age of 11. And it was 'quite common' for girls to . be lured via internet chat rooms to meet a friend, only to be met by a . group of boys and gang raped in a park. 'Then another group of boys come, they take her to another part of the park and she is serially raped again,' Ms Berelowitz told MPs. 'I wish I could say to you that such things are uncommon but I’m afraid they are quite common.' In the Rochdale case, nine Muslim men, . mainly of Pakistani origin, were found guilty of plying girls as young . as 13 with drink and drugs so they could use them for sex. Horror: Children are being targeted on Facebook - and in one instance word of a gang rape was spread by BlackBerry messenger . But while it may be true that some Pakistani men saw white girls as 'easy meat' - as suggested by a number of high-profile politicians - that was only one pattern among many, she said. 'I regret to say that there are parts of every single community - white, Pakistani, Afghan, Gypsy and Romany travellers, you name it - who are seeing children as easy access in terms of sexual exploitation. And in terms of victims we are seeing the same sort of profile.' Ethnic minority victims were 'too often missed out'. The deputy commissioner told the visibly-stunned MPs that 'what is being done is so terrible that people need to lay aside their denial' or risk victims being disbelieved. Victims numbered in the thousands not the hundreds, she said. She said she was 'extremely concerned' about the role being played by the internet in enabling and fuelling abuse, and ridiculed the idea that parents could prevent access. Young people were acting out scenes they saw in online pornography and even organising abuse via social networking sites and messaging systems, she said. One police force showed her a list of more than 1,000 girls aged between 12 and 14 whom a man in his 40s masquerading as a boy had managed to make his 'friends' on Facebook. 'We have gathered quite a lot of evidence to show that there is no doubt that social networking sites can be a source of real problems for this,' she said. She said easy access to extreme pornography was a particular concern. 'We’ve had boys say to us - some of the boys I’ve spoken to who’ve been involved in sexual exploitation - ""it was like being in a porn movie"". 'They have watched things and then they’ve enacted them. 'Parents may think they can control what’s going on because they can have a blockage on the computer but the reality is children can get anything they like on their mobile phones. 'And they are. It has definitely affected children’s thresholds of what they think is normal.' In another case, older men were using young male gang members as a 'front line' in a wider abuse network, and had even forced two of the boys to have sex and filmed it on a mobile phone to ensure their compliance. Speaking about the race issue, she told the committee she had visited a 'racist' estate in the north of England where there was routine sexual abuse of children within an all-white community. 'I have been to gang-associated areas in the north of England. 'I am thinking of one particular estate which is exclusively white, because it is such a racist estate, where there is a very strong and identified pattern of the white males on that estate sexually exploiting the white females on that estate. 'So it is really important to hold all of it in mind.'","Internet is fuelling abuse of thousands of youngsters, Deputy Children's Commissioner tells MPs .

"Marine Le Pen dealt Nicolas Sarkozy a major blow last night by declaring he had ‘lost’ the election and refusing to tell her supporters to back him. The French president’s hopes of clinging to power rely on picking up the votes of many of the six million who backed Miss Le Pen’s National Front in record numbers in the first round of the national poll. The strong showing for the Far Right party triggered alarm around Europe, while the prospect of Mr Sarkozy losing to socialist opponent Francois Hollande in the second round spooked financial markets. Scroll down for video . Fighting for his political life: Nicolas Sarkozy, pictured in Paris yesterday, must win over voters on the far right if he is to avoid defeat in the presidential run-off . Towering strength: Marine Le Penn  yesterday dealt Sarkozy a major blow by declaring that he lost the election. She refused to support him in the run-off . Economists fear Mr Hollande will unpick a Brussels deal on fiscal union and shatter an uneasy consensus on the need for austerity measures across the Continent. The political uncertainty in France, the world’s fifth largest economy, helped trigger a sell-off on both sides of the Atlantic. The French stock market fell by 2.83 per cent, Germany’s by 3.36 per cent and London’s by 1.85 per cent. German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday expressed shock that nearly 20 per cent of French voters had gone for the National Front. The alliance between Berlin and Paris is key to the European project. Defeat for Mr Sarkozy on May 6 would also be awkward for David Cameron, who broke with convention by publicly endorsing the French president. President in waiting? Francois Hollande is favourite to defeat Sarkozy in the run-off in two weeks time . Government sources said efforts would be made to extend an olive branch to the French socialists, with Europe Minister David Lidington expected to be tasked with trying to strengthen links. ‘They are political allies,’ a Downing Street source said of Mr Sarkozy and Mr Cameron, defending the Prime Minister’s decision to back the French president. ‘But of course, if Hollande ends up winning we will have to work with him.’ Miss Le Pen’s party won 18 per cent of the vote, its largest ever share, in Sunday’s first round, but yesterday her party said there would be no deal with the current president. She said: ‘I don’t expect anything except that the system will implode,’ adding: ‘Sarkozy has already lost the presidential election.’ Bruno Bilde, Miss Le Pen’s senior aide, said: ‘There has to be reorganisation of French political life. ‘It’s therefore out of the question for the National Front candidate to negotiate … or to offer her vote in favour of Nicolas Sarkozy or Francois Hollande. Marine Le Pen is convinced of that.’ Pleased: Francois Hollande (left) waves as he arrives on the stage to give a speech after doing well in the first round of the votes, as Sarkozy went out and about today (right) Salute: Marine Le Pen, National Front Party Candidate took third place in the first round of the votes . A National Front spokesman said: ‘We . shall be abstaining, because we do not want to give a green light to any . of the two candidates, because they are the same’. Opinion . polls have suggested that up to six in ten Le Pen voters could back Mr . Sarkozy in the second round. Mr Hollande won 28.6 per cent and Sarkozy . took 27 per cent on Sunday. Mr Hollande is now the favourite to win. If he does, he would become France’s first socialist leader in 17 years. Both . contenders tried to tack to the right to try to appeal to voters who . had backed Miss Le Pen. Speaking at a rally in central France, Mr . Sarkozy said he ‘had heard’ Le Pen’s message and vowed to be tough on . immigration. He said: . ‘National Front voters must be respected. They voiced their view. It was . a vote of suffering, a crisis vote. Why insult them? This anxiety, this . suffering, I know them, I understand them. ‘They . concern our borders, outsourcing, control of immigration, work, . security, for them and their families. I know that in this fast-moving . world, the concern of our patriots to preserve their way of life is the . key issue in this election.’ In Brittany, Mr Hollande said: ‘My message? We are a large country and we will recover – we have no need of divisions.’ Pierre . Moscovici, his campaign director, said the Socialist candidate would . continue to be ‘very open’ to legal immigration, but ‘we must fight with . absolute firmness, without concession, against illegal immigration’. Far . Left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came fourth with almost 12 per . cent of the vote, has told his supporters to back Mr Hollande. Voilà!

French president Jacques Chirac's wife Bernadette is seen in a polling . station in Sarran . In 2007 Nicolas Sarkozy inspired voters with pledges to break with the past and make France a more dynamic economy. But after an initial wave of reforms, his momentum fizzled. His stormy personal life got in the way: he divorced months into office, then quickly married former supermodel Carla Bruni, and became seen as a bling-bling president more concerned with pleasing his super-rich friends than serving the public. He enjoyed a string of foreign policy successes, improving relations with the United States and Israel, leading an international airstrike campaign in Libya and rallying European partners to stem Europe's financial crisis. But voters at home felt forgotten and hurt by a presidency that included France's worst recession since World War II. Francois Hollande, despite a bland persona and few eye-catching campaign ideas, has been more popular than Sarkozy for months. Sarkozy showed signs of a possible comeback once he hit the campaign trail. The shooting rampage in southern France also gave him a platform to appear presidential and project the tough guy image that helped launch him to national prominence. But in recent days his support has lagged again. The last polls before the election, released on Friday, showed Sarkozy slipping a few points behind Hollande in the first round - and a crushing 10 to 15 points away from victory in the runoff.","Nicolas Sarkozy's re-election votes are pinned on winning votes of six million who backed Marine Le Pen in first round .

"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hugo Chavez mocked the U.S. and joked about directing 'a big atomic bomb' at Washington as they met in Caracas today. The president of Iran was visiting his Venezuelan counterpart in an attempt to rally support for his government in the face of tightening sanctions from the West. His meeting with Mr Chavez came on the day that Iran sentenced a man to death for allegedly spying on the country for the U.S., and claimed to have arrested several more American spies. And the country has also sparked anger by beginning to enrich uranium at a secret underground site - a move which could be a step further towards developing a nuclear bomb. Laughing: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, left, shares a joke with Hugo Chavez as he arrives in Caracas . Mr Ahmadinejad is in Venezuela at the start of his tour of Latin American countries ruled by left-wing governments sympathetic to Iran's virulently anti-western regime. As international sanctions begin to bite on Iran's oil-dominated economy, the president is looking for allies who can continue to provide an economic lifeline for his government. 'Despite those arrogant people who do not wish us to be together, we will unite forever,' he told Mr Chavez today. Both men hugged, beamed, held hands and showered each other with praise, making macabre jokes which appeared to threaten the U.S., the principal enemy of both leaders. Allies: The president of Iran is visiting Latin America to drum up support against sanctions from the West . Outspoken: The men joked about targeting Washington with 'a big atomic bomb' Mr Chavez said that he was hiding a bomb under a grassy knoll before the steps of the presidential palace, saying: 'That hill will open up and a big atomic bomb will come out.' As the two men laughed, he added: 'The imperialist spokesmen say Ahmadinejad and I are going into the basement now to set our sights on Washington and launch cannons and missiles... It's laughable.' During a welcome ceremony for Mr Ahmadinejad, the speeches were mostly limited to mutual adulation and anti-U.S. snipes. Mr Chavez said: 'The imperialist madness has been unleashed in a way that has not been seen for a long time.' Mr Ahmadinejad called his host, who is recovering from cancer, 'the champion in the war on imperialism'. And discussing the two countries' co-operation, Mr Chavez said that Iranian constructors had recently . built 14,000 new homes in Venezuela, adding: 'The only bombs we're . preparing are bombs against poverty, hunger and misery.' Show of power: Mr Ahmadinejad is seeking support for his government from left-leaning rulers sympathetic to his anti-western foreign policy . Friendship: The two men are united in their hatred of the U.S., which Mr Chavez has accused of being responsible for a number of South American leaders falling ill with cancer . U.S. officials have expressed disquiet over Venezuela's close ties with Iran. They fear Mr Chavez will weaken the international diplomatic front against Iran and could give Tehran an economic lifeline. The United States and its allies believe Iran's nuclear policy - which has taken a step forward with the opening of the underground Fordow facility near Qom - is aimed at producing a weapon. Iran says it is only for peaceful power generation. As well as Venezuela, Mr Ahmadinejad plans to visit Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador on a visit that Washington has said shows its 'desperation' for friends. Those nations' governments share Mr Chavez's broad global views, but do not have Venezuela's economic clout and are unable to offer Iran any significant assistance. Analysts are watching closely to see if Mr Chavez will back Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil shipping lane, or how much he could undermine the sanctions by providing fuel or cash to Tehran. Ahmadinejad, who is subordinate to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on foreign policy, has said little about the rising tensions with the West, including the sentencing to death of 28-year-old Iranian-American Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, who is accused of spying for the CIA.

"An Eagle Scout whose defence of same-sex unions became an internet sensation last year, has challenged the anti-gay policy of the Boy Scouts of America during its annual conference in Orlando. Zach Wahls, 20, of Iowa City, Iowa, presented the Boy Scouts leadership with a petition signed by 275,000 people calling for the organization to end discrimination against gay youth and leaders. The petition was launched April 17 on . Change.org, the web-based social change platform, by Jennifer Tyrrell, . 32, a former Boy Scouts den leader from Bridgeport, Ohio, one week after . she was ousted because she is gay. The petition also calls for her . reinstatement. Scroll down for video . Hoping for change: Eagle Scout Zach Wahls needed a little help as he delivered the cartons of 275,000 petitions to the Boys Scouts of America national board meeting in Orlando . Fight: The petition was launched on April 17, one week after Jennifer Tyrrell, 32, an ex-den leader from Bridgeport, Ohio, was ousted because she is gay . Eagle Scout is the top rank attainable in the BSA and requires a major service project to demonstrate leadership, along with numerous merit badges. It is also fuelled by some star power, with support from chat show host Ellen DeGeneres, Modern Family star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and singer Ricky Martin. ABC News reported that leaders of the Boy Scouts appeared receptive to Wahls’ statements. Mr Wahls told the network: 'It's a dialogue that continues to be difficult for many people. But the members of our community are the ones that pay the price, not the organization as a whole.' Tyrrell, who will not attend the event, said she is not optimistic. Getting the message out: Both Mr Wahls and Ms Tyrrell have said spoken out in interviews . Ms Tyrrell was honoured for her fight against the Boy Scouts' decision on stage at the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation Media Awards in Los Angeles last month. Mr Wahls, whose defence of his own lesbian mothers and civil unions before the Iowa House of Representatives has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.5 million times, said gay rights advocates are aware of many Boy Scout leaders who support change. 'I think it's a lot closer than people might expect,' Wahls said. He added: 'It's very clear that there's a lot of support even within the Boy Scouts of America... What we're trying to do is make sure we give them some real credence so they know that they have external support, that there are a lot people that have their back when it comes to actually changing this policy from a national perspective.' But later, the BSA indicated it would not be changing its policies. Scout's honour: Mr Wahls' defence of his own lesbian mothers and civil unions before Iowa lawmakers last year has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.5 million times . Deron Smith, BSA director of public relations, said in a statement to ABC: 'The Boy Scouts of America teaches its members to treat those with different opinions with courtesy and respect at all times. 'Today, Scouting officials accepted signatures from an online petition and shared the purpose of its membership policy.' The statement went on: 'Scouting maintains that is youth development program is not the appropriate environment to introduce or discuss, in any way, same-sex attraction. Parents and caregivers should have the right to decide when and how to discuss the issue with their children.' The Boy Scouts of America in 2000 famously won a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the organization to ban gays whose conduct, the Boy Scouts argued, violated its values. Mr Wahls, his lesbian parents and Tyrrell found that local Boy Scout leaders and parents accepted them regardless of the parents' sexual orientation. 'It was a complete non-issue after people got to know me and know my parents,' he said. Ms Tyrrell said she was assured by her . local cubmaster that her sexual orientation was not a problem and she . was even drafted to be den leader. Celeb backing: Among the stars who have signed the petition are chat show host Ellen Degeneres, pictured left with partner Portia De Rossi, and singer Ricky Martin, right . However, later, when she became treasurer and pointed out some financial discrepancies in the books, someone told the pastor of the church that chartered her den that she was gay, and the Boy Scouts dismissed her. 'The fact is the [Boy Scout] organization is still run by a lot of older folks who grew up in a time and culture where quite frankly this was not something that was discussed,' Mr Wahls said. On the Change.org web page hosting Tyrrell's petition, supporter James Dozier was one of several former scouts who posted comments critical of the anti-gay stance. 'It is stuff like this that really demeans all I worked for to become an Eagle Scout... I am so grateful for everything the Scouts taught me and I am proud about being an Eagle Scout, but this really diminishes everything I accomplished,' Dozier wrote. The BSA is one of the biggest U.S. youth organizations, claiming some 2.7 million youth members and over 1 million adult volunteers at the end of 2011. It was founded in 1910 as part of the international Scout movement established in Britain by General Robert Baden-Powell.

"Dowagen Queen Fabiola of Belgium is accused of trying to shield her fortune from the tax man . Belgium's Dowagen Queen Fabiola is accused of trying to shield her fortune from the tax man in a move that has provoked anger from the country's prime minister. The 84-year-old's inheritance plan has been widely seen as a tax dodge on a fortune amassed with taxpayer's money. In a rare rebuke of the Belgian monarchy, Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo told . parliament on Thursday that he 'shared' the strong emotions the scandal . had caused among ordinary citizens. He called the former queen's plan to create a private fund to deal with her inheritance ethically flawed even if it was strictly legal. 'Because of the position of Queen . Fabiola and the stipend annually provided by parliament, this fund . causes ethical problems,' he said. The Spanish-born Fabiola is the widow of the late King Baudouin, who died in 1993. His brother, King Albert II, is now on the throne. It was the latest in a series of scandals to embroil the Belgian monarchy, one of the few remaining symbols that unite this divided nation of 6.5 million Dutch-speakers Flemings and 4.5 million Francophones. Di Rupo said the queen had not told the government or the king about her plans, which broke in the media on Wednesday. While much of Europe wallows in a seemingly endless debt crisis, monarchies are often seen as living in the lap of luxury, feeding off annual public stipends while other families struggle. Experts say legal constructions like the queen's private fund would allow her to bequeath part of her fortune to relatives like nieces and nephews and to her favorite charity causes without having to pay the regular amount of taxes. Fabiola, who is childless, insisted in a statement that none of the money granted by the government - almost (euro) 1.5 million ($2 million) a year - would be used in the new fund, which would only include her private money. She said she spends the government stipend on 'housekeeping, of which the biggest part is staff wages.' Keenly aware of the economic crisis, King Albert II last year pledged to use part of his salary to help pay for the upkeep of his properties. The Dowagen Queen's tax dispute comes after a Christmas speech by the king that was widely seen as criticizing the biggest political party in Flanders, the right-wing N-VA, which wants to do away with the monarchy and break away from Belgium.

"Quit: Lollipop man Bob Slade, pictured today outside his house in . Plymouth, Devon, left his post after council bosses threatened him with a . suspension . A lollipop man has quit his post after he was threatened with suspension for high-fiving school children by council bosses. Bob Slade, 65, had been a crossing patrol supervisor outside the Manadon Vale primary school in Plymouth, Devon, for four-and-a-half years. But the former dockyard worker resigned after Plymouth City Council said he would be suspended for four weeks for high-fiving children - which they said was a safety concern. Mr Slade said: 'I really enjoyed the job. I have been doing it for more than four years without a single accident. 'I had to stop giving them high fives about a month before I resigned. 'The parents were all happy for me to do so and I would always ensure their safety but once the council told me I would be suspended, I thought it was best I resigned. ""They told me to be very friendly with the children when I first got the job, which I did.' The school is currently without a crossing patrol supervisor following Mr Slade’s departure.

Others posted their support on the internet. Jennie Wills posted: 'How ridiculous !!!! Our Lollypop Man is lovely all the kids love him.' Paddy Paddison posted: 'PCC once again showing that rigid adherence to rules is more important than people.

Mr Slade said he appreciates the support from parents, but would be unlikely to return to the role.

'The high-fives was one of a number of safety issues raised with the school crossing patrol before he made the decision to resign.

"They have been protesting about 'corporate greed' outside St Paul's Cathedral for weeks with an apparent goal to destroy capitalism. But it seems the Occupy London camp in the heart of the capital's financial district is having trouble controlling its own financial affairs. This week some demonstrators were accused of becoming 'elitist' with too much power over the group amid accusations of the misuse of funds. Allegations: Some demonstrators were accused of becoming 'elitist' with too much power over the group amid accusations of the misuse of funds . Claims: Some activists (none pictured) apparently regard themselves as 'more equal than others' and have been compared to the ruling elite satirised in George Orwell's famous Animal Farm . Some were said to regard themselves as 'more equal than others' and have been compared to the ruling elite satirised in George Orwell's famous Animal Farm. The allegations emerged as the demonstrators met for a meeting in Starbucks on Tuesday but argued about their pot of money and how and when it should be spent, The Times said. It led to rising tensions and members of the finance committee stepping down. One member, 25-year-old Tess Jones from New York was accused of using donations from the public to pay for flights to New York. She has vehemently denied the allegations as 'wild rumours' and has vowed to stay and help form an interim committee. 'Some are more equal than others': Animal Farm was a satirical account of the Russian Revolution and the Stalinist regime . An anonymous source told the newspaper two main leaders in their 40s and 50s and three people in their 20s were controlling the group and a charter had been drawn up giving power to very few people. Animal Farm by George Orwell was published in England on 17 August 1945. Orwell, a democratic socialist, retells the story of the emergence and development of Soviet communism up to and during the Stalin era before World War II. In the book the animals overthrow their human oppressors and establish a socialist state called Animal Farm which eventually collapses. The pigs, being the most intelligent animals in the group, take control of the planning and government of the farm and then declare themselves the decision-makers. Over the years they become more and more like humans. Eventually, the seven principles of Animalism, known as the Seven Commandments and inscribed on the side of the barn, become reduced to a single principle reading 'all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.' She said: 'We . are calling it the Animal Farm manifesto. The are always smartly . dressed. I don't know how they manage it when we are all camping and . they go off and have their secret meetings in Starbucks. In addition, she claimed: 'A small number . have decided they are more equal and are controlling the rest of us.' The source alleged the group had £21,000 in public donations two weeks ago but the leaders, who she said could sometimes be 'aggressive', had apparently said there was no more money for the food or 'tranquility' tent - in charge of welfare - and the legal team were banned from using taxis or buying stationery. She demanded to know where the 'missing' money had gone and said people were starting to leave as there wasn't enough food. In Orwell's 1945 novel, based on the Russian Revolution, the animals of Manor Farm overthrow the dictator farmer Mr Jones to establish a new regime based on communism. But the system fails as some of the . animals become ruthless dictators declaring that 'All animals are equal . but some are more equal than others'. The anti-capitalist protest at the . Cathedral is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to . highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy. Power: An anonymous source said two main leaders and three people in their 20s were controlling the group and a charter had been drawn up giving power to very few people . Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul's since October 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed. The Occupy London group say its aim is: 'A future free from austerity, growing . inequality, unemployment, tax injustice and a political elite who . ignores its citizens, and work towards concrete demands to be met.' Last month they took over an empty office building owned by investment bank UBS. It was the latest act of defiance from the group who said they would legally challenge 24-hour eviction legal notices pinned to their tents outside the Cathedral. The camp's presence has led to a humiliating internal row within the church which led to two high . profile resignations.","Some demonstrators accused of becoming 'elitist' with too much power .

"An immigration computer database is being set up to track down the 150,000 people who are staying in Britain illegally, it was revealed yesterday. Border chiefs are due to launch the project next month to deal with the huge backlog of foreign nationals who have overstayed their student or temporary work visas. Letters will be sent to those in the 'migration refusal pool' warning that they will be deported and barred from entering the UK if they do not leave within 28 days. Thousands of 'overstayers': An immigration database is being set up to track down 150,000 people living in Britain illegally such as this Pakistani man who was arrested for the third time in Walworth, South London . Private companies currently tendering for the multi-million pound contract include G4S, the controversial security firm which failed to deliver enough staff for the Olympic Games. Passenger records held in the e-borders database, which covers details of all flights outside Europe to and from Britain, will be checked and there will be careful monitoring of the 100 immigrants whose visas expire daily. It comes after it was revealed last month that 40 per cent of immigrants who have been refused leave to stay in the country have not been sent the forms demanding they leave. Reduce backlog: Immigration Minister Damian Green said warning sent to immigrants when their visa expires will reduce numbers who decide to overstay . Tens of thousands of these lapsed visa cases date back more than five years and are a legacy of Labour's catastrophic mismanagement of Britain's immigration system. Immigration minister Damian Green said he hoped the new scheme would allow Border Agency staff more time to carry out enforcement operations and reduce the backlog. He said: 'We're concentrating much more on enforcement. From debrief interviews we've found that a third of people decide to overstay at the point their visa expires. 'If we can send these people letters warning of the consequences of illegally overstaying then I'm sure we can reduce the total number deciding to remain.' The move follows a UKBA summer-long drive to remove visa 'overstayers' that has led to thousands being removed, with 2,000 of those being in London alone. The majority of those targeted entered the country on student visas which have now expired. Mr Green said they mainly came from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Brazil and Nigeria and were now working illegally. An operation in the capital yesterday resulted in three arrests. Two Pakistani nationals and an Iranian man were arrested in Walworth and Brixton, South London, for allegedly working illegally. One 28-year-old Iranian was arrested by the same immigration officer at a Halal butchers three years ago. Another Pakistani man smirked as he was led away in handcuffs in what was his third arrest by UKBA staff. Working illegally: This Pakistani man was arrested by border police from the A.M. Halal Butchers in Brixton, South London where he was allegedly working illegally . The chief inspector of immigration, John Vine, criticised the UKBA for not having a strategy for reducing the pool of overstayers last month. The only guidance staff were given for dealing with cases in this 150,000-strong group was that the total size of the pool should not be allowed to increase. Vine said his greatest concern during his inspection of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight immigration team was over the '150,000-plus cases nationally that are sitting in a migration refusal pool'. The chief inspector concluded that UKBA staff reported it being impossible to know whether the 150,000 were still in Britain or had left voluntarily. Arrested before: This Iranian man was arrested at the same Brixton butchers. He has been detained at least once before, three years ago by the same border officer seen here . In total, the UKBA faces an enormous backlog of 276,000 immigration cases. The growing total includes asylum seekers, foreign criminals and illegal migrants and is equivalent to the population of Newcastle. MPs sitting on the Commons Home Affairs Committee said the UK has become a 'Bermuda Triangle' for migrants, a country where it is 'easy to get in, but impossible to keep track of everyone, let alone get them out.' In addition, around 21,000 new asylum cases have built up because officials were able to process only 63 per cent of last year's applications. There are also 3,900 foreign criminals living in the community and free to commit more crimes, including more than 800 who have been at large for five years or more. Equivalent to Newcastle: The Border Agency faces a backlog of 276,000 immigration cases - equivalent to Newcastle's population .","The project is to launch next month to deal with the huge backlog of foreign nationals who have overstayed their student or temporary work visas .

"Troy Davis, who is set to be executed by lethal injection tomorrow night, has lost a bid for clemency launched by his defence lawyers who said he was wrongly convicted of killing a police officer. Georgia's board of pardons rejected the last-minute plea even after it attracted high-profile support, and his execution will go ahead as planned. It was the last hope for the 42-year-old, who was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989. Anti-death penalty activists, who also claim Davis was wrongly convicted, chanted and held banners through Atlanta last week. It is the fourth time in four years his execution has been scheduled by Georgia officials. Scroll down for video . Conviction: Troy Davis, left, is set to be executed by lethal injection on Wednesday after he was convicted of killing police officer Mark MacPhail, right, who was shot dead in Savannah, Georgia, in 1989 . Peace: Police officer Mark MacPhail MacPhail's mother Anneliese MacPhail remains convinced Davis is guilty . Steve Hayes, spokesman for the Board . of Pardons and Paroles, said the panel decided to rejected Davis' request for clemency after hearing hours of testimony from his . supporters and prosecutors. Troy Davis was convicted of the August 19, 1989, murder of Georgia police officer Mark MacPhail, who was working as a security guard at a Burger King when he intervened in an argument between several men in a nearby parking lot. He was shot in the heart and face without having drawn his gun. One of the men, Sylvester Coles, went to police and implicated Davis in the killing, and he was arrested four days later. During Davis’ 1991 trial, many witnesses testified they had seen Davis shoot MacPhail. Two others testified that Davis had confessed the murder to them. The murder weapon was never found, and no physical evidence linked Davis to the crime. Throughout his trial and subsequent appeals, Davis has maintained his innocence but was sentenced to death in August 1991. Seven of nine witnesses to the . murder changed or . recanted their testimony in recent years. Several stated they had felt pressure by police to implicate Davis. New witnesses implicated Coles in the crime. Many appeals in state and federal courts followed. Davis and his lawyers argued that the racial composition of the jury and poor advocacy from his lawyers had affected his right to a fair trial. In an August 2010 decision, the conviction was upheld, with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia declaring that the new evidence cast only 'minimal doubt on his conviction'. Subsequent appeals, including to the Supreme Court, were rejected. In July 2007, September 2008, and October 2008, execution dates were scheduled but stayed shortly before the events took place. The decision appeared to leave Davis . with little chance of avoiding the execution date. Defence attorney . Jason Ewart has said that the pardons board was likely Davis' last . option. His lawyers have long argued Davis . was a victim of mistaken identity. But prosecutors say they have no . doubt that they charged the right person with the crime. MacPhail's relatives said they were relieved by the decision. 'That's what we wanted, and that's . what we got,' said Anneliese MacPhail, the victim's mother. 'We wanted . to get it over with, and for him to get his punishment.' 'Justice was finally served for my father,' said Mark MacPhail Jr, who . was an infant when his father was gunned down. 'The truth was finally . heard.' Kim Davis, the inmate's sister, declined immediate comment on the decision. Amnesty International USA director Larry Cox said in a statement that the decision was 'unconscionable'. 'Should Troy Davis be executed, . Georgia may well have executed an innocent man and in so doing . discredited the justice system,' Mr Cox said.- but Mr MacPhail’s mother . Anneliese remains convinced Davis is guilty. She said the upcoming execution of her son's 'killer' will bring her peace. ‘I will never have closure,’ Ms MacPhail told CNN. ‘But I may have some peace when he is executed.’ The case has captured international attention because of concerns about the quality of evidence involved in Davis’s conviction - but Ms MacPhail said she has ‘never had any doubts’ it was him. ‘I think these people are just against the death penalty,’ she told CNN, of the many protesters who claim to be worried the state will put an innocent man to death. ‘They don't know what happened.’ Georgia's Board of Pardons and Paroles is expected to meet on Monday to consider whether to stop Davis' execution by lethal injection, which is scheduled for next Wednesday. Marching army: Thousands gathered in Atlanta, Georgia, to protest the pending execution on Wednesday of Troy Davis, who they say was wrongly convicted of killing a Savannah police officer in 1989 . Crowds: Thousands gathered in downtown Atlanta to protest the pending execution on Wednesday . ‘I pray that this rally will have an . impact on Pardons and Paroles,’ said marcher Solana Plaines, of . Savannah, Georgia. ‘I hope they will do the right thing.’ Davis declined to order a special last . meal. He will be served what's on the menu at the Georgia state prison . in Jackson before his execution on Wednesday - grilled cheeseburger, . oven-browned potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw, cookies and a grape . beverage. Davis's supporters say there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime and that key witnesses in his trial have since recanted their testimony. ‘You just can't give up hope,’ said Ellen Kubica, who travelled all the way from her home in Germany to attend Friday's event, which featured banners reading: ‘Too much doubt to execute.’ Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march. Reverend Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and television show host, also attended. Anger: Reverend Al Sharpton speaks to a standing-room only crowd during a prayer service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, in support of death row inmate Troy Davis . Megaphone: Martin Luther King III, son of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, joined the march . ‘The only thing left to decide is whether you have the courage to do the right thing,’ he said of the parole board. ‘It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row.’ 'The only thing left to decide is whether you have the courage to do the right thing. It is blatantly clear that there is no reason for this man to be sitting on death row' Reverend Al Sharpton . In a rare move, the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2009 ordered a new hearing for Davis to assess what he said was new evidence showing his innocence. The justices transferred the case to a U.S. District Court in Georgia for a hearing and determination of his claims that new witnesses will clearly establish his innocence. A year later, the judge, William T. Moore Jr, rejected Davis' claims of innocence. But on Thursday, supporters of Davis delivered petitions with more than 600,000 names to the parole board. New York: Demonstrators gather near Times Square in Manhattan to protest the execution of Davis on Friday . Message: A woman holds a sign at a protest outside President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters in Chicago, one of 300 rallies held worldwide on Friday, ahead of a last-ditch parole board hearing for Davis . In a column last week in the Atlanta Journal Constitution, former FBI Director William Sessions called for Davis's sentence to be commuted to life in prison, saying the case was 'permeated in doubt'. However in an opposing column written in late 2008 and republished on Thursday, Spencer Lawton, the district attorney who prosecuted Davis, said the condemned man had a fair trial. The claim that seven witnesses at the trial had subsequently recanted their testimony was ‘not believable’, Lawton wrote - and he denied any witnesses had been coerced by police.

"An increasing number of British women are travelling to war-torn Syria to marry jihadists from the UK, with some seeing them as leading a ‘perfect life’. Many are thought to be marrying jihadists on the internet, as strict Islamic code forbids unmarried women to travel alone, according to researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College, London. Exact numbers are difficult to pinpoint, but the research centre believes that dozens of British women have married English-speaking jihadists – or are trying to - according to chatter that it monitors on forums. Abdul Waheed Majeed, left, is thought to be the first British suicide bomber in Syria, while the picture on the right is thought to show at least two British extremists fighting in the Middle East country, where an increasing number of British women are flocking . The explosion from the truck bomb driven by Abdul Waheed Majeed . Charged: British student Nawal Msaad, 26, is accused of trying to smuggle £16,500 in her underwear to terrorists fighting in Syria . It knows of two women from Portsmouth, one from London and one from Surrey who definitely have married English-speaking men fighting for opposition forces. It said that one is a convert and that two were married prior to departure, with the other two marrying on arrival in Syria. Women from other countries have also gone to Syria to be with jihadists - two from France, who both married jihadists before they left for the war, one from Sweden, one from Serbia, one from the Philippines and one from Germany. What gives away the women’s intentions are the questions they pose to the fighters. Researcher Shiraz Maher told The Times: ‘The thing that is interesting is the staggering extent to which so many women are asking questions. We think it is pretty significant.’ One woman asked British jihadist Abu Abdullah al-Britani: ‘How can a sister ask you for marriage? What are your standards? Are you interested after asking Allah, of course.’ Charles Lister, from the Brookings Institute, said that many women view jihadists in Syria as living the ‘perfect life’. The revelation follows the court appearance in January of Nawal Msaad, 26, a student accused of trying to smuggle £16,000 in her underwear to terrorists fighting in Syria. Nawal Msaad, 26, and her alleged co-conspirator Amal Elwahabi, 27, are the first British women charged with terror offences over the conflict. Msaad, an undergraduate from Holloway, North London, was arrested at  Heathrow as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul with 20,000 euros wrapped in cling film in her knickers. Hours later, police swooped on Elwahabi, who stands jointly accused of being part of an arrangement in which money was made available for the purposes of terrorism. The court heard that the two Britons attempted to send the bundle of rolled-up notes to a suspected British jihadist fighting in Syria’s civil war. The head of the Counter Terrorism Command, Richard Walton, said several teenagers had been enticed to join jihadists fighting in the war-torn country, as he warned that the conflict posed a growing threat to national security. Earlier in January, two 17-year-old girls from London and West Yorkshire were held at Heathrow as they were boarding a flight to Istanbul. Officers spent five days quizzing the girls before releasing them without charge. But Mr Walton said that other ‘boys and girls’ were being lured to join rebel forces fighting in Syria. He said the numbers of Syria-related terror arrests had soared, with 14 in the first three weeks of this year – more than half the total for the whole of 2013. He said: ‘We’ve had a number of teenagers both from London and nationally who’ve been attempting to go to Syria. That’s boys and girls, unfortunately. ‘It’s not just the odd one. It’s shocking that they are such young people.’","Dozens of British women are thought to have travelled to Syria to marry .

"The Supreme Court has overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital after being convinced that his children were not biologically his own. A total of $1.8 million worth of estate was left to the Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Fund by the man, who died in June 2012 and was also known to have repeatedly accused his neighbour of poisoning his plants, according to the Supreme Court judgement. After one of his daughters challenged the will, the court heard that the father-of-three who emigrated from Italy, was often 'aggressive' and 'hysterical' and suffered from a 'delusional illness' which worsened from 1998 onwards. The Supreme Court of South Australia overturned the will of a deceased man who left his entire estate to a hospital . His children recounted to Justice Tom Gray how the 82-year-old often accused his wife of being unfaithful to him and on one occasion, alleged she had been a prostitute and engaged in incest. In 2000, the judgement records that his wife underwent a lie detector test at the man's insistence, which she passed. 'The deceased said that these results indicated that the person that administered the test was either Dutch or German, and falsified the results of the test as a sign of ethnic unity with his wife, who was born in Germany,' Justice Gray revealed in his final decision. He had also requested toothbrushes and hair samples from his children on several occasions, before claiming they would be used in DNA sample tests to prove that they were not his biological offspring. Justice Tom Gray said in his decision that the man appeared to have 'suffered from delusions at the time that he made the alleged will' after hearing that he accused his neighbour of poisoning his plants despite his security camera's showing no evidence. He also accused his wife of being unfaithful and subjected her to a lie detector test . Paranoia was also evident in the deceased's accusations against his former neighbour, who he insisted was poisoning his plants even after relocating to a new home. The allegations continued even after the surveillance camera's he had installed around his home failed to detect any such behaviour. In the ruling published earlier this month, Justice Gray wrote that while, 'the deceased's will, on its face, appears to be properly executed' the evidence presented 'raises a suspicion that the deceased suffered from delusions at the time that he made the alleged will, and that these delusions influenced his testamentary intentions'. A settlement was reached between the hospital and the man's children that would see only $200,000 remain with the Royal Adelaide Hospital while $85,000 was awarded to his granddaughter and the remainder split between his three children.

"Way back when, relationships and friendships between co-workers were, not so common, a majority instead opting for the more professional dealings with their colleagues. But it seems times have changed and in a big way, as our private and professional lives become more intertwined, social media taking down the barriers as we connect with colleagues both online and offline outside of work. A nation wide survey by jobs platform OneShift has found that a vast majority of Australian workers now don't actually mind being friends with workers on social media. It found 79 per cent thought it was appropriate to be friends with their co-workers on Facebook and Instagram. A nationwide survey found 79 per cent thought it was appropriate to be friends with their co-workers on Facebook and Instagram . Majority of people are becoming friends with colleagues at work . Surprisingly, the majority, 63 per cent,  said this did not affect what they posted about or the photos they shared, even if they weren't so work appropriate. 63 per cent, said having colleagues on social media did not affect what they posted about or the photos they shared . 'I think people are connecting in different ways,' said founder and CEO of Oneshift's Gen George. 'Back then, there were no smart phones or social media but now it's normal for people to skype, have 24/7 instant chats which allows for a lot faster pace environment.' 'It's not your usual 9 to 5 job anymore.' Ms George says 20 years ago the norm was people going to work, seeing their colleagues and then going home, living a very separate work life and personal life, but now everything is integrated. 'The more you look at Gen Y people, they are receptive to putting things on line,' she said. 'It's acceptable growing up with the connection of social media, colleagues have a different perception when they haven’t grown up with it.' But our affection for our colleagues extends far beyond social media with 64 per cent also saying they socialise with their co-workers outside of work. 'We are spending more time with colleagues and becoming more part of their life, we're embracing it.' And while there was always the advice of not 'going there' while at work, it seems in many instances, affections between colleagues have become more than just platonic. More than 40 per cent have admitted to dating a co-worker and the good news for those wanting to jump into a work romance, it's been found you won't be judged too harshly among your work peers. Almost 80 per cent of those surveyed said they wouldn't feel uncomfortable if two of their colleagues were dating, although 10 per cent said they kept a long relationship with a colleague secret.

A group of work mates getting together to run a marathon. Some workplaces feel creating friends at work means people want to come to work more because they enjoy it . It was also found more than 6 in 10 Australian workers like to have a drink with their colleagues. Ms George, said the strong relationships formed at work are an inevitable result of a new work culture that no longer recognises the separation of our work life from our private life, but that this shouldn’t be viewed negatively. 'If someone is expected to respond to emails on their smartphone or the company’s social media channel at 10.30 at night, then the office has already invaded the home,' she said. 'It’s no surprise then that with those walls breaking down, we’re more comfortable socialising with colleagues outside of work, whether that’s online, at the local pub or cinema after work, or at the beach on the weekend.' And while some would be hesitant to get too involved with their co-workers, Ms George says a more social workplace should be encouraged. 'Work life balance is key, but that concept is taking on a new meaning today. It’s all part of the attitude of working to live, rather than living to work.' 'You should love what you do, and enjoy the people you work with. Rather than aiming for that distinct separation of the two, we should be looking at how work fits into the rest of your life.'

'The friendships you have with your colleagues are important not only to your own success, but to the success of the business and should be encouraged by employers,' said Ms George. Jane Lu, Founder of Showpo Fashion says her team at work are all Facebook friends. 'Our team supports everyone with extra curriculum lifestyles, we have nothing to hide form each other,' she said. She says most people these days are well aware of what to post and what not to post. 'I think you'd have to be stupid to chuck a sickie and post that you're on the beach.' With a small team of eight, she says that gets along so well people want to come to work, because otherwise they are creating more work for other people. The Showpo Fashion team even plan and take holidays together and spend plenty of time out of work hanging out. 'Have Friday night drinks every week, holidays together, get togethers, it's important we have good relationships at work.'

"In trouble: Sgt Gary Stein is facing dismissal from the Marines after saying he wouldn't follow orders from Obama . An American Marine sergeant who started a Facebook group that is openly critical of President Barack Obama is facing possible dismissal from the Corps. Sgt Gary Stein - a Camp Pendleton Marine who started the Facebook page called Armed Forces Tea Party -  has been told that he is in violation of Pentagon policy barring troops from political activities. Sgt Stein, who has been in the Corps for nine years, said he started the page to encourage fellow service members to exercise their free speech rights. As well as posting comments saying he will not follow the unlawful orders of Obama - the commander in chief - he also criticised Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. The Marine Corps said that Stein's commanding officer ordered a preliminary inquiry on March 8 after receiving allegations that Stein posted the political statements violating the Pentagon's directives. 'After reviewing the findings of the preliminary inquiry, the commander decided to address the allegations through administrative action,' the Corps said. Sgt Stein said he planned to fight the charges. He had applied to extend his service, which was set to expire in a few months. He added: 'I'm completely shocked that this is happening.' 'I've done nothing wrong. I've only stated what our oath states that I will defend the constitution and that I will not follow unlawful orders. If that's a crime, what is America coming to?' In a statement on the Armed Forces Tea Party page this morning, he added: . 'If I am guilty of anything it would be that I am American, a freedom . loving Conservative, hell bent on defending the constitution and . preserving Americas greatness. Critical: The military has had a policy since the Civil War of restricting the free speech of servicemen, including criticism of the commander in chief . 'I am no more the Leader of the Armed . Forces Tea Party than any other of 18,000 members are. I just happen to . be normal guy who started a Facebook page and who hold the Tea Party . values close my heart and believes the Tea Party can enact real change . in this country.' In addition to being discharged, Sgt Stein said he would have his rank reduced to lance corporal if he is proven to be in violation. He said he was removed from his job at the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in San Diego yesterday and given a desk job with no access to computers. According to Pentagon directives, military personnel in uniform cannot sponsor a political club, participate in any TV or radio program or group discussion that advocates for or against a political party, candidate or cause, or speak at any event promoting a political movement. Defensive: Sgt Stein says he did not mean to be . 'disrespectful' but he believes Obama's policies are 'crippling this . country' Commissioned officers also may not use contemptuous words against senior officials, including the defense secretary or the president. Sgt Stein was first cautioned by his superiors at Camp Pendleton in 2010, after he launched his Facebook page and criticised Obama's health care overhaul. He volunteered to take down the page while he reviewed the rules at the request of his superiors. He concluded he was not in violation and relaunched the page. Last week, he said his superiors told him he could not use social media sites on government computers after he posted the message stating he would not follow the president's unlawful orders. Stein said his statement was part of an online debate about NATO allowing U.S. troops to be tried for the Quran burnings in Afghanistan. Profile: Sgt. Stein says he is a Conservative blogger and . speaker but adds he does not 'represent the views of the United States Armed . Forces' In that context, he said, he was stating that he would not follow orders from the president if those orders included detaining U.S. citizens, disarming them or doing anything else that he believes would violate their constitutional rights. Another Marine alerted his command about the statement, Sgt Stein said. He said he respects the office of the president, but he does not agree with Obama's policies. He said he is within his rights to speak up. The Marine Corps said Sgt Stein is allowed to express his personal opinions as long as they do not give the impression he is speaking in his official capacity as a Marine.

"Joe Biden made another gaffe on the campaign trail on Wednesday by mistaking what century it was less than 24 hours after his 'put y'all back in chains' race-baiting caused uproar. Biden seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s when he told a Virginia crowd: 'Folks, where's it written we cannot lead the world in the 20th century in making automobiles?' In a statement to the Weekly Standard, Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams was quick to take a jab at Biden. Williams said: 'Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will ensure America leads the world in the 21st century by strengthening middle-class families and creating jobs. Scroll down for video . Standing by his VP: President Obama, pictured on Wednesday during a campaign stop in Davenport, Iowa, defended Biden and clarified the comments . Gaffe: Biden, pictured on August 14, sparked outrage with his 'put y'all back in chains' speech . 'President Obama and Vice President Biden have taken our nation backward with failed policies that have resulted in higher unemployment, more debt, and a weaker economy. A campaign based on rage and divisiveness can't hide the president's failed record.' Even as he's faced with a chorus of Republican uproar, President Obama is standing by his man. The commander-in-chief fended off criticism of Joe Biden after the vice president declared during a campaign stop on Tuesday that Obama's opponent Mitt Romney wanted to 'put ya'll back in chains.' Hours after those comment hit the airwaves, Republicans came out in force to suggest that it might be time for the president to put the 69-year-old Biden out to pasture. Among them was former Alaska Gov Sarah Palin, who went so far as to propose that Biden should be replaced with Hillary Clinton if Obama wants to be re-elected. Speaking on Wednesday, Obama clarified Biden’s remarks, telling People magazine that he meant consumers would be worse off if the GOP succeeded in doing away with new restraints on financial institutions. ""In no sense was he trying to connote something other than that,"" Obama said. In Iowa for a bus tour, Obama said the reaction to Biden's remarks was a function of politics, but he did not blame him. Backlash: Sarah Palin called Biden's remark 'disgusting' 'The truth is that during the course of these campaigns, folks like to get obsessed with how something was phrased even if everybody personally understands that's not how it was meant,' Obama told the magazine. He added: 'That's sort of the nature of modern campaigns and modern coverage of campaigns. But I tell you, when I'm traveling around Iowa, that's not what's on people's minds.' On Tuesday in Danville, Virginia, Biden told a crowd: ‘'He [Romney] said in the first 100 days he’s going to let the big banks write their own rules, unchain Wall Street.' Before an audience that included hundreds of black people, Biden added: 'They're going to put y’all back in chains.' Palin, who was John McCain’s running mate during his failed presidential bid in 2008, called the quote 'disgusting.' Shake up: Sarah Palin has said Obama should replace Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton as vice president . Swap: Palin suggested that Obama, pictured at a campaign stop on Tuesday in Iowa, replace Biden with his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, right . She suggested that the Obama campaign would be much better off if it dumped Biden for Hillary Clinton. Palin told Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday: 'The strategists there in the Obama campaign have got to look at a diplomatic way of replacing Joe Biden on the ticket with Hillary... Joe Biden really drags down that ticket.' She added that she hoped Obama would not take such a step because ‘an Obama/Clinton ticket would have a darn good chance of winning.' Palin was joined by another prominent Republican, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who questioned the vice president’s 'mental capacity.' Giuliani told CNBC: 'I've never seen a vice president that has made as many mistakes, said as many stupid things.' Questions: Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has called Biden 'not very bright' in life of his recent gaffes . 'I mean, there’s a real fear if, God forbid, he ever had to be entrusted with the presidency, whether he really has the mental capacity to handle it. 'I mean, this guy just isn’t bright. He’s never been bright. He isn’t bright. And people think, “Well, he just talks a little too much.” Actually he’s just not very smart.' There is, however, very little chance that Obama would drop Biden as his running mate and it is doubtful that Clinton would even want the job. Even as Obama stuck up for his No. 2, it didn’t stop Biden from making yet another gaffe on the campaign trail. He's at it again: Biden made another gaffe on Wednesday when he told a Virginia crowd when he seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s . January 2012: . During  speech at a manufacturing plant in New Hampshire the vice . president spoke about outsourcing to India and put on a bad Indian . accent while asking 'How many times do you get the call, 'I like to talk . to you about your credit card.'December 2010: . During the swearing in of a Republican Senator Mark Kirk in Congress, . Biden told the Capitol Hill newcomer to put that hand on the Bible and . raise his left.  According to the congressional rulebook, it should have . been the other way round.March 2010: . He dropped the F-bomb during the signing of the administration’s . historic health reforms, apparently unaware that the microphones would . catch him out when he whispered into the President’s ear immediately . before the announcement, declaring: 'This is a big f****** deal!'March 2010: . Mr Biden said 'God rest her soul' in reference to the mother of Irish . Prime Minister Brian Cowen. Mr Cowen's mother is alive; his father had . died. Realising his misstep, he corrected with: 'God bless her soul'.October 2008: . Speaking in Athens, Ohio about John McCain's economic strategy, he . said: 'Look, John's last-minute economic plan does nothing to tackle the . number-one job facing the middle class, and it happens to be, as Barack . says, a three-letter word: jobs. J-O-B-S, jobs.'September 2008: . During a political rally in Missouri, he urged wheelchair-bound state . senator Chuck Graham to rise and be recognised, saying: 'Stand up, . Chuck, let 'em see ya.' Realizing his mistake, he said: ‘Oh, God love . you… what am I talking about?’September 2008: . After he was named the vice presidential nominee, he addressed a crowd . in Nashua, New Hampshire, questioning how he beat out Hillary Clinton: . 'Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice . president of the United States of America,' he said in New Hampshire. 'Quite frankly it might have been a better pick than me.'August 2008: . He also mixed up Barack Obama’s name at his first campaign rally with . the president, introducing him as: 'A man I'm proud to call my friend. A . man who will be the next President of the United States - Barack . America!'","Biden makes another mistake in a speech to a Virginia crowd, apparently mistaking this century for the 1900s .

"Lifting 4kg dumb bells and heavy weights for two hours a day would be an impressive fitness regime for an adult. But the gruelling sessions are in actual fact exercises for a pair of Romanian brothers who part of a family dubbed 'The Hercules'. Giuliano Stroe, aged nine, and his seven-year-old brother Claudiu hit the headlines as they trained to be the world's strongest boys in a family of bodybuilders.

"Car giant General Motors have been forced to pull an advert after its jingle - which claimed that Chinese people sing 'ching-ching, chop suey' - was accused of being racist. In a humiliating u-turn, the company has removed the advert from worldwide markets after it referred to China as 'the land of Fu Manchu'. The advert was promoting the Chevrolet Trax SUV, and had been aired in Canada since the beginning of April. The advert for the Chevrolet Trax SUV disappeared from Canadian TV screens about a week ago, and was replaced with a new ad without lyrics . It had been posted to Chevrolet’s European website too - but has now disappeared from Canadian TV screens and replaced with an edited version without the offensive lyrics. A company spokesman blamed 'negative feedback' in response to the lyrics . A spokesman told the South China Morning Post: 'Once the issue was called to our attention, GM immediately removed the offensive content from the commercial' 'As the goal of advertising is to engage an audience and draw their attention to a featured product and it is never our intention to offend the audience, we made a decision to edit the advertisement.' General Motors have been forced to pull the advert after they received 'negative feedback' for their offensive jingle . The video with the lyrics have now been erased from websites across the internet. The TV advert, called 'After Midnight', features the song Booty Swing by Austrian musician Parov Stelar. The lyrics on the offending advertisement say: 'Now, in the land of Fu Manchu, The girls all now do the Suzie-Q, Clap their hands in the centre of the floor, Saying ""ching-ching, chop suey, swing some more"".' The Trax is in the process of being launched in various markets worldwide, excluding America. It is already on sale in South Korea and will soon be made available in Europe and Canada. Last month the car manufacturer announced plans to launch 17 new or updated models in China, the Economic Times reported. China is the world's largest car consumer, and GM is keen to begin capitalising on the country's luxury auto market.","The advert was promoting the Chevrolet Trax SUV with offensive jingle .

"Attack: Miriam Margolyes blasted the English class system after become an Australian citizen . One of Britain’s most respected and enduring actresses launched a stinging attack on the English class system... and added insult to injury by becoming an Australian citizen. BAFTA-winning star Miriam Margolyes criticised her native land for its lack of energy and optimism after a citizenship ceremony presided over by Australian prime minister Julia Gillard. She said: 'I don’t like class distinction and there is far too much of that in England. 'There’s an energy here - an optimism, a vitality. I think England doesn’t have that any more. There’s an irony and not accepting bull**** and I love that, that straight-talking stuff.' Miss Margolyes, 71, took a pledge of allegiance to Australia with 100 other people at a ceremony in Canberra on Saturday, which was Australia Day. The actress, best known for playing Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films between 2002 and 2011, has divided her life between homes in London and Robertson, New South Wales, for years as her partner, Heather, is Australian. Mrs Gillard told the audience at her citizenship ceremony: 'This is your new country, and you’ll never want another. Welcome to citizenship. Welcome to Australia. Welcome home.' Miss Margolyes, who was awarded an OBE for services to drama in 2001, will also keep her British citizenship. Explaining her decision to seek dual nationality, she said: 'My partner of 44 years is Australian and she is the main reason for becoming Australian - because I want to be closer to her. BAFTA-winner: Miss Margolyes in  Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets . 'We met in 1968 in London when she was on a research trip to London. Being in Australia makes me happy, my partner is Australian and my home is in Australia and it’s ridiculous not to be Australian - it’s a logical step to take. 'I think I should be described as 'bi'- not bisexual because I’m not - I’m gay - but 'binational' because I retain British nationality and I add to it being Australian, which is like having your cake and eating it.' Despite her attack on the British class system, Miss Margolyes said she still considers herself to be British as well as Australian because of her English accent. She said: 'I am not the sort of person who divests myself of everything that came before I came to Australia. 'I want to take all the knowledge and experiences I gained when I was in England and put it at the service of Australia, because I have to bring something to Australia, not just money but myself. Expat: Miss Margolyes was awarded an OBE for services to drama in 2001 . 'It would be absurd to say I’m not British - you can hear it when I speak.' Born in Oxford, Miss Margolyes started her acting career in the 1962 Cambridge Footlights comedy group alongside future Monty Python stars John Cleese and Graham Chapman. She won the BAFTA for best supporting actress for the 1993 Martin Scorsese film The Age of Innocence. In 2008, she revealed her anguish that revealing she was gay led to her mother having a severe stroke, saying: 'I spoke to her about an affair with a woman and three days later she had this stroke. 'I realised it was a mistake on my behalf. It was an indulgence of me to tell her that.'","Miss Margolyes criticised UK after citizenship ceremony .

"Chinese tourists are expected to flock to Thailand later this week to celebrate Chinese New Year. But far from welcoming the holidaymakers, the Thai tourist board will be handing out etiquette manuals outlining how the holidaymakers are expected to behave, following complaints by locals. The Tourist Authority of Thailand estimates that at least 90,000 tourists will arrive from China this week and has prepared leaflets to hand out as they touch down. The Thai tourism office plans to distribute etiquette leaflets to all Chinese tourists visiting the country . The manual, written in Mandarin, advises against using public property as lavatories and contains general instructions on how to responsibly tour the country. Traditionally Chiang Mai and nearby Chiang Rai in the north-east are the biggest draw for Chinese tourists. But the holidaymakers have become the target of numerous complaints, with locals accusing them of defecating in public places, causing traffic accidents with reckless driving and defacing tourist attractions. Chinese tourists were recently banned  from even entering Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai, after complaints that they had ruined the toilets. Chalermchai Kositpipat, who owns the White Temple, ordered staff to bar visitors following the incident. Following complaints from Chinese tourists the ban was lifted on the understanding that tour guides are clean toilets if their clients make a mess. Chinese tourists were banned recently from Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai . Photos of a Chinese tourist who draped her underwear on chairs at Chiang Mai airport, outraging fellow travellers, also caused a stir on social media at the beginning of the month, and Thai tourism authorities have asked tour operators to clamp down on inappropriate behaviour. The guide produced by Thailand focuses on respecting local cultures, keeping with the local traffic laws, and observing museum etiquette such as not touching paintings. In response to the tales of recent embarrassing Chinese tourist behaviour the state-owned China Central Television has also aired TV programs aiming to educate Chinese tourists about international etiquette and expectations from countries visited. A Chinese tourist incurred the wrath of fellow travellers earlier this month by draping her underwear in Chiang Mai airport as she waited for a flight . Thailand government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd urged Thailand citizens to extend patience towards their visitors over the next few days. It's not the first time a country has had to produce a guide to tourist etiquette: Thailand's Embassy in Japan posted an online manners guide aimed at Thai visitors to its country following complaints about the behaviour of Thai visitors to Japan last year. The Thai embassy's consular chief penned a list of 10 do's and don'ts including 'Do not use your chopsticks to pick up food for other people'; 'If driving, stop for pedestrians at crosswalks' and 'Just because you have kids doesn't mean you can cut the queue'.","Etiquette leaflet will be distributed among visiting Chinese .

"British taxpayers are forking out almost £1million a year for pregnant Polish women to go home and give birth in their native country, it emerged yesterday. Under European Union rules, set up to provide emergency healthcare between member states, hundreds of Polish women are returning to their families to have their children, with the NHS picking up the bill. Last year around 500 Poles living in the UK went back to their native land to give birth. Britain picks up the bill for healthcare in other EEA states when patients have arranged treatment with an E112 form (file photo) Patients who pay tax and live in the UK can go to another EEA country or Switzerland for treatment paid for by the NHS (file photo) Given that the average cost to the NHS . per birth is £1,631, Polish births alone cost the British taxpayer . around £850,000 in 2012. The situation has become more acute . following the influx of immigrants into the UK from Eastern Europe over . the past decade. Under EU regulations, anyone who comes to Britain to . earn a living can fill in an S2 or E112 form, which entitles them to . free treatment in any other member state or Switzerland. The same applies to British women living in a European state. Latest figures reveal that there were . 1,132 cases last year where Britain paid for treatment in European . Economic Area countries or Switzerland. Some 995 cases, or around 90 per . cent, related to maternity care. Of these, 519 were for treatment in . Polish hospitals, with 174 cases in France and 90 in Germany. There were . 74 cases in Slovakia, 49 in the Czech Republic and 21 in Hungary. Romanian hospitals claimed for 18, Lithuania for 12, four from Bulgaria and one claim from Latvia. The figures are more than double that of 2010 when just 442 of the 1,498 cases related to maternity care.

Gerard Batten, UKIP spokesman on home . affairs, said: ‘This is yet another example of how membership of the EU . means the UK public purse is being plundered. People fleece us for . whatever they can get. Unfortunately all these things are totally legal. We can only put a stop to it by leaving the EU.’ To obtain an E112 form, an NHS consultant must first agree that treatment abroad is right for the patient. The patient must also gain approval from the local health authority and the Department of Health. Patients are treated under the same . care conditions as residents of the country they go to. In nations where . state healthcare is not free, the patient may have to pay a percentage . of the cost. Tory MP Chris Skidmore said: ‘When this scheme was set up it was meant to cover for emergency treatment. ‘This particular EU area should be renegotiated when the Prime Minister sets out a repatriation of powers.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: . ‘Under EU rules, anyone working and paying tax where they are living, . including Britons living abroad, can request treatment in another EU . country. ‘This is particularly common in maternity cases where some people prefer to be around family and friends.’","Britain spent £2million last year on treatment in other EEA countries .

There were 519 cases in Poland last year, 174 in France and 90 in Germany .
E112 form means NHS pays for those who pay tax in UK to go abroad .
We would like to make clear that the cost of £1m has been calculated on the assumption that the cost billed to the NHS of a birth in Poland under the E112/S2 scheme is the same or similar to the average cost of a birth in the UK which is £1,631 ."
"A paramedic who wrote abusive comments on Facebook about an NHS campaigner, whose mother who died at Stafford Hospital, has been suspended. Roy Guest, 51, was told he could not work for a year after posting ‘offensive’ remarks about whistle-blower Julie Bailey's late mother, Bella, who died while being cared for at the scandal-hit institution. One of the many comments he posted on the social media page stated: ‘I hope you suffer a life threatening illness...’ Paramedic Roy Guest, 51, (left) was suspended for a year after posting offensive comments about NHS campaigner Julie Bailey (right). Her mother, Bella, died while on the wards at Stafford Hospital . Ms Bailey set up the campaign group Cure the NHS and has been widely credited for pushing politicians to hold . a public inquiry into the failings. The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) panel ruled that Guest should be suspended from the register for 12 months. Panel chair Clair Bonnet said: ‘The panel concluded that his insight is limited. The registrant has not engaged with these proceedings at any stage. ‘Whilst he sought to apologise to JB . in writing, the panel considered that his draft letter was, to a . significant degree, self-centred. ‘It focused more on the impact of his actions upon himself and his family, . rather than on the impact upon JB or upon the reputations of the . profession and/or the trust. ‘The . panel had no evidence before it of the registrant’s current attitude or . whether he had taken any steps to remediate his misconduct. Ms . Bailey, who has since been awarded a CBE, has had problems with trolls in the past, receiving abuse from Twitter users. Comments by the paramedic, who was sacked by West Midlands Ambulance Trust last year, included: 'I hope you get a life-threatening illness' Ms Bailey has been credited with bringing the crisis at the hospital to light and pushing politicians to act . Probes . into the scandal at Stafford revealed that poor care could have led to the deaths . of hundreds of patients as a result of maltreatment and neglect. Many . were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to . drink water from vases or given the wrong medication. Her campaign eventually led to a full public inquiry into the scandal which in turn has led to wider NHS reforms. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service is aware of the hearing held by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) panel said Guest had not engaged in any of the proceedings involved with the investigation . 'The HCPC hearing refers to comments made on a Facebook open forum by a former member of staff. 'The incident was taken extremely seriously by the Trust when the posting first became public in February 2013. An investigation was instigated by the Trust and the member of staff concerned was dismissed in May 2013. 'It goes without saying that the Trust would not condone a personal attack and wishes to distance itself from the published comments making reference to Julie Bailey and the situation at Mid-Staffordshire Hospital. Last year, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said cruelty in the NHS became had widespread during the scandal . The hospital was the subject of a 2009 inquiry which found as many as 1,200 people may have needlessly died due to poor care over four years. The scandal came to national attention because of an investigation by the Healthcare Commission into it's day-to-day running. The commission was first alerted by the 'apparently high mortality rates in patients admitted as emergencies'. When the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust failed to provide what the commission considered an adequate explanation, a full-scale investigation was carried out in 2008. The published report severely criticised the Foundation Trust's management and detailed the appalling conditions and inadequacies at the hospital. Last year Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said cruelty was allowed to become 'normal' in the NHS at the time of the Stafford hospital scandal and neither staff nor ministers took any notice.","Roy Guest personally attacked Julie Bailey from group Cure the NHS .

Towns within hundreds of miles of the city have been placed on tornado watch as the cyclone makes its way south. Forecasters say it is due to hit New South Wales' capital Sydney tomorrow. In Biloela yesterday, rescues by helicopters and boats were caught on camera by emergency services' head-cams and aired on local television channel Network Seven today. Deluged: Two women, one holding a small child, are seen stranded in their flooded truck, waiting for help . Rescue: One woman reaches out to steady the man suspended from the helicopters winch, while the other protects the child from the down draft . Stranded: Holding on tight to the child, the women look relieved to see help arrive . Cramped: The three were only inches away from the raging flood water as it swelled around their vehicle . The footage shows two women in the back of a submerged truck, reaching out to steady the rescuer as he is lowered on a winch from the helicopter. Clearly distressed, they put the crying infant in a waterproof bag which was then lifted up to the safety of the helicopter. Reassuring the two women, the rescuer repeatedly tells them he will come back for them both. Inside the helicopter, the bag is unzipped and the crying child emerges, distraught but safe. Further footage shows an elderly woman being rescued from her marooned houseboat, which has taken a battering from the storms and is drifting. In the town of Bundaberg, the Spinnaker Flood Bar  was flooded for the second time after it was inundated due to severe floods that hit Queensland in 2011. Protection: The women carefully place the child into a waterproof black bag . Distressed: The women lower the child into the bag, which is attached to the helicopter winch . Unsure: The child loos up at the rescuer who is attached by a harness to the noisy helicopter hovering overhead . Distressed: The child looks terrified as the women try to zip him into the bag . Steady: The women look on concerned as the child is winched up in the black bag to the helicopter overhead . 'I don't know if we'll come back from this. It will probably finish us to be honest with you,' said restaurant owner Brett Jensen. Deadly snakes, forced from their bushland habitat, have added a further threat to householders who have been wading through flood waters that have risen throughout most of the east coast of Queensland and northern New South Wales. ‘There’s no end in sight – it’s going to get worse,’ warned an emergency services spokesman. Tens of thousands of holidaymakers, who headed to camping areas and seaside resorts to enjoy the Australia Day long weekend found themselves fleeing from the rain and the floods, their vehicles causing chaos on major roads. Entire houses disappeared under floodwater as rivers burst their banks and the town of Mundubbera, 225 miles north of Brisbane, was cut in two after the Burnett River rose 7ft above a road bridge. Relief: The women give the thumbs up as the child is winched safely up away from the submerged truck . Safety: In the helicopter the child is handed over to a second rescuer . Terrified: the whole experience has clearly been terrifying for the small child . Reassuring: The man on the winch gives the child a reassuring pat on the head before returning down to rescue the two women from the truck . ‘We’ve got a bit of a fight on our hands,’ said councillor Faye Whelan of Mundubbera when the river reached 63ft, 3ft 3in above the devastating levels of 2010 – and late today it was still rising. 'Houses that had been inundated in the 2010 floods have been washed out again, with several people trapped on their roofs.' The body of an elderly man has been pulled from waters at Burnett Heads – and two other people have been reported missing in flood waters in Maryborough and Gympie, north of Brisbane. Three families remained stranded on rooftops at Widgee, near Gympie, today and winds were too strong to mount a rescue by helicopter. Emergency services said they had carried out at least 21 ‘swift water’ rescues, with five people being pulled from flooded drains. Waist-deep: Residents wade through flood water as they attempt to clear belongings from a house in East Bundaberg, Queensland . Brave?: One car driver pushes on through flood waters near Maroochydore on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland . Isolated: People celebrating Australia Day wade through flood waters on Boyne Island, near Gladstone in central Queensland . Brisbane: Some streets were already flooded in the central business district of Brisbane on Sunday . In a grim summary of events in Queensland, state Premier Campbell Newman said that at least 40 houses had been inundated around the Gladstone region alone. Flood levels are expected to easily exceed 2010 levels in Bundaberg, famous for its rum, where at least 300 homes have been inundated. In the town of Gympie a 17-year-old man has been reported missing in flood waters, while in Maryborough authorities are searching for a young woman who reportedly drove her car into flood waters, hoping to get through to the other side. On the Sunshine Coast tens of thousands of homes are without power after power lines were brought down, while south of Brisbane the famous Gold Coast region is expected to be hit by heavy rain and winds of up to 80mph.","Distressed child and two women airlifted to safety from back of deluged truck in Queensland .

"Ariel detergent has sparked outrage in Germany after placing a neo-Nazi code on a new line of promotional packages. The boxes feature a white football shirt with a large number '88' - which far-right extremists use as a code for 'Heil Hitler' to skirt the country's ban on Nazi slogans. The number was intended to show how many loads of laundry buyers would be able to do with one package. Controversy: '88' is used by neo-Nazis to represent 'Heil Hitler' as Germany has a ban on Nazi slogans . However, it is common knowledge in . Germany that neo-Nazis have given the number a new meaning. The symbol . derives from that fact that 'H' is the eighth letter of the alphabet. The . brand's parent company, Procter & Gamble, has issued an apology for . 'any false connotations' after shoppers took to Twitter posting . pictures of the offending powder. The firm yesterday acknowledged that the number was 'unintentionally ambiguous.' Ariel 18 liquid detergent has also been pulled from German shelves as '18' represents 'AH', or 'Adolf Hitler' 'We very much regret if there are any false associations and distance ourselves clearly from any far-right ideology,' company spokeswoman Gabi Hassig said in a statement. Haessig said the company has stopped shipping the offending powder. They have also pulled a liquid detergent that was being promoted as 'Ariel 18' - which represents 'AH', as in Adolf Hitler.","Packages printed with large number '88', used by extremists for 'Heil Hitler'

"It seems Paddington Bear has come a long way from the wide eyed dufflecoat-wearing marmalade-loving character once adored by children in the 70s. If the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) is to be believed, cinemagoers heading to watch his latest big screen incarnation can expect 'dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references (and) bad language' from Britain's best loved bear. However, the PG rating came as somewhat of a surprise to Paddington's 88-year-old creator Michael Bond, who chronicled his adventures in a series of popular books. Scroll down for video . The new Paddington Bear film has been given a PG rating rather than the U expected by creator Michael Bond . The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) had warned cinemagoers to expect 'dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references (and) bad language' from Britain's best loved bear . He had still to see the film by the time it was given its certificate, but he said he was 'totally amazed' by the classification advice. The writer, who makes a cameo appearance in the film, said: 'I'd be very upset. I might not sleep well tonight. I can't imagine what the sex references are. It doesn't enter into it with the books, certainly.' The BBFC has since gone on to clarify that the swearing in the film was 'infrequent' and substituted 'innuendo' for 'mild sex references'. The 'infrequent scenes of dangerous behaviour' in the film refer to Paddington hiding in a fridge and skateboarding while holding on to a bus, while 'mild threat' was seen when a taxidermist villain 'threatens to kill and stuff' the famous bear. And among the 'mild sex references' - later revised to 'innunendo' - is a homoerotic 'comic sequence in which a man disguised as a woman is flirted with by another man'. The BBFC has since gone on to clarify that the swearing in the film, starring Hugh Bonneville was 'infrequent' and substituted 'innuendo' for 'mild sex references' The 'infrequent scenes of dangerous behaviour' in the film refer to Paddington hiding in a fridge and skateboarding while holding on to a bus, while 'mild threat' was seen when a taxidermist villain 'threatens to kill and stuff' the famous bear . Ben Whishaw provides the voice for the Peruvian bear in the live-action film, which also features Downton Abbey's Hugh Bonneville, Dr Who star Peter Capaldi and Australian actress Nicole Kidman. Whishaw replaced Colin Firth as the voice of Paddington after The King's Speech star quit, saying he was having trouble finding the voice of the marmalade-loving bear. The film sees Paddington despatched from his native jungle and smuggled on board a boat to England. Ben Whishaw provides the voice for the Peruvian bear in the live-action film, which also features  Dr Who star Peter Capaldi and Australian actress Nicole Kidman (pictured) However, the news came as somewhat of a surprise to Paddington's 88-year-old creator Michael Bond, who chronicled his adventures in a series of popular books, who said he was 'totally amazed' by the classification . Recent children's films which have been awarded a universal (U) certificate include The Lego Movie, Despicable Me 2 and Monsters University while Frozen (mild threat) and How To Train Your Dragon 2 (mild violence and threat) were awarded a PG certificate. Announcing the revised consumer 'insight' advice, the BBFC said it had made the amendments after the distributor asked for it to be reconsidered. It now reads: 'dangerous behaviour, mild threat, innuendo, infrequent mild bad language'. In a statement, the BBFC added: 'The content in the film goes beyond the BBFC guidelines at U and the distributor was content with the PG certificate for the film.' Changes to guidelines last year resulted in the body being tougher on bad language at the U level as a result of public consultations. Bond's books have sold 35 million copies worldwide since they were first published in 1958.","British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) warned the new film includes dangerous behaviour, mild threat, mild sex references and bad language'

"Last Saturday night millions of football fans watched as Real Madrid won the European Cup in one of the most eagerly-awaited fixtures of the sporting calendar. But, according to a Heineken advert shown in Brazil before the game, none of them were women, as they were all too busy shopping for shoes instead. In the ad, the beer brand teamed up with Shoestock to offer a 50 per cent off shoes sale online and in stores, starting at exactly the same time as the game, in order to keep wives and girlfriends of sports fans busy. Scroll down for video . Brewer Heineken put on a three-hour shoe sale during the European Cup final last weekend, offering men the chance to distract their wife or girlfriend so they could watch the match in peace . The advert has been removed from YouTube after attracting a barrage of criticism for its sexist content . In the short clip, a voice-over offers men the opportunity to watch the game with their friends 'without ditching the wife, because this time she'll be ditching you'. The voice-over adds that the sale will give women 'everything to make her think only about shoes, and especially not about where you are.' It ends by saying that you - meaning a man - will be happy with your friends, while your wife will be happy with you. The film, which was made by Wieden+Kennedy, provoked outcries of sexism from female sports fans in Brazil before it was removed from YouTube. That isn't entirely surprising, given that during the 2010 World Cup, the majority of Brazilian viewers were women. One user wrote: Thank you, Heineken, for . reminding me that my place is JUST in a store thinking about my . appearance and not drinking your beer, which was my favourite, watching . sports with my friends, which I thought was fun.' The advertising company who came up with the promotion attempted to defend it, saying it 'in no way alludes to male-chauvinism' (pictured, Christiano Ronaldo plays in the Champions League final on Saturday) Saturday's final between Real Madrid and Athletico de Madrid saw Real walk away with the title, thanks to an injury-time header from Sergio Ramos and an extra-time goal from Welshman Gareth Bale (pictured) When challenged by Business Insider, Wieden+Kennedy said: 'The idea in no way alludes to male-chauvinism. It’s an idea that plays with the different interests that may exist among couples. 'We had no intention of reinforcing stereotypes or causing any kind of discomfort or embarrassment.' The company added that the advert was meant to generate conversation and was 'entirely good-natured.'","Heineken advert aired in Brazil ahead of Champions League final .

"The families of five World War Two airmen who were shot down during a bombing raid more than 70 years ago are calling on the Government to help recover their bodies from a German swamp. The young men of Halifax HR980 were shot down during a night raid over Berlin in 1943 and the location of their crash was thought to have been lost after the war. Their relatives were never told where the plane landed but when the swamp they crashed into began to dry up, pieces of the aircraft were pushed to the surface and revealed their final resting place. Some of the crew of Halifax HR980, which was shot down during a raid over Berlin in 1943. They are, from left, Arthur Cox, William Burgum, Harley Harber and Donald Hemstock. The bodies of Flight Sergeant Harber and Sergeant Cox were the only ones to be recovered . Flight Sergeant Jake Harrison, left, and Sergeant Peter Buck, right, who were both lost when the aircraft crashed and their bodies have yet to be recovered . German authorites have now granted permission for the plane and the bodies of the five Commonwealth airmen to be recovered. However, their requests to the governments of the UK, Canada and Australia to help fund the £165,000 recovery operation have been rejected. One of the men who died in the raid was Canadian Flight Sergeant Jake Harrison, who left behind widow Lola Leslie,  now aged 92. Her daughter Linda says the family don't have the heart to explain to her mother that he will not be recovered from the mud. She said: 'They were married for two days when he got called to service and never returned home. You can imagine her reaction when I told her Jake's plane was found after all these years. 'All those years of wondering what happened to him - my heart broke for her. 'I have not told her that the recovery is at a standstill due to a lack of funding, I don't want to put her through that. She keeps asking if they found him and I just tell her it takes time.' German authorites have now granted permission for the plane and the bodies of the five Commonwealth airmen to be recovered. Pictured is Flight Sergeant William Burgum . Mrs Leslie said the three Commonwealth countries have a duty to fund the rescue operation which has been planned by volunteer recovery specialists. Pat Davies, 94, is the sister of trapped British navigator Sergeant Peter Buck and is desperate for him to receive a 'proper burial'. Mrs Davies, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'I think the government should do something - they went down protecting the country and doing their duty. 'It would be a nice thing for them to finally be laid to rest in a proper burial.' The young bomber crew were shot down on August 23, 1943, and crashed into the Reiersdorf swamp 35 miles north of Berlin. Crash reports unearthed in the RAF archives reveal Wehrmacht soldiers recovered the bodies of Australian air gunners Flight Sergeant Harley Harber, 27, and Sergeant Arthur Cox, whose bodies were thrown free of the aircraft and later buried in the Berlin  war cemetery. An aerial shot of the swamp crash site near to Berlin where the aircraft crashed in August 1943 . The location of the crash site sank without trace in the archives of the RAF after the war, and the families were never told of the location. Only after the swamp began to dry up in recent years was the crash location rediscovered. The remaining trapped crew are Australian pilot Flight Sergeant William Burgum, 21, British aircrew Sergeant Roland Hill, 32, Sergeant Peter Buck, 20, Sergeant Donald Hempstock, 21, and Canadian Flight Sergeant Gordon Harrison. Now a team of recovery experts from the Canadian Halifax 57 Rescue organisation and a team of German aviation archaeologists from Luftfahrt Archäologie Oderland have drawn up an excavation plan. The operation, costing £165,000, involves using 'ground freezing' refrigerated probes to create a 200ft-diameter circular wall of frozen swamp around the crash site. Inside the frozen wall they will then pump out the thick muddy soup covering the wreckage. The team of recovery experts, who are hoping to excavate the aircraft and the bodies from the swamp, led by Karl Kasgard, bottom right . Recovery co-ordinator Karl Kjarsgaard, a director of the Bomber Command Museum of Canada and president of the recovery group Halifax 57 Rescue, warned that without funding from governments or business an excavation would not be possible. He said: 'The leaders of our governments have the funding to do this recovery but they will not provide the collaborative seed money to do the right thing. 'These air warriors who gave us our freedom lie in the mud and should not be there.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said they did not fund archaeological digs of historic aircraft, but if remains were found they would pay for a burial in the local area where they were discovered. Bomber Command crews suffered a terrifyingly high casualty rate during the war. With 55,573 killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew between 1939 to 1945, bomber crews had a worse chance of survival than an infantry officer in the trenches of the First World War.","Young men aboard Halifax HR980 were lost over Germany in August 1943 .

"Education Minister Christopher Pyne has denied he's trying to save ABC jobs in his home state of South Australia, from his own government and at the expense of the broadcaster's other departments. Just as his Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull was confirming that the ABC will lose more than $250 million in federal funding (with up to 500 jobs expected to be shed before Christmas) and SBS $25 million, Mr Pyne took the unusual step of launching his own on-line petition on Wednesday calling on the ABC board not to cut production in South Australia. His office has denied it's a case of double standards, My Pyne attempting to turn the blame onto the ABC board, accusing them of 'political vandalism' if they choose to reduce production costs. The social media backlash against Christopher Pyne's crusade was immediate . A spokesman for My Pyne told Daily Mail Australia that 'he's not saying that, he's not saying that there should be cuts pushed on elsewhere, it's because of the report (Peter Lewis Report) the (Communication) Minister received, which says there should be no cuts to programming'. In an interview with ABC Radio 891, Mr Pyne said: 'Obviously the ABC needs to make its contribution to reducing the debt and the deficit that Labor has left us. And Malcolm Turnbull’s done the job for them'. 'He got Peter Lewis to do a report, The Lewis Report, into how to reduce spending at the ABC, which showed that the spending could be reduced without any impact on production, without any impact on programming,' Mr Pyne said. Christopher Pyne hopes his campaign to save ABC jobs in South Australia will be heard . Reaction to Mr Pyne's petition to save jobs in South Australia has sparked much reaction . 'So if ABC management in Ultimo decide to cut jobs and production in Adelaide, it is a deliberate act of political vandalism, because they know, they have the report in front of them, in black and white, showing how to reduce costs without affecting production and programming and that’s what all out listeners need to know. 'There is no need for there to be a production change here in Adelaide unless in Ultimo in Sydney, they refuse to actually implement the report Malcolm Turnbull had done for them.' Mr Pyne's petition via Change.org states: 'We, the undersigned, are concerned that ABC in South Australia is the last TV production unit outside of Sydney and Melbourne. 'The Board must reassure South Australians that the local TV production house of the ABC will remain in South Australia. As noted in the ABC’s 2013 annual report, ABC South Australia produces top rating, award-winning shows such as Dream Build which is listed in the 12 most popular Australian made shows. 'Further, ABC South Australia produces television that is often with a regional focus, including but not limited to The Cook and The Chef, Poh’s Kitchen, Dream Build, the Karta orang-utan documentary at Adelaide Zoo, The Beatles 50th anniversary tour documentary, a forthcoming country-based heritage restoration series and more. 'These television series are targeted at individual groups within the community and are crucial to a diverse market. By moving ABC TV elsewhere, it will incur unnecessary costs and remove the efficient and innovative production unit from South Australia. 'We, the undersigned, note that productions such as The Daters has been produced here in South Australia with a limited budget, while using innovative technology which has made it successful enough to be screened on ABC2 and ABC’s iView. 'We, the undersigned, strongly support the ABC staying as a production unit in South Australia and for the ABC to adhere to its charter and continue to tell great stories “that contribute to a sense of national identity… and reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community”. Please ensure that the ABC does not close its production house in Adelaide.' Communications Minister has revealed the cuts to the public broadcasters ABC and SBS saying 'if the ABC or SBS want to make decisions to change or cease programming; that is their choice. The savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming' Mr Pyne turned the heat up on the ABC Board today saying 'if ABC management in Ultimo decide to cut jobs and production in Adelaide, it is a deliberate act of political vandalism, because they know, they have the report in front of them, in black and white, showing how to reduce costs' Mr Turnbull has released details, claiming that changes to programming are not required and the savings can be found through 'operational efficiencies'. His statement read: 'An Efficiency Study was launched in January to identify how the ABC and SBS could find efficiencies in their back office operations, finance, property, IT, administration, corporate and marketing, without impacting on programming'. 'In total, including the 1 per cent down-payment announced in the May budget, the overall savings to the broadcasters is $308 million over five years or 4.4 per cent of taxpayers' investment,' Mr Turnbull stated. 'For the ABC this means it will receive $5.2 billion over five years rather than $5.5 billion, a saving of $254 million or 4.6 per cent. 'The Government is confident that these savings can be achieved without affecting the diverse range and quality of programmes provided by the ABC or SBS. Suggestions that popular programs or services are at risk because of Budget savings are not credible. 'If the ABC or SBS want to make decisions to change or cease programming; that is their choice. The savings are not of a level that require any changes to programming. 'Programming changes are decisions for the Management and Boards of the organisations, not the Government.' As for his colleague calling on jobs to be specifically saved in South Australia, Mr Turnbull said 'Christopher is representing his electorate, everybody is entitled to their opinion'.","Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has confirmed the ABC will lose $254 million over the next five years)

"Spain's Interior Ministry has come under fire for a crime prevention campaign in which all the burglars are black... but attempted to defend itself by saying it was inspired by the Three Wise Men. The safety warning was criticised by anti-racism campaigners and opposition politicians after a series of posters warning against burglars only featured figures with black faces. In one of the posters three of the figures can be seen riding on a camel, while another shows what appears to be a woman with a black face, arms and legs carrying a bag of  money. The Spanish Interior Ministry has defended itself against allegations of racism by saying a poster campaign in which all the burglars are black was inspired in part by the Three Wise Men . The ministry has attempted to dismiss the allegations by saying the characters are wearing balaclavas - but their argument failed to impress critics who pointed out the characters also had black hands and legs . The ministry has attempted to dismiss the allegations by saying the characters had been wearing balaclavas. Their argument failed to impress critics however who pointed out the characters also had black hands and legs. Asked why in one poster the characters were riding on a camel, the ministry claimed in a written statement that the picture was a play on the image of the Three Kings who in this case were not bringing gifts, but were coming to rob the house. The ministry said: 'The image is not actually of the Three Kings with black skin but three criminals in balaclavas. The posters, which have been put up across the country, have also come under fire from Spain's main opposition party, the socialist PSOE . One of the posters shows a character in a grey suit, which was said by critics to be a burkha-wearing burglar . 'We want to warn people that crooks could try to pass themselves off as something legitimate to try and rob people's homes.' Ruyan Torres Veliz, from the Spanish Youth Against Racism, said: 'As well as not explaining why these people had black hands and feet, including the woman in a dress, it should be pointed out to the Interior Ministry that it isn't Christmas which is usually the time the Three Kings are out in force.' The posters, that have been put up across the country, have also come under fire from Spain's main opposition party, the socialist PSOE.

"These magnificent mountains look almost unreal as they constantly change colour with the light and weather. British photographer Andro Loria, 50, said the altering shadows it was like watching an 'everlasting show' pass over the landscape. He took the shots on a hiking tour through the Landmannalaugar Highlands in Iceland's Fjallabak Nature Reserve. Mr Loria, a scientist from north west London, said the scene was 'unearthly' and at times he felt like he was walking across the moon. Captivated by the area's beauty, he said he slowed the rest of the group down because he kept stopping to take 'hundreds' of photos. British photographer Andro Loria captured the Iceland landscape beautifully, and included this 70-year-old walker . The mountains appear to change colour dependent on the light and the weather . Mr Loria, who is engaged to be married, said: 'The colourful mountains change colours constantly according to the light and weather. 'The patches of ice or snow in spring or early summer add more contrast to the scenery; some ice patches on slopes survive into late summer. The hills are usually yellow and gold with splashes of grey and blue and red or purple from sulphur rich minerals due to volcanic activity. Green moss adds an extra colour. 'As the relief is rather ragged you have a constant interplay between light, colour and shades creating a never ending show. It is a paradise for photography.' The shots include Mt. Brennisteinsalda, which means 'Sulphur Wave', an 850 metre high active volcano with hot sulphur springs on its slopes. Mr Loria added: 'The combination of contrasting colour and light in ever-changing shapes due to variable light was absolutely unique. I had never seen anything like it before. Colours added by volcanic activity made it all look almost unreal and unearthy. 'You almost feel like you are crossing a lunar landscape at times. 'The majority of peaks in Landmannalaugar are between 800-1200m above sea level. Due to the location of the highlands the view from the top spots allows you to see incredible panoramas. The constant interplay of light, shapes, shades and colour is very captivating. 'The views from the tops of the highest hills or mountains are very impressive, they are easy to get to and at places are almost flat and barren.' The photographer Loria described it as almost like passing over a lunar landscape . The photos were taken on a hiking tour through the Landmannalaugar Highlands in Iceland's Fjallabak Nature Reserve . The photographs are so vivid they look more like paintings, with the array of colours captured beautifully . He described the walker shown in one of the shots - an American man from the group who is more than 70 years old - inspired some of his best snaps. Mr Loria added: 'I wish I will still be travelling like him when I get to that age. He was also a reason I took a couple of my favourite shots. They were taken late, the sun was low providing beautiful light and lighting up hills with extra splashes of gold and pink. 'I turned back to see if my fellow walker was OK and after seeing the scene took a few shots. The way he walked along the ridge, blending into the landscape, was fantastic. It was one of those men and nature being united feelings.' The rock formations at a mountain range in Iceland are unique, and unlike others in the world .

"White House press secretary said afterwards that the U.S. continues to support an Afghan-led process . toward reconciliation . Afghan 'suicide bomber' tried to blow up Leon Panetta hours earlier . Comes days after rogue U.S. soldier massacred 16 Afghans . Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai called for NATO troops to leave Afghan villages and confine themselves to major bases after the slaughter of 16 civilians by a U.S. soldier, underscoring fury over the massacre and clouding U.S. exit plans. In a near-simultaneous announcement, the Afghan Taliban said it was suspending nascent peace talks with the United States seen as a strong chance to end the country's decade-long conflict, blaming 'shaky, erratic and vague' U.S. statements. Karzai, in a statement after meeting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in Kabul, said as a consequence of the weekend massacre, 'international security forces have to be taken out of Afghan village outposts and return to (larger) bases'. In advance of his visit an Afghan man who apparently targeted U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in a suicide attack at Britain's main base in Afghanistan died of his injuries. After a Thursday visit with United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, pictured, Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said NATO troops should leave rural areas and stay on military bases . Behind the smiles: After his meeting with Panetta Karzai also said he now wants Afghan forces to take the lead for countrywide security in 2013, a year ahead of schedule . The civilian had sustained severe burns . after driving on to a runway at Camp Bastion at the same time as Mr . Panetta was landing for a visit to U.S. troops and local political . leaders. The White House says its approach toward the Taliban has not changed, rejecting the militant group's statements that it broke off talks because the Americans had failed to follow through on promises and had made new demands. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that the U.S. continues to support an Afghan-led process toward reconciliation. He says U.S. terms have not changed for participation in that process by the Taliban. Carney would not discuss details of recent talks with the Taliban. The American soldier accused of carrying out the massacre was attached to a small special forces compound similar to others around the country which underpin NATO's anti-insurgent strategy ahead of a 2014 deadline for Western combat forces to pull out. The incident has harmed relations between Afghanistan and the United States and 'all efforts have to be done to avoid such incident in the future', Karzai said on Thursday, warning it also had hurt the trust Afghans had in foreign forces. The night-time killings in Kandahar province on Sunday have raised questions about Western strategy in Afghanistan and intensified calls for the withdrawal of foreign combat troops. The Taliban decision to suspend the talks was a blow to NATO hopes of a negotiated settlement to the war, which has cost the United States $510 billion and the lives of over 1,900 soldiers. Panetta left Afghanistan shortly after his meeting with Karzai following his two day visit . The attempted suicide bomber apparently stole a truck from a British soldier after injuring the soldier in a struggle, then drove onto the runway. He crashed into a ditch, then seems to have set himself on fire and fought with NATO troops, who managed to tackle him and put out the fire. The incident has raised disturbing questions over security at the base. The driver, a local male civilian . employed at the base, died of his injuries the morning after the . incident despite attempts to save his life in hospital. He . started his apparent attack by taking a truck from a British soldier, . who suffered a broken pelvis when he was run over while trying to stop . the hijacker. What's the big deal? Secretary Panetta wore a big smile as he set foot at Camp Bastion . The man then drove to the runway at around the same time as Mr Panetta was landing in an Air Force aeroplane. After his truck crashed, he jumped out of the vehicle and appeared to be on fire - although, contrary to earlier reports, the car did not blow up, nor was there any sign of explosives on board. 'For reasons that are totally unknown to us at this time, our personnel discovered that he was ablaze,' Pentagon spokesman George Little said. The man was carrying lighter fluid and matches inside the vehicle, according to Fox News, suggesting that he may have deliberately set himself alight. Despite being on fire, the man fought with U.S. soldiers and even jumped on to the side of their vehicle. Target? The blast came as U.S. Mr Panetta (second right) was arriving at Camp Bastion . Meeting: Mr Panetta addresses coalition troops at Camp Bastion soon after the apparent attack . Mr Little added: 'Base personnel put the fire out and he was . immediately treated for burn injuries and is still being treated. He . sustained considerable burn wounds.' Mr Panetta and . his entourage were unharmed, although their plane was diverted to . another runway to unload - and Pentagon officials said they had no . evidence that the timing of the apparent attack was linked to the . Defense Secretary's visit. 'We don't have any indication right . now that this was meant as a threat to the secretary', said a spokesman. 'As a fact we don't have any indication that the driver knew who was . coming in on that aircraft.' A Camp Bastion spokesman added: . 'Procedures were put in place to account for the whereabouts of all . military and civilian personnel and, to achieve this, movement within . Camp Bastion was restricted.' Arrival: Mr Panetta touches down in Afghanistan after his plane was diverted to another runway . Departure: Major Matt O'Donnell shields himself from rotor wash from Mr Panetta's helicopters . Ministry of Defence police patrolled roads inside the base today in the wake of the incident. Flights and movements in and out were restricted throughout the afternoon while it was investigated and were lifted later on. Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney cancelled a Canadian speaking appearance because of security concerns sparked by demonstrations during a visit he made to Vancouver last year. Mr Cheney was scheduled to talk about his experiences in office and the current American political situation at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre on April 24. But Ryan Ruppert of Spectre Live Corp. said on Monday that Mr Cheney and his daughter Elizabeth had cancelled through their agent. 'After speaking with their security advisers, they changed their mind on coming to the event,' Mr Ruppert said. He added they had 'decided it was better for their personal safety they stay out of Canada.' Last September 26, Mr Cheney was forced to stay holed up in the Vancouver Club for seven hours before it was deemed safe for him to leave. Demonstrators blocked the entrances and at one point scuffled with police. Critics of Mr Cheney take issue with his endorsement of water boarding and sleep deprivation against detainees while serving in former President George W. Bush's administration. Bastion is home to a large contingent of U.S. troops as well as UK forces. The blast came as Mr Panetta meet with troops, commanders and Afghan government officials. In a highly unusual move, earlier today around 200 U.S. Marines were told to leave their weapons outside a tent where U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta was set to give a talk. Officials said the order was because . there were two dozen unarmed Afghan soldiers in attendance and everyone . should be treated the same. They also denied it was related to Sunday's shooting. 'You've got one of the most important people in the world in the room,' Maj. Gen. Mark Gurganus told reporters at Camp Leatherneck. 'This is not a big deal.' The move was unusual as in combat zones marines are usually instructed to have their weapons within close range. One military official in Washington told NBC 'it sends the wrong message' that marines can't be trusted in the presence of the Secretary of Defense. Mr Panetta's visit was planned months ago, . long before the weekend slaughter by a rogue U.S. soldier that claimed . the lives of 16 villagers, including women and children. It also comes on the same day it emerged the U.S. soldier who massacred 16 . Afghan civilians was caught on surveillance video – showing him walking . up to his base, laying down his weapon and raising his arms in . surrender. An Afghan official said that the U.S. showed Afghan authorities the surveillance . video to prove that only one perpetrator was involved in the Sunday . shootings, an account which has been disputed. The trip propels Mr Panetta into the centre of escalating anti-American . anger and sets the stage for some difficult discussions with Afghan . leaders. Mr Panetta, who has . said the rogue soldier could face the death penalty, told Afghan . officials that recent violence will not deter the United States from . carrying out its mission in Afghanistan. The trip is the first significant visit from a U.S. dignitary since the killings, which many had worried would spark another . wave of deadly riots like those that followed the burning of Korans at a . U.S. base last month. Nearly a week of violent demonstrations and . attacks left more than 30 dead, including six U.S. soldiers killed . apparent reprisal attacks. Six British soldiers also died last week when their armoured vehicle was blown up . Attack: The incident happened at the main British base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion . Disbelief: Two grief-stricken Afghan men look into the van where the body of a badly burned child is wrapped in a blue blanket following the shooting last weekend . Military . commanders have yet to release their final investigation on the Koran . burnings, which U.S. officials say was a mistake. Five U.S. service . members could face disciplinary action in connection with the incident. UN . Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today expressed deep sadness at . the 'shocking incident' and said the UN expects that an investigation . will rapidly establish the facts, that those responsible will be held . accountable, and that the public will be kept informed. 'When . it comes to the protection of civilian populations, I have been very . vocal here and all around the world, not only in Afghanistan,' Ban told a . group of reporters. 'We will continue to urge all authorities and . military personnel who are engaging in these operations to pay extreme . and utmost care to protect the civilian population.'","White House press secretary said afterwards that the U.S. continues to support an Afghan-led process .

"Found: 18-year-old Matthew Allen has been rescued after spending nine weeks alone in the outbush . A teenager who had been given up for dead has been found after surviving for nearly nine weeks in the Australian bush. Matthew Allen, 18, had lost half his body weight and was suffering from partial blindness brought on by his ordeal when he was found, lying exhausted, by two hikers. His body was covered in leeches and insect bites, with gangrene eating into his feet and lower legs. But the astonishing survival  of the accountancy student, who lived with his family less than  two miles from where he was found, has divided opinion in the local community. Some have questioned his story, while others have simply marvelled at his endurance. Police say Matthew suffers from an unspecified mental illness, but that there is no doubt from his shocking condition that he has been living rough since he left his home in Westleigh, on the northern edge of Sydney, last November. Matthew is believed to have set out into the dense bush on a survival mission, where he struggled to exist on virtually no food and the little water he could gather from a virtually-dry creek bed. To make matters worse there was a record-breaking heatwave. Police chief Glyn Baker said: ‘He was not living under any shelter and was exposed to the full conditions since he was reported missing two months ago. ‘Anyone who is missing for that length of time in those kind of conditions… you wouldn’t expect to see them again.’ Matthew, who had lost six stone, was found by chance on Saturday as he lay near a track in the bush, too exhausted and sick to raise himself on to his infected feet. He  was badly dehydrated, his body was red with mosquito bites, leeches clung to his arms and legs and he was completely disorientated. Incredible survival: Despite his emaciated condition, experienced bush walkers and police are in awe of his ability to have survived virtually without any sustenance since November in the wilderness near Hornsby - during a record-breaking heatwave . A helicopter was sent to winch him out of the bush and fly him to hospital in Hornsby, a suburb of Sydney. Matthew’s family have gathered at his bedside in hospital, where he is being treated for his injuries. Police have described them as ‘not life-threatening’, but added that if Matthew had not been found by chance he would not have survived for many more days. His mother Deborah said that her family’s priority now ‘is getting  Matthew well’. She declined to comment further. Police said the boy intended to go into the bush, and did not get lost there. When his family reported him missing a widespread search was  carried out but the teenager could not be found. He had left his mobile phone at home and had not taken any extra clothing with him. Discovery: Matthew was found near Hornsby, a suburb of Sydney on the edge of the outback . Officers have yet to question Matthew about his ordeal but they believe he had deliberately stayed out of sight when hikers passed close by. Inspector Baker said: ‘Hikers often walk along tracks in the area. He must have kept out of the way of people. ‘I also think he was in such a state that he couldn’t actually get up and move. He was not that far from home but there’s no indication that food was being pilfered from the house.’ Some local people have questioned why Matthew was not found earlier, when he was eventually discovered so close to home. One writer on an internet forum that has been debating his survival wrote: ‘I find it all a bit odd. There’s more to this story.’ But Duncan Gibbs said the bush is ‘pretty rugged and you can be just around the corner from someone and never know that they’re there’.","Matthew Allen walked out of home on 'survival mission' in November .

"When archaeologists claimed to have found the bones of John the Baptist amid the ruins of an ancient Bulgarian monastery experts were understandably sceptical. But carbon dating tests carried out at Oxford University have provided scientific evidence to support the extraordinary claim. A knucklebone has been dated to the 1st Century AD - a time when the revered Jewish prophet is believed to have lived. The remains of John the Baptist? Clockwise from top left, the knucklebone, the ulna, part of cranial bone and molar (together), and a rib . Find: An excavation on the island of Sveti Ivan resulted in the discovery of human bones in a sarcophagus . Researchers were said to be . 'surprised' when they discovered the very early age of the remains, but . admit 'dating evidence alone cannot prove the bones to be of John the . Baptist'. The new dating evidence will be revealed in a TV documentary to be shown on the National Geographic channel on Sunday. The . remains - small fragments of a skull, bones from a jaw and an arm, and a . tooth - were discovered two years ago embedded in an altar in the ruins . of the ancient monastery, on an island in the Black Sea. They were kept inside a reliquary - a container for holy relics - on Sveti Ivan - which translates into English as St John - off Sozopol on Bulgaria’s southern coast. Find: The new dating evidence will be revealed in a TV documentary to be shown on the National Geographic channel on Sunday . The knucklebone has been dated to the 1st Century AD - a time when the revered Jewish prophet is believed to have lived. The ‘key’ clue to the relics’ origins . was a tiny sandstone box found alongside the reliquary with a Greek . inscription: 'God, save your servant Thomas. To St John. June 24.' The . date is believed to be John the Baptist’s birthday. One theory is that the person referred to as Thomas had been given the task of bringing the relics to the island. Oxford professors Thomas Higham and . Christopher Ramsey attempted to radiocarbon date four of the human . bones, but only one of them could be dated successfully. Professor Higham said: ‘We were . surprised when the radiocarbon dating produced this very early age. We . had suspected that the bones may have been more recent than this, . perhaps from the third or fourth centuries. ‘However, . the result from the metacarpal hand bone is clearly consistent with . someone who lived in the early first century AD. Whether that person is . John the Baptist is a question that we cannot yet definitely answer and . probably never will. DNA tests at the University of . Copenhagen on three bones confirmed they were from the same person and . probably from someone of Middle East origin - where John the Baptist . came from. They also established they were probably from a man. Dr . Hannes Schroeder, who carried out the research, said: ‘Of course, this . does not prove that these were the remains of John the Baptist but nor . does it refute that theory.’ Dig: Archaeologists and students work at the site on St Ivan Island, Bulgaria . The bones were found amid the ruins of an ancient monastery . John the Baptist was the son of Zachary, a priest of the Temple in Jerusalem, and Elizabeth - who was related to the Virgin Mary. He lived as a hermit in the desert of Judea until about A.D. 27. When he was thirty, he began to preach on the banks of the Jordan against the evils of the times and called men to penance and baptism 'for the Kingdom of Heaven is close at hand'. John anticipated a messianic figure who would be greater than himself and, in the New Testament, Jesus is the one whose coming John foretold. When Christ came to him, John baptised Him, saying: 'It is I who need baptism from You"". When Christ left to preach in Galilee, John continued preaching in the Jordan valley. Fearful of his great power with the people, Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Perea and Galilee, had him arrested and imprisoned at Machaerus Fortress on the Dead Sea after John denounced his adultrous and incestuous marriage with Herodias, wife of his half brother Philip. John was beheaded at the request of Salome, daughter of Herodias, who asked for his head at the instigation of her mother. John is presented in the New Testament as the last of the Old Testament prophets. source: www.catholic.org . One . theory is that the person referred to as Thomas in the inscription was . given the task of bringing the relics to the island monastery. Bulgarian . researchers believe that the bones probably came to Bulgaria via . Antioch, an ancient Turkish city, where the right hand of St John was . kept until the tenth century. Many countries around the Mediterranean claim to have remains of St John, including Turkey, Montenegro, Greece, Italy and Egypt. According to the bible he was the cousin of Jesus and a revered holy man who baptised the son of God. He . is said to have foretold the coming of Christ before being beheaded on . the orders of King Herod, with his head served up on a plate. In a separate study, another Oxford . researcher Dr Georges Kazan has used historical documents to show that . in the latter part of the fourth century, monks had taken relics of John . the Baptist out of Jerusalem and these included portions of skull. These relics were soon summoned to Constantinople by the Roman Emperor who built a church to house them there. Further . research by Dr Kazan suggests that the reliquary used to contain them . may have resembled the sarcophagus-shaped casket discovered at Sveti . Ivan. Archaeological and written records . suggest that these reliquaries were first developed and used at . Constantinople by the city’s ruling elite at around the time that the . relics of John the Baptist are said to have arrived there. The marble sarcophagus, which contained a collection of human and animal bones, was found directly beneath the church altar . Proof? The reliquary box thought to have been used to carry the bones to the island. The exterior has inscriptions written in ancient Greek mentioning John the Baptist and his feast day . Dr Kazan said: 'My research suggests that during the fifth or early sixth century, the monastery of Sveti Ivan may well have received a significant portion of St John the Baptist’s relics, as well as a prestige reliquary in the shape of a sarcophagus, from a member of Constantinople’s elite. 'This gift could have been to dedicate or rededicate the church and the monastery to St John, which the patron or patrons may have supported financially.' The scientific analysis of the relics undertaken by Tom Higham and Christopher Ramsey at Oxford, and their colleagues in Copenhagen was supported by the National Geographic Society. The documentary Head of John the Baptist, featuring the scientists' work is due to be shown on the National Geographic Channel at 8pm on 17 June 2012. Resting place?

"Upset: Brian Fairfield was told to take down the Union Jack from his house in Hull, East Yorkshire . An ex-serviceman was forced to remove a flagpole flying a Union Jack from his garden after neighbours complained it was ‘too noisy’. Brian Fairfield, from Hull, East Yorkshire, raised the flag for the first time last week but within days was asked to take it down. The 80-year-old said his landlord Sanctuary Housing had received five complaints from local residents, complaining it was an eyesore and that it made too much noise. Mr Fairfield said: 'It’s the first time I have heard our national flag being described as offensive to look at. 'I had only managed to raise the flag five or six times before the phone rang to say it had to come down. 'We . all have rights but surely mine count as much as theirs. The least my . landlord could have done was to come and see me and the flag for . themselves. 'It’s not causing anybody any harm.' Another of Mr Fairfield’s neighbours complained that she couldn’t watch the television while his flag was flying. 'If she wants to watch the television, she should concentrate on that instead of my flag,' he said. 'It’s ludicrous.' Mr . Fairfield joined the British Army through National Service in 1952 . before being transferred to serve as a Sergeant in the Parachute . Regiment in 1954. The pensioner says he takes pride in being patriotic. Mr Fairfield's landlord Sanctuary Housing told him to remove the flag from his garden, pictured, following complaints from neighbours . He said: 'Maybe I am more patriotic than the average person. 'When I watch the military parades on television, I have a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. 'I’ve always wanted a flag but I’ve never had a garden to fly one in until now, and I think it makes my garden look nicer. 'I’m proud to be an Englishman and proud to have been in the forces, so I want to fly my flag, it’s as simple as that.' Mr Fairfield says he even checked whether he needed planning permission for the flagpole, which is 18ft tall, and hangs his 5ft by 3ft Union Jack flag. He and his wife Shirley, 68, moved to their bungalow 18 months ago after having problems with their neighbours at their previous home, where they lived for 26 years. He said: 'We find it very idyllic living here, it’s like our little piece of heaven. But this has really ruined things for us. 'I’ve been totally upset by the whole thing, I can’t believe people can take so much offence over our country’s flag. 'I hope people will see that there are much bigger things to be worried about, rather than stopping an old man from taking pride in his heritage.' John Hanson, local head of housing operations for Sanctuary Housing, said: 'Mr and Mrs Fairfield are a lovely couple to work with, and we understand that they have the best of intentions. 'Objections were about the size of the flag and the noise it created, not the principle of flying one, and we are more than happy to help the Fairfields come to a suitable agreement with their neighbours.'","Brian Fairfield, 80, put up 5ft by 3ft flag at his home in Hull, East Yorkshire .

"A Fisheries Department in Australia is refusing to pay a $188,000 bill for removing a whale carcass from a popular beach because 'whales are mammals, not fish.' While that is scientifically true, the local council in the City of Stirling, West Australia, insists that because the whale came from the sea, the state's Fisheries Department has to pay for its removal. The 17 metre carcass washed ashore on Scarborough Beach on November 3, leaving Stirling City to arrange for special earthmoving equipment to lift the rotting body up and transport it by lorry to a waste facility where it was buried, the ABC reported today. Scroll down for video . Over $188,000 was spent by the City of Stirling to clean up a 17 metre whale carcass that washed ashore on Scarborough Beach . Stirling's mayor, Giovanni Italiano, said the equivalent of $188,000 was spent on the equipment hire, waste ground fees, cleaning the beach and paying for labour and security. 'I've asked the Premier of the State and the Minister for Fisheries to arrange for the State government to pick up the bill - but all we've been offered is $8,000 for the waste fees and the cost of the contaminated sand,' said Mr Italiano. 'The Minister for Fisheries' office said they are not going to foot the bill because it's a mammal, not a fish. They believe it's not in their jurisdiction.' Mr Italiano told the ABC that that the State Government should have arranged to tow the dead whale out to sea before it was washed onto the beach. The local council in West Australia has claimed that the state's Fisheries Department has to pay the bill . 'We're not going to pay this and the ratepayers are not going to pay it. 'We pay the Government $26.3 million  for fire and emergencies services levies and this was an emergency.' He insisted that if another whale carcass was washed onto the beach, his council would not handle the clean-up. Meanwhile a spokeswoman for the Minister for Fisheries said the Fish Resources Management Act of 1994 'does not envisage the Department of Fisheries managing whales, whether they are alive or dead.' However the minister for the Fisheries' office said the carcass was 'not in their jurisdiction ' due to being a mammal, not a fish . Whales are classified as mammals because, unlike fish, they are warm-blooded and breath air with lungs, taking in oxygen directly when they come to the surface at regular intervals. When they surface, they exhale the air they have previously breathed in, puffing it out through 'nostrils' known as blowholes. They give birth to live young and suckle the new-born on milk secreted by mammary glands. In addition, they have hair, or rather bristles, usually on their heads. Science has taught us that whales, along with dolphins, seals and walruses left the land some 55 million years ago and went into the water, where they evolved into today's creatures. It was the same whale that made worldwide news when Australian man Harrison Williams, from Perth, climbed on top of it . ‘It was definitely a stupid act but I didn't mean any disrespect to anyone. Mum thinks I'm an idiot, and Dad isn't too proud either,' Mr Williams said . The whale in question is the same one that Harrison Williams, from Quinns Rocks near Perth, climbed on top of after he jumped off a boat on Saturday afternoon. He became stranded when sharks started to circle the dead whale. ‘He [the shark] was too busy chomping on the whale so it wasn't too bad,' he said. The extreme sports enthusiast added his parents were not impressed with his brush with the whale. 'I’ve done it, I don’t need to do it again,' he said. ‘It was definitely a stupid act but I didn't mean any disrespect to anyone. Mum thinks I'm an idiot, and Dad isn't too proud either.'","The removal of the 17 metre whale carcass cost the local council $188,000 .

Chief Justice Shehab al Hammadi of the State Security Court said at the time that ignorance of the law was no defense. An Emirati court last year sentenced eight people, including an American, to up to a year in prison for their role in producing a satirical video about youth culture in Dubai that prosecutors said defamed the country's image. The American, Shezanne Cassim, was released within weeks of the verdict, after having already serving nine months behind bars. The international community was concerned about our dear friend and colleague and we are glad the matter has been resolved. 'We are grateful to the court for its wisdom and compassion.' Dr Black is on a flight back to Atlanta, where he will make his way home to Athens. Although Dr Black's family have not gone into details of his conviction, a fine in a UAE court usually means a criminal record for the defendant. It can also carry immediate deportation and a travel ban on entering the UAE again for a strict time limit, although it is not clear in this case if one has been imposed. His distraught daughter Jessica Beasley and son Scott Black - who is expecting his first child - are waiting to spend time with him before he reveals details of his captivity. His children said they were worried about his health as he languished in prison. He suffers from diabetes, cholesterol and high blood pressure. Dr Black has already suffered a double tragedy in his life after his eldest son Jeff was killed by a drunk driver in 1988 and his wife of 20 years, Merry, fell sick and died a decade later. Friends and family rallied to raise $12,000 in just 24 hours to pay for a lawyer in the UAE after learning of his imprisonment. The legal whizz, who has not been named, successfully managed to persuade the court not to give Dr Black a more hefty penalty. Concerned: Dr Black's son Scott, who lives in Florida with his wife - who is expecting Dr Black's third grandchild says his father is an experienced traveller and respects local cultures . Creative thinker: Dr Black photographed at the conference. He lectures in how to encourage creativity after initially training as an architect . The professor, who has a degree in architecture, three masters and a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of Georgia, was rarely without a camera around his neck. He had only been in the UAE for two days when he was arrested. Detroit-born Dr Black landed at 6.30am on October 19 - exactly a month ago - and checked into the Novotel hotel in Abu Dhabi, where he was an invited speaker at a Creative Thinkers conference. The hotel is a few streets from the restricted embassies' quarter, where security is tight and photography is banned. Dr Black, who was used to spending several hours every morning walking and taking pictures wherever he was, was said to have taken a picture of one of the 'no photography' signs. His friend and conference organiser Mahmoud Arafa said: 'I believe he wanted to post this picture [of the sign] on Facebook because there is nothing like this in the US. 'Photography is his passion. He is always glued to his camera and takes pictures everywhere.' Pictured: Abu Dhabi and its corniche are widely photographed but the country, a close ally of the United States, bans photography is many areas and imposes heft penalties for breaches of its laws .","Dr Alan Black arrested in Abu Dhabi for taking pictures in restricted area .

"When Kamina the baby gorilla was rejected by her mother after birth, human surrogates stepped in to take over the role. And, as these touching photographs show, the adorable youngster doesn't seem to know any differently, thanks to their fur-covered suits. On Monday, Kamina was flown by private jet from Oklahoma City Zoo, where she was born on August 16, to Cincinnati Zoo, where staff hope one of the female gorillas will take the baby in as their own. But before they try to integrate her with the troop, a team of 10 to 15 humans wearing furry vests and gloves will bottle feed and care for Kamina for about 12 to 14 weeks. They will also wear masks because baby gorillas are susceptible to respiratory infections. Scroll down for video . New home: Kamina the baby gorilla is fed at Cincinnati Zoo. She was flown to the zoo after being rejected by her mother in Oklahoma City after her birth last month . Holding on: Kamina was taken out of her mother's care 24 hours after her birth when the female gorilla showed no maternal instincts, putting her baby's life in danger . Settling in: Staff, who cover themselves with gorilla-like fur, are now hand-rearing the baby gorilla for three months before they introduce her to the gorilla troop . Playful: Staff hope that one of the female gorillas at Cincinnati Zoo will take Kamina in as their own when she gets to meet them in a few months . '[Gorillas] need to feel that closeness, they need to feel that love like they should from their mother on day one,' Ron Evans, the primate curator at the Cincinnati Zoo, told the Cincinnati Enquirer. Staff will also move around like gorillas on their knuckles and make what they call 'gorilla vocalizations' to Kamina, a western lowland gorilla, so that she learns the sounds of her family-to-be. 'They start learning life lessons, and language, and rules of etiquette from day one just like we do,' Evans told FOX19. Baby gorillas also rarely leave their mothers' sides, meaning that the zoos in both Oklahoma City and Cincinnati have relied on staff and volunteers to be with Kamina around the clock. But ultimately, the baby will be handed over to her fellow gorillas. She will be ready to leave once she can walk on her own. Heading to her new home: Kamina was flown by private jet - to avoid respiratory illnesses - from Oklahoma City to Cincinnati on Monday with zoo staff . On her way: The fur carried or worn by staff allows Kamina to think she is with other gorillas. Staff also move and make sounds like gorillas . Welcome to Ohio! She clings on to one of her carers as they emerge from the plane. Baby gorillas rarely leave their mothers' sides in their first few months . Kamina was forced to move homes after her mother, Ndjole, did not show any maternal care and put the newborn's life at risk, Oklahoma City Zoo Veterinarian Dr. Jennifer D'Agostino told The Oklahoman. The zoo turned to Cincinnati to see if they would be able to raise the baby, in line with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums guidelines Species Survival Plan. Oklahoma City Zoo staff, including Evans, took the private jet with her to her new home on Monday. 'She was in our laps the whole time. It was incredible.' Evans told the Enquirer. 'You cannot put a gorilla that young into a crate like you could with an older animal.' The zoo recent had success with another rejected gorilla, Gladys, who was also rejected by her mother in Brownsville, Texas. She was flown to Cincinnati in February 2013 and is now arguably the happiest animal in the entire zoo, Evans told FOX19. Staff now hope Kamina will have the same success. Introductions: Dr. Srikant Iyer, from Cincinnati Children's Hospital, examines Kamina in at the Cincinnati Zoo on Tuesday . Checks: Staff hope that Kamina, pictured at the new zoo, will be matched with a mother after another rejected baby gorilla found a home at the zoo last year . Looking good: Dr. Iyer checks on the health four-pound gorilla after she arrives in Ohio earlier this week . Hello there! Specialists at the Gorilla Species Survival Plan from The Association of Zoos and Aquariums oversaw the rescue plan for the endangered creature . Growing girl: Staff will remain will Kamina for 24 hours, seven days a week until she is walking on her own and ready to move in with the troop . They have candidates to take on the role of her mother: Samantha, who has proven to be a good mother, or Mara, who has no children but has shown an inclination to be motherly towards the younger members of the troop. Another baby gorilla, Mondika, was born just two weeks before Kamina, so staff think she'll also have a playmate when she is finally introduced. 'Over the next couple of months they will ease her in,' Oklahoma City Zoo mammal curator Laura Bottaro said. 'It's a very gradual process, and it's important that protocol be followed. But we feel like she's got a great chance to find a mom to take care of her. They've had success there before, just like we have had success finding surrogates for chimpanzees.' Western Lowland gorillas are an endangered species and there are believed to be fewer than 800 in the world. They live in heavy rainforests across central Africa, which makes it difficult for scientists to know their exact numbers. Hopeful: Staff at Oklahoma City Zoo said they were sad to say goodbye to Kamina but know that she has the best chance of meeting a new mother in Cincinnati .","Kamina was born at Oklahoma City Zoo in August but was rejected by her mother .
With no other females who could adopt Kamina, she was flown by private jet to Cincinnati Zoo on Monday .
Staff, wearing fur suits and gloves, will care for her around the clock and move and make sounds like gorillas .
In three months, she will join the gorilla troop; staff are hopeful one of the females will take her in as their own ."
"Jake Berry's chosen tipple from an award-winning brewery in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, has fallen foul of the Commons PC brigade - because its label features black-faced Morris dancers . When an MP was asked to nominate a guest ale from his constituency to be served at a House of Commons bar, he was only too happy to help out. But Jake Berry’s chosen tipple from an award-winning brewery in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, has fallen foul of the Commons PC brigade – because its label features black-faced Morris dancers. The beer from the Irwell Works Brewery was intended to celebrate the Britannia Coconut Dancers from nearby Bacup, who have been performing since 1857 with blacked faces to celebrate the area’s mining heritage. But officials said the image may cause offence, so the beer will be served in the Strangers Bar sporting the Bacup crest instead. Parliamentary chiefs threw out the pale ale which had been specially crafted by a multi award-winning Rossendale brewery, saying the imagery ‘may have caused offence.’ MPs and local politicians slammed the decision, saying it ‘favours political correctness over common sense’. The Coconutters have hit out, saying their traditional black make-up and colourful turbans, red and white kilts and clogs, are a celebration of Lancashire’s mining heritage. It comes days after Will Straw, son of Blackburn MP Jack, was embroiled in a Twitter storm after posting a picture of himself with the morris dancing troupe. Joe Healey, Coconutters secretary, called the decision ‘a real sad shame’. He said: ‘I don’t understand the furore. Some people make caustic comments without understanding the tradition. ‘After recent comments made about us, I felt compelled to go back through our history, and there is no racial element whatsoever. There is no mention of race or ethnicity. ‘Researchers from Sheffield University have done the same, and come to the same conclusion.' Irwell Works Brewery in Ramsbottom dropped the image of the Coconutters from the beer pump and replaced it with the Bacup crest, which will accompany the ale in the Strangers Bar. Mr Berry said: ‘We thought of several names, but as the boundary dance was saved earlier this year, I thought it would be a fitting tribute to name the beer after the Britannia Coconutters, to celebrate their huge contribution to traditional dancing and their charity work across Rossendale. A spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence' ‘The House of Commons authorities did not feel that this would comply with the strict rules they have regarding the naming of guest beers and requested us to choose one of our alternative suggestions. ‘I’m disappointed in the House of Commons Authorities decision. People who live in London obviously have no understanding about our Lancashire traditions.’ Sara D’arcy, managing director of Irwell Works Brewery, said: ‘After Jake suggested we do a beer featuring the Coconutters, I made it up and we sent it down with him. ‘He came back to us and said they thought the picture of them could offend people, so we changed it to the Bacup crest.’ A spokesman for the House of Commons said: ‘The ale offered was not acceptable as the imagery proposed to be used in connection with sales may have caused offence.’","MP Jake Berry was asked to nominate guest ale from his constituency .

"MPs are to spend just two and a half days a week in Parliament after Michael Gove told them they were not likely to be needed on Thursdays. The government chief whip has informed Tory MPs that there will be no major legislation on Thursday afternoons for the foreseeable future. It means they will arrive in Westminster on Monday lunchtime and could leave on Wednesday afternoons. Scroll down for video . Chief  whip Michael Gove has told Tory MPs that Thursdays will be one-line whips, which means there will be no major legislation or debates . The House of Commons has all but ground to a halt in recent months, with almost no legislation to debate. The coalition has reached a logjam, with the Tories and Lib Dems unable to agree on major new laws with six months until the election. This week saw the final stages of the Childcare Payments Bill debated on Monday and the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill passed last night. But today the government has given Labour time to force a vote on the European Arrest Warrant. Tomorrow is given over to backbench business on ‘money creation and society’ and ‘devolution and the union’. Mr Gove has sent an email to Tory MPs making clear that in future all Thursdays will be a one-line whip – meaning that are not required to attend. The Commons was almost empty during a debate on Iran on Thursday November 6. The scene is likely to be repeated in the coming weeks . David Cameron suffered a humiliating first defeat on a Coalition bill today after more than 40 MPs rebelled in a vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer. The Government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to purchase drinks from different brewers, but ministers were left embarrassed after they failed to head-off the backbench rebellion. Chief Whip Michael Gove faced shouts of ‘resign’ and ‘well done, Chief Whip’, after 17 Conservatives and 24 Liberal Democrats voted against the Coalition Government in its first legislative defeat since 2010. The rebellion was particularly embarrassing for Lib Dem Business Minister Jo Swinson, who had spoken for the Government during the debate, after the rebels included her husband Duncan Hames. Matt Hancock, who was one of the ministers responsible for the bill, was reportedly seen ‘grovelling’ to the Prime Minister after the vote. Some of the absent MPs are thought to have been  campaigning ahead of the Rochester and Strood by-election. Departmental questions are held on Thursday mornings, so some MPs will be present. And others will be in Westminster for Thursday afternoon debates or meetings. But many will be able to return to their constituencies to work, and campaign for re-election in May next year. One Tory MP said: ‘Michael was saying that Thursdays are generally a one-line whip. He was emphasising as part of a bigger memo that they are likely to remain one-line whips.’ With no crunch votes to stay for, Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs are also likely to depart from Westminster to return home to campaign for votes. A Conservative spokesman said: 'As advice to Conservative MPs made explicitly clear, if there is a three line whip then MPs will be required to be in parliament, just as has always been the case. 'And just as has always been the case, if there is not a three line whip, they are free to choose whether to work in their constituencies instead.' Despite running out of major legislation, the coalition will go on until May because of a law passed in 2010 creating fixed-term parliaments of five years. It was imposed to prevent the sudden collapse of the power-sharing deal between the Tories and Lib Dems. But critics say it means the government has run out of steam and will limp on for months. Deputy PM Nick Clegg yesterday defended the move. He told MPs: ‘We have legislated for a fixed-term parliament. ‘That is an important constitutional innovation. I personally think that coalition Governments of different compositions are more likely in future. ‘That is why, among many other reasons, it is important that we do what we say and see through this Parliament from end to end until May 2015.’","Chief whip Michael Gove tells MPs there will be no big votes on Thursdays .

"Health benefits: Drinking a large glass of red wine every day could help prevent bowel cancer say researchers . Drinking a large glass of red wine every day could help prevent bowel cancer, researchers claim. Resveratrol, found in the skins of red grapes and which gives the wine its colour, has long been known to have cancer-fighting properties, but scientists did not know how much was needed to be effective. Tests on mice have now shown that a dose equivalent to five milligrams in humans halved the growth of bowel tumours. Five milligrams were far more effective than a one gram dose. Professor Karen Brown, who led the trials at Leicester University, said: ‘Everybody thinks that more is better, but we found that the low dose was more effective. 'We were amazed that it had any effect at all and even more surprised by the effectiveness of the low dose.’ Professor Brown will present her findings this week at Resveratrol 2012, a conference dedicated to research into the compound, at the university. Previous studies have shown even tiny amounts of the compound can reach target tissues in humans. Scientists have been exploring . resveratrol’s potential to reduce the risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s . and even the ageing process. It is available as a supplement, . However, cancer trials involving resveratrol supplements have proved disappointing. Cure: Resveratrol, found in the skin of red grapes has been known to have cancer fighting properties . ‘People do take it as a supplement, but there’s no clinical evidence that this is of any benefit’ said Professor Brown. There is some evidence that very high doses of resveratrol may interfere with certain medicines. ‘We’re still trying to understand the mechanism behind the way resveratrol works and see if it translates to human tissues and cells’ said Prof Brown. Within two years, her team hopes to conduct a human trial on patients at high risk of bowel cancer. Sarah Williams, of Cancer Research UK, warned: ‘People shouldn’t drink wine in an attempt to get any health benefits resveratrol can offer. ‘Alcohol has been estimated to cause around 12,500 cases of cancer a year in the UK. The best way to cut the risk of cancer through alcohol is to drink less.’","Resveratrol, found in the skins of red grapes, has been known to have cancer-fighting qualities but scientists didn't know how much was needed .

"Daphne McDaniels, 24, was arrested for the murders of her two daughters nearly four months after the sisters' bodies were discovered . A mother has been charged with the murder of her two young daughters after the little girls were beaten to death at a home in Quitman, Texas. Daphne McDaniels, 24, was arrested for the murders of one-year-old Natalye Price and Gabriella Guerrero, three, nearly four months after the sisters' bodies were discovered. At the time, her boyfriend Thomas Liles, 19, was arrested for tampering with evidence. Police say he threw away drug paraphernalia  just before  the girls' battered bodies were found. According to KLTV, the autopsy report showed that Gabriella died of multiple blunt force injuries including contusions of the head, trunk and extremities, and lacerations of the liver. Her sister, Natalye, suffered scalp, facial, lung and liver contusions, as well as bruises of the trunk and further injuries. McDaniels has been living in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but she returned to Texas this week to be interrogated and was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder. She is now being held in Wood County jail. Former neighbors told CBS 19 they are not shocked by the arrest. 'Every night and every day, I pray for justice for these babies,' said Selma Bell, who lives just yards from the apartment where the children were found dead. 'That haunts me, it really does.' Ms Bell claims McDaniels verbally abused the kids and she had seen bruises on their faces. 'You should love your children, not harm them if you don't want them take them to someone who will care for them the way they are supposed to be,' she added. In July, Child Protective Services spokesman Shari Pulliam  told KETK NBC that the agency had previously investigated McDaniels' daughter's living conditions. McDaniels (left) has been charged with murder. Her boyfriend Thomas Liles (right) was arrested for tampering with evidence last July. Police say he threw away drug paraphernalia before the girls' bodies were found . In December 2013, allegations of medical and physical neglect were made at another home, where there was no running water, large amounts of trash and debris, and one of the girls had a bump on their leg that was infected. But McDaniels was able to move into adequate and safe housing for her children during the investigation and was also able help caring for her children. The case was completed in February 2014, KETK reported, by which time the mother was living alone with her daughters, who were in daycare while she worked. Liles is was indicted in September and released from the Wood County jail on October 1. Police say that the investigation is ongoing.

"The St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department has released shocking video footage showing the final moments of a 25-year-old black man who was shot by officers after he approached them wielding a knife and shouting ‘shot me’. The incident occurred on Tuesday just four miles from where unarmed teenager Michael Brown had been shot by police on August 9. The dead man has been named as Kajieme Powell, who was reportedly known in the local community as 'disturbed'. The police department announced that it was releasing not only cell phone video taken by a witness, but also the 911 calls, dispatch audio and video showing the man shoplifting, in a bid for complete transparency. Scroll down for video: WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . The man shot dead by police in St. Louis on Tuesday has been named as 25-year-old Kajieme Powell . The owner of the convenience store had called 911 on Tuesday after he suspected Powell had stolen two drinks and donuts from his shop, according to a recording of the call. The security camera footage corresponds with this. The owner of a local beauty salon also called police to report that Powell was acting erratically and had a knife in his pocket. The cell phone footage starts with Powell acting agitated outside the store. He places the two cans  on the ground and then paces about as he waits for the cops to arrive. As the two officers get out of their vehicle, Powell starts walking towards them with a knife - late established to be a steak knife - in his hand and he repeatedly shouts ‘shot me.’ Watch full uncensored video at KWMU . As the two officers get out of their vehicle, Powell starts walking towards them with a knife - late established to be a steak knife - in his hand and he repeatedly shouts 'shot me' When he ignores commands to drop the knife, the two officers fired a total of 12 shots, before cuffing him even though he is dead. 'I don’t think any of us can deny that the tension not only in St. Louis but around the county and the world because of the activities in Ferguson over the last 10 or 12 days certainly has led to us making sure that we got this right and answered as many questions as we could as quickly as we can,' Police Chief Sam Dotson told St. Louis Public Radio. On Tuesday he had said that his officers had opened fire on Powell after he came within three to four feet of them holding a knife 'in an overhand grip.' However the cell phone footage shows Powell not that close to the cops and with his hands at his side. Dotson later acknowledged discrepancies between his Tuesday account and what the video revealed. Final moments: Powell, 25, was apparently known in the local community as 'disturbed' When Powell ignores commands to drop the knife, the two officers fired a total of 12 shots, before cuffing him even though he is dead . He told CNN that although Powell's hands were down by his sides, he was moving toward the officer with a knife in his hand. 'The officers did what I think you or I would do, they protected their life in that situation,' he said. Dotson was asked why the officers hadn't opted for an alternate form of defense like a Taser. 'Certainly a Taser is an option that's available to the officers, but Tasers aren't 100 percent,' he said. 'So you've got an individual with a knife who's moving towards you, not listening to any verbal commands, continues, says, ""shoot me now, kill me now."" 'Tasers aren't 100 percent. if that Taser misses, that [individual] continues on and hurts an officer. 'In a lethal situation, they used lethal force,' he added.","The man shot dead by police in St. Louis on Tuesday has been named as 25-year-old Kajieme Powell .

"The Church of England’s official Twitter feed was branded ‘offensive’ yesterday after a quip about gay marriage and former glamour model Katie Price. A user calling himself ‘Just Skippy’ began the exchange by sending a question to the Church’s Twitter account, @c_of_e. He wrote: ‘Can I ask what @c_of_e thinks about Katie Price marrying for 3rd time making a mockery of marriage yet you are against Homosexual marriage.’ 'Offensive': The Church of England replied to a tweet asking what it thought of Katie Price marrying for the first time .

Having said that, Jordan gets quite a few mentions in the Old Testament’ - a reference to the reality star’s name in her glamour modelling days. While some readers were amused by the unexpectedly light-hearted quip, others took offence - illustrating the pitfalls of trying to communicate to the world in just 140 characters. In fact what followed was an object lesson in the point made by the account’s strapline: ‘We’re here to learn and to engage with the Twitter community and talk about some of the work we do.’ ‘Just Skippy’ - whose profile adds ‘It’s me, Chris’ and describes himself as a ‘39-year-old sort of builder from Birmingham’ - was initially positive, tweeting: ‘Oh that has made me laugh, I could almost forgive you on your stance on gay marriage but I won’t.’ Ministers have unveiled plans to legalise gay marriage following a legal ban on same-sex weddings in the Church of England . Joining in Sunday’s exchange, fellow users pointed out that Miss Price - who last week wed builder and part-time stripper Kieran Hayler, 25, in the Caribbean - would not have been allowed to remarry in most C of E churches anyway.

"A Labour candidate has called for Myleene Klass to leave the country after she criticised Ed Miliband’s proposal for a ‘mansion’ tax. The former Hear’Say singer took the Labour leader to task in a heated TV debate and viewers praised her for ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with him. But she has faced a string of increasingly hostile comments from Labour members and supporters, with some claiming she should leave Britain. Scroll down for video . Labour candidate Paula Sherriff said Myleene Klass should emigrate to avoid the mansion tax . John Clarke, Labour's candidate in Witham, in Essex, said Labour should squeeze the rich until 'the pips squeak' Paula Sherriff, Labour's parliamentary candidate for Dewsbury and Mirfield, West Yorkshire, tweeted: 'If multi-millionaire Myleene Klass doesn't like mansion tax perhaps she should emigrate with Sol Campbell and Griff Rhys Jones! Toodle pip!' Labour campaigner Chris Michaels added: 'I wish Myleene Klass would leave the country.' John Clarke, the party's candidate in Witham, in Essex, added: 'The more Myleene Klass whinges about tax, the more Ed goes up in people's admiration: squeeze 'em till the pips squeak!' Miss Klass was born in the UK but her father is Austrian and her mother is from the Philippines. Former England footballer Mr Campbell and comedian Mr Rhys Jones have both spoken out against the mansion tax in recent months. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said the reaction showed Labour 'really are the nasty party' and criticised its members for making 'knee-jerk personal attacks'. Myleene Klass was pictured at the BBC's Radio One studios  in London today as the controversy over her attack on Ed Miliband continued . Ukip leader Nigel Farage compared the Labour attack on Myleene Klass to Mark Reckless's comments that EU migrants could be deported from Britain . Mr Miliband and Miss Klass clashed on ITV's The Agenda on Monday night, when she criticised his controversial proposal for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million. But after Miss Klass, 36, won widespread praise for her robust challenge, Mr Miliband, 44, sought his revenge on Twitter by joking about her with his 357,000 followers. In a reference to Hear'Say's 2001 number one single Pure and Simple, he wrote: 'Here's why our NHS needs a mansion tax. It's Pure and Simple', adding a link to a blog post where Labour set out the arguments for its mansion tax. Mr Miliband was left humiliated on Monday night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by Miss Klass over Labour’s proposed mansion tax . In a reference to the Hear'Say song, Mr Miliband said the NHS needs a mansion tax 'Pure and Simple' Nick Clegg this morning leapt to Mr Miliband’s defence and argued that the former pop singer was ‘wrong’. Speaking on his LBC phone-in he made light of her suggestion that she would only be able to buy a garage in London with £2m. ‘She’s wrong on that. That’s some garage, he said. ‘What we need to do is get rid of the emotion of claiming that one person’s home is a mansion: why don’t we treat higher value homes [fairly]?’ ‘What is possibly fair about a family who lives in a family home in Lewisham that they pay the same an oligarch?’ Myleene and Ed enjoyed a quick drink with the other panel members, Allison Pearson (centre) and Sir Christopher Meyer (right), and presenter Tom Bradby . Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them.' Miss Klass, who is thought to be worth around £11million, has been accused of opposing the mansion tax only because she is wealthy. Yesterday she ignored the trolls, but on the show, she told Mr Miliband: 'For me, it's so disturbing. The name in its own right - ""mansion tax"". 'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It's like a garage.' She said those hit hardest would be 'the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years'. Mr Miliband responded: 'I totally understand that people don't like paying more in tax. The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.' But former British ambassador to the US Sir Christopher Meyer joined in the debate and angrily told Mr Miliband: 'You're going to screw me royally.' Host Tom Bradby tried to calm things down, saying: 'Ed's getting a bit isolated here.' Miss Klass interrupted: 'Ed's getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work. You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can't just point at things and tax them. You need to have a better strategy and say why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?' Ed Miliband admitted he has problems with photo opportunities, and suggested Kim Kardashian could help him improve his image. The Labour leader has insisted that the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich. He has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t-shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in Manchester. Appearing on ITV's Agenda on Monday night, Mr Miliband held up a spoof newspaper front page, with the headline: 'Em plays the Kim Kard.' It was a reference to Kim Kardashian's expertise at the photo opportunity, and the extraordinary pictures released last week in which she posed naked on the front of Paper magazine, under the headline 'Break the internet'. The images sparked countless spoofs online. Explaining his front page, Mr Miliband said: 'You'll know she ‘broke’ the internet this week with a risque photo opportunity. 'Now all politicians have problems with photo opportunities, me more than most, so I have decided to hire Kim to help me with the photo opportunities.' Mr Miliband was widely mocked after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich in May this year. He suggested he could learn from Kim Kardashian, who appeared on the front cover of Paper magazine last week under the headline: 'Break the internet' Myleene says you can only buy a garage for £2million – in fact it's a sprawling mansion with an indoor swimming pool and a sweeping drive . Myleene Klass joked that in some parts of London buying a property for more than the  proposed £2million Mansion Tax threshold  would probably only stretch to a garage. But  in fact it can secure a mansion in less fashionable parts of the capital and  something even grander outside London - usually with a swimming pool, huge drive and extensive grounds. However, the singer is right about garages being expensive, because last month one in Chelsea sold for an eye-watering £550,000. Overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. This is what £2million can buy you: . Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million. A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years. There are also fears that, if the tax is introduced, the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting Government revenue. In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value. This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966. A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost. Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax. A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry. And for £550,000....

"A radio show host who asked a Canadian politician what it was like to be a sexually-attractive mother has been fired. JetFM DJ Justin 'Drex' Wilcomes asked British Colombia premier Christy Clark the leading question after it was submitted by a male listener during the on-air interview. The 47-year-old mother of one seemed surprised by the question, which used the acronmym MILF, a lewd term referencing a mother's sex appeal. Scroll down for audio . Canadian radio show host Justin 'Drex' Wilcomes, left, quizzed B.C. premier Christy Clark, right, on air . She laughed, and said: 'You know, I take that as a compliment. 'Better a MILF than a cougar, so tell him I said thank you.' The term cougar is used to mean an older woman who seeks the company of much younger men. After the interview, which was broadcast last month, Canadian websites and news programmes discussed the appropriateness both of the DJ posing the question, and of the politician's reply. JetFM, a rock radio station that serves the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island, yesterday said it had released Justin 'Drex' Wilcomes from his employment contract. 'We treat employee matters as private and will not comment further, other than to say that this was an internal decision,' the station said in a statement. Premier: Christy Clark managed to laugh off the comment she was a MILF saying she took it as a compliment . No longer working at the radio station: DJ Justin 'Drex' Wilcomes told another station he was fired because of the attention the question attracted . Working mother: Christy Clark pictured here at a meeting in Edmonton in December 2011 . The politician's office said it had neither complained about the DJ's conduct, nor sought his sacking. The Vancouver Sun reported that Wilcomes had no comment yesterday, but said he told a local radio station that he 'did what was expected of me' as an FM radio station host and called the termination an overreaction. 'I work at a rock station; we do entertainment and comedy,' he said. 'I don’t think it was a bad thing.. ...more the media attention is what they were angry about.' Miss Clark, who has an 11-year-old son, Hamish, by ex-husband political strategist Mark Marissen, has refused to rise to sexist suggestions that either her job or her family might be compromised by her high status role. In a television interview conducted just before she was elected as leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 2011, she compared her position to that of male Canadian Prime Minister, Seven Harper. She said: 'Steven Harper manages to go home for dinner with his kids every night, or most nights when he's in the country, and he has breakfast with them in the morning, and he's a pretty busy guy. 'He does a pretty good job.'","Premier of British Columbia Christy Clark, 47, surprised by sexist question .

"Tensions in Ferguson, Missouri calmed Thursday night, following the withdrawl of National Guard troops and the beginning of a grand jury investigation into the death of black teenager Michael Brown. Protesters continued to gather on West Florissant Ave, near the scene where an unarmed Brown was shot to death by police officer Darren Wilson, but the congregation remained non-violent. The night of peace came after the announcement from Gov Jay Nixon that he would be puling the National Guard out of the St Louis suburb. Scroll down for video . Hoops: Tensions between police and locals in Ferguson were much tamer on Thursday. Above, Highway Patrolmen and a group of young men engage in a friendly game of basketball . Calm: The streets of Ferguson were mostly peaceful Thursday night after the National Guard was dismissed from the St Louis suburb . Tapering: The number of protesters was considerably smaller than previous nights . Investigation: A grand jury began reviewing the case on Wednesday. Above protesters on the street Thursday night . A small band of soldiers with a humvee remained at the Thursday . night protests, but it was quite a contrast to Monday, when the . troops hurled several rounds of tear gas into the crowds. Highway Patrol Capt Ronald S Johnson told the . St Louis Post-Dispatch that he believes it was the National Guard leaving, . and a visit yesterday from Attorney General Eric Holder that brought . peace to the streets of Ferguson. Holder visited Ferguson on Wednesday, as a grand jury begins to investigate Brown's shooting death. 'I think it shows that the process has begun, and people know the President is watching,' Johnson told the Post-Dispatch. Still angry: There are widespread calls by protesters for the resignation of local prosecutor Robert McCulloch . Racial divisions: The protesters have sought to highlight the level of racism still faced by black people in the U.S. Police stand guard along Florissant Avenue but apparently in a less belligerent stance than previously . No justice: Two people side by the street and watch a sombre procession through Ferguson . No peace: Police were still standing ready with clubs and guns but the night passed without incident . Force: Missouri national guard militia stand guard at the command centre where operations have been directed . Bleak future: The killing of Michael Brown has once again raised difficult questions about being black in America . Loyalty: Despite the killing and the questions it's raised, protesters still march brandishing the American flag . Relatively unarmed: Police stand guard along Florissant Avenue to prevent looting by furious demonstrators . The National Guard was called out of Ferguson, Missouri today on the orders of Gov Jay Nixon. A small band remained Thursday night to help police another night of protests, though it was much more peaceful . The National Guard helped secure the streets  of the St. Louis suburb for three nights, beginning on Monday, as hundreds of angry residents took to the street and confronted State Troopers in riot gear. Last night, police arrested only a few people in the protest zones - the quietest night so far. Gov Nixon says the Guard provided security that allowed cops to restore trust with residents. Nixon's announcement comes as St. Louis County's prosecuting attorney issued a defiant letter - typed in all caps - saying he refuses to 'walk away' from investigating the racially-charged shooting of black teen Michael Brown by a white Ferguson police officer. Leaving town: National Guard troops are pulling out of Ferguson four days after Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ordered them there to help keep order . Nixon said the troops have completed their mission, which was helped to provide security while the Missouri Highway Patrol and St. Louis County cops took over . More than 76,000 people have signed a petition demanding that Robert McCulloch be replaced by a special prosecutor. In the letter, McCulloch calls on Gov Nixon to make a decision publicly about whether to remove him from the investigation or to support him staying on. He makes clear that he will not resign of his own accord and says the governor is the only one who can force him to step away from the case. Since demonstrations began after the August 9 shooting of Michel Brown, authorities have arrested at least 163 people in the protest area in Ferguson, a predominantly black city with 50 white police officers and three black officers. 'The situation has greatly improved with fewer incidents of outside instigators interfering with peaceful protesters, and fewer acts of violence,' the governor said. The Ferguson Police Department has been effectively relieved of command and the Missouri Highway Patrol and St. Louis County and St. Louis city police are patrolling the streets of the town. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch (left) asked Governor Jay Nixon (right) to either remove him from the investigation or support him publicly . McCulloch, whose police officer father was killed responding to a call about a black suspect, defended his impartiality and said he would not step down from the investigation . After heavy confrontations between riot cops and protesters on Sunday night, Gov Nixon called up the National Guard to shore up security in the city. Tempers on the streets seem have cooled significantly since then. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that only a few protesters could be seen on the streets Wednesday night into Thursday morning and police stayed mostly in their squad cars parked along Florissant Street - Ground Zero for the protests. Some question McCulloch's ability to be unbiased since his father, mother and other relatives worked for St. Louis police. His father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect. Nixon said this week he is not asking McCulloch to recuse himself. But a McCulloch aide, Ed Magee, said the governor 'didn't take an actual position one way or the other.' McCulloch called for a more definitive decision. He said in a statement that Nixon must 'end this distraction' or risk delay in resolution of the investigation. Federal authorities have launched an independent investigation into Brown's death, and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill told The Associated Press that all of the physical evidence from the case was being flown Thursday from St. Louis to the FBI forensics lab in Quantico, Virginia. The evidence includes shell casings and trajectories, blood patterns and clothing, the Missouri Democrat reported. 'The only thing you have to test the credibility of eye witnesses to a shooting like this is in fact the physical evidence,' McCaskill said. 'I'm hopeful the forensic evidence will be clear and will shed a lot more light on what the facts were.' The Guardsmen helped provide security, but were not responsible for actually policing the streets and making arrests .","Governor Jay Nixon said the National Guard has fulfilled its mission of providing security while State Troopers and county police took over .

"Scientists have finally solved a visual illusion first discovered by Galileo over 400 years ago. He was perplexed to find Venus looked bigger than Jupiter with the naked eye - but not through a telescope. Now, researchers say the effect is an optical illusion that occurs because of the way our eyes see lightness and darkness in the world. Galileo was perplexed to find Venus (left) looked bigger than Jupiter with the naked eye - but not through a telescope. Now researchers claim to have discovered why . The edges of a light object appear blurred and this is effectively magnified by the brain so that the entire object appears bigger than it should. Venus, being nearer to Earth, is brighter than Jupiter and so it appears bigger against the dark background of the night sky. Their results advance our understanding of how our brains are wired for seeing white versus black objects. The work was done by Jens Kremkow and collaborators in the laboratories of Jose Manuel Alonso and Qasim Zaidi at the State University of New York College of Optometry, and will be published on February 10 of 2014 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science . 'Galileo was the first to say that our eye was distorting reality,' Dr Alonso said. 'He could see that Venus appeared to be much larger than Jupiter when seen with the naked eye and that the opposite was true when he looked through his telescope,' Galileo said that the effect was some kind of size illusion created by the eyes. 'Either because their light is refracted in the moisture that cover the pupil, or because it is reflected from the edges of the eyelids and these reflected rays are diffused over the pupil, or for some other reasons,' Galileo wrote. The 19 Century German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz came nearer to the truth when he said that the 'irradiation illusion', as he called it, was caused by our sensation of the object and not by the optics of the eye. 'The latest research demonstrates that the sensation Helmholtz used to explain the irradiation illusion is a ‘non-linear’ response of the visual system when objects are presented on dark backgrounds,' Dr Alonso explained. The phenomenon is related to the way we see black and white-  and also explains why we find black text on a white page easier to read . Galileo was puzzled by the fact that he appearance of the planets hanged depending on whether one looked with the naked eye versus with a telescope. Viewed directly, planets seemed 'expanded' and had 'a radiant crown', which made Venus looked eight to ten times larger than Jupiter even if Jupiter was four times larger. Though Galileo realized this size illusion was not created by the object—but by his eyes—he did not understand why or how. He wrote, 'Either because their light is refracted in the moisture that covers the pupil, or because it is reflected from the edges of the eyelids and these reflected rays are diffused over the pupil, or for some other reason."" Generations of scientists following Galileo continued to assume the illusion was caused by blur or similar optical effects. However, though blur can distort size, it does not explain why Venus looks larger than Jupiter with the naked eye. Hermann von Helmholtz—the venerable 19th Century German physician-physicist—was the first to realize that something else"" was needed to explain the illusion, as he described in his Treatise on Physiological Optics. In this photo, the planet Jupiter is visible as a bright dot on the upper left, with Venus the brightest planet in the center of the frame and the cresent moon is behind the cloud. Scientists have now discovered why Venus looks bigger than Jupiter . The researchers say the results also show why we prefer black text on a white background . Only now, with Kremkow and colleagues' new study, has science finally zoomed in and illuminated the scope of the problem. It's a feature of how we see everything, no less. In the new study, Alonso and his colleagues used electrodes to record the electrical signals from neurons in the visual areas of anesthetized cats, monkeys and human brains while the researchers showed the animal and human participants dark shapes on a light background, light shapes on a dark background, or light or dark shapes on a gray background. So white spots on a black background look bigger than same-sized black spots on white background, and Galileo's glowing moons are not really as big as they might appear to the unaided eye. This effect is responsible for how we see everything from textures and faces—based on their dark parts in bright daylight—to why it is easier to read this very page with black-on-white lettering, rather than white-on-black (a well known, and until now, unexplained phenomenon). By tracing these effects as a function of the way neurons are laid out and interconnected in the retina and brain, the authors found that the illusion is potentially derived from the very origin of vision—in the photoreceptors of the eye themselves.","Experts say key is the way our eye processes black and white .
Also explains why we prefer reading black on white text .

"Disney reopened a controversial attraction at its Orlando theme-park on Friday after it was removed over claims it mocked fat children. Habit Heroes an interactive educational program at Epcot was launched last February with the aim of helping kids live more healthily. Its animated characters depicting a rotund fairy called Snacker; an exercise averse character called Lead Bottom and a greedy baddy known as The Glutton were battled by happy and fit action figures called Will Power and Callie Stenics when the attraction first opened. Scroll down for video . Out: Animated characters first used in the Epcot attraction Habit Heroes were deemed too mean to obese children, pictured. The educational tour was reopened this week removing the obese figures altogether . Write caption here . But for many the message went too far and complaints flooded in that the exhibit stigmatized overweight children. The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance said in a statement: 'We're appalled to learn that Disney, a traditional hallmark of childhood happiness and joy, has fallen under the shadow of negativity and discrimination. 'It appears that Disney now believes that using the tool of shame, favored so much by today's healthcare corporations, is the best way to communicate with children'. Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, an assistant professor of family medicine, told the Calgary Herald, 'It's so dumbfounding it's unreal. I just can't believe somebody out there thought it was a good idea to pick up where the school bullies left off and shame kids on their vacation.' The sight was closed after a month but reopened on Friday minus the taunting characters, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

'When the attraction had its soft opening last February, the creative team sought guest feedback,"" said Brent Strong, creative director for Walt Disney Imagineering, who oversaw the project told the Sentinel this week. 'We found that some pieces were getting in the way of our story, which is that healthy living can make us all feel like super heroes. We had to try to tell that story in a different way.' This time the theme park sought input from experts in obesity and removed all the obese characters. 'Rather than single out one population, this message reminds guests that everyone is responsible for health choices as individuals, within their families and finally in their communities,' Tony Jenkins from the insurance firm Florida Blue, which sponsors the ride, told the Sentinel.

"Speaking out: Ireland Hobert-Hoch, 13, said she didn't want to be aware of how much she weighed . A 13-year-old student was sent to the principal's office after refusing to be weighed in front of her classmates during gym class. A teacher at Southeast Polk Junior High in Pleasant Hill, Iowa was measuring the heights and weights of students to calculate their body mass index when Ireland Hobert-Hoch said no. She said she did not want to be weighed because it made her - and other classmates - uncomfortable and she does not think she should be worried about her weight. 'I don't feel like it's their business,' she told the Des Moines Register. 'I feel like it's my doctor and my mom and my own business. Maybe not even my own because I don't need to know that right now.' But the teacher would not allow the straight-A student to sit it out - and instead sent her to the principal's office. School principal Mike Daily said the teenager was not sent to him because of her refusal but because of how it 'was presented to the teacher', HuffPo reported. He said that students have been getting their heights and weights measured as part of the FitnessGram program since before he started at the school four years ago. He said the results are confidential. The school board will discuss the issue at upcoming meetings and will decide if it should continue. Staff say that the measurements are required to assess the child's health. Support: Her mother, Heather Hobert-Hoch, said she does not want her daughter to be worried about her body or what she is eating. The school told her that they are the first family to ever complain . The girl's mother, Heather Hobert-Hoch, said that when she called the school to complain about how her daughter had been treated, the school offered no apologies for how it had acted. 'When I voiced my concerns they said, ""We've done this for years, and you are the only one complaining"",' she told the Register. Ireland said she wanted to step forward so that other girls who felt uncomfortable didn't have to have their weights taken either. She said that while she was talking with the teacher about it, some students just told her to do it so that she didn't get in trouble. But still, she refused. Scene: Staff at Southeast Polk Junior High School said the tests were carried out to determine if the students have healthy BMIs. They will be discussing the issue at upcoming board meetings . 'I don't want other people being weighed,' she said. 'I thought if I did that then... it would make other people stand up and say no - which it did.' She said that she had been brought up to not be concerned about her weight or how she looked. '[My mother] told me that you don't need to know that, it's not important. It doesn't make up who are. She didn't want me to constantly worry about what I weigh - like other girls,' she said. Her mother, Heather, said that the family stopped using a scale years ago and she has noticed that her daughter has been much happier since. 'I wanted to get rid of it as an issue', she said. 'I didn't want it to affect her eating. I just don't want her to become so worried about weight that it defines who she is.'","Students at Southeast Polk Junior High in Iowa were getting their heights and weights measured so staff could calculate if they had healthy BMIs .

"And the winner is... well, nobody. That seemed to be the only result after two Indian beauty queens aiming to impress visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi both ended up looking like losers. One because she hosted the gathering after claiming to be Miss India Australia 2014 when she wasn't, and the other because, although she was Miss India Australia 2014, the confusion meant she missed out on the opportunity to host the lavish event herself in Sydney for India's leader. Mr Modi is the first Indian leader to visit Australia in 28 years. The Herald Sun reported that the claws were out between the two battling beauties, Rashi Kapoor and Phalguni Kataria, after Australian Football League multicultural ambassador Ms Kapoor hosted a get-together for the Indian Primer Minister as Miss India Australia 2014 when the title actually belonged to Ms Kataria. Miss India Australia 2014, Phalguni Kataria, felt hard done by at not being asked to host a special event in Sydney for visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Ms Kataria said she was devastated at missing out on the opportunity to host the event and 'utterly shocked someone else is claiming to be Miss India Australia'. While Ms Kapoor said it was all just a simple misunderstanding. Ms Kapoor said she usually went by her title, Miss India Global, and it was the Indian media that was at fault for the mix up. Miss India Australia 2013, Rashi Kapoor, blamed the Indian media for the misunderstanding . 'I would never portray myself as something I am not. They got confused and I didn’t want to correct them. It was an event for the Prime Minister, not me,' she told the Herald Sun. 'I actually won Miss India Global in 2013. That’s what my trophy says.' But Ms Kataria said: 'That (Miss India Australia) is my title. I worked hard for it.' Ms Kataria was 'utterly shocked someone else is claiming to be Miss India Australia' 'I had thought that it would be me who would be asked to host the Prime Minister, like Miss India USA had done in America. 'I cannot believe that someone else can just step in and do it and take this honour from me.' Miss India Australia organiser Reena Koak believed it was unfair Ms Kapoor was portrayed as the 2014 titleholder as Ms Kataria now held the crown. Ms Kapoor said she usually went by the title of Miss India Global, although this was disputed . Ms Kapoor was crowned Miss India Australia in 2013, but it was claimed she currently held the title of Miss India Melbourne, not Miss India Global. Organiser Anamika Srivastava admits that a printing error may have resulted in the wrong titles appearing on Ms Kapoor’s sash and trophy.

"An advert for a popular brand of pantyliners has sparked outrage after viewers complained it contained language they deemed offensive. The 30 second television commercial by Johnson & Johnson brand Carefree dispenses with the customary euphemisms and sanitised suggestions at bodily functions. Instead, the actress in the advert talks openly about the woman's monthly cycle - mentioning the words 'vagina' and 'discharge'. Frank: Johnson & Johnson say their decision to use the words 'vagina' and 'discharge' was very conscious. 'We wanted to take a bold approach' The actress in the commercial, naked but for a scattering of flower petals to protect her modesty, says to the camera that 'even that bit of discharge in between our period is our body working to keep the vagina healthy.' She goes on to say that Carefree pads 'lock away wetness and odour, helping you to feel dry, clean and fresh every day.' Such references may seem entirely innocuous to most. But after the advert, created by ad firm 303Lowe, aired for the first time on Monday night in New Zealand, the Advertising Standards Bureau (ASB) received nine complaints, with viewers objecting particularly to the words 'vagina' and 'discharge'. Offence: Some viewers were uncomfortable with the language used, and nine made complaints to the Advertising Standards Bureau . The advert, which carries a GXC rating, meaning it can be shown at any time except for during programmes that specifically target children under the age of 13, has been given the green light by the advertising standards authority. Carefree spokesman Debbie Selikman told NSM that the company made a very conscious decision to use frank language. 'It's the first time a major brand has had the guts to use real words, not euphemisms or diminutive terms,' Selikman told NineMSN. New Zealand media blog Stop Press reported that parent company Johnson & Johnson created the Carefree ad in response to a study that showed women would welcome a more honest conversation about their bodies, and revealed that 71 percent of Australian women admit to experiencing discharge while 66 percent are bothered by it. Michelle Forster of Johnson & Johnson Pacific, the company that owns Carefree, said: 'We have decided to take a bold approach in this campaign with the aim to tackle a subject which as always been taboo. 'We want to encourage women to talk openly about their bodies, educating them both on discharge and the benefits of using Carefree act-fresh liners on a daily basis.'

"13 years after her father died responding to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Josephine Smith is carrying on his legacy by becoming the first daughter of a 9/11 responder to join the New York Fire Department. It was an emotional moment for Smith, 34, graduating the FDNY academy Tuesday, full of pride for her family but sadness that 'my father couldn't be here.' 'I've made it a mission to make sure that I fulfilled my dream of becoming a city firefighter and following in my father's footsteps,' she said, crying shortly after the service ended. Josephine Smith is the first daughter of a 9/11 responder to join the New York Fire Department . Josephine Smith's father Kevin was among the 340 firefighters killed in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center . NBC News that Smith's father Kevin was in one of the units that faced the most danger. About 340 firefighters died in the attack, which happened when Smith was 21-years-old. 'Kevin was a part of one of the units hit most hard that day: Hazmat 1,' Mayor Bill de Blasio told the graduates. 'Josephine out of that tragedy devoted herself to service.' The graduation has been a longtime goal for Smith who used to follow her dad to work and play on the fire engines . Mother Angela Clay believed that were Kevin here today he'd be an extremely proud father and would've had words of advice for his girl: 'Do a good job. Keep your head straight. Your heart in it. And love your job.' Most important, Angela said, 'she's made herself proud about what she's accomplished today. And that's our goal with her.' The graduation has been a longtime goal for Smith who used to follow her dad to work and play on the fire engines. Mayor Bill de Blasio told the graduates that Josephine's father was among the units hit hardest . She still wears her father's bracelet and carries a memorial card in her hat. 'There's not a second that goes by I don't think of my father. There's so much that reminds me of him,” she said. 'Being a firefighter himself, he knows what comes with the job. But he would know it I'd be able to handle it, he knows how strong I am,' she said.","Josephine Smith has becomed the first daughter of a 9/11 responder to join the New York Fire Department .

"German chancellor Angela Merkel raised eyebrows when she was pictured alongside children with blacked-up faces on the steps of the chancellery in Berlin earlier today. Fortunately for the CDU leader, the visiting children were not part of a political stunt but carol singers dressed up as the three wise men for the German Twelfth night, known as Three Kings' Day. As Ms Merkel joined in the charity carolling, news came that her coalition partners, the Free Democrat Party, are struggling to stay in parliament. Controversial: German chancellor Angela Merkel, right, looks at a caroller, depicting one of the Three  Kings  during a reception for carol singers from all over Germany at the chancellery in in Berlin today . The Chancellor’s Christian Democrats are riding high in national polls at about 40 per cent, but as her partners in power, the Free Democrat Party (FDP), meet in Stuttgart this weekend their future looks bleak. Current polls indicate that the FDP would fall short of the 5 per cent threshold to enter parliament, meaning Merkel would be forced to seek a coalition with the Social Democratic or Green Parties in order to secure a third term in government. The FDP’s support has fallen from a record 14.6 per cent in the 2009 election to four per cent in a recent poll. Although the costumes of the children . may appear controversial, the blacked-up faces of the children joining the Chancellor today is part . of the Sternsinger, or star singer, tradition of Dreikönigstag, the . Three Kings' Day, when children go from house to house in groups of . four and sing carols for charity. It is tradition that one of the kings are black and it is not seen as racist, but part of the traditional costume. Traditional celebration: Children carol singers, some with traditional 'blackened' faces, sing for charity with Ms Merkel in celebration of the German Twelfth Night - Three Kings' Day .

"Scientists have created the most detailed computer simulation of the history of the universe. This new virtual cosmos, designed by U.S., German and British researchers, comes complete with twisting galaxies, exploding gas clouds and mysterious black . holes. Called Illustris, the numerical-based model covers the 13 . billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12 million years after . the Big Bang. Scroll down for video... Scientists have created the most detailed computer simulation of the history of the universe.. Pictured is the cosmic web from 1 to 4 billion years after the Big Bang . The simulation, which accurately depicts the distribution . and composition of various types of galaxies, was developed by a team led by . astrophysicist Mark Vogelsberger of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It covers cosmic evolution in a cube with a side length 350 million light-years with unprecedented resolution. ‘Until now, no single simulation was able to reproduce the . universe on both large and small scales simultaneously,’ said Professor . Vogelsberger. Previous attempts to simulate the universe were hampered by . lack of computing power and the complexities of the underlying physics. The model recreates structures like galaxy clusters and the bubbles and voids of the cosmic web. Shown here the varying gas temperatures of the universe as it evolves . This image shows dark matter density, left, transitioning to gas density, right, in a simulation of the evolution of the universe since the Big Bang.

Illustris was developed by a team led by astrophysicist Mark Vogelsberger of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The numerical model covers the 13-billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12-million years after the Big Bang. The Illustris creators say it represents 'a significant step forward in modelling galaxy formation.' They attribute its success to advanced computer power. The team dedicated five years to developing the Illustris . program. The actual calculations took 3 months of ‘run time,’ using a total of . 8,000 computer processing units running in parallel. As a result those programs either were limited in . resolution, or forced to focus on a small portion of the universe. Earlier simulations also had trouble modelling complex . feedback from star formation, supernova explosions, and supermassive black . holes. The team dedicated five years to developing the Illustris . program. The actual calculations took 3 months of ‘run time,’ using a total of . 8,000 computer processing units running in parallel. If they had used an average desktop computer, the . calculations would have taken more than 2,000 years to complete. The computer simulation began a mere 12 million years after . the Big Bang. When it reached the present day, astronomers counted more than . 41,000 galaxies in the cube of simulated space. Importantly, Illustris yielded a realistic mix of spiral . galaxies like the Milky Way and football-shaped elliptical galaxies. It also recreated large-scale structures like galaxy . clusters and the bubbles and voids of the cosmic web. On the small scale, it . accurately recreated the chemistries of individual galaxies. Since light travels at a fixed speed, the farther away . astronomers look, the farther back in time they can see. A galaxy one billion light-years away is seen as it was a . billion years ago. Telescopes like Hubble can give us views of the early . universe by looking to greater distances. However, astronomers can't use Hubble . to follow the evolution of a single galaxy over time. ‘Illustris is like a time machine. We can go forward and . backward in time,’ said co-author Shy Genel. ‘We can pause the simulation and zoom into a single galaxy . or galaxy cluster to see what's really going on.’ The numerical model covers the 13-billion-year evolution of the universe beginning just 12-million years after the Big Bang.

"An internet troll who harassed successful sellers on eBay in a bid to put them out of business has been exposed after years of abuse. Charles 'Chuck' Fitch, from Canton, Michigan, is said to be the man behind the mask who calls himself Ebayisajoke and harasses not only the ecommerce website and PayPal but also those who use it. A television reporter in Detroit, Michigan, hired private investigators to track down the man who targeted individual customers, sending them a torrent of threatening abuse. Scroll down for video . Calling himself Ebayisajoke, the troll wears a Guy Fawkes mask and alters his voice to attack eBay and sellers . Local TV reporter Rob Wolchek says this man, whom he identified as Charles 'Chuck' Fitch, is the troll . They found him living in an apartment in the commuter town of Canton, but when they confronted Mr Fitch, an obese bachelor who appears to live by himself and stay inside most of the day, he did not deny accusations that he was Ebay's worst troll. Ebayisajoke, who has his own YouTube channel, dedicates his time to trying to 'expose' the internet auction site, accusing it of various crimes and wrongdoings, and talking on camera - hidden by a ghoulish Guy Fawkes mask - about how sellers should use alternative sites. Using voice alteration software to help keep his identity hidden, he also uses his films to accuse sellers on eBay of malpractice.  It is believed Ebayisajoke began his abuse, much of which is found on his blog ebayblows.org, after he was shut down by the site for breaking their rules. TV reporter Rob Wolchek, who tracked him down, told MailOnline the scale of Ebayisajoke's trolling stretched back several years and had been targeted at victims right across America and as far as the UK. He said: 'He has allegedly been a suspect in many trolling cases in many different forums for the last few years.  I think he has been doing this for years and years and years. 'There was someone from England who posted online that he had been having some kind of a war with this guy.' One of the troll's targets is the successful eBay seller Joe DeMarco, who expanded his Detroit hubcab shop Hubcaps Joe's into a thriving online business.  Mr DeMarco, of Oradell, NJ, became so good at selling online, he even produced videos showing other people how to do it. According to My Fox Detroit's Wolchek, Ebayisajoke decided to target Mr DeMarco, claiming he abused eBay's Significantly Not As Described . buyer's claim, which is said to let users get a free refund on anything . they buy if it is not what they were expecting. In one online rant, Ebayisajoke said: 'I'm going to ruin you in every conceivable manner.  First I'm going to target your eBay account...' Side view: In one rant, the troll turns away from the camera, revealing shaved grey hair rather like Mr Fitch . The My Fox Detroit reporter approached this man, naming him as Charles Fitch, as he left the cinema . Silent: The man, named as Fitch, did not reply to claims that he was the troll Ebayisajoke and drove away . No Slim Jim: The thick neck of the man behind the Ebayisajoke mask looks rather like that of Mr Fitch . In another, he says: 'You are going to lose your business and I'm going to be sitting back, laughing about it.' Mr DeMarco told My Fox Detroit: 'He is sick; he is actually sick in the head.' Wolchek, who was the first reporter to unmask the serial troll, says Ebayisajoke's method is to target small business owners, outbid everyone else and then refuse to pay, so that the seller's sale fell through. He would also then give the seller a bad review, something sellers on eBay, where reputation is everything, fear above all. Busy online presence: The troll issues video clips decrying eBay, PayPal and those who sell on eBay from his home . The man identified as the online bully got into this truck and drove away from reporters without comment . Investigators hired by Wolchek identified the troll as Charles 'Chuck' Fitch, and after days of watching him leave his apartment only to buy lunch at Subway or to hit Walmart, the reporter confronted him after he went to the cinema by himself. Wolchek approached the man and put it to him that he was the man behind Ebayisajoke, a claim Fitch, who got into his truck and drove away, did not refute. According to theDailyDot.com, Fitch seemed more concerned with his online persona, writing afterwards: 'As far as Ebayisajoke is concerned they didn’t expose anything and everything he was doing online was in fact legal.' Mr DeMarco is said to have reported the troll to the FBI. VIDEO: WATCH THE MY FOX DETROIT REPORT INTO THE EBAY TROLL .","Ebay-hating troll named as Charles 'Chuck' Fitch of Canton, Michigan .

"Britons get happier rather than grumpier with age, according to a new survey which reveals we find our greatest contentment at 58. The research suggests that people in the UK finally manage to get the work-life balance right towards the end of their working lives as they hit a golden age of satisfaction when silver-haired. The study, commissioned for the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, also found that the age associated with the greatest stress is 35 - as they juggle the pressures of a young family with a demanding stage in their careers. Scroll down for video . A survey of working people found Brits became happiest with their work-life balance at the age of 58 (file image) Analysis of the study of 2,000 people found 58 was the age at which the highest proportion of people were happy with the balance of work and leisure, as well as feeling good about their lifestyle. They were also more likely to have a proper lunch break and stick to their contracted hours rather than working unpaid overtime. A third of those who took part in the survey, to mark the launch of the new Samsung model today, said they were unhappy with their work-life balance. The biggest key to contentment was spending time with family, according to almost two-thirds (63%) of those who took part - while the second most important factor was doing a job they loved. Financial worries were the biggest cause of stress. Professor Cary Cooper, from the University of Lancaster, said: 'It’s little wonder that our 30s are so stressful as we try - sometimes desperately - to juggle high-pressure jobs and family demands whilst maintaining happy relationships. The age at which people are most stressed was given at 35 when many men and women start a family but also have to meet the demands of high-stress jobs . 'And then by the time we reach our 50s, we feel much more confident - allowing us to set the agenda when it comes to working hours and family life. 'It is also interesting to note that spending time with family and being in a happy relationship score most highly in making us feel happy, while money is the top source of stress.' Marketing director of IT and mobile for Samsung, Ines van Gennip, said: 'It seems the old adage of ""good things come to those who wait"" is true, at least in life, with those aged in their 50s likely to be the most content. 'In our fast-paced busy lives, finding the balance between work and life has never been harder so make the most of the time you have by being really organised.'","Britons finally strike work-life balance as they approach their sixties .

"Despite Britain being considered a culinary melting pot, the average Brit can only cook four foreign dishes - spaghetti Bolognese, curry, stir fry and risotto, a study revealed . And we are woefully lacking in global gastronomic knowledge, with more than half (60 per cent) unaware that gazpacho is Spanish and more than a quarter (30 per cent) unsure of what a falafel is. The findings also showed that there is a staggering £240 million worth of unused herbs and spices going to waste in the kitchen cupboard - with 13 per cent of the nation hoarding spices that are more than four years old. Scroll down for video . The average Brit can only cook four foreign dishes - spaghetti Bolognese, curry, stir fry and risotto (pictured) The average homeowner has ten different types of herbs and spices in their their kitchen . The average homeowner has ten different types of herbs and spices in their kitchen, with basil, chilli and oregano the ones we use most when cooking at home. Exotic ingredients including ras el hanout (North African spice mix),  star anise and marjoram are the three Brit cooks use the least. The research by Kenwood suggests our reluctance to experiment with more adventurous dishes is to blame. 1. Spaghetti Bolognese (70%) 2. Indian Curry (62%) 3. Chinese Stir Fry (60%) 4. Risotto (40%) 5. Mexican Chilli (39%) 6. BBQ Ribs (32%) 7. Thai Curry (30%) 8. Caesar salad (28%) 9. Paella (25%) 10. Lamb tagine (18%) 1. Basil (44%) 2. Chilli (41%) 3. Oregano (30%) 4. Coriander (30%) 5. Ginger (29%) 6. Rosemary (28%) 7. Paprika (22%) 8. Parsley (19%) 9. Cinnamon (19%) 10. Thyme (17%) Astonishingly, the research revealed 60 per cent don't know that gazpacho comes from Spain, and 30 per cent are not sure what a falafel is, with seven per cent confusing it with baklava, a rich, sweet pastry made of layers of filo, chopped nuts and honey, and a further seven per cent believing it is an unleavened flatbread. From left to right: Basil, chilli and oregano are the herbs and spices used the most in British kitchens . It also found 17 per cent (one in six) can cook no more than one international dish and more than a quarter (27 per cent) use ready-made sauces rather than starting from scratch. Meanwhile, 25 per cent admit they have to rely on takeaways or restaurants to get their foreign food fix. Two thirds (62 per cent) have cooked an Indian curry at home, yet just one in seven (15 per cent) have added turmeric to their dishes, 10 per cent have experimented with mustard seeds and a mere two per cent tried cooking with cardamom. Food historian Seren Evans-Charrington said: 'The British palate has continually embraced new flavours and cuisines through the ages. Lacking in knowledge: 60% of Brits are unaware that gazpacho (left) comes from Spain more than a quarter (30%) are unsure of what a falafel (right) is, with 7% believing its a sweet dessert rather than a savoury snack . 'But perhaps we are more open to tasting and experiencing 'new' dishes than cooking them. 'In the home kitchen, when a family needs to be fed, it can be easy to stick to a repertoire of tried and tested recipes.' Seb Goff, Kenwood Trade Marketing Manager, added: 'We were staggered how many millions of pounds worth of herbs and spices are going to waste. 'We know Brits continually embrace new flavours and cuisines, but it seems we're not confident enough to experiment with them in our own homes.' The company has teamed up with six chefs,  Matt Tebbutt, Andy Bates, Celia Brooks, Shelina Permalloo, Zoe Adjonyoh and Anjum Anand to create downloadable e-booklet Around the World in 80 Plates, designed to encourage home cooks to try creating exotic dishes from scratch.","Basil, chilli and oregano used the most in home cooking .

"One of Britain’s most senior Roman Catholics has sparked fury by suggesting an MP and former minister died because he was gay. The new Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, said society had kept ‘very quiet’ about the death of Labour MP and former Scotland Office minister David Cairns. Mr Cairns, a former Catholic priest himself, died in May last year at the age of 44 from acute pancreatitis. But Bishop Tartaglia questioned why his body ‘just shut down’. Bishop Philip Tartaglia (left) has been urged to apologise after he reportedly linked the death of MP David Cairns (right) to his homosexuality . At a conference on religious freedom . held at Oxford University, he said: ‘If what I have heard is true about . the relationship between the physical and mental health of gay men, then . society is being very quiet about it. ‘Recently in Scotland, there was a . gay Catholic MP who died at the age of 44 or so, and nobody said . anything, and why his body just shut down at that age. ‘Obviously he could have had a disease that would have killed anybody. ‘But you seem to hear so many stories . about this kind of thing, but society won’t address it.’ A source close . to David Cameron said the Prime Minister believed the Archbishop’s . remarks were ‘totally unacceptable’. Mr Cairns’s partner of 15 years, . Dermot Kehoe, accused him of delivering a ‘hate speech’, and said the . comments had added to his grief. Mr Kehoe said the bishop’s ‘ignorance . and prejudice should not go unchallenged’. He wrote on Twitter: . ‘Tartaglia’s comments are hate speech. He has position of moral . leadership and should not speak from ignorance of the facts... Distressing and painful.’ Bishop Tartaglia (right) is taking over as Archbishop of Glasgow from Mario Conti (pictured, left) A spokesman for Archbishop Tartaglia said his words had been ‘taken out of context’ and had been made in a lecture 14 weeks ago. He said he had been asked a question . ‘which was not related to his speech. In his reply he mentioned a . situation he had been closely involved in, namely the funeral . arrangements for the late David Cairns. ‘The Archbishop knew David . Cairns, met him regularly at events in Inverclyde, and got on well with . him, and was personally involved in his funeral arrangements. Archbishop-elect Tartaglia (pictured) is an outspoken opponent of gay marriage . . He is . sorry for any hurt which has resulted, there was certainly no offence or . judgment intended in his words.’ But Mr Kehoe rejected the apology and . accused the Archbishop of using the situation to ‘influence the . Government’ to stop its plans for same-sex marriage. Labour Leader Ed . Miliband, who was visiting Edinburgh yesterday, said the Archbishop’s . comments had caused hurt. ‘I think, knowing the circumstances . of what actually happened to David, he will recognise that his comments . were wrong,’ he said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . wrote on Twitter: ‘Comments from Archbishop of Glasgow on the much . missed David Cairns are deeply wrong, shocking and distressing. Hope he . will now withdraw.’ Mr Cairns successfully fought to overturn a 19th . Century law and become the first former Catholic priest to become an MP. He remained a devout Catholic . throughout his life and represented the constituency where he was born, . Greenock in the west of Scotland. He was the first minister to exit . Gordon Brown’s government, in September 2008, after becoming . disillusioned with his leadership.He also piloted legislation to protect . shop workers from being forced to work on Sundays. His death, after a short but painful . illness, came just weeks after he was admitted to hospital suffering . from acute pancreatitis.

"He was destined for the pot – if they had found one big enough to fit. But Claude the Tasmanian giant crab was saved from death when the fisherman who caught him sold him to a British aquarium  for £3,000. Now, after a 29-hour plane journey from Australia – where giant crab meat is a delicacy – and two weeks in quarantine, Claude is ready to meet his public. Catch of the day: Held up by Sealife aquarist Jemma Battric, Claude weighs a mighty 15lbs and measures 15 inches wide - when he is fully grown he will weigh a whopping 30lbs and gain an extra three inches . Lucky escape: The Tasmanian King Crab is a delicacy in its native Australia and was destined for the dinner table until it was snapped up by a British aquarium worker. He paid £3,000 for three and had them flown to the UK . He is the biggest crab on display in the UK and weighs a mighty 15lb with a 15-inch shell – enough to make 160 crab cakes. Claude is 100 times bigger than a standard UK shore crab. Yet he is still a juvenile and will grow to double his weight. Claude was caught off the coast of . Tasmania last month, but was sold to the Sea Life group along with two . other Tasmanian giant crabs. He will go on display at the Sea Life . centre in Weymouth, Dorset, on Thursday, and his two companions will . be  moved to other centres in Birmingham and Berlin if Claude responds . well to his new home. Currently he is being kept on his own . in a specially made cylindrical tank, ten feet tall and six feet wide, . but the aquarium will introduce some coldwater fish once he is settled. Mini me: Claude dwarfs a British Shore crab who is put on his back for size and to show just how gigantic he is . Big crab, small appetite: 'The crabs don't eat very much despite being one of the largest species and they will feed on shrimp, prawns, and squid when they are here,' said Jemma Battrick, aquarist at Weymouth Sea Life . In the wild, crabs eat any dead or dying matter they find on the seabed . but Claude is currently dining on diced mackerel and squid and is . reportedly very happy with his gourmet diet. Rob Hicks, head marine biologist for . Sea Life, said: ‘They are such impressive creatures we thought that it . was worth the cost and effort of flying them halfway round the world so . they can flourish in an aquarium display. ‘They had a stopover in Hong Kong and . arrived with us two weeks ago. It took them a few days to get over the . jet-lag but now they’re feeding happily and don’t seem any the worse for . their trip.’ Jemma Battrick, aquarist at Weymouth Sea Life said: 'When I found out we were getting the crabs in I was really excited. Massive claws: Rob Hicks, head marine biologist for Sea Life, said: 'They are such impressive creatures we thought that it was worth the cost and effort of flying them half-way round the world to so they can flourish in an aquarium display' 'We already have a tank here for them so it will be easy to move them in, and they will go on display straight away. 'The crabs don’t eat very much despite being one of the largest species and they will feed on shrimp, prawns, and squid when they are here. 'We want to increase their numbers but in Australia people eat them and I think visitors to the Sea Life will be shocked when they find that out because they look so magnificent.'",Claude weighs a mighty 15lbs and measures 15 inches wide and would have produced 20lbs worth of meat .
"An empty piece of land on the world-renowned Sandbanks peninsula has gone on the market for £6.25million – more than the price of a 38-bedroom castle in the Scottish Highlands. The muddy plot, the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market, is now priced at £2m more than when it came with two houses. Despite being empty, the plot is the same price as an entire estate on the south shore of Loch Rannoch, Perthshire, which includes a castle, a swimming pool, 12 extra villas or bungalows, a sports hall, a golf course, a shooting range and an army assault course. If it sold at the asking price, the plot - which measures 27m by 18m - will equate to a staggering £1,161 per square foot. Scroll down for video . This narrow empty plot of land in the world-renowned Sandbanks area has gone on the market for a staggering £6.25million . The plot, the latest in the so-called Millionaires' Row to go on the market, is now priced at £2m more than when it came with two houses . The area, which measures 27m by 18m and already has planning permission, will equate to £1,161 per square feet if it sells for the asking price . But looking at it from another point of view - literally - it's perhaps easy to see why the small area has gone on the market for such an eye-watering sum. The reason that the sliver of land is set to fetch such an eye-watering sum is because it backs onto the beach and is located on the narrowest part of the peninsula, meaning that it boasts two-way views, including over Poole Harbour. A property two doors down holds the record for the most expensive house on the peninsula per square foot. The detached house sold last year for £3.45million, which worked out as £1,725 per square foot. Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property and counts Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie among its residents. Prices in the area have soared in the past few years, with prospective buyers  even able to get more for their money in the exclusive London neighbourhood of Mayfair. At the moment, £6.75million could give buyers a two-bedroom flat, within spitting distance of Hyde Park. The latest plot in the exclusive resort has gone on the market after the owner decided to stay put in the house he currently rents. The owner initially bought the land, which included two 1960s houses, with the intention of building his dream home in their place. But while the planning application was being considered, he fell in love with the property he was living in and decided to remain there. He went ahead with knocking down the two houses on the Sandbanks plot, later securing permission for two four-bed houses, complete with their own gym and swimming pool. The planning permission stipulates that the twin properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively and would be set over four floors with a terrace running all the way around. But whoever buys the land could face spending an additional £1million on building the new homes. When the existing owner bought the property, it consisted of two houses (pictured) which he knocked down to make way for his dream home . The site, situated in the sought-after resort of Sandbanks, backs onto the beach and boasts two-way views, including over Poole Harbour . Whoever buys the plot will face spending about £1m each on building the two new homes, which will be four-storey and four-bedroom . The owner intended to build his dream home on the plot but decided to stay in his current property, despite obtaining planning permission . The properties would be 4,370 sq ft and 4,023 sq ft respectively, set over four floors with a terrace running all the way round to enjoy the views . Sandbanks is said to be the fourth most expensive place in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo - to buy property . The prospective buyer will also count Harry Redknapp among their neighbours. The QPR manager bought his ultra-modern property with his wife Sandra for £3million in 2001 and commutes daily from his waterfront home to QPR's London-based ground Loftus Road. Troubled footballer Paul Gascoigne also reportedly moved to the exclusive resort earlier this year, where he is said to be renting a flash penthouse apartment. Other notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, and Mr Redknapp's son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there. Adrian Dunford, of Tailor Made estate agents which is selling the empty plot, said: 'This is one of the few plots left along that section, most of the houses have now been replaced with new properties. 'A lot of those have been turned into apartments so they're unlikely to change again. A property in that particular area, two doors down from this one, holds the record for cost of a house per square foot. 'One of the reasons why the properties on that section go for so much is because of the two-way views. Historically that section has always been sought-after and the most expensive. Every home in the Sandbanks community (pictured from above) is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most  enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel . The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand (pictured) 'On the peninsula the houses are much larger, 13-14,000 sq ft, they will change hands for £8million, but this bit is the narrowest part of Sandbanks so the houses there can only be about 4-5,000 sq ft.' He added: 'Generally they are second homes on that stretch but we are seeing a change in fashion. Historically everybody wanted large homes but we are seeing more people very happy to live in something smaller and easier to manage. 'A lot of people are using them as their main home in the UK but then also have another home in France, Barbados or Monte Carlo. It means they don't have a huge maintenance bill when they're away. 'In that area people are only going to move when they pass away, because where do you move from there? You've got a nice plot, with two-way views, waves crashing on the beach - it's a great place to live.' The empty plot is more than the price of an entire estate on the south shore of Loch Rannoch, Perthshire, which includes a 38-bedroom castle . The £6m estate, which has this view, includes a swimming pool, 12 extra villas or bungalows, a sports hall, a golf course and a shooting range . Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks - nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach' - is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of its sought-after property. By area, Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London. Sandbanks's popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 14,990 sq ft (1,393-square-metre) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. In May, a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value. Earlier this year a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million. Prospective buyers could even get more for their money in Mayfair, where £6.75m could buy you this two-bedroom flat . In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' reputation has continued to grow. Mr Dunford added: 'The land is worth more without the old houses on it because it's all about the potential use of the land. 'Generally you can get more square footage in a modern build than you could just ten years ago. Properties now can build one or two floors higher so you get a larger house and a more popular layout. 'Most of the older properties are only two storeys and generally don't take full advantage of the two-way view. Construction now with no pillars or internal walls means you can sit in your kitchen and look both ways with no obstruction. You just can't get that in a 1970s build. 'The key thing that drives the value is we're surrounded by water. What you have got in Sandbanks is all you have, it's not like a rural place where you can expand and build a new village. And the more popular it becomes the more in demand plots like this are. If you want to be here you have to pay the money and people selling know that.'","The area, which measures 27m by 18m, will equate to £1,161 per square foot if it sells for the huge asking price .

"A mayor is in line for an 80 per cent pay rise, in a move which could trigger a fresh wave of spiralling local government salary increases. Despite his council making £70million of cuts, Sir Peter Soulsby could see his pay go up from £56,000 to £100,000. The Government has pleaded with councils to cut the pay of their best-rewarded officials at a time of austerity. But under the proposals, Sir Peter’s deputy could more than double his salary from £34,000 to £75,000. Former Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby, seen here with his wife Alison,  was elected mayor of Leicester this year. The council is pushing through £70million spending curbs and shedding 1,000 jobs this winter . But a £100,000 salary would make Sir Peter the second highest-paid elected mayor in the country, behind only Boris Johnson (pictured), who is on £144,000 . Six assistant mayors would pocket 65 per . cent increases from £26,000 to £40,000, and all 47 city councillors . would see their basic allowances go up 20 per cent from £10,000 to . £12,000. Former Labour MP Sir Peter was elected . Mayor of Leicester this year. The council is pushing through £70million . spending curbs and shedding 1,000 jobs this winter. Sir Peter last month described the cuts . as ‘enormously problematic’ and added that he was ‘determined to . minimise the pain on front-line services and, so far as I can, protect . the jobs of the people who provide the services’. But a £100,000 salary would make him the . second highest-paid elected mayor in the country, behind only Boris . Johnson, who is on £144,000. If the pay rises go through, they are . likely to have an immediate knock-on effect across the country. Local . authorities tend to set elected members’ pay and allowance rates by . comparing themselves with their neighbours. Some councils have doubled the level of . allowances paid to elected members in the past five years by claiming . they were falling behind. The increases in Leicester were proposed by a four-strong remuneration panel. Sir Peter has said that the panel is independent, but the city’s one Tory councillor, Ross Grant, said it had been appointed after Labour won all but two council seats in May elections, and called it ‘hand-picked’. He said: ‘The pay proposals are disgraceful. The panel has been promoted as independent, but its members were appointed by Labour after the election, with no involvement for opposition parties. ‘It has a representative of business, which needs to keep sweet with the council, and of a university, which needs co-operation with the council to get its expansion plans approved.’ Local Government Minister Bob Neill said: ‘True to form this shows you can’t trust Labour councils with public money. It’s scandalous that they are lining their pockets with bumper pay packets way out of step with the tough economic circumstances. These  councillors are the ultimate champagne socialists.’ When an MP, Sir Peter employed his two daughters, Lauren and Eleanor, as junior secretaries. He also employed his wife Lady Alison, who earned £25,000 a year as office manager. And he claimed for a £472.59 bailiff’s bill on expenses after debt collectors were sent to his constituency office when he fell behind with his rent in October 2007. The fees office agreed he should not be liable for the bill and reimbursed him. Sir Peter said the cost of the pay increases was met by his decision earlier this year to get rid of the authority’s chief executive, which saved £250,000. But after details of the rises sparked a row, he last night promised to delay a council vote on implementing them. ‘The report of the remuneration panel was leaked before we had the chance to read or discuss the contents,’ he said. ‘I am firmly of the view that politicians ought not to set their own pay. I also believe that those making recommendations should have an opportunity to understand members’ views and to explain their thinking. ‘I have therefore asked officers to take the item off the agenda for the full council meeting next week. This will give members an opportunity to ask the panel to explain its proposals and, if it sees fit, reconsider them.’","Salary would make Sir Peter Soulsby the second highest-paid elected mayor in the country, behind only Boris Johnson, who is on £144,000 ."
"An Arkansas high school has created controversy after officials pulled a profile of an openly gay student from appearing in the annual yearbook. The Yellowjacket was scheduled to feature an interview with Taylor Ellis, 17, about his experience coming out as homosexual last year, until school officials for the Sheridan School District pulled it. On Tuesday, representatives from the Human Rights Campaign, a national organization that promotes civil rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, staged a demonstration on the State Capitol steps in support of Ellis. Scroll down for more . Taylor Ellis, an openly gay student at Sheridan High School, hugs his mom, Lynn Tiley, as the Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, right, looks on during a rally on Tuesday outside the Capitol in Little Rock, Ark. Lynn Tiley fights back tears as she speak about her son Taylor Ellis, in front of supporters gathered at the rally after he son was denied an interview profile in his schools yearbook because it was about him being gay . The group said it had collected more than 30,000 signatures, thousands of them from Arkansans, on an online petition calling for the profile to be published. At a news conference organized by the Human Rights Campaign, Ellis said he didn't understand the school's decision. ‘It’s not something I’m ashamed of. In fact, I’m proud of who I am. That’s why I can’t understand why my school was trying to force me back into the closet.’ In a statement, Superintendent Brenda Haynes of the Sheridan School District said the school would ‘not make decisions based on demands by any special interest group.’ Taylor Ellis, with his father Billy to his right, address a crowd at a rally outside the Capitol in Little Rock, Ark. to protest at his treatment by Sheridan High School . ‘We must make decisions that lead in the proper direction for all of our students and for our community,’ she said. ‘We have reviewed state law, court cases, and our own policies. It is clear that the adults who have the responsibility for the operation of the District have the obligation to make decisions which are consistent with the mission of our school. We have done so.’ Rather than publish Ellis’ story, the district decided to scrap all seven profiles that had been prepared for publication. ‘They don't want to just throw out the gay kid's interview,’ the yearbook's assistant editor, Hannah Bruner, told KATV. It was her who had profiled Ellis. The yearbook's assistant editor Hannah Bruner said she had profiled Ellis because it was a story that didn't get talked about much in Sheridan . ‘It's a big thing in Sheridan to be gay. That is something that doesn't get told a lot.’ She said the profile told how Ellis had been frightened at first, but then had found most of the student body and teachers very accepting of him. At Tuesday’s protest Ellis’ mother, Lynn Tiley, said she was told administrators were concerned that the profile of Ellis was 'too personal' and might endanger his well-being. 'I accepted it, and everybody else needs to accept it as well,' she said, close to tears. The Human Rights Campaign urged Gov. Mike Beebe and the state's education commissioner, Tom Kimbrell, to intervene, but representatives of their offices said it was a matter for the local school district.

"Twitter dug its heels in yesterday after French prosecutors demanded the details of users who have posted racist or anti-Semitic comments. In what could prove a significant test case for the micro-blogging site, lawyer Alexandre Neri argued that the company is only subject to US law and only a judge in America could force it to release the information. In October, Jewish student bodies asked . Twitter to remove a number of messages which appeared under the hashtag . #unbonjuif (#agoodjew), with some users posting examples such as: ‘#agoodjew is a . dead Jew.’ Offensive: A French court has ordered Twitter to hand over the identities of racist and anti-Semitic users after the hashtag #unbonjuif (#agoodjew) went viral in France last year . The hashtag became the third most popular in France, with . thousands attacking the religion. France has a number of strict laws aimed at combating hate crimes. [caption . The Union of Jewish Students of France . (UEJF) and three other similar groups took Twitter to a French court asking them to hand over the . names of all those responsible so they can be prosecuted. 'Because it does not take the necessary measures to identify where the tweets come from, Twitter is offering a platform to racism and anti-Semitism,' said Jonathan Hayoun, the president of the Union of French Jewish Students (UEJF), in a statement on Monday. But Mr Neri told the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris that Twitter . ‘data is collected and stored in the United States’ – namely in San . Francisco, where the site is based. ‘Should I submit myself to the law of a different country to where I work?' he asked. He added that the differences between French and US laws on freedom of speech have created a ‘huge void, a question mark’. Stephane Lilti, counsel for the Jewish groups, suggested Twitter had  a ‘commercial interest’ in protecting the anonymity of its users. ‘Twitter is playing a commercial game by raising a number of legal hurdles to not having to comply with its legal obligations,’ he told the court. Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud will hand down a verdict on January 24. French ministers Fleur Pellerin and Najat Vallaud-Belkacem have said they will speak to Twitter executives about the controversy by phone this week. Last year Twitter shut down an account run by a German neo-Nazi group based in Hanover, following a request by German police. Facebook and YouTube complied with similar requests. A spokesman for Twitter said it always suspends accounts when they are illegal, or in breach of its rules, but would not hand over details of account holders unless ordered by a judge.","Jewish students take site to court over offensive posts .

"The most controversial participant on thought-provoking TV show First Contact lied to producers about getting her nails done before escaping on a flight back to Sydney. Sandy, 41, dramatically quit halfway through filming the SBS documentary series which took six Australians to meet Aboriginal communities around the country, including in some of the most remote places on earth. The show's producer Darren Dale, from Blackfella Films, said Sandy left the show on day 13 of a 28-day shoot, while filming in Alice Springs. Scroll down for video . Mortgage broker Sandy walked off SBS TV show First Contact halfway through filming . The 41-year-old lied to producers about getting her nails done before escaping on a flight back to Sydney . 'She said she was going to get her nails done,' Mr Dale told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then when she hadn't come back, when we couldn't find her our instinct was she's flown to Sydney. 'With the timing it was 10.30am and a plane left at 11.30am, we had a pretty good hunch she got a plane.' Mr Dale said they sent one of their crew members based in Sydney to the airport who found her walking off the plane. She explained her reasons for leaving on camera while walking through the airport, which will be shown on episode two which airs on Wednesday night at 8.30pm. Mr Dale also revealed that the mother of five is of Syrian, German and Caucasian descent and the father of her children is Maori. Is also emerged that the mother of five is of Syrian, German and Caucasian descent and the father of her children is Maori . Some viewers on social media remarked that it was odd she held such strong views about Indigenous Australians when she had mixed race children . Sandy pulled out of the show shortly after a trip to the remote community Elcho Island, off Arnhem Land . Some viewers on social media remarked that it was odd she held such strong views about Indigenous Australians when she had mixed race children, but Mr Dale said he believed Sandy was just unapologetically set in her beliefs. 'Sandy is like a force of nature, I think she's got such a wilful personality and I think her views transcend everything,' he said. 'She clearly thinks what she thinks, she doesn't care about race, religion, creed.' Sandy told news.com.au she left the show because she'd had enough of the experiences and because tensions were flaring with fellow participant Alice. 'I’m thinking, ""For f*** sake, are you for real? I’m not putting up with this s*** for the next 18 days. I’ve got enough drama at home"",' she said. Faced with sleeping in a child’s bed at an Aboriginal family's house in Sydney, she said: 'I'm not staying here, I can’t. I know what happens on those mattresses.' 'I had a lot of stuff going on at home as well, with a divorce, and my children back here in Newcastle.' It has also emerged that she no longer works as a mortgage broker in Newcastle. A spokeswoman for her former employer, financial planning firm Chase Edwards, said Sandy was 'no longer with us', despite the fact her LinkedIn profile listed her as being currently employed there. ‘Sandy’s not worked at Chase Edwards for approximately six months and she’s not associated with the company in any way,’ she said. The TV show filmed in April this year. On the first episode of the SBS documentary series, which aired on Tuesday night, Sandy made no secret of her views about Aboriginal people and said she didn’t ‘f***ing care’ if people thought she was racist. ‘God gave black people rhythm and soul. They can dance and sing and are hot while they dance, but when it comes to brains, white people have a better gene, better make up,’ she said. From left: Sandy, Trent, Jasmine, host Ray Martin, Alice, Bo-dene and Marcus, from new series First Contact . Sandy is welcomed by an Aboriginal girl when the cast visits Nyinyikay, in the Northern Territory . The most controversial of the show's participants said she didn’t ‘f***ing care’ if people thought she was racist . 'If you're out there and you're looking at f***ing kangaroos go past and snakes and build a fire, like f***, how much more can you learn?' Faced with sleeping in a child’s bed at a house in Sydney, the mother-of-five pulled no punches. ‘F***, I’m not staying’, she said. ‘I can’t. I know what happens on those mattresses. They’re all sleeping on it with their sweat, their drinking and their partying, all their boozing and all their yahooing and I ain't sleeping on it. It's dirty.’ Sandy, described on the show as a mother of five mixed race children, also initially claimed that Aboriginals had ‘whinged too much’ about the stolen generation of children snatched from their parents to be brought up in white society. Jasmine (left) and Bo-dene (right) were among six Australians who spent a month in Aboriginal communties . However, after hearing first hand from a family affected by the policy, she softened her views. The group of six responded in dramatically different ways to their experience, with some embracing Aboriginal culture and others struggling to come to terms with what they saw. After starting out in Sydney, the group travelled to Nyinyikay, in the Northern Territory, where the men took part in a turtle hunt. The slaughter of the creature took place the next day and was deeply divisive with some of the women openly crying. On episode two, to air on Wednesday night, the group visit remote community Elcho Island, off Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Sandy pulled out of the show shortly afterwards. Jasmine says that months after filming she feels like some of her questions went unanswered, and she still believes it is unfair Aborigines get higher welfare payments and placements in university . The 33-year-old mother of four from Brisbane became distressed when watching a turtle be killed for food . Similar to the acclaimed Go Back To Where You Came From, the show takes six 'ordinary' Australians and immerses them in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the Indigenous population. 'Petrol sniffing', 'wasters' and 'spending their dole cheques on booze' are among the labels the six people give to Aborigines at first. Host Ray Martin said none of the opinions he heard on the show shocked him, as he had heard them many times before. The veteran journalist and passionate advocate for Aboriginal issues said six out of 10 Australians have never met or have little to do with an Indigenous person. 'The Aboriginal problem is a festering sore of Australian society, it's one of those things we have to fix,' Mr Martin said. 'So we thought we would take six people - average Aussies who weren't racists, or weirdos or nutters – and have people willing to ask questions and willing to question their beliefs. 'Why do they drink so much, why don't they send their kids to school, why don't they leave townships and get a job? They are all valid questions and not racist questions.' The second episode of First Contact is at 8.30pm on Wednesday 19 November. It concludes at 8.30pm on Thursday 20 November – broadcast simultaneously each night on SBS ONE and NITV, and replayed at 9.30pm on SBS 2 .","Newcastle woman Sandy quits SBS TV show halfway through filming .

Mr Clarkson said he took up his favourite childhood pastime again in a bid to stave off boredom after he left his NHS job as a nurse. He said: 'I was a fan of Dr Who and tried to make the Dalek Robot. I loved the fact you could build something then break it all up and start on something else. 'But then I went into the ""dark ages"" of Lego - life got in the way. I lost touch with it as I focused on work, love and family.

He said: 'I got right back into it when the kids were growing up, helping them build toys.

"'Outrage industry': Comedian Rowan Atkinson blamed the law for creating a society of an 'extraordinarily authoritarian and controlling nature' Ministers agreed to scrap a law . outlawing ‘insulting words or behaviour’ last night after a campaign led . by comedian Rowan Atkinson. Home Secretary Theresa May announced a dramatic U-turn yesterday saying the government would ditch the contentious words from the Public Order Act amid fears that they are strangling free speech. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star led a coalition of campaign groups complaining that the legislation has been abused by over-zealous police and prosecutors to arrest Christian preachers, critics of Scientology, gay rights campaigners and even students making jokes. The government caved in yesterday after suffering a humiliating defeat in the House of Lords before Christmas. Mrs . May told the Commons that the word ‘insulting’ would be removed from . Section 5 of the Public Order Act, as part of the Crime and Courts Bill. She . told MPs: ‘Looking at past cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions . could not identify any where the behaviour leading to a conviction could . not be described as “abusive” as well as “insulting”. 'He . has stated that the word “insulting” could safely be removed without . the risk of undermining the ability of the CPS to bring prosecutions. ‘We . will issue guidance to the police on the range of powers that remain . available to them to deploy in the kind of situations I described, but . the word “insulting” shall be removed from Section 5.’ The climbdown was welcomed by civil liberties campaigners. Tory MP David Davis said: ‘I welcome this sensible decision by the Home Secretary. The only effect of this law was to chill public debate and depress freedom of speech.’ Reform Section 5 campaign director . Simon Calvert said he was “very pleased” by the Government’s statement, . adding: ‘This is a victory for free speech. People of all shades of . opinion have suffered at the hands of Section 5.’ Nick . Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, . said: ‘It should not be the police’s role to intervene when someone . feels they have been insulted and the Home Secretary and her Coalition . colleagues should be applauded for accepting this important change.’ Comedian . Rowan Atkinson blamed the law, introduced in 1986, for creating an . ‘outrage industry’ and a society of an ‘extraordinarily authoritarian . and controlling nature’. The Daily Mail has repeatedly highlighted the most egregious abuses of the old law. Words removed: Home Secretary Theresa May (right) announced a U-turn saying the government would ditch contentious words from the Public Order Act and Tory MP David Davis (left) welcomed the decision and said the law could only 'chill public debate and depress freedom of speech' A sixteen-year-old boy was arrested under the legislation for peacefully holding a placard that read ‘Scientology is a dangerous cult’, on the grounds that it might insult followers of the religious movement. In 2005, an Oxford student was arrested for saying to a policeman: ‘Excuse me, do you realise your horse is gay?’. Thames Valley Police said the arrest had taken place because he had made ‘homophobic comments that were deemed offensive to people passing by’. Gay rights campaigners from the group Outrage! were also arrested under the Act when they protested against supporters of the Islamist fundamentalist group, Hizb ut-Tahrir, which was calling for the killing of gays, Jews and unchaste women. In a victory for the Mail, the Bill also contains a commitment to shake-up Britain’s lopsided extradition laws. The legislation says there will be a so-called ‘forum bar ‘which means more suspects are likely to face trial in the UK - rather than be packed off to America. A hearing will take place before a judge to examine the details of any offence which the Americans want to end in extradition. If prosecution is possible in both the UK and abroad, the courts will have the power to bar prosecution overseas. This will be done of it is ‘in the interests of justice’. Supporters believe that - if the ‘forum bar’ had already been in place - Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon could have been spared his decade-long fight against extradition. He was only saved, in October last year, after the Mail’s lengthy Affront to British Justice campaign.","Home Secretary says the government will ditch contentious words from the Public Order Act .

"Hewn ruthlessly from the earth by water over 270million years, these stone structures are a testament to the power of the natural world. The pillars, arches and columns rise hundred of feet into the air over a vast region of southern China, striking awe into observers who have flocked to the area for thousands of years. Known as karsts, the limestone structures - captured in these images for National Geographic Magazine - are created when water forces fissures, sinkholes, cracks and caverns into the soft rock, leaving only a series of monoliths above ground. Vast: Jaw-dropping limestone 'karsts' formed by erosion over 270million years soar hundreds of feet into the air across a huge region of southern China. Pictured, climber Emily Harrington takes the hard way up Moon Hill, an arch which was formed from the remains of a collapsed cave. Sightseers can take an easier dirt track . Awe: The enormity of the structures is clear compared to the size of the cavers ascending them, from a limestone spire in the Enshi canyon (left) to the Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park (right). Seeing these sights can be much easier, as a new glass elevator delivers less intrepid tourists to the foot of the arch . China's Stone Forest is one of the . largest, with huge arches which once belonged to cave systems but now . protrude awkwardly above the lush green hills around. Covering an estimated half a million square kilometres, south China's is one of the largest and most significant in the world. While . limestone structures are common, only in a humid, tropical environment . can there be enough movement of water to create such dramatic change, . and form structures which have earned the South China Karst recognition . as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But . just as with an iceberg, what can be seen in these photographs is only . the tip. The flowing water has not only carved up the landscape above . the ground, but has also transformed it below. South . China is home to some of the largest caves in the world, which even now . are still being mapped and explored by researchers from around the . world. Heading the charge . is a team led by Andy Eavis, the chairman of the British Caving . Association who has been traveling to China for more than 30 years. Otherworldly: The landscape was formed by water in the humid region seeping in through cracks in porous rock and gradually opening up sinkholes, fissures and caves . All work and no play...: Those pictured have devoted their careers to exploring and mapping the hostile cave landscape down below - but do come up for air occasionally . Map: Beneath southern China's landscape researchers have discovered some of the largest underground chambers in the world. In 2013 a British-led expedition used a laser scanner to map the Miao Room of Gebihe, pictured, whose maximum height is 627 feet. A passenger jet is shown for scale . The images are from the July issue of National Geographic magazine . He and his explorers have used . pioneering laser scanners to map the complex, unstable systems in . unprecedented detail, including the Miao Room of the Gebihe cave system - . since confirmed as the second-largest known cavern in the world. Despite . its entrance from the outer world comprising just a narrow, unobtrusive . gap in stone in the forest, it has a maximum height of 627 feet. The . cavern must be explored in hostile conditions - including high humidity . and a lack of any natural light - using a mixture of computer . technology and old-fashioned caving bravery. With . fissures and sharp points of rock, a wrong step could mean injury or . death, and the cavern is so large it could fit a fleet of jumbo jets . with plenty of room to spare. Other . caves are less formidable. In one part of the region, an entire village . of 21 homes - with no need for rooves - is situated inside a cavern . together with a primary school, a basketball court, and an increasing . stream of tourists. More still have been made safe for people to explore without the risk of losing their hats. It . is not all work and no play for the explorers. Some feature in these . photos, where they take time off from their caving work to ascend the . other side of China's fantasy landscape. That . is despite there being far more tourist-friendly ways to ascend the . limestone structures, which are mainly in China's Yunnan, Guizhou and . Guangxi provinces. One, the . Great Arch in Ziyun Getu He Chuandong National Park, includes a glass . elevator which delivers the less intrepid to the foot of the arch so . they do not have to climb. It is a vision of the future - and it's predicted the caves will be next. With . China becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, . tourists from other parts of the vast nation are already streaming . underground - though how long it will take to install a glass lift there . remains to be seen.

"Norman Headworth, 92, who died the day after falling down steps on a family day out after having to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance . An elderly RAF veteran who suffered a serious head injury in a bad fall died after having to wait 90 minutes on a concrete step for an ambulance. Norman Headworth, 92, died at Colchester General Hospital four days after he tumbled down steps while on a day out to the seaside with his family. Mr Headworth, a former Wellington bomber air gunner from Long Melford near Sudbury in Suffolk, suffered a fractured wrist and a major bleed on the brain as a result of the fall. He had enjoyed a cup of tea at a seafront pub in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, and fell as he walked a few yards to meet his daughter Moira Cruickshank, who was waiting for him in her car. But then he had to wait for an hour-and-a-half before the emergency services arrived. Now his family say he 'deserved much better' - with his son-in-law, retired cardiologist John Cruickshank, saying he believed the ambulance took so long because of Mr Headworth's age. 'Waiting for the ambulance seemed to go on forever,' Mr Cruickshank said as he recounted the incident, which happened in May. 'We made at least three calls and I had to answer the same questions every time. Norman had broken his wrist and banged his head - it was a severe injury. 'I am a medic but you don't have to be a doctor to know that the quicker you get to a head injury the better the chances of survival. 'Had the ambulance got there in the usual 20 minutes, the chances of his survival would have been better.' An inquest into Mr Headworth's death was held in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk last month, but full details of the ambulance delay have only now emerged. Mrs Cruickshank said she agreed with the hearing's accidental death verdict - but she stressed her father may have survived if he'd been treated as a priority case . 'At 92 he had been through the last war,' she added. 'He lived with us in a self contained flat, was no burden on the state whatsoever and was in good health. 'It's so sad because he just missed out on all the D-Day 70th anniversary commemorations, which he was really looking forward to. Mr Headworth, pictured in his RAF uniform, left, was a Second World War veteran and his daughter Moira, right, says that he deserved better . 'He wanted to make 100 and probably would have done so. He deserved much better.' East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST) carried out a full investigation into the incident. Chief executive Anthony Marsh gave his 'sincere apologies' for the long wait in a personal letter to the Cruickshanks after the probe. Mr Marsh told the couple: 'I am able to state that between the time of 14.49 and 15.44 hours, all other emergency ambulances were either not available to respond for various reasons, or assigned to other emergency incidents which were coded higher and immediately life threatening or out of service for a variety of reasons.' He insisted that the patient's age does not affect the coding of a 999 call or level of response provided. Mr Headworth died the day after the fall at Colchester General Hospital after suffering a broken wrist and a bleed on the brain . Last night, Gary Baines, EEAST senior locality manager for north Essex, said: 'We have been in contact with Mr Headworth's family about what happened and the operational demand we faced on the day of his accident. 'We prioritise all 999 calls according to those patients in most serious need, but clearly want to reach and treat every patient as quickly as is possible. 'As we work hard to put more ambulances on the road with more new staff recruited in Essex, this will improve our response times.' Mrs Cruickshank said that her father volunteered to join the RAF in November 1940 when he was just 18 - even though his worried mother wanted him to wait to be called up. He was accepted for aircrew training and sent to Squire's Gate Blackpool, the leading training site in the UK for air gunners. The 92-year-old volunteered to join the RAF in November 1940 and went on to fly in Wellington bombers, pictured, based in North Africa . Mr Headworth went on to fly in Wellington bombers based in North Africa and took part in the campaign to capture Italy from the Germans in 1943 to 1944. During his time in Africa, the veteran recalled being 'strafed' by German fighter planes, just making it to a slit trench in time, head first onto other occupants. He also recalled flying into a hail of flak and tracer bullets in a famous raid on Benito Mussolini's Italian Navy over the Bay of Taranto. He then went on to be stationed at RAF Knockholt in Kent which housed the Ivy Farm Communications Centre where German radio messages had been intercepted, transcribed and forwarded to Bletchley Park for decoding. There he met his wife Beryl Weston, who he married on June 11, 1945, just 35 days after the German surrender, and went on to set up his own successful driving school in the late 1950s.","Norman Headworth suffered a bad fall while on family day out to seaside .

"It was more than just a dark plume of smoke on the horizon - for this was the moment that marked the turning point of World War Two, and the end of a great German battleship's reign of terror. Just days earlier, in 1941, the Bismarck had sunk HMS Hood during the Battle of the Denmark Strait. The . attack, that killed 1,415 men, prompted the Prime Minister to give the . famous order 'sink the Bismarck'. Now, an archive of photos that document the race to destroy the dreaded vessel - as seen from the crew of a British ship - has been unearthed after 71 years. The German battleship Bismarck is struck by the first torpedo in a newly unearthed set of rare photos taken in May 1941 . The message on the reverse of the above photo - released as picture postcard souvenirs - reveals how aircraft carrier HMS Victorious engaged the enemy off the coast of Greenland . There are numerous pictures showing Swordfish bi-planes and their crew on standby and ready for action on the deck of Victorious . Victorious was one of 42 ships sent by Winston Churchill to find the fearsome German battleship . The snaps were taken from on board the . aircraft carrier HMS Victorious, one of 42 ships sent by Winston . Churchill to find the battleship in May 1941.

On the reverse of an image of a plane flying from the aircraft carrier, someone has written across it 'Swordfish taking off from Victorious to have a smack at the Bismarck'. One image taken from a reconnaissance aircraft records the moment the enemy ship was first sighted .

The 20 black and white photos show Royal Navy ships - including Victorious (above) - steaming through the North Atlantic at great speed during the chase . The sinking of the Hood (pictured below) by the Bismarck managed to shock a nation by then used to war. Only three of its 1,418 crew survived the sinking during the Battle of the Denmark Strait. The fifth salvo from the Bismarck hit the ship's magazine resulting in a catastrophic explosion, which tore it in half, and it sank in less than three minutes. The flagship of the fleet was part of a force ordered to engage the Bismarck and her escort cruiser Prinz Eugen off Greenland. And another is of the Bismarck in the distance with a plume of black smoke coming from her. The back reads: 'Bismarck receiving the first torpedo from aircraft from Victorious.' After coming under heavy attack, the Bismarck tried to limp to the Nazi-occupied French port of St Nazaire but was attacked again and sunk 600 miles from it on May 27. Other pictures show King George VI inspecting the crew of Victorious after the historic battle that proved a turning point in the war. It is believed the photos were printed off months afterwards and made available as souvenirs to the crew of the aircraft carrier. There is an official stamp on the back of each one which states they are not meant for press publication. The photos have been owned by an unidentified private collector for more than 50 years and he has now chosen to put them up for sale at auction. Andrew Aldridge, of Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, which is selling the photos, said: 'This is a fascinating archive which catalogues one of the decisive moments of the war. 'The pictures show some of the British ships racing across the sea to find Bismarck, the intense activity on board, the first sighting of her and then the first attack. 'There are several more showing the King inspecting the crew and the ship after they were victorious. 'The pictures are actually postcards and they were not meant to be seen by the wider public.

HMS Hood was the biggest vessel lost by the Royal Navy in World War II after she wasattacked by the 41,000 ton Bismarck on May 23. After being chased south towards France, the Bismarck was pummelled with torpedoes dropped by the Swordfish planes and from several destroyers. It was recently claimed that the crew of the Bismarck tried to surrender before the ship was sunk with the loss of 2,000 men. Her wreck was discovered in 5,000 feet of water 600 miles west of Brest in the Atlantic in 1989. The photos are expected to sell for £300 at the auction in Devizes on Saturday.

Other pictures show King George VI inspecting the crew of Victorious after the historic battle that proved a turning point in the war . Bismarck, the fearsome German battleship which was sunk in the North Atlantic . Every war veteran has a story to tell. But few could rival John Moffat's extraordinary tale. It was the torpedo he fired that crippled the rudder of the German battleship, leaving it at the mercy of Royal Navy ships which then sank it. He was piloting one of three Swordfish open-cockpit biplanes that set off from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal to take vengeance. 'What nobody talks about were the conditions  -  they were unbelievable,' recalled Mr Moffat,  speaking in 2009. Then aged 89, he had written a book, I Sank The Bismarck, about his experiences. 'The ship was pitching 60ft, water was running over the decks and the wind was blowing at 70 or 80mph. John Moffat is credited with taking off from HMS Ark Royal and launching the torpedo from his Swordfish that disabled the rudder of the Bismarck . 'And nobody mentions the deck hands who had to bring the planes up from the hangars  -  they did something special. After they brought them up they had to open the wings which took ten men for each wing. And then they had to wind a handle to get the starters working. 'I only stopped flying nine months ago and there are no other planes in the world that could have done what the Swordfish planes did that day. 'After take-off we climbed to 6,000ft to get above the really thick cloud and we knew when we were near because all hell broke loose with Bismarck's fire. We got the order to attack and I went down and saw the enormous bloody ship. I thought the Ark Royal was big, but this one, blimey. 'I must have been under 2,000 yards when I was about to launch the torpedo at the bow, but as I was about to press the button I heard in my ear ""not now, not now"". 'I turned round and saw the navigator leaning right out of the plane with his backside in the air. 'Then I realised what he was doing  -  he was looking at the sea because if I had let the torpedo go and it had hit a wave it could have gone anywhere. I had to put it in a trough. 'Then I heard him say ""let it go"" and I pressed the button. Then I heard him say ""we've got a runner""  -  and I got out of there. 'My navigator was a chap called John ""Dusty"" Miller and I've spent the last 20 years trying to find out what happened to him or where he is.' Mr Moffat pulled up before the torpedo hit and didn't see it strike. The following morning he flew to the ship for a second attack but there was no need. He watched as the Bismarck, which had been under siege from the Royal Navy, rolled over. And he saw hundreds of German sailors leaping into the water as she started to sink. Only 115 of Bismarck's crew of 2,222 survived. 'I didn't dare look any further, I just got back to the Ark Royal and I thought: ""There but for the grace of God go I"",' said Mr Moffat, from Dunkeld, Scotland. He only found out it was his torpedo that crippled the Bismarck when the Fleet Air Arm  -  the Navy's air force  -  wrote to him in 2000. He said: 'It gave me a sort of satisfaction.' The Bismarck was built in August 1940 and was the biggest battleship made by Germany. She was named after Otto von Bismarck, the German chancellor behind the unification of Germany in 1871. Despite her fearsome reputation, the Bismarck enjoyed just an eight-month career during which time she was involved in one offensive operation, when she destroyed HMS Hood. Out nearly 3,000 shells fired at Bismarck by the Royal Navy, about 400 hit the ship before she finally sunk. The Bismarck's sister ship the Tirpitz wreaked havoc among the Arctic convoys until she was sunk while at anchor in a Norwegian fjord. The Bismarck had a maximum weight of 51,000 tons, was 823ft long and had a top speed of 34mph.","Photo archive unearthed after 71 years .

"A former professor of Barack Obama has turned against his one-time student and publicly urged voters not to re-elect him. Roberto Unger posted a video on YouTube detailing the reasons why he believes the President does not deserve a second term in the White House. Mr Unger, a prominent Brazilian politician and an adviser to Obama in 2008, said: 'President Obama must be defeated in the coming election. He has failed to advance the progressive . cause in the United States.' Scroll down for video . Scathing: Obama's former professor Roberto Unger said that he had 'failed' the United States and should not be re-elected . The 65-year-old academic was in frequent contact with Mr Obama on his Blackberry throughout the last election campaign but has since decided that he no longer agreed with the President's decisions. His list of complaints against the President is a long one in the video entitled 'Beyond Obama'. The esteemed philosopher is scathing of Mr Obama's plans to salvage America's ailing economy, saying that his policy solely consists of 'financial confidence and food stamps'. He adds: 'He has spent trillions of dollars to rescue the moneyed interests and left workers and homeowners to their own devices.' The . politician admits that if Republican candidate Mitt Romney wins . the election 'there will be a cost... in judicial and administrative . appointments'. However his most barbed remarks he reserves for the Democrat leader saying that Mr Obama has 'evoked a politics of handholding, but no one changes the world without a struggle'. Delete! The President regularly talked to Unger during his 2008 campaign... this is no longer likely to be the case . Taking a shot: Roberto Unger criticised President Obama after being a long time supporter . His summary of the past four years is . equally scathing: 'Give the bond markets what they want, bail out the . reckless so long as they are also rich, use fiscal and monetary stimulus . to make up for the absence of any consequential broadening of economic . and educational opportunity, sweeten the pill of disempowerment with a . touch of tax fairness, even though the effect of any such tax reform is . sure to be modest.' Making enemies: Obama has lost a respected adviser Roberto Unger . Most of Mr Unger's comments seem to . be politically to the left of Mr Obama, but he insists that the . Republicans would be no more destructive than the Democrats as 'the risk . of military adventurism' would remain the same. And some would doubtless strike a . chord with the President's GOP opponents, including the academic's . attacks on Mr Obama's efforts to reform healthcare. Mr Unger argues: 'He has subordinated . the broadening of economic and educational opportunity to the important . but secondary issue of access to health care in the mistaken belief . that he would be spared a fight.' He also suggests that, despite their . fierce rivalry, the Democrats' agenda is little different to that of the . Republicans, saying the party aims 'to put a human face on the . programme of its adversaries'. The professor concludes his video by . saying: 'Only a political reversal can allow the voice of democratic . prophecy to speak once again in American life.' Mr Unger is a renowned politician in . his native Brazil. He has twice has run for president of Brazil and has . served as Minister of Strategic Affairs. Unger was one of the founding members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and drafted its founding manifesto. He has also advised on politics throughout Latin America. Model student: Obama was taught by Unger when he attended Harvard Law School in 1988 . The professor is a respected author having published dozens of books on economics, philosophy and politics. In philosophy, his arguments are said to focus on some the greatest problems of the human existence. The video, which was posted three weeks ago, has been viewed 22,000 times. Mr Unger has taught at Harvard Law since 1976. Obama studied jurisprudence and reinventing democracy with the professor. The . President attended Harvard Law School in 1988 and was selected as an . editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year. Last week Obama announced that young immigrants who were brought into the U.S. illegally will no longer be deported. The .

"Scuba diving is the perfect way to witness the underwater world up close. But one diver got more than he bargained for when an eager remora fish - also know as a suckerfish - attached itself to his wetsuit. Snorre E. Johnsen was swimming off Australia's northeastern shores when the remora fish attached itself dangerously close to his crotch area. Wearing a 2-3mm wetsuit, the diver manages to signal to his friend to use his GoPro camera to capture the fish on camera. Although it didn't hurt, the diver admits he could definitely feel the suction through his wetsuit. 'As you can see from the video, I wasn't scared for my nuts,' diver Snorre E. Johnsen told MailOnline. 'Prior to that dive I'd experienced plenty of cool stuff and fishy things; there is always new experiences and interesting things that you never see above water,' he said. The remora fish latched on while Mr Johnsen was diving at the Moltke wreck, off Magnetic Island in Queensland, Australia. Look down, mate: Norwegian diver Snorre E.

"Monica Lewinsky is reportedly set to write a tell-all book about her affair with Bill Clinton - including her intimate love letters to the ex-president and how he had an insatiable desire for threesomes. The former White House intern, 39, reportedly wants revenge on Clinton, who she believes escaped unscathed while she has never been able to shake the disgrace of their Oval Office trysts. Friends claim publishers are scrambling to get their hands on the book, and after holding meetings, she has learned she could get as much a $12 million if she recounts every tawdry detail. While she has not yet secured a book deal, her apparent attempts to cash in on the affair could rattle the Clinton marriage - and wreck Hillary's bid for the presidency in 2016. Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky is reportedly writing a $12 million tell-all book about her affair with Clinton . Speaking to the National Enquirer, her friends said the memoir could . even spark further health problems for the former . president, who has undergone heart surgeries. 'Her book could be more than just revenge, it could kill him!' a source said. Her bids for a book deal will at least shake Clinton - bringing him crashing down from the success he enjoyed after an energetic speech at the Democratic National Convention earlier this month. 'Monica has tried to move forward, but the nightmare of her affair with Bill still haunts her,' a friend told the Enquirer. 'She’s facing 40 without a man in her life, and seething about the way her reputation was destroyed as the whole world watched.' The book will also include never-before-seen love letters that she wrote to the president - some of which were so intimate she never sent them, another friend added. They reportedly detail her love for . Clinton and how Lewinsky, then just 22, could make him much happier than . his wife, Hillary, who the president called a 'cold fish'. Admiration: A December 1996 White House photo shows Clinton and Lewinsky at a Christmas party . Affair: Lewinsky, pictured in November 1995, claimed she had nine sexual encounters with President Clinton in the Oval Office between November 1995 and March 1997 . Centre of a scandal: In October 1996, Clinton embraces Lewinsky, then a White House intern . He also laughed about his nonexistent sex life with his wife - and said he thought he was not the only one looking for love outside their marriage. 'Monica can describe how Bill went on . and on about his insatiable desire for three-way sex, orgies and the use . of sex toys of all kinds,' the friend added. As . well as the heartbreak she suffered after her relationship with Clinton, Lewinsky . also plans to detail the pain of ending a pregnancy at the height of her . liaison with the president, the source said. She . was carrying a child fathered by a Pentagon employee called 'Thomas', . she revealed in an earlier biography written by Andrew Morton. 'That . void has never been filled,' said the friend. She . decided to develop the memoir after her sullied reputation meant she . struggled to find work but realised she would get a generous offer for the book. Denial: With his wife standing by in January 1998, Clinton insists he did not have relations with 'that woman' Truth: But in August 1998, Clinton confessed on television that he did have sexual relations with her . She is also writing it to get revenge on Clinton, now 66, friends said. 'For years, Monica tried to protect . Bill out of a misplaced sense of loyalty,' a source told the Enquirer. 'But she no . longer feels that way, and her memoir is his worst nightmare.' During her grand jury testimony . against Clinton in 1998, an immunity deal prevented her from exposing . intimate details about their affair in the Morton expose that came out that . year. 'But that agreement expired in 2001, and . when Bill published his autobiography My Life three years later, . Monica felt betrayed by him all over again,' said the source. In the wake of the scandal, Lewinsky became the centre of a political storm and gave a series of high-profile interviews. But unable to escape the shake the reputation, she moved to England in 2005 where she earned her master's degree and worked as a news correspondent for the UK's Channel Five News. 'Nightmare': Lewinsky's friends believe the book could rock Clinton's marriage to Hillary, left, who he called a 'cold fish' during the affair. They are also pictured with daughter Chelsea . Though it has been 14 years since she claimed she had nine sexual encounters with the president, her presence still looms in the life of Clinton's post-presidency and Hillary's political career. In what was an unfortunate and awkward schedule at the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina earlier this month, Lewinsky's former rabbi - who publicly condemned Clinton during the sex scandal - gave the benediction minutes after the former President took the stage. ABC News reported that the awkward pairing was likely overlooked by organizers because Rabbi David Wolpe is such a well-known figure in the Jewish community.

"Landlords will now be able to shop around for the best deals when ordering beer, which could see the price of a pint fall . Britain’s drinkers could see the price of a pint fall in the biggest shake-up of the pub industry in centuries. MPs have voted to scrap the ‘beer tie’ under which breweries that rented out pubs to landlords locked them into selling their beer. The surprise move means landlords will now be able to shop around to get the best deals when ordering beer. Some experts say this could lead to consumers enjoying cheaper pints but pub groups claim it will mean less choice as they will have to close outlets and axe jobs because of lower profits. Shares in Enterprise Inns, which has 5,500 pubs, fell 19 per cent yesterday, while rivals Punch Taverns lost the same amount. Almost half of Britain’s 50,000 pubs are ‘tied houses’, a controversial deal that forces landlords to pay over the odds for their beer. Research by the Campaign for Real Ale last year showed that tied licensees were paying around £150 for a keg of Fosters lager, which contains 11 gallons, compared with the wholesale price of £85. That’s a difference of 77 per cent, or 73p per pint. But pub firms claim they rent out their outlets at a discount so that tenants are able to get a foothold into the industry without having to start with large amounts of capital. Some publicans have complained that such deals can be unfair and offer very low salaries, which led to the Government suggesting plans for reform in June. However, official research showed that sweeping changes could lead to pub closures and job losses. With the sector having already suffered from the smoking ban and cheaper alcohol sold in supermarkets, no change was proposed. The Coalition was then surprised on Monday night when a backbench rebellion led to MPs voting in favour of an amendment to the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill, by Lib Dem MP Greg Mulholland, that wiped out ‘tied’ pubs. Simon Townsend, the chief executive of Enterprise Inns, said the amendment was a ‘disproportionate’ response. Embarrassed: Minister Jo Swinson . Ministers were assessing what went wrong yesterday after they suffered their first defeat on a Coalition Bill when 17 Conservatives and 24 Liberal Democrats voted to help pubs buy cheaper beer. The Government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to buy drinks from different brewers, but it was left embarrassed after whips failed to head off the backbench rebellion. Chief Whip Michael Gove faced shouts of ‘resign’ as the Coalition suffered its first legislative defeat since 2010. Matt Hancock, one of the ministers responsible for the Bill, was reportedly seen ‘grovelling’ to the Prime Minister after an amendment was passed by 284 votes to 259. The rebellion was particularly embarrassing for Lib Dem Business Minister Jo Swinson, who had spoken for the Government during the debate. The rebels included her husband, Duncan Hames. A number of MPs who were absent for the vote were thought to have been on the campaign trail in Rochester and Strood for today’s crucial by-election. In January 2013, the Tories were defeated in the Commons on plans to redraw constituency boundaries before 2015, but that Bill had not been brought jointly with the Lib Dems. ‘We continue to believe the tie offers the best operating model for the vast majority of our publicans,’ he said. ‘We take a flexible approach to all our lease and tenancy agreements. In light of the vote we will continue to assess all options to safeguard the interests of publicans and shareholders.’ Stephen Billingham, executive chairman of Punch Taverns, said: ‘Punch has been at the forefront of improving the support for pub tenants and we remain committed to a sustainable future for British pubs. However, the amended Bill would have significant, adverse consequences for Britain’s community pubs.’ David Forde, managing director of Heineken, said: ‘What the great British pub needs most is sustained investment to improve standards and attract more customers.’ Analysts at Barclays estimate a switch of all pubs from rent only could hit profits at Enterprise and Punch by 19 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. The pub groups are considering a legal challenge and the changes are expected to be fiercely debated in the House of Lords. If the Bill gets Royal Assent the change will be gradual, with pubs withdrawing from the beer tie as contracts expire and are renegotiated.","Price of a pint could fall after MP's vote to scrap 'beer tie'

"The Bureau of Meteorology has predicted an El Nino weather pattern to strike Australia this summer, with irregularly hot and dry weather on the horizon. El Nino is a climatic event occurring roughly every five years, which is defined by substantial warming in temperatures of the Pacific Ocean sea surface. In Australia, El Nino is characterised by droughts and abnormal heat, particularly in the eastern and coasts of the country, which are already on the grips of a dry spell. This week, the Bureau has raised its prediction of an El Nino hitting this summer to 70 per cent, up from 50 per cent just two weeks ago. Scroll down for video . Lake Wallace dried up during a drought in Australia. This week, the Bureau of Meteorology has raised its prediction for an El Nino this summer to 70 per cent . Large crowds visit Bondi Beach on February 8, 2009 in Sydney. In Australia, El Nino is characterised by droughts and anomalous heat, particularly in the eastern and southern coasts of the country . Countries bordering on the Pacific Ocean who rely upon agriculture and fishing  are the most affected by El Nino. When the conditions last for months, fishing industries can be severely damaged. The counterpart to El Nino, La Nina, sees temperatures cool to lower than average across the Pacific Ocean, increasing the risk of cyclones and landfalls around the Asia Pacific region. Australia has already had two major heatwaves this spring, while sub-surface temperatures in the central to eastern areas of the Pacific are already 4 degrees warmer than average. The event is largely triggered by changes in the Pacific Ocean. 'We're seeing very warm temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean, about 1 degree above average,' said Andrew Watkins, the bureau's manager of climate prediction service. 'Things seem to have evolved fairly quickly in the last few weeks,' 'What's happened is that things have continued to warm up in the tropical Pacific Ocean rather than stay stagnant, and the central tropical Pacific has reached temperatures that are basically at El Nino levels now.' 'This has a strong impact on temperature. October was 2.8 degrees above normal and very dry. We're seeing similar conditions across southeast Asia in Malaysia and Indonesia. Simultaneously, there are   floods happening in South America, which is the other side of the coin.' The event is associated with very wet weather months in April–October along the coasts of Peru and Equador, giving rise to serious flooding. Mr Watkins says the Bureau used numerous approaches to reach the conclusion. 'There are  five international models which we have used  and they come from all over the world; France, England, America, Canada and Japan, plus our own model at the Bureau, which is called Poama.' Andrew Watkins (pictured), the bureau's manager of climate prediction service, says there are five international models which indicate that El Nino is on the horizon . A map from the Bureau predicting above average temperatures for summer across all of Australia . In its latest fortnightly El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Wrap-Up, the BoM has lifted its ENSO tracking status from 'watch' to 'alert'. 'There is enough going on here that is sensible to raise the odds, raise the threat level, because we don't want people to go without the best information,' Mr Watkins said the last time we saw similar conditions in Australia was in  2012, and the conditions are looking to be more severe this year. According to US weather agencies, 2014 has been the warmest ever April-September period, posing a serious threat that 2014 could be the hottest year on record. At the moment, the warmest year is a tie between 2005 and 2010. Mr Watkins warned it can be difficult to classify the event conclusively.'The reality is that it's not like flicking a switch. El Nino is not a sudden change, but rather a gradual progression,' he said. 'We are however seeing some telltale signs that these event will be reached by December.' Warmer Pacific temperatures combined with cooler seas around northern Australia mean there may be fewer tropical cyclones crossing the coast but also fewer tropical rain depressions relied upon by drought-affected farmers in Queensland, Dr Watkins said. 'They have already had a couple of bad wet seasons up there so a third one is not a good situation.' In 2009/10 there were serious drought conditions across much of eastern Australia because of the El Nino effect.","The Bureau of Meterology has predicted El Nino to arrive this summer .

"It has long been debated how cats went from running in the wild to becoming our domesticated furry friends. Researchers may have solved the mystery after analysing the genetic makeup of Egyptian cat mummies. The results of the study of DNA from the remains of ritually slaughtered animals found in tombs suggest that we have the people of Ancient Egypt to thank for our moggies and ginger toms. The Great Sphinx, a lioness with the head of a woman, shows the Ancient Egyptians' love for cats . Scientists at the University of California Davis published the study which points at the Egyptians as being the first cat breeders, The Sunday Times reports. In a paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, the team claim that in order to keep up with the demand of cats as sacrifices to the gods, the Egyptians had large catteries where felines were bred for slaughter. The research project, headed by Jennifer Kurushima, a scientist at the University of California Davis, said: ‘Modern cats can trace their genealogy to the time of the pharaohs. 'The Egyptians may well have been the first cat breeders, an important step in the domestication process of cats.’ Loved: As far back as Ancient Egypt cats were adored and the Egyptians even had cat goddesses to whom they sacrificed cats - the demand for animals to offer the gods led to the first catteries . The Egyptians revered cats and it is heavily featured in Ancient Egyptian art as early as 4,000 BC. They worshiped feline goddesses like Mafdet, the goddess for protection of dangerous animals, who was most commonly depicted as a woman with a lion or cat-head, and more famously Bastet, the cat goddess of beauty, women and fertility. It was to these two goddesses that the Egyptians sacrificed the ancestors of the modern domesticated cat more than 2,200 years ago. Popular: Cats have been domesticated pets for nearly 4,000 years . The aim of the study was to find genetic similarities between the mummified cats and modern cats and wild cats, to work out how long ago humans turned them into pets. Kurushima and team extracted mitochondrial DNA from three mummified cats found in tombs and compared it with samples from modern wild cats and domestic cats. Kurushima said: ‘Millions of cat mummies were offered and buried in areas throughout Egypt. ‘To supply the demand for votive offerings, catteries were established to raise large numbers of felines for slaughter.’ Cats have long been popular household pets not only for their cuddly fur and great companionship. Their vermin hunting skills led to cats becoming popular as pets in North Africa nearly 4,000 years ago, apart from a period of time in the Middle Ages when they were hunted alongside ‘witches’ and accused of being associated with the devil.","Research suggest Ancient Egyptians were the original cat breeders .

"The woman behind the controversial photographs of military mothers breastfeeding in their uniforms has been fired from her civilian job as an X-ray technician, while the women who posed up have been disciplined. Crystal Scott, founder of the Mom2Mom Breastfeeding Support group based in Spokane, Washington, told how her employers at Schryver Medical said her campaign to raise awareness about nursing military moms had drawn too much media attention. 'It’s sad because the media has portrayed Mom2Mom in such a positive light,' Mrs Scott told Right This Minute. Proud: Servicewomen Terran Echegoyen-McCabe, left, breastfeeds her twin daughters while wearing her uniform alongside colleague Christina Luna and her little girl at Fairchild Airforce Base outside Spokane, Washington . 'I was doing something for the good of people. I feel like our organization is making positive changes for women all over the world. To be punished for something that was good was unfortunate.' The military wife and mother-of-three has now hired a lawyer to fight the unfair dismissal. '[I was] sad, shocked, disappointed. To be wrongfully terminated for the media… I was upset,' she said. The military mothers who posed for the photographs have also been disciplined, according to reports. In the images, Terran Echegoyen-McCabe and Christina Luna are pictured nursing their babies on an Air Force base in an image that they said was intended to raise awareness of the right to breastfeed in public. But the controversial photoshoot was a violation of regulations against using the uniform to promote a civilian cause, according to Guard spokesman Capt. Keith Kosik. Although he told the New York Daily News the pair were not expected to . face disciplinary action, he said the incident warranted a formal . response for educational purposes. Fired: Founder of Mom2Mom Crystal Scott, who posed with her son Roman, has been fired from her job as an X-ray technician because of the controversial campaign . The striking image has seen a flurry . of comments, from supporters who say breastfeeding is a 'fundamental . right' to another who compared it to 'defecating in uniform'. Mrs Echegoyen-McCabe is pictured . breastfeeding her 10-month-old twin girls on her lunch break during a drill weekend as a member of the Air National Guard. By her side is friend Mrs Luna who feeds her toddler. Scott asked the women to pose for the support group she founded in January to help those who live and work at the Fairchild  Air Force Base outside Spokane, Washington. Mrs Scott has lived on the base for four years with her husband Kevin, an instructor, and their three children Gavin, ten, Aiden, four and one-year-old Roman. It was her idea to asked photographer Brynja Sigurdardottir to photograph the mothers in their fatigues ahead of National Breastfeeding Awareness Month in August. Following the photoshoot in May, the image of the military mothers breastfeeding was posted online and became a red-hot issue. Mrs Scott told MailOnline: 'We were not expecting it. We went to bed and the next morning, we were getting calls, comments and emails.' Although there has been a rally of . support, one Facebook comment compared the image of the mothers in . uniform to 'urinating and defecating'. Bringing about change: Trysta Chavez also posed for a photograph with her baby after seeing a lack of support for women breastfeeding in public . Mrs Scott said: 'No one can agree on everything and everyone is 100 per cent entitled to their opinion. 'But to compare breastfeeding to other bodily functions like defecating and urinating? It's disheartening and saddening.' She added: 'We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud. We've done nothing wrong. We're not disgracing the uniform, we are very proud. Crystal Scott, founder of Mom2Mom Breastfeeding Support Group . 'We can only hope that it brings positive changes not only for military but for women across the board to show them they don't have to hide in the closet. 'We love our military. We don't want to go against them at all.' There are currently no clear regulations as to whether or not a military member in uniform is allowed to breastfeed. There has been much confusion over this issue with some servicewomen being asked to move to private rooms while at the same time nothing has been said to women feeding their babies from bottles. The Mom2Mom Facebook page has been flooded with comments. Statement: Mrs Chavez was among the women who allowed themselves to be photographed for a campaign for National Breastfeeding Awareness Month in August . Tracy Mueller Schoesler wrote: 'What . strong beautiful women who are not just fighting for the freedoms of . this country but for themselves and their children! Breastfeedingis  a fundamental right in or out of an uniform!' One supporter Anna Krause commented: 'This is great. You are still A mom no matter what.' Another Jessica Emerick said: 'I . can't believe someone would have the audacity to judge or criticize this . photo, or any nursing mother. It's pitiful.' However there have been detractors. One fellow . soldier Rita Trujillo commented: 'I as one of many women who fought . long and hard to be accepted and respected as fellow soldiers and the . right to wear these uniforms feel shocked, angry at these published . photos.' Robyn Roche-Paull, a lactation consultant and a U.S. Navy Veteran wrote a book and has a blog called Breastfeeding in Combat Boots which aims to make women's position clearer while breastfeeding and serving their country. As she writes: 'There are NO polices or regulations in any of the military branches that either approve OR disapprove of breastfeeding in uniform.' She said that arguments against were based on the fact that it shows a woman to be nurturing and therefore 'unprofessional'.

"Walking around Sandals LaSource is a strange experience. It’s not just the staff who are incredibly friendly, but guests, too. If I were to knock on my neighbours’ door and ask them to fetch me a mojito, I know they’d happily oblige. A spare toothbrush? Coming right up. Everyone at this newly-opened Grenadian extravaganza seems blissfully, deliriously happy - from the British couple who excitedly tell me this is the tenth Sandals resort they’ve visited, to the young, amorous Americans slurping neon cocktails, who want to know all about the village in Hampshire where I was born. So my initial exploration of the 17-acre site becomes a lengthy process. Grab a cocktail, pull up a seat: The Sandals LaSource resort is a pristine hideaway on the Grenada shore . Sandals LaSource is a new addition to this lovely spot, a country which includes the main 120 square mile island and the smaller islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. It’s an adults-only affair (no under-18s allowed), one of 15 Sandals resorts dotted around the Caribbean. Grenada is a ten-hour flight from London and the resort is a five-minute drive from the airport, on the south-western tip of the island, specifically a beautiful stretch of sand known as Pink Gin beach. For this reason, I’ve packed my ear plugs, but not once do I hear an aircraft. There are 225 rooms and suites. Some have pools on the balconies, and there are butler suites where assistants wearing earpieces and white gloves dance attendance. Guests are given mobile phones with which they can contact their butlers, although I can’t help but cringe when I overhear a portly, sunburnt American barking orders for beer from his sun-lounger. Just glorious: Grenada is home to some wonderful stretches of shoreline, including Grand Anse Beach . I might not have a suite, but I’m hardly roughing it. My room, in the seafront Italian Village area, has an imposing marble bath tub on the balcony and a glass wall dividing the bedroom from the shower so, if you wish, you can watch your other half scrub sand from their nether regions. Waterskiing, kayaking, snorkelling and scuba trips all come gratis, and, for a small charge, there are excursions outside the resort. I opt for river tubing and spend the day floating lazily along a river lined by thick, jungle-like foliage, my progress impeded only by clusters of rocks which cause log jams. With a quick shove from our guides, we pop free like corks. Halfway along, we enter a deep lagoon and take turns jumping off a ledge into the clear water. On the way back to the resort, we stop by Grand Anse beach, near the capital of St George’s. Although one of the island’s most beautiful beaches, it’s surprisingly quiet, with just a few locals occupying the deckchairs. We have a quick look around the knick-knack-filled stalls then head to St George’s itself, home to the cruise ship terminal and a souvenir-filled shopping centre clearly aimed at passengers on a mad dash ashore. The spice market in St George’s Square is a fragrant alternative, and the piles of nutmeg, cloves and lemongrass remind us why Grenada is known as the spice island. Capital concerns: What passes for urban life on Grenada is lightly visible in the capital St George's . The snorkelling trip I have booked the next day is cancelled due to bad weather, so I opt for an island tour. One of Grenada’s darker periods was the coup-within-a-coup which resulted in the killing of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop on October 19, 1983. We visit the fort where he died. Bishop was executed by the People’s Revolutionary Army of Grenada, led by General Hudson Austin. On October 25, U.S. marines invaded on the orders of President Reagan. As we now know, he had to use all his charm to appease Mrs Thatcher, who, despite Grenada being part of the Commonwealth, was kept in the dark about the operation. U.S. forces took control of the island within three days. Austin was arrested and an Interim Advisory Council reinstated the 1974 constitution. Elections were held in 1984 and Herbert A. Blaize became Grenada’s new PM. Today, the bullet holes that pockmark the walls of Fort George are the only chilling reminder of this era. Sandals is brilliant for people-watching because of its diverse clientele. Some of the most interesting evenings are spent in the open-plan Living Room bar with its dance floor and themed music nights. The shameless dad-dancing and inappropriate grinding is truly something to behold. A guest tells me that Sandals resorts bring out the romantic side in everyone, whether they’re 18 or 80, but I can’t help thinking that the free alcohol also plays a part. Sandals guests refer to staff members as if they were old friends. The more hardcore fans wear their Sandals T-shirts like badges of honour and swap tales of Sandals reunions. Settling in nicely: Tamara enjoyed a splendid week on the sands of the Sandals LaSource resort . There are nine restaurants. I develop a penchant for eggs benedict at Le Jardinier, where I appear to be the only person not chasing down my breakfast with champagne. Another favourite is Butch’s Chophouse, a steakhouse named after Sandals’ chairman, Jamaican-born Gordon ‘Butch’ Stewart, who happens to be dining there when I visit. He’s a jovial, grandfather-type figure who happily chats to star-struck devotees. In the afternoons, I offset the threat of obesity by visiting the gym (Sandals guests party hard, but they work out hard, too; even at 6am there are queues for the running machines). When I’m feeling less energetic, I sign up for a round of bocce ball (an Italian boules-type game) and play board games at the swim-up bar. On my final day, I head to Le Jardinier and toast Sandals LaSource with a pre-9am glass of champers. Seven nights all-inclusive at Sandals LaSource Grenada (0800 597 0002, www.sandals.co.uk) costs from £1,629 per person, staying in a South Seas Premium Room. This price includes return flights and transfers.","A 'hidden' gem, Grenada is one of the more southerly Caribbean islands .

"An 11-year-old Colombian girl is in critical condition after one of more than 100 cocaine capsules her father had made her swallow as part of a drug mule operation, burst in her stomach. The girl was rushed to hospital in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, where doctors removed nearly 1.2lbs of cocaine during surgery. Police are now hunting for the schoolgirl's father, who is accused of forcing her to swallow 104 cocaine capsules so he could use her as a drug mule for a flight to Spain. Scroll down for video . Drugs mule: The 11-year-old was rushed to a hospital in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, after a cocaine capsule burst in her stomach, where doctors found 104 capsules during surgery (stock image) The schoolgirl underwent a life-saving operation after her father and another relative had rushed her to a hospital in Santiago de Cali early on Monday morning. The father and the relative then disappeared after leaving the 11-year-old with medics. The unnamed youngster was hours away from taking a flight to Madrid with her father, after which the two would have continued to the Canary Islands, police said. CCTV images from the hospital she was taken to showed a man rushing towards the A&E ward carrying her in his arms. He is later seen  talking to a second man in a corridor outside, before leaving the building by the door they had come through minutes earlier. Snowstorm: The 11-year-old schoolgirl from Santiago De Cali was hours away from taking a flight to Madrid with her father, after which the two would have continued to the Canary Islands, police said . Detectives were last night quizzing the youngster's mother while they hunted for her husband. Cali police chief Hoover Penilla said: 'The girl underwent emergency surgery because of the risk to her life and 104 capsules that appear to be cocaine capsules were removed from her body. 'Everything is pointing to the fact this youngster was going to be used in a twisted way by adults as a drugs mule to transport drugs from Colombia to another country.' He added: 'They had flights reserved to travel from Cali to Bogota and then an onward connection Bogota to Madrid with a final destination of Gran Canaria. Jhon Arley Murillo, a spokesman for the Colombian Family Welfare Institute which will now take temporary care of the schoolgirl, added: 'A case like this is horrific because it puts the life of an 11-year-old girl at risk. 'We are going to take steps to offer her protection and remove her from her harmful family environment.' Detectives investing the drama have already discovered her parents applied for a visa for her at the start of the year so she could travel abroad. They are understood to have told her school last week she would be away for a fortnight. The girl's mum has told police she and her husband were estranged but detectives say they believe she may be lying after searching the family home and finding evidence they still lived together. A passport in her name and the plane ticket to Spain were found during the search. Tests on the capsules removed from her stomach were expected to confirm today they contained cocaine. The youngster remains in intensive care at Cali's Valle del Lili Hospital, although her life is not said to be at risk. It is thought to be the first time the girl was going to be used as a drugs mule and police say they have never seen the tactic employed before by drugs trafficking gangs. A local TV station reporting on the case branded the adults involved as 'savages.' Colombia, alongside Peru, is known as one of the world's top exporters of cocaine. Police at Madrid Airport have in the past stopped drugs traffickers carrying cocaine sewn into the underside of wigs, hidden inside false plaster casts and stashed inside the arms of wheelchairs. The city of Cali became synonymous with cocaine in the eighties and nineties. The Cali Cartel, a drug cartel based around the city and the Valle del Cauca department, was once renowned and compared to the Russian KGB by the American Drugs Enforcement Agency which called it 'the most powerful crime syndicate in history.' At the height of its reign, they were said to have control over 90 per cent of the world's cocaine market.","Girl, 11, rushed to hospital after cocaine capsule burst in her stomach .

"Women are increasingly putting their husband's career before their own, a controversial new study of Harvard Business School graduates has found. It canvassed over 25,000 male and female students, and found 40 percent of Gen X and boomer women said their spouses' careers took priority over theirs. They researchers also said only about 20 percent of them had planned on their careers taking a back seat when they graduated.. The team also say that in most cases, children were not the cause of the lapsed careers. The majority of women said they assumed they would have egalitarian marriages in which both spouses' careers were taken equally seriously. Researchers surveyed more than 25,000 HBS graduates altogether. They reported on Baby Boomers (ages 49–67), Generation X (ages 32–48), and Millennials (ages 26–31), also known as Generation Y. They concluded that while women were well intentioned when they graduated, they ultimately ended up being held back by their partners. The new study of Harvard Business School graduates from HBS's Robin Ely and Colleen Ammerman and Hunter College sociologist Pamela Stone interviewed 25,000 men and women who graduated from Harvard Business School over the past several decades. 'In the end, we found not just achievement and satisfaction gaps between men and women, but a real gap between what women expect as they look ahead to their careers and where they ultimately land,' they wrote. 'The men and women who graduate from HBS set out with much in common—MBAs, high ambitions, and preparation for leadership. 'Perhaps it's time for more-candid conversations—at home, at work, and on campus—about how and why their paths unfold so differently.' The researchers found male graduates were much more likely to be in senior management positions and have more responsibility and more direct reports than their female peers. 'Setting aside those measures of success, since not everyone aspires to them, we found that women are less satisfied with their careers. The gap between men’s and women’s advancement to senior positions has endured, despite increasing numbers of women with the credentials and the experience to assume top roles across industries and institutions and despite the efforts of many organizations to develop their high-potential female employees. In the business world, women make up 5% of Fortune 1000 CEOs, and only a handful of them are women of color. The gap is narrower but still significant in professional service firms, where 20% of CEOs are women. And despite much interest in and attention to women on boards, women hold fewer than 20% of board seats at Fortune 500 companies, and their representation has increased only incrementally in recent years. Even fewer women of color (below 5%) occupy . Source: Catalyst . 'Whereas about 50% to 60% of men across the three generations told us they were 'extremely satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with their experiences of meaningful work, professional accomplishments, opportunities for career growth, and compatibility of work and personal life, only 40% to 50% of women were similarly satisfied on the same dimensions.' When they graduated, more than half of male HBS grads said they expected their careers would take precedence over their partners'. Only 7 percent of Gen X women and 3 percent of baby boomer women said they expected their careers to take precedence. Researchers surveyed more than 25,000 HBS graduates altogether.

"Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer has lashed back at rebel  senator Jacqui Lambie, accusing her of lying in parliament and scheming to start her own political party. His claims follow after a parliamentary spiel by the Tasmanian senator, during which she accused her party leader of trying to intimidate her and interfere with her role in the Senate. But Mr Palmer says those statements are lies and accused Senator Lambie of planning to set up her own political party. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer has lashed back at rebel senator Jacqui Lambie, accusing her of lying in parliament . The pair are at odds over Senator Lambie's pledge to vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal is reconsidered. She says she will not be told how to vote by anyone and claims her only boss is the people of Tasmania. But Mr Palmer says the outspoken senator hasn't brought a single proposal to PUP about Tasmanians or about veterans. Ms Lambie says she will not be told how to vote by anyone and claims her only boss is the people of Tasmania . 'She just wants to have a fight about nothing which is not a rational way to behave as a respectable senator,' he said in a statement. Mr Palmer on Wednesday sacked the senator from her party positions of deputy Senate leader and deputy whip and suspended her from all party meetings. After dropping PUP logos and references from her website, the Tasmanian senator split from her party colleagues in the upper house to vote against the government on a series of motions. She later accused Mr Palmer of spreading rumours about her and causing her personal distress. The Palmer United Party leader sacked the senator from her parliamentary positions on Wednesday . There's speculation Senator Lambie may quit PUP following their public spat, but for now she remains a party member. Mr Palmer said Senator Lambie had failed to attend party meetings and had not returned his phone calls or spoken to him for a month. He previously labelled Senator Lambie a 'drama queen' after she accused him of flip-flopping over her stance on Defence pay.","Clive Palmer has lashed back at rebel senator Jacqui Lambie .

"A mother who gave birth to her daughter three months prematurely while battling terminal cancer has had more than $90,000 raised for her family within 24 hours. Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth to Ava at 29 weeks in Melbourne on Thursday so she can undergo further cancer treatment as her health slowly deteriorates. Ava was born via caesarean weighing just 1kg as Ms Buchholtz lay in the hospital bed wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours. Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth to Ava at 29 weeks in Melbourne on Friday with doctors fearing her cancer riddled body would not cope with a full term pregnancy . Ms Buchholtz said she could not thank the Australian public enough for their generosity. 'It means a lot in our lives. It relieves a bit of stress, helps give us more of an opportunity for Alex to spend time with Ava - little things like that really mean a lot,' she told the Herald Sun. Ms Buchholtz and her fiancé, Alex Ansalone, had been desperately trying to raise money for cancer treatment to buy the new family more time together. The couple have terminated two pregnancies since they started trying for a family - once during her first fight with an aggressive stage four breast cancer in 2012. Ms Buchholtz and her fiance, Alex Ansalone, have been desperately trying to raise money for cancer treatment to buy the new family more time together . The couple, who have been together since April 2012, welcomed baby Ava on Friday at Royal Women’s Hospital in Melborne . Ms Buchholtz, pictured here pregnant with Ava, was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012 . They stored Ms Buchholtz's eggs before she underwent chemotherapy and had a double mastectomy. Ms Buchholtz and Mr Ansalone decided to try again for baby Ava when Ms Buchholtz thought she was finally cancer free. But 17 weeks into the pregnancy, her cancer returned and doctors said it had spread to her spine. In just two months, 12 new tumours have grown and spread into her neck, back, pelvis, hip and thigh. 'We've been told her prognosis is not good and there's no cure,' Mr Ansalone told the Herald Sun. 'So having the baby has been the best thing at this stage. It has helped us push through.' Ava was born via caesarean weighing just 1,056 grams as Ms Buchholtz lay in the hospital bed wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours .

Ms Buchholtz was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012. The tumour along with 18 lymph nodes were removed and she had a double mastectomy as a precaution. After a blood test showed Ms Buchholtz was pregnant, the couple decided to terminate the pregnancy so she could undergo intense chemotherapy. The couple managed to fall pregnant naturally following the treatment, but again had to terminate in September last year after learning the child would not survive due to abnormalities. Ms Buchholtz had a double mastectomy in 2012 as a precaution when she was first diagnosed . The couple expect Ms Buchholtz's ongoing treatment to exceed $40,000 and have set up a crowd funding website to help prolong her life . In December, Ms Buchholtz had  breast reconstruction surgery and was able to return to work in February. An MRI confirmed in August that her cancer had spread to the spine. Ms Buchholtz will now undergo radiotherapy and another round of chemotherapy following Ava's birth.

"A new Christmas survey has shown that New South Wales (NSW) and Western Australia are forecast to spend the most per person on Christmas gifts, while cheap jewellery or something from a service station may be the ideal gift if you come from Victoria. According to the Commonwealth Bank’s survey of 1,000 Australians, the bludgeoning economy of NSW with their strong population growth, and Western Australia, whose economy is thriving because of the mining industry, means that people from here will be forking out the most cash over Christmas. However, their survey also showed that Victoria was the ‘Mr Scrooge’ state as the statistics proved that it is the most frugal state over Christmas. With this in mind, Victoria shoppers should check out the results from another recent survey. Canstar asked 3,000 adults questions like if they feel obliged to spend lots of money, and how much they spend on their loved ones. The Chodzinski family and friends sit down for Christmas dinner last year. Matriarch, Dorothy Chodzinksi, from Newcastle was one of those surveyed by CommBank about spending over the festive season . Their research discovered that the worst gift people received at Christmas was cheap jewellery on 28 per cent; followed by toiletries (such as deodorant, body spray, perfume) at 25 per cent, and socks or underwear at 20 per cent. Canstar also found that 57 per cent of people feel obliged to spend a certain amount on gifts; 48 per cent tended to leave buying gifts until the last minute; while 12 per cent have bought a last-minute gift from a service station. Cheap jewellery was rated by Canstar's survey as the worst Christmas present to get . Tacky underwear might appeal to some, but 20 per cent of people told Canstar's survey that they hated receiving them as a Christmas present . On a more serious note, Commbank's survey uncovered that while many consumers expected to have the bulk of their festive shopping done by today, the average Aussie is forecast to spend an additional $1,079 over the coming weeks. Nationwide, CommBank forecasted that festive spending would peak at $17.8 billion in the five weeks between December 1, 2014, and January 6, 2015. Dorothy Chodzinksi from Newcastle was one of those surveyed by CommBank. This Christmas she said she’d spend $600 in total on her two daughters, while on her three nieces and three nephews she’d spend a total of $500-$600. (From left to right) Andrew White, Dorothy Chodzinski and Ania Chodzinski sort out last year's decorations. Dorothy said she would spend $600 in total on her two daughters this Christmas . ‘In my extended family we don’t buy gifts for our siblings, but instead concentrate on each other’s children. Christmas is all about them after all,” she said. She also couldn’t agree more with some of the results that Canstar’s research threw up. ‘Cheap jewellery is a pretty ordinary present, I have to say. Something that doesn’t reflect the person’s personality and lifestyle I’d class as a bad present. You have to show that you’ve made an effort,’ she said. 20 per cent of the 3,000 people surveyed by Canstar hated to get socks as Christmas presents . In a sign of the changing times, CommBank stated that online retailers can expect a busy start to December, with the research revealing six million Aussies plan to do their online gift shopping on December 1, 2014. However, the vast majority (72 per cent) of shoppers will purchase gifts at bricks and mortar stores, with festive spending expected to peak at shopping malls on Saturday, December 13, when 3.2 million consumers are forecast to hit the shops. Dorothy Chodzinksi's nephew Daniel (left) and niece Monica (right) open their Christmas presents last year. Dorothy spends a total of $500-$600 on her three nieces and three nephews at Christmas . ‘While consumers have been sending mixed signals on their spending intent in recent weeks, our research shows consumers are planning to open their wallets and spend big in the lead up to, and directly after, Christmas Day,’ Diana Mousina, Economist, Commonwealth Bank, said. In other areas Aussies are expected to spend a large portion of their festive budget in the Boxing Day sales ($2.6 billion) and entertaining friends and family ($1.7 billion). Underwear, cheap jewellery, toiletries and socks ranked as the worst Christmas presents going . ‘Interestingly, while consumers expected to have completed the bulk of their Christmas shopping by today, our research shows they are still planning to spend an additional $1,000 and the bulk of that will go on gifts,’ Mousina said. ‘Other areas we’re expecting consumers to spend include entertaining friends and family, and eating and drinking in and out of the home.'","CommBank forecasts that festive spending will peak at $17.8 billion .

"An illegal immigrant was jailed today for breaking the neck of a young ballet star in a violent street mugging. Doctors feared Jack Widdowson, 19, would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair after being robbed for his mobile phone on a night out. He was found unconscious on a canal path and paralysed after being targeted in the robbery of his iPhone. Ballet dancer Jack Widdowson pictured here outside Cardiff Crown Court (left) and (right) his attacker Mohammed Ali Mohamoed, 27 . Horror: Ballet dancer Jack Widdowson pictured here in hospital after the attack . But the court heard that nine months later Mr Widdowson - an apprentice with the Bern Ballet in Switzerland - had fought back to full health due to his extreme fitness, strength and flexibility. His attacker Mohammed Mohamoed, 27, was jailed for 13 years after being found guilty of attacking Mr Widdowson. Egyptian-born Mohamoed will be deported from the country when he is released from prison. Judge Justice Wyn Williams told him: 'You as a dangerous offender. You caused Jack extremely serious injury and he was very fortunate he didn't suffer permanent, devastating effects. 'You left him lying in the street which was callous in the extreme. Much credit is due to the young man who came across him and helped him and the medical staff who treated him afterwards. 'You will be subject to an automatic deportation when you have served your sentence - that will be in the hands of the home office.' Mr Widdowson, one of the youngest apprentices to be taken on by the Swiss company Bern:Ballet, was attacked while visiting his brother who is studying at Cardiff University. Attacked: Pictured here is Jack in a ballet performance days before the attack that left him with a broken neck . Talent: Mr Widdowson was one of the youngest apprentices to be taken on by the Swiss company Bern Ballet . The day before the attack he had his 'big break' when he was called up as an understudy for a leading ballet role. But Cardiff Crown Court heard his night came to a violent end when he was attacked by Mohamoed who took his Apple iPhone and left him for dead in the street. A jury was shown a video interview with the rising star, from Bath, Somerset, as he lay in a hospital bed wearing a neck brace after the attack. He told police: 'I have broken neck, that's going to have to have a hell of a lot of rehab and physio to get back to where I was. 'I've been told I'll make a full recovery and that's what I want to do - I just want to put this whole thing behind me.' The family of Jack Widdowson give a statement outside court after Mohammed Ali Mohamoed, 27, was found guilty . The court heard that minutes after the alleged attack Mohamoed was seen laughing and joking in the city centre, even kicking a football around with a group of boys. Unemployed Mohamoed was later arrested at his home in Splott, Cardiff. The court heard Mohamoed was born in Egypt and his parents, who are farmers, still live there. He drifted through Europe first moving to Italy before settling in Cardiff where he claimed to be a Palestinian refugee. The court heard that minutes after the alleged attack Mohamoed was seen laughing and joking in the city centre . Mohamoed lied to the UK border agency giving them a fake name and date of birth - he later tried to mislead the police in the same way. Prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees QC told Mohamoed: 'You broke his neck, then you lied to police because you realised you had committed a dreadful offence.' Mohamoed was caught on CCTV prowling Cardiff city centre looking for a victim to attack. He admitted meeting Widdowson and stealing his mobile phone which he later used to make a call to a friend in Italy before selling it at a market. But he denied attempted murder and told the court the young ballet dancer was unharmed when he left him in the dark alleyway in Cardiff Bay. Mohamoed, who admitted theft, was found guilty of grievous bodily harm and jailed for 13 years. After the case his parents Julian and Celia, who have since set up a charity called the Dance Again Foundation, praised Jack for his recovery. It said: 'Jack has made an amazing recovery from a horrific injury and we would like to htank the many people who have helped to achieve that. 'He has been performing for some time now and has already performed publically on a number of occassions. We and he are just delighted that he has been able to resume his career as a dancer despite what happened to him.' Detective Constable Mike Owens of South Wales Police said: 'Jack had been enjoying a night out with family and friends when he was subjected to a shocking level of violence by Mohammed Mohamoed. 'Amazingly Mr Widdowson, who is such a talented young man, has made a full recovery and we are delighted that he is back dancing again. 'Today's decision will hopefully allow Jack and his family to finally put this incident behind them.'","Doctors feared Jack Widdowson, 19, would be paralysed for life .

"Inconsistent: Even the man the university is named after - the 19th-century Mormon church president Brigham Young - wore a thick chinstrap beard . Students at Brigham Young University have launched a bid to overturn a decades-old ban on students at the Mormon school having beards. Despite having a campus full of otherwise fashion-conscious young men, the only facial hair on display at the university in the city of Provo, Utah is the occasional neatly-trimmed moustache. The world famous university banned chin hair in the mid-1970s in an effort to distance its strait-laced student body from the more-often-than-not bearded and long haired activists staging anti-war protests at other centres of education in the United States. But now, with beards having gone from being the ultimate symbol of non-conformism to a ubiquitous fashion trend, students at Brigham Young are urging university officials to lift the ban so that they can join the likes of Ryan Gosling and Ben Affleck in rocking the facial fuzz. Shane Pitson, 23, is among the group of reluctantly clean-shaven students leading the campaign to have the Brigham Young beard ban overturned. 'We want the option and ability to express personality through facial hair,' he told the New York Times adding that being Mormons doesn't necessarily mean students aren't interested in fashion. He also pointed out the irony of naming the famously conservative university after the 19th-century Mormon church president Brigham Young, who himself wore a thick chinstrap beard. Mr Pitson's campaign began in September after he was forced to shave off the facial appendage he had grown over the summer and has since been enthusiastically taken up by his fellow students. He even launched a website calling for the return of the beard, going so far as to pen a tongue-in-cheek letter written in the beard's voice. 'I know you didn't appreciate me hanging out with ""the wrong crowd"" and protesting the Vietnam War and all but I was honestly so hurt when you banned my presence,' he lamented, pretending to be a beard. Brigham Young University was founded in 1875 and for its first 100 years beards were a common sight . Campaign: With the rise of student activism in the 1960s, Brigham Young University's president, Ernest L. Wilkinson led a campaign to keep the school free of 'grimy, sandalled, tight-fitted, ragged-Levi beatniks' Brigham Young University was founded in 1875 and for the first century of its existence beards were a regular sight - so much so that male students held an annual competition in which they declined to shave for three weeks, with prizes given out to those with the most impressive growths. However, with the rise of student activism in the 1960s, the school's president, Ernest L. Wilkinson led a campaign to keep the university free of 'grimy, sandalled, tight-fitted, ragged-Levi beatniks.' By the mid-1970s his ideals had been written into the school's rulebook - banning beards along with a host of other fashion items deemed too subversive for conservative campus life. The only people currently allowed to wear beards on campus are individuals who can prove that shaving could cause medical problems - such as haemophiliacs or those prone to serious infections. The ban itself does not bar students from walking around the campus, but university staff are instructed not to allow them to take advantage of the basic necessities of student life - such as withdrawing library books, using the gym or entering classrooms or exam halls.","Brigham Young University banned students wearing beards 40 years ago .

"The bird flu-hit farm where 6,000 ducks have been culled waited almost a week to sound the alarm - after staff first thought the animals were spooked by Bonfire Night. Egg production dropped at the Cherry Valley breeding site in Nafferton, East Yorkshire, on November 8, but a vet only sounded a formal bird flu alert with the government on November 14, last Friday. The firm said staff first thought the noise of fireworks might have stressed the birds into laying fewer eggs. Then a vet suspected a bacterial infection, but antibiotics didn't work. Delay: The East Yorkshire farm where 6,000 ducks were culled yesterday (above) in a bird flu outbreak only sounded a formal alarm six days after the first problems were spotted, operator Cherry Valley has confirmed . Hosed down: Ducks are disinfected at the farm today. Three days before the first signs of the virus, a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm. They are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away . Only three days before the first problem was seen, a shipment of 15,000 eggs left the farm. They are now being tested for the virus in incubators 50 miles away amid fears they may have to be destroyed. A drop in egg numbers is one of the six key warning signs for spotting bird flu listed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). But Cherry Valley, which breeds 7million ducks a year for ready meals sold in Tesco, M&S, Lidl and Aldi at 33 sites across Britain, said many factors could have been responsible . A Cherry Valley spokesman told MailOnline: ‘On November 8-9 the farm first noticed problems and notified a consultant [private] vet, who was in touch with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). ‘There was no suspicion of bird flu originally, party because it was around bonfire weekend and there were fireworks. Grim operation: Workers wore protective clothing as they disposed of 6,000 carcasses from the stricken farm . A Cherry Valley spokesman defended the delay, telling MailOnline: 'It could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away, like a person feeling ill and going to the GP' 'These are one of the external factors which cause stress in animals and egg production to drop. ‘So it could have been one of many things rather than jumping to the very worst conclusion straight away, much like a person feeling ill and going to the GP.’ The private vet first contacted the APHA on November 11, but both parties agreed it was probably a bacterial infection and prescribed the ducks with antibiotics the same day. When ducks continued to die and the antibiotics didn’t work, the vet reported a suspected bird flu case on November 14, the spokesman added. Tests then confirmed the disease the next day and a public warning went out a day after that. In a statement, the firm added: 'There are well-established robust processes in place and they were closely followed. 'There was no suspicion of bird flu initially as a fall in egg production can be a symptom of several different things. These include general stresses, such as disturbance due to such things as fireworks which were a feature of that weekend.' Defra confirmed yesterday the virus was the same H5N8 strain found in Germany and the Netherlands. A leading health expert claimed there will 'probably be human cases' of the strain - despite it never infecting a human before. Elizabeth Mumford from the World Health Organisation warned the virus was 'unpredictable' as all 6,000 white Pekin ducks on the farm were gassed to death and dumped in metal containers. Dr Elizabeth Mumford (left) said although the risk of human infection was low, 'flu viruses are unpredictable' Red signs were placed around the small East Yorkshire village as environment secretary Liz Truss told MPs: 'Whilst we're never complacent about such an important issue, we do have a very strong track record' Wednesday, November 5 .

Egg laying begins dropping at Nafferton farm. At first staff suspect ducks have been 'spooked' by loud noises on Bonfire weekend. Tuesday, November 11 . Vet contacts Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA); both agree it is probably a bacterial infection and prescribe antibiotics. Friday, November 14 . With deaths continuing, vet sounds first bird flu alarm with APHA. Tests taken the same day. Saturday, November 15 . Tests confirm the virus is bird flu of type H5. Later tests rule out lethal H5N1 strain. Sunday, November 16 . Public alert declared late at night after emergency meeting involving the chief vet. Tuesday, November 18 . 6,000 ducks culled as Defra confirms virus is same H5N8 strain found in Germany and the Netherlands. She said there could be 'a few sporadic cases', adding: 'We believe any time that humans are in close contact with poultry, there's a possibility of transmission to humans'. Although the possibility of seeing human cases was low, she said: 'I don't see why we wouldn't. If it's really circulating widely, there's no reason we shouldn't see human cases.' It was the first time an expert had claimed the H5N8 strain could pass to humans. Other top scientists, including Britain's chief vet and Public Health England, have stressed repeatedly that the risk of transfer to humans is negligible. Yesterday a second site owned by Cherry Valley was drawn into bird flu fears for the first time. The firm's Usselby hatchery near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, incubating between 14,000 and 15,000 duck eggs which left the stricken farm on November 5 and are due to hatch in two weeks. Defra is now set to test the eggs and work out whether they need to be destroyed. A spokesman said: 'As part of our robust action in response to the confirmed case of avian flu, we are considering a range of measures including destroying a shipment of eggs sent to a separate farm for hatching earlier in November. 'This is in line with our tried and tested procedures for dealing with avian flu outbreaks.' Cherry Valley admitted the move but insisted: 'As the World Health Organisation, the Minister, the Food Standards Agency, Public Health England and others have made clear, there is absolutely no risk to humans and people should continue to eat all forms of poultry. 'Any eggs that are destroyed are done so to protect the integrity of the supply chain and ensure that the disease does not affect more birds.' Dr Colin Butter, head of avian viral immunology at The Pirbright Institute for animal health, said: 'It's certainly possible that eggs from an infected flock could carry influenza on their surface.' Final moments: Ducks are packed into crates and taken to be culled today at a bird flu-hit Yorkshire farm . Operation: The farm is run by Lincolnshire firm Cherry Valley, whose products from the 7million ducks it breeds in Britain every year include frozen duck meals for supermarket shelves such as the one above . He added: 'In chickens you would know very fast because they die. With highly pathogenic bird flu, which this is, the can die within a couple of days, so you know very fast that you have a problem in the flock. 'However, with some water fowl such as ducks, the symptoms of influenza can be much less severe, so farmers have to be on a very sharp lookout.' But he added: 'There's all evidence to suggest this farm picked it up extremely quickly... [And] I'm quite sure the scientists from Defra have this question in hand.' A Defra spokesman said: 'The advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Public Health England remains that the risk to public health is very low. The Food Standards Agency have said there is no food safety risk for consumers.'","Bird flu alarm was not sounded at Yorkshire farm for almost a week .

"A tense standoff between Occupy Denver protesters and authorities near the Colorado Capitol erupted Saturday with a surge of demonstrators being met with police force that included pepper spray and rubber bullets. The clash came as Occupy Wall Street protesters and state officials in Tennessee squared off for a third consecutive night Saturday, even though a local judge has refused to jail demonstrators who have been arrested and said the state lacks the authority to set a curfew on the property. In Denver, some supporters of the Occupy movement, marching with a group of about 2,000, tried to advance up the Capitol steps. Manhandled: A protester is grabbed by police officers during the unrest in Denver on Saturday . About eight officers scuffled with a group of protesters, according to The Denver Post, and police confirmed to the newspaper that they used pepper spray and rubber bullets or pepper balls to break up the crowd. Denver police spokesman Matt Murray said protesters knocked an officer off his motorcycle and other officers were kicked by demonstrators. Murray said seven protesters were arrested, including two for assault and one for disobedience, the Associated Press reports. Grounded: A man is arrested after clashing with police during the Occupy Denver protest after a march through the downtown district . Police arrested about 30 anti-Wall Street protesters in Portland early Sunday, dragging and carrying them to waiting vans, after they refused to leave a park in an affluent district. An Associated Press photographer said most of the protesters went limp and police carried or dragged them away. There was no violence during the arrests, which took about 90 minutes. Police said they arrested more than two dozen people on charges that included criminal trespassing, interfering with a police officer, and disorderly conduct. Another 38 protesters were arrested in Austin on Sunday morning when they refused to put away a food table. Texan police told the group that tables of food had to be put away between the hours of 10pm and 6am. He said some demonstrators had received medical treatment on the scene, but no one had been taken to a hospital. Mike Korzen, 25, said he was among the protesters whom police dispersed with rubber bullets and pepper spray. 'I was standing there with my hands behind my back,' Korzen said, using a water bottle to wash pepper spray from his eyes. Democratic Rep. Ed Perlmutter of the Denver suburbs visited the protest site Saturday afternoon to try to calm protesters. After the clash several protesters moved across the street to a park where a small encampment has been established. A city street between the park and the Capitol was blocked by police cars and a Denver bus. The . clash came after a week of police crackdowns around the U.S. on Occupy . activists, who have been protesting economic inequality and what they . call corporate greed. In Oakland, California, an Iraq War veteran was seriously injured during a protest clash with police Tuesday night.

Nashville, magistrate Tom Nelson has said there's no legal reason to . keep demonstrators who have been arrested behind bars and he has . released them after each arrest. He has refused each night to sign off on arrest warrants for more than two dozen people taken into custody. Protesters were galvanized by the friction between state officials and Nelson. 'My . heart has been here all along, but the arrests gave me the momentum to . come,' said Vicki Metzgar, 61, director of a Nashville Public Schools . science and math initiative who joined the protests Saturday. 'This plaza belongs to us, not the politicians.' Weapons raised: Mayhem as the protesters face the wrath of heavily equipped police officers . Some legal experts agreed with the judge. The . arrests appeared to be a violation of First Amendment rights in the . U.S. Constitution that allow for people to peacefully assemble, said . attorney David Raybin, a former prosecutor. He . and others said the nature of the arrests, coupled with the judge's . refusal to sign off on the warrants, could become ammunition for . lawsuits. 'The government is exposing itself to serious liability here by doing this,' Raybin said. The curfew at the Legislative Plaza, which state troopers began enforcing Thursday night, runs from 10pm to 6am. Others . questioned the timing of the curfew. The protesters had been . demonstrating for about three weeks before it took effect, a point that . Nelson said he factored into his decision. Face to face: Protester Elaina Jeansonne stands her ground in front of a row of police officers . 'You can't pass a curfew mid-protest . because you disagree with this group of protesters,' said criminal defence attorney Patrick Frogge, who is representing some of those . arrested. The state . Department of Safety is carrying out the arrests. Commissioner Bill . Gibbons, who until he joined the Haslam administration was the district . attorney in Memphis, said he didn't have a role in developing the curfew . but assured Haslam his department could enforce it. Cecily . Friday, one of the original Occupy Nashville protesters, said the . administration's attempt to get rid of the demonstrators has 'completely . backfired.' 'Over 1,000 people have been added to our Facebook page since the arrests,' she said. Among . those arrested Friday night was journalist Jonathan Meador, who told . troopers he was a reporter covering the story for the Nashville Scene . alternative newspaper. Ellinda McKinney offers her message to police during the protest on Saturday . On Saturday, the owner of the newspaper sent a letter to Haslam's staff. 'I . expect the governor to publicly apologize to him for this violation of . his rights and to assure the people of Tennessee that this . administration will not interfere with the right to a free press that . has been a fundamental right in this country since our founding,' SouthComm CEO Chris Ferrell wrote. 'I'm . sure you understand that every media outlet in this country will . vigorously defend our right to cover government action without fear of . arrest or reprisal.' In New . York City, where the Occupy Wall Street movement began last month, a . mix of snow, rain and slush made for sheer misery at the encampment in . Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan. Denver police order protesters to disperse after the disorder . Drenched protesters hunkered down in tents and under tarps as the plaza filled with rainwater and melted snow. Technically, tents are banned in the park, but protesters say authorities have been looking the other way, even despite a crackdown on generators that were keeping them warm. 'I want to thank the New York Police Department,' said 32-year-old protester Sam McBee, decked out in a yellow slicker and rain pants. 'We're not supposed to have tents. We're not supposed to have sleeping bags. You go to Atlanta, they don't have it. You go to Oakland, you don't have it.

"Parents have been urged to make sure their children have been vaccinated against measles following a second outbreak, this time in the North of England. Doctors have reported 200 cases of the disease in and around Middlesbrough in the past six months, with an additional 19 last week. As a result, health officials in the North East have joined colleagues in South Wales calling on parents to make sure their children are vaccinated if they didn’t have the MMR jab as babies. Injection queue: Parents queue with their children in Swansea for the MMR jab after an outbreak of measles in South Wales. After 19 new cases were diagnosed in Middlesborough, people in the North East are also being urged to get the injection . More than 1,000 people - mainly children - queued up at drop-in clinics in and around Swansea on Saturday to have the MMR jab after GPs reported 20 new measles cases daily. The Health Protection Agency publishes measles figures for England on a quarterly basis except where there is a local outbreak, and currently only the North East is being broken down in this way. Last week Public Health England (PHE) - which now oversees the HPA - said 200 cases of measles had been confirmed in the region since last September, along with 176 suspected cases. That was an increase of 19 confirmed and 14 suspected cases on the previous week. The majority of cases were in the Teesside, County Durham and Darlington areas. The figure of 200 cases in six months compares with 11 cases in all of 2010, 18 in 2011 and 41 in 2012. Outbreak: Parents are being urged to get their children the MMR jab in the North East after 19 new cases were reported . Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the North East PHE Centre said: ‘Measles is highly infectious and unvaccinated children and adults who haven’t had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region. ‘There is no treatment for measles but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine and two doses are required to ensure the best protection. ‘If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status they should check with their GP. If you’ve missed out on MMR in the past it’s always possible to catch-up as the vaccine can be given at any age.’ Doctors in Swansea warned last week that as many as 3,800 children there had missed out on having the MMR jab. More drop-in clinics will be held next weekend while an immunisation campaign is due to be held in schools after the Easter break.","19 new measles cases in the Middlesbrough in the last week after 200 in the last six months .

"Real estate tycoon Donald Trump blasted President Barack Obama on Tuesday for his handling of the Ebola crisis overseas, telling MailOnline that putting servicemen and women in close proximity to the deadly virus is 'morally unfair to the soldiers, and to the soldiers' families.' The perennial Republican maybe-candidate said in an interview that exposure to Ebola is inevitable for the hundreds of U.S. military personnel serving in Liberia. And it may be only a matter of time, he predicted, before men and women in uniform contract the disease – which kills between 50 and 70 per cent of its victims. 'You're going to see a whole new kind of ""hell to pay"" if they catch it,' Trump said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . FIGHTING WORDS: 'Obama has become immune to ""hell to pay"",' Donand Trump says, skewering the president for what he sees as a 'morally unfair' Ebola mission handed to servicemen and women . STOPPED: U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams (center), commander of U.S. Army Africa, cheered the groundbreaking of an Ebola treatment center in Liberia just two weeks ago – but he's enduring a 21-day quarantine before he can come back to the United States . SUPERVISION: Soldiers on the base in Vicenza, Italy are confined to a housing complex with barracks, a dining hall and a gym, but allowed no outside access – and they must not interact with other personnel at the site . But with a shrug in his voice, he said moral outrage that used to bother the president now seems to roll off his back. 'He has been hit from so many angles, for so many mistakes that he's made,' Trump explained. 'Obama has become immune to ""hell to pay"".' Already a group of about 40 soldiers and army officers – including a major general  – are languishing in quarantine on an Italian military base. The army calls the situation 'controlled monitoring,' according to CNN, but it's a distinction without a difference. There's been no indication from the Pentagon that any U.S. personnel are sick, but a plane carrying Army Major General Darryl Williams, the commander of U.S. Army Africa, was met on the base by medical staff in full hazmat gear. 'What's not being said,' Trump told MailOnline in a discussion about the situation on the ground, 'is they have to make sure they don't come back into this country if they have it. If our soldiers catch it, that would be absolutely – terrible. Just a disgrace.' The Pentagon did not respond to questions about why this group of officers and enlisted personnel was being kept in quarantine. Defense Department policy dictates that 'as long as individuals remain asymptomatic, they may return to work and routine daily activities with family members' even after exposure to Ebola. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the DOD 'has not issued a policy related to their workers that have spent time in West Africa.' Speaking Tuesday before taking off for a political rally in Wisconsin, President Obama told reporters that military quarantines are handled differently from civilian situations 'because they are, first of all, not treating patients. Second of all, they are not there voluntarily, it’s part of their mission that's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me.' RUNNING? Donald Trump has toyed with a presidential run in the past and might be gearing up his anti-Obama rhetoric for a stab at the ultimate prize in 20126 . But regardless of what they're doing 4,600 miles away from the nation's capital, Trump says Obama shouldn't be the only world leader to order deployments. 'I don't think we should be sending our armies' to western Africa, he said. 'We're the only ones who send our soldiers, while we're $18 trillion in debt.' While he allowed that it may be appropriate for American military engineers to build the kind of infrastructure needed to keep Ebola in check in the Third World, he still fixed his gaze on Africa's other side. 'Why are we the only ones doing it?' Trump asked. 'China's not doing it. And China takes a lot out of west Africa. You know, they take a lot! And Russia's not doing it. Nobody's doing it but us. It's unbelievable.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump's remarks. And the Obama administration hasn't addressed the thorny problems related to potentially quarantining the full complement of service personnel in western Africa – 4,000 in all. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have recommended that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel impose a mandatory 21-day quarantine for all servicemen and women, including National Guard troops, who return from the Ebola hot zone. COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: Obama said Tuesday that soldiers are in a different situation from health care workers because 'they are not there voluntarily; it’s part of their mission that's been assigned to them' Earnest said Monday that the White House 'will let the Department of Defense make an announcement' on their own timetable. Asked about the wisdom of sending thousands of troops to Africa without a set policy dictating how they might get home, he insisted that 'we’re going to let science drive that process.' The administration, which is arguing against requiring quarantines for doctors and nurses upon their return from Liberia and other nearby nations, might soon be in the position of mandating them for men and women in uniform. 'It's so sad. So sad,' Trump said. 'They'll send 4 thousand soldiers over there, ill-trained, ill-equipped, never heard the word ""Ebola"" before this whole thing started a couple of months ago, and now nobody knows how they come back.' 'And nobody knows whether they come back sick!' It's a very sad thing,' he said. 'And our soldiers should never have been sent over there.","Real estate tycoon says US shouldn't send its armies to western Africa unless China and Russia put their own troops at risk .

"Fathers4Justice campaigner Tim Haries, 42, was found guilty of causing criminal damage by a jury at Southwark Crown Court today . A Fathers4Justice campaigner who sprayed the word 'help' onto a portrait of the Queen as it hung in Westminster Abbey was found guilty of criminal damage today. Tim Haries, 42, shouted 'Fathers for justice' as he defaced the Ralph Heimans painting before telling an Abbey steward who tackled him to the ground: 'Sorry mate, I've got nothing against the Queen', Southwark Crown Court was told. Despite telling a police officer arresting him that he was 'guilty as charged', the father of two had denied a charge of causing criminal damage of more than £5,000. Haries, who told jurors he wanted to highlight the 'social justice issue of our time', smuggled a can of purple spray paint into the Abbey on June 13 last year, before scrawling the word 'help' on the £160,000 painting. Prosecutor Allister Walker said Haries was tackled to the ground by steward Peter Crook after defacing the large oil painting. Photographs of the incident were later posted on a Fathers4Justice Facebook page. Haries told officers who arrived at the scene 'It's for Fathers4Justice', and when asked if it was he who had sprayed the painting, he replied 'Guilty as charged', the court was told. Today jurors were addressed by Haries, who told them he had now decided to represent himself and said he carried out the act as a protest against the 'social catastrophe' of fathers not being allowed access to their children. 'The pain of losing my children has been like a living bereavement for me,' he said. 'I believe that contact denial is a hate crime and an abuse of children's fundamental rights.' But Judge Alistair McCreath, Recorder of Westminster, told the jury that direct action or civil disobedience could not be used as a defence in law. Haries was told he could leave the dock and sit at the back of the court room when representing himself. But, after being found guilty, he said he wanted to reappoint his defence barrister Kyriakos Argyropoulos. Judge McCreath told him: 'You can't just duck and dive and have counsel and not have counsel.' But Mr Argyropoulos said he consented to represent him again, before the judge said he would adjourn for a month for pre-sentencing reports to be carried out. Haries, of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was given conditional bail to return to the court for sentencing on 5 February, but the judge told him this was not an indication of how he would be dealt with. The £160,000 oil painting by artist Ralph Heimans before, left, and after it was defaced by the father of two . Haries later released a statement through Fathers4Justice in which he said his 'children's lives are worth more than any painting'. 'Whilst I disagree with the verdict reached by the jury, I take full responsibility for my actions,' he said. 'Every Family Court judge who separates fathers from their children does so with the authority of the Queen.' He said that he defaced the painting a day after his 'desperation at not seeing my children was further heightened' when a shared parenting debate in Parliament was attended by just four MPs. 'As a result of this disgraceful attendance and the obvious contempt MPs have for the children and families ripped apart in secret courts, I felt compelled to act,' he added. The portrait by artist Ralph Heimans . was cordoned off by a rope in the abbey's Chapter House as part of a . wider exhibition to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Commissioned by the Palace to mark the Diamond Jubilee, the . 11ft by 9ft oil painting took Australian portrait painter six months to produce, working 20-hour days. Mr Heimans, 43, painted the Queen in the sacrarium of Westminster Abbey, also know as the Coronation Theatre, standing on the exact spot where she was crowned. Ralph Heimans, 43, in front of his portrait of the Queen commissioned to mark the Diamond Jubilee . Known for his society portraits, he said he was thrilled to chosen to paint the monarch, whom he described as 'very beautiful to paint - I hadn't expected that'. The artist, a married father-of-two from Sydney, was given a one-hour sitting with the Queen, which he spent photographing her. After the painting was finished it was displayed in the artist's native Australia before being put on display in Westminster Abbey. The . oil on canvas has been repaired since Haries defaced it, at a cost of £7,300.","Tim Haries, 42, climbed over a cordon and wrote 'help' on £160,000 painting .

"A cafe owner has been forced to apologise after putting a sign in its window telling mothers they should breastfeed in the toilets. Tillings Cafe came under fire after a customer posted a picture of the notice - which informs customers they can use the disabled toilet if they want to breastfeed their babies - on Twitter. But the family-owned coffee shop in Gomshall, Surrey was forced to remove the sign after the National Childbirth Trust, the UK's largest parenting charity, asked for it to be taken down. The sign, which was posted in the window of Tillings Cafe in Gomshall in Surrey, which told breastfeeding mothers they would have to use the toilets . The laminated note, which is headed a 'Polite notice for the comfort of customers', read: 'We have baby changing facilities in our spacious disabled toilet. 'There is also a chair nearby which can be taken inside for mothers who are breastfeeding. 'We reserve the right to ask GROUPS of breastfeeding mothers to use this facility instead of feeding at the table.' The sign angered local mothers, who called for it to be removed. Hayley Kenway, who has a seven-month-old, said: 'I have been there before and have never had any problems. But after hearing about this I am disgusted that they have requested babies to be fed in the toilets. 'Asking any of their customers to feed in the toilet is a breach of human rights.' While mother Sophie Stone added: 'It's laughable that they seem to suggest groups of mothers take it in turn to use the chair in the loo. 'I think the screams of hungry babies would cause more disruption than feeding them ever would.' The note was posted in the window of the family-owned cafe in Gomshall in Surrey . The disabled toilet at Tillings cafe, where they suggested mothers should go to breastfeed their children . However, the owners have now taken down the sign and have issued a full apology, claiming the sign was meant to present an option for mothers, rather than an order. Owner June Radford, who has run the cafe for three years, said: 'Tillings can only apologise for a huge miscommunication. 'We have had many happy breastfeeding mums in our cafe in the three years we have been open and we continue to support breastfeeding. 'We have never and would never ask anyone to stop breasting in the cafe, nor leave the cafe. The sign, headed 'A polite notice for the comfort of customers', was posted on Twitter by a customer and attracted the attention of the National Childbirth Trust . 'We are a small independent family-owned business and we try to do our best to look after all of our customers. 'Being human we can make mistakes and if we have offended anyone in trying to establish an option for more private feeding facilities we can only apologise and ask for your help in telling us what we might do to support the breastfeeding cause.' Emma Pickett, chair of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers and a breastfeeding counsellor, said: 'Most people are now aware of the rules that breastfeeding mothers shouldn't be discriminated against. 'To say breastfeeding women should use a disabled toilet is unacceptable as it is unhygienic and what happens if a disabled person wants to use the toilet? 'Everyday breast feeding mums meet up all over the UK with other mums and babies for at cafes so it is important they are catered for.' Emma Bond, who posted a picture on Facebook of her breastfeeding her premature daughter for the first time, which was then removed from the site . The cafe row comes after Facebook were forced to reinstated a picture of a mother breastfeeding her severely premature baby for the first time last month after it was removed from the site because it ‘breached nudity rules’ Emma Bond, 24, posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, but soon found it had been removed after it had been deemed 'offensive'. Meanwhile in September, breastfeeding mother Olivia Pozniak claimed she was forced to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for breakfast at a Wetherspoon pub in Bexleyheath. And in June, 27-year-old Carrie Davies says she was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son. Mothers who staged a mass breastfeeding protest at a Sports Direct store in Nottingham in support for Wioletta Komar, who claims she was asked to leave the premises for breastfeeding her son . According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. However, in September a breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast. Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up. Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.","Tillings Cafe posted a notice in the window for breastfeeding mothers .

"Babies have long been known to favour attractive faces, but it would seem the youngest members of society have a wider definition of beauty than previously imagined. For although having a pretty face appeals to babies, beautiful, slender bodies do not. Particularly when it comes to men. Infants shown images of chubby and toned male figures displayed a marked preference for the fatter of the two, according to a study conducted by the University of Sheffield. Preference: Nine-month-old babies would rather look at Jack Black's physique rather than David Beckham's . 'The men with attractive bodies were . models, and the men with unattractive bodies were friends of the . experimenters,' explained the research team, led by psychology . specialist Dr Michelle Heron-Delaney. The images were shown to three groups of children, aged three months, six months and nine months, and their response was monitored by video cameras. Photos were shown in batches of two, for 10 seconds at a time. Each pair included one fat body and one muscly one, some of which had their faces covered and some of which did not. Of the three groups, those aged nine months showed a significant preference for the fatter bodies, their eyes lingering on the 'less attractive' physique. Beauty: According to researchers, the results reveal that perceptions of beauty evolve and develop with age . The six-month-olds could distinguish . between the two body shapes, but displayed no particular preference, . while the three-month-olds couldn't tell the difference. Interestingly, . the nine-month-olds only showed a preference for fatter bodies when the . head was covered: uncovered, the children made no distinction between . the two body shapes. Writing in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, . the researchers said: 'The current study suggests that during infancy, . preferences for particular human body shapes reflect level of exposure . and resultant familiarity rather than culturally defined stereotypes of . attractiveness. 'Precisely when and how children develop preferences for adult-defined attractive bodies remains a question for future research.' Explanations for the phenomenon included the prevalence of larger bodies in everyday life and the similarity of a tubby male physique to the female body. The researchers added: 'Because unattractive body shapes are more common than attractive/athletic body shapes in our everyday environment, a preference for unattractive body shapes at nine months of age suggests that preferences for particular human body shapes reflect level of exposure and familiarity rather than culturally defined stereotypes of body attractiveness.'","Young children shown photos of men had response monitored by cameras .

"The fattest Australians reside in the nation's sunshine state, a new report has revealed.

While Queenslanders still drink more than the national average, there has been a decline in the number of young men drinking at risky levels . 'We have the sad mantle of being the heaviest state in Australia,' she said.

"An ash cloud crisis even worse than the Icelandic eruption, which grounded thousands of flights four years ago, could be possible, scientists have claimed. The warning comes after the discovery that volcanic ash has travelled from Alaska to Northern Ireland - overturning previously held assumptions about the distances deposits could drift. It is the first evidence that ash clouds can travel across the vast Atlantic Ocean. Scroll down for video . Queen's University Belfast scientists found volcanic ash had travelled from Alaska to Northern Ireland. It is the first evidence that suggest ash clouds (stock image shown) can cross the Atlantic. This could mean airways are more susceptible to volcanoes than first thought . Dr Sean Pyne-O'Donnell, from Queen's University Belfast (QUB), who helped conduct the research, said it could have major implications for the aviation industry. He said: 'The usefulness is the awareness that such a thing can happen. 'Airlines are always interested in risk management. This allows them to be better prepared for such eventualities.' On Monday, Alaska's most active volcano began to calm down. It began spewing ash 35,000ft (10,700 metres) into the air over the weekend, but scientists said the volcano has a pattern of prolonged eruptions of varying intensity and they're not ready to consider the explosion over. Pavlof Volcano began erupting on Wednesday 12 November, culminating with a major blast on Saturday that lasted eight hours before its seismic activity dramatically dropped. The National Weather Service warned aircraft to avoid the area over the weekend because of the ash plume. Academics have traced ash found in sites across Europe, including Sluggan Bog near Randalstown in County Antrim, Northern Ireland to the so-called White River Ash resulting from the eruption of the Alaskan volcano, Mount Bona-Churchill, in 847AD. Chemical 'fingerprinting' was used to match the White River Ash to tephra layers - material produced by volcanoes - in Ireland, Norway, Germany and Greenland. For 20 years it was believed these layers had come from Iceland - the source of most ash in Europe. In 2010, plumes spewed out by the volcano Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland caused major disruption and grounded over 100,000 international flights, costing airlines more than £2 billion ($3.1 billion). Volcanoes like Mount Bona-Churchill in Alaska are much more volatile and are scheduled to erupt on average every 100 years, increasing the risk of another ash cloud drama with consequences for transatlantic as well as European travel. In 2010, plumes spewed out by the volcano Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland caused major disruption and grounded over 100,000 international flights (image shown), costing airlines more than £2 billion ($3.1 billion). The latest findings suggest a similar disruption from another volcano may not be as unlikely as thought . Dr Pyne-O'Donnell, from Queen's School of Geography, Archaeology and Paleoecology, added: 'If this was to happen again, which is not improbable, it would have massive implications for airspace. 'This is a very large area and is very busy with travel. There could be large-scale disruption.' The findings were made by QUB scientists in partnership with an international team of academics and have been published in the journal Geology . Researchers also speculate that other tephra layers from similar transatlantic eruptions may yet be uncovered in other Irish sites.","Scientists found that recent volcanic ash had travelled from Alaska to Northern Ireland .

"When accused murderer Gable Tostee is released from prison to life on the strict conditional bail conditions imposed by the Supreme Court of Queensland, the 28-year-old will walk into a much diminished world. Not only is he banned from his favourite pastimes - drinking alcohol and surfing Facebook, Tinder and Bodyspace looking for girls - the bailed defendant cannot drive, is banned from carousing on his favourite haunt, the Surfers Paradise nightclub strip, and is not allowed out after dark. Until three months before Ms Wright's death, Tostee had been a regular on the party strip, visiting clubs such as Crazy Horse, Cocktails, Club Liv, Bourbon Bar, Players, Alive, Vanity and Sin City, until managers banned him from at least two of the clubs for being 'creepy with girls'. Scroll down for video . Trial pending: Three months after Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death on the Gold Coast, her date that night, Gable Tostee, is being released on bail to await trial for her August alleged murder . This is over: Gable Tostee (pictured out at a Gold Coast nightclub) will no longer be allowed out at night while under strict bail conditions including an alcohol ban for the next six months leading up to his 2016 trial for alleged murder . Worlds' end: When Warriena Tagpuno Wright (pictured, left) lost her life after meeting Gable Tostee (pictured, right on his Tinder page) via the mobile dating app, she was a vibrant young New Zealander holidaying on the Gold Coast. Tostee was a nightclub frequenter, womaniser and social media addict . From this: Gable Tostee, who is being released to await trial for alleged murder, was once a regular at Sin City (pictured) on the Gold Coast party strip in Surfers Paradise, but was banned for being 'creepy with girls'. Now the accused killer is forbidden from going out after dark or drinking alcohol while out on bail . To this: Gable Tostee is on a strict curfew while on bail and may have few outings other than to attend alcohol rehab and perhaps resume working for his father at World Carpets (pictured) From today, the bodybuilder and self-confessed womaniser is only allowed outside his parents house between 6am and 6pm. He will have to regularly report to Broadbeach Police station, always driven the 15km there and back because Tostee's license has been suspended on a drink driving charge. The flooring contractor's sole outings may be to work with his father, Gray Tostee, at World Carpets, where the elder Tostee acts as a sales manager, and participate in an alcohol rehab program ordered by the court. Parental supervision: Gray Tostee (pictured outside his World Carpets office on the Gold Coast) and wife Helene will supervise son Gable Tostee, 28, while he is on bail awaiting trial for alleged murder next year . House arrest: Gable Tostee will have to reside at his parents' house (pictured) in a gated community at Carrara on the Gold Coast and will not be allowed outside between 6pm and 6am under strict curfew . Judge Debra Mullins said on Tuesday Tostee did not wish to be screened for alcohol on any day except Sunday, but he will be subject to random breath testing at any time of the day or night.. Gable, who has been treated by a psychiatrist since 2009 for 'insecure social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and depression' is banned from using any form of social media. Following his arrest on August 15, Tostee organised for a posting on his Facebook page in September, in which he said, 'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone'. Off limits: Gable Tostee was renting Apartment 1404 in the Avalon building (above, left) when he met Warriena Wright in the Surfers Paradise Beer Garden and then went back to his flat and she fell. He will no longer be able to fraternise in Gold Coast hosteleries and will be subject to alcohol tests . Taboo: Facebook, Tinder and all other social media outlets are out of bounds for Gable Tostee (who released this post, above, while in prison) after his release on strict bail conditions to the care of his family . Tragic loss: The circumstances of the death of Warriena Wright (pictured, right, with sister Reza) will be examined in a murder trial next year . Tostee also  has a history of suffering from attention deficit disorder. Prosecutors argued that Tostee - who could face a 20 year jail term if convicted of murder - was a serious flight risk. The $200,000 surety put up by his parents to diminish the risk is the equivalent  of Gray and Helene Tostee's equity in their Gold Coast house, according to bail documents. If Gable breaches bail, his parents could lose the family home. Police are not expected to finalise their brief of evidence against Mr Tostee until April next year, and he may not go to trial until 2016. Gable Tostee's next court outing is on January 12, when he is due to appear at Southport Magistrates Court on the murder charge, as well as two separate overnight drunken incidents he allegedly committed in the months before his fateful Tinder date with Ms Wright. According to court documents presented at his first bail application, and the charges heard by Magistrate Kerry Magee in October, Tostee is alleged to have driven his car in a police chase at 3am on July 27 this year while having a blood alcohol level of .203 - five times over the limit. He is also charged with assaulting or obstructing police in an alleged incident at around 2.35am on January 27 this year in which a 'heavily intoxicated' Tostee is alleged to have kicked out at a sergeant and told a constable to 'f*** off c***'. Tostee has maintained his innocence of murder and his lawyer told Tuesday's bail hearing at the Brisbane Supreme Court he wished to clear his name.","Gable Tostee is due for release from prison on strict bail conditions .

"Parents have told how their children were left 'scarred for life' after cinema staff put on a horror film instead of a cartoon comedy. There was panic in a Saturday-morning screening when 15-rated supernatural thriller Paranormal Activity 4 started playing instead of PG family movie Madagascar 3. Youngsters reacted in horror as a 'flashback' scene from the original Paranormal Activity showed a bloodied corpse being hurled at the camera. Scroll down for video . Horror: An audience settling down for a family film were shocked to be shown 15-rated Paranormal Activity 4 . Around 25 families at the Cineworld cinema in Nottingham scrambled for the exits with their crying children - some as young as five - when the film started. Natasha Lewis, 32, had taken her eight-year-old son Dylan to see the film. The full-time mother, from Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, said: 'Dylan wanted to see the new Madagascar film as he's seen the others and they're his favourite. He was really looking forward to it. 'We sat down and it was meant to start at 10am, but it took until 10.30am for the lights to go down and for the trailers to start. 'They started playing the movie and I thought - this doesn't look right. And then I recognised the opening sequence as a flashback to the first movie, which I saw a couple of years ago. 'It opens on the most terrifying scene in the first film - where a body shoots full pelt towards the camera. Family fun: Children as young as five thought they were about to watch Dreamworks' Madagascar 3 . 'It's enough to make grown men jump, so you can imagine the terror in these young faces. 'Everybody just scrambled for the exits, all you could hear were children crying and screaming. Everyone was very upset. 'I've watched a few horror films in my time but the Paranormal Activity films are the scariest since the Exorcist. 'It was only about two minutes worth of the film but it was enough to scar them for life. 'There were parents and kids in there, including some children who were younger than Dylan. 'The cinema needs to check the film before sending everyone in so they don't make this mistake again. Blunder: Staff at the Cineworld cinema in Nottingham (pictured) apologised and offered a refund to the angry audience . 'I'm disgusted about it, mistakes like this simply should not happen. 'Dylan has not liked going to the cinema before but I thought we'd try it out. But now he never wants to go back.' Natasha was refunded the £11.40 she had paid for the two tickets by staff, who also offered customers the chance to see 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' on another screen. Cineworld apologised to customers who were affected by the glitch, and say measures are being taken to ensure it doesn't happen again. A spokeswoman for Cineworld said: 'We have investigated the incident and can confirm that this was a technical error with the projector and apologise sincerely to the families. 'All customers who were affected by the incident were offered refunds and complimentary tickets. 'We also invited customers to watch the screening of Madagascar 3 half an hour later. 'We take matters such as this very seriously and are currently working with technicians to ensure this does not happen again.' Zoo-escapees Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe and Gloria the hippo are still struggling to get home to New York. They decide to go to Monte Carlo to ask some penguins to fly them home, but a plane crash forces them to hide in a railway siding from the evil Animal Control Officer. The animals stow away on a circus train and talk their way into performing in Rome and London, where they impress an agent and secure an American tour. But when they arrive at the Central Park Zoo, the animals realise they have grown too much in spirit to be content in captivity. Instead, they join the circus permanently and proceed with their American tour. Suburban teenager Alex is showing her boyfriend Ben the family treehouse, where they discover Robbie, the child from next door. Scared by Robbie's behaviour, Ben decides to install laptops around the house to film what goes on. Over the next few days, an evil presence makes itself known. Robbie's possessed mother Katie appears in the house and talks to Alex's brother Wyatt. That night, he causes Alex to levitate in her sleep. When mother Holly encounters Katie she is killed. Katie then kills Ben when he comes to investigate. Alex pleads Wyatt to run away. Instead, he stands still and blank-faced in Katie's garden.","Children as young as five at Saturday screening at Cineworld in Nottingham .

"These pictures capture the moment animal lovers come to the rescue of more than 1,000 cats found starving, thirsty and cramped in cages on the back of a crashed lorry in China.

They were nursed with food, water and milk before being packed off to Changsha Small Animal Protection Association for treatment. Volunteers save more than 1,000 cats locked in wooden cages without food and water, after a traffic accident on a street of Changsha, Hunan province, yesterday . Cats that survived the Changsha crash have been sent to Changsha Small Animal Protection Association .

"A teenage girl dug herself out of shallow grave after she was raped by two men and buried alive. The 13-year-old was snatched while walking to Koran lessons from her local village in Punjab and raped by the men in an isolated area. Her attackers then buried her alive when they thought that she had died during the assault. Horrific: A 13-year-old girl was buried alive and left for dead after being snatched while on her way to Koran class in the Toba Tek Singh region of Pakistan . But she regained consciousness and managed to dig her way out of the muddy grave and flag down a passerby. She was taken to a medical centre and survived her horrific ordeal. According to the New York Post, her father Siddique Mughal told local police that his daughter had been taken. But they initially refused to investigate the incident. But they were ordered to arrest the girl's alleged attackers by the Lahore High Court Chief Justice's Complaint Cell. Another victim: 2007 Gang-rape victim Kainat Soomro was labelled a 'black virgin' and shunned by her rural village after she accused her alleged attackers . A judge from the Toba Tek Sing area, where the attack took place, has also been asked to investigate the matter. Child rape is becoming increasingly problematic in Pakistan. According to Pakistani children's charity Sahil, the number of children raped between 2002 and 2012 increased from 668 to 2,788. One of the most notable cases was that of Kainat Soomro who was attacked by four men when she was aged just 13 in 2007. She was shunned by her village after speaking out against her attackers and was labelled a 'kari' or 'black virgin'. Despite her own family being ordered to kill her to rid themselves of shame, they stood by her despite threats of violence against them. Her father and one of her brothers were beaten, and another older brother went missing and was later found murdered. Despite her quest for justice, her alleged attackers were eventually acquitted. She told the Press earlier this year that her family have 'lost everything'.","The teenager was attacked in the Toba Tek Singh area of Punjab .
