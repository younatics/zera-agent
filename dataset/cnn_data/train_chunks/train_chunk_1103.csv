"Sheffield United midfielder Jose Baxter says Nigel Clough’s knockout specialists fancy their chances of more success in the FA Cup. The League One team have lost only two of 19 FA and League Cup matches under Clough and reached the semi-final last year. ‘We were just having a laugh in the changing room saying we’ve got to be favourites now after a few have gone out,’ Baxter said. Jose Baxter (left) is eyeing more knock-out success in the FA Cup with Sheffield United . Nigel Clough's side are in the Capital One Cup semi-final and want to go far in the FA Cup . ‘There are still some great teams in there, though, and that’s what the Cup is all about, the underdogs beating the big boys.’ The Blades must first see off League One promotion rivals Preston in a replay at Bramall Lane a week tomorrow.

"Rangers legend David Robertson warned the Ibrox board they missed a trick by throwing out American financier Robert Sarver’s £20million takeover bid for the crisis club. Earlier this month, Rangers directors rejected the Phoenix Suns owner’s attempt to purchase a controlling stake - arguing he was unlikely to receive the necessary backing of 75 per cent of shareholders. But Phoenix-based Robertson, who suggested to the businessman that he buy Rangers after coaching one of his children at football, criticised the board for not acting in the club’s best interests. David Robertson feels Rangers have missed out by rejecting Robert Sarver's bid for the club . Robert Sarver is the owner of NBA side Phoenix Suns and tried to buy Rangers . When asked if it was a missed opportunity, the 46-year-old said: ‘It is. I don’t know if I’m speaking out of turn but I know it’s a fantastic opportunity, and I’m sure there could have been ways to make it work. The shareholding piece of it didn’t work out but if those guys really had Rangers at heart they would have tried to find a way to make it work. ‘I don’t know if people want power or whatever, but the way I think the shareholdings are, there’s a lot of small shareholdings that all add up. It’s a difficult situation. He needed 75 per cent and they felt they couldn’t have got that. The shareholders really could have made it happen.’ Sarver had proposed to loan Rangers £6.5m up front after seeing his initial offer rejected on January 6, only for his second proposal to be blocked on January 12. But Robertson, who won six league titles under Walter Smith during the nine-in-a-row era, believes Sarver would have turned Rangers into a force again. ‘He’s such an honest guy, whatever he says you can take as gospel,’ added Robertson, speaking at the SFA’s UEFA Pro Licence course at Hampden. ‘He had visions of getting Rangers back to where they were and even further. He’s obviously disappointed but he feels he’s the guy who could turn the place around.’ Robertson is unsure if the basketball franchise owner will launch another bid. Asked if Sarver could join forces with Dave King or the Three Bears, he said: ‘I don’t know. He was prepared to invest a lot in it. I talk to him now and again. He’s never going to give too much away. He’s obviously very interested but he’s got banks to look after, the Phoenix Suns and the Phoenix Mercury. He was very, very serious about Rangers. Rangers are in financial difficulties and the future of the club is uncertain . ‘He is by the book and straight talking. He’s not going to go around doing anything dodgy behind the scenes. I know him better than most. When somebody like him knocks on your door, I find it hard to understand why they didn’t open it. ‘He was prepared to invest a lot. On and off the field he could have done so much. I know Rangers as a club - even on the business side of it - are not operating to full capacity. Whoever ends up in control, you just hope there’s a good, solid plan.’ After Craig Whyte and Charles Green, it’s perhaps understandable Rangers were wary of a foreign investor appearing from nowhere. But Robertson argued it wouldn’t have been difficult to establish Sarver’s credibility. ‘With technology these days, it doesn’t take long to work out what a good guy he is. My daughter goes to school in Tucson - the University of Arizona - and he’s got the Sarver Heart Center there, so he does a lot of good, a lot of charity work. The Suns do a lot of charity stuff. ‘I run a club in Phoenix and his kids play within the club, I coach one of them. He’s just like any other parent, stands on the sidelines and cheers his kids on. He’s a down-to-earth guy and has been very generous to our club.’ Mike Ashley has been linked with a takeover but his ties with Newcastle could complicate matters . Sarver the basketball chief has an impressive record with the Suns, winning three successive NBA titles between 2005 and 2007. ‘He’s just a winner,’ said Robertson. ‘He’s obviously got the wealth to invest in a club - at some point he will - but he’s also got the infrastructure. You’ve got to meet tough guidelines with the franchise every year, every week. ‘Before I started talking to him, he was looking at other clubs in Spain and England. I mentioned Rangers and the problems they are in, and, having been there and seen what’s happened, he’s the type they need. He loves the passion that the club and the supporters have. He’s had loads of messages, thank yous — he’ll definitely remember Rangers for a long time.’ David Robertson was speaking at the SFA’s UEFA Pro Licence course.

"Some may call him 'nuts' or 'crazy' but Neil Tyagi doesn't care as he has set a $1 reserve price on his house for its Valentine’s Day auction, just for fun. The 33-year-old  transport worker wanted his house at 230 Blacktown Road in Blacktown, Western Sydney to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to its auction, deciding to call his agent and lock in the reserve price of $1. Despite his agent telling him it was a bad idea, Mr Tyagi went ahead with his plan, claiming he wanted to do something special and believes he will make a huge profit. Some may call him 'nuts' or 'crazy' but Neil Tyagi doesn't care as he has set a $1 reserve price on his house for its Valentine’s Day auction, just for fun . 'My family think I'm crazy, my wife thinks I'm nuts,' Mr Tyagi told Daily Mail Australia. 'We wanted to do something different, we wanted to do something fun that hasn't done before and for it to be memorable for someone who is buying the home.' Mr Tyagi said he and his wife Maria never wanted to sell the house in the first place. When their circumstances changed and they were forced to put the house up for auction, Mr Tyagi saw it as an opportunity to have some fun. 'We didn't really want to sell the property in the first place so when it came about that we did have to sell and we said we might as well do something different, something special.

The 33-year-old transport worker wanted his house in Blacktown, Western Sydney to go out with a bang and do something memorable in the run up to its auction, deciding to call his agent and lock in the reserve price of $1 . The couple bought their  576 square metre house in 2004 for $300,000 and hope to sell for between $500,000 and $600,000. While Mr Tyagi said he is slightly worried about the prospect of his four-bedroom two-bathroom home actually being whipped off the market for $1, he said he will just have to deal with it if it happens. 'I won't have a choice if it does sell for $1, we're going to have to cut our losses and let it go,' he said. 'When it goes on the market it can go anywhere from $1 up and after that it could go for anything so really we have to leave it up to the market to decide. So why not,' Mr Tyagi said.

Mr Bhandari said he hasn't slept since Mr Tyagi's bizarre request and revealed that he and his team have been working around the clock to ensure they are not 'left red-faced' following the February 14 auction.

"The left boot worn by Kris Commons yesterday is already worth a fair bit more than the one he parted with on the fake farewell last Saturday. Commons, who tossed his footwear into the New Douglas Park crowd in what was deemed a goodbye gesture, called upon on a replacement set to master Ross County. A shoot-on-sight policy that didn’t quite come off when he was the most likely Celtic scorer in a stodgy first half paid dividends after the interval to help the champions steal a march on Aberdeen. Kris Commons (centre) put Celtic ahead against Ross County and celebrates with his team-mates . Commons (centre) celebrates the winner in the 52nd minute as Celtic moved three points clear in Scotland . Commons (centre) shoots at goal for Celtic in the game against Ross County in the Scottish Premiership . Ross County: Reguero, Fraser, Paul Quinn, Boyd, Reckord, Kiss, Woods (Jervis 79), Dingwall (Boyce, 45) Carey (Maatsen, 78), Ross, Curran. Subs not used: Saunders, Cardle,  Brown, Toshney. Booked: Kiss . Celtic: Gordon, Matthews, Van Dijk, Denayer, Izaguirre, Brown, Biton, Commons (Scepovic, 75) Henderson, Griffiths (McGregor, 75), Guidetti (Ambrose, 86). Subs not used: Lustig, Zaluska, Thomson, Lindsay. Booked: Van Dijk, Commons . Goal: Commons, 52 . His 52nd-minute hit struck the leg of Paul Quinn for a lucky loop over Antonio Reguero to decide a fairly desperate contest and open up a three-point gap at the top. And without the Bolton Wanderers target and creative force of the side, curiously withdrawn by Ronny Deila with 15 minutes left, Celtic clung on with an extra centre-half in Efe Ambrose to survive some late raids from the host side. If that’s what life is going to be like . without Commons, then Aberdeen will be encouraged for the next four months, while Rangers will be given a boost for Sunday’s League Cup semi-final should the 31-year-old depart this week. John Guidetti, without a goal since November 30, and Leigh Griffiths, on Sunday charged by police for an alleged offence in an Edinburgh pub last year, both drew blanks while Commons always shaped up like the lock-breaker Celtic needed. Celtic's players celebrate Commons' strike from range landing in the back of the net . Celtic captain Scott Brown (right) attempts to score for Celtic against Ross County . Commons (right) was denied another goal in the late stages, despite taking the ball past Antonio Beguero (left) County boss Jim McIntyre was quick to learn his lesson from the 5-0 defeat doled out by Celtic in October when the champions were four goals up by the 34th minute. At Parkhead before the turn of the year he stifled Celtic in a stalemate and, for the third meeting in as many months, there would be no shame in trying the same tactics. Albeit minus Richie Brittain with a torn hamstring, County’s solid structure tested the patience and the probing of the visitors. Only when Scott Brown’s backheel flick to Emilio Izaguirre opened up an imaginative avenue to goal did Celtic threaten in the opening half hour. Commons, however, couldn’t keep his back-post header down from Izaguirre’s delivery. Deila pleads for his team to play at pace but, when confronted by a side detailed to throttle that ambition at source, Celtic often struggle to scheme at speed. The craft of Commons helped Celtic create more menace towards the end of the half. Scott Boyd, just as he’d done at Parkhead, was excellent in blocking shots at goal and he frustrated Commons here. Filip Kiss then conceded a free-kick on the edge of the area and Commons picked himself up to force Reguero into pushing away his dipping attempt. They were perhaps fortunate not to be chasing the game by that point. Izaguirre played the man, Craig Curran, at the back post instead of the ball that had pinged back and forth across Craig Gordon’s goal on the only occasion Celtic had to defend deep. Referee Kevin Clancy rejected those penalty claims. Gordon coughed up a Graham Carey drive but there were no takers and McIntyre’s complaint all day long would have been that his men didn’t counter with much belief after doing the right things when sitting off Celtic. Striker Leigh Griffiths reacts to missing a good chance to score for Celtic in the first half . Celtic manager Ronny Deila went over to celebrate with the Celtic fans after the full time whistle was blown . Liam Boyce, a late first-half replacement for the injured Tony Dingwall, led the County line after the break but the enforced adjustment had little time to take positive effect. Celtic were brisk on the break with Commons at the heart of a move that culminated in Reguero denying Griffiths and Jamie Reckord’s block stopping a strike from Guidetti on the follow-up. The on-loan Swede continues to drive his transfer price down. After netting 11 in his first 10 games, he went six appearances without a goal before Deila kept him benched throughout the back-to-back wins over Hamilton and Motherwell. Eligible to play against Inter Milan, Guidetti was salivating earlier in the season about that prospect and the dream of grabbing a hat-trick against Rangers. If he can string three starts together right now, that will be a surprise. Frustration boiled over as he squared up to Quinn near the end. At least that ended in a hug. Will that be an example for Peter Lawwell and Commons to follow over the club’s contract talks with their star man? It was no surprise that Commons was the spark for the winner. His speculative strike from 30 yards got the assistance his gamble required. After Commons let fly, Quinn turned his back and the connection from his calf took the ball on a looping passage over his helpless keeper and into the net. County have picked up just one point since their Parkhead heroics and, with Jake Jervis on for extra presence up top, only came close to snatching another on 80 minutes. Boyce cut inside Adam Matthews to whip a shot across goal and Gordon twice denied Boyd, but they had become daring too late in the day. At least that’s the ast McIntyre will see of Celtic this season, while their rivals still have the champions to contend with down the stretch of the relegation scrap.","It was goalless at half-time as Ross County frustrated Celtic in the first 45 .

"He is known as 'The Lizard', has been likened to a swan and, within poker circles, labelled a phenomenon. There are many faces - if the myths are believed - to the mysterious Brighton owner Tony Bloom; a quiet, private man whose club are very much centre of attention today when Arsenal visit the Amex Stadium in the fourth round of the FA Cup. He was nicknamed The Lizard by an old friend who claimed he had alligator blood at the card tables, from where his career winnings are somewhere in excess of £2million. Fans of Brighton have likened him more to a swan; calm, sleek and elegant above the surface, but legs kicking fast below the waterline to get where he wants. Brighton owner Tony Bloom is known as 'The Lizard' and has invested £200m into his boyhood club . Bloom will be hoping his Brighton players can cause an FA Cup shock against Arsenal on Sunday . The Seagulls know they face a daunting task against the Gunners who boast the talents of Alexis Sanchez . Bloom’s exact wealth is unknown but he has already invested approximately £200m in Brighton, sums that have secured a new home and bright future for the club he followed as a boy. And so, on days like today, when the FA Cup holders are in town, he is worth his weight in gold in the eyes of Seagulls’ supporters, who may not know this most reclusive of figures, but have much to thank him for. Bloom, 44, studied maths at Manchester University, then became a professional gambler, a trader in the City and eventually made a fortune setting up online betting firm Premierbet in 2002 and selling it for £1m three years later. Now a property developer and director of 12 companies, high-stakes poker was the launching pad to his empire building and he is convinced it has given him the tools for his role at Brighton. In one of his rare interviews four years ago, he said: ‘Poker gives you a good grounding in lots of things, including reading situations and reading people and making tough decisions. Those skills can be used in business and certainly in running a football club.’ Certainly Brighton would not have been able to move into their Amex Stadium, which opened in 2011, were it not for his £93m investment when he took over in 2009. John Hewitt, chairman of the Brighton & Hove Albion Supporters’ Club, first met Bloom when he replaced the club’s previous chairman Dick Knight. Bloom took over the reigns at Brighton from Dick Knight (right) in 2009 and funded their Amex Stadium . ‘We always thought you never know whether he will gamble with the club and end up losing it,’ said Hewitt. ‘But having met Tony, he doesn’t strike me as a gambler. That’s probably why he’s good at it. ‘We worked hard to get the stadium on its way but didn’t have the money to do it. Originally it was going to be funded by grants, but they didn’t materialise. If Tony hadn’t come along we wouldn’t have the stadium. The fact he’s a fan and he and his family go back with the club was important. He’s very driven in what he wants. Passionate, but doesn’t show passion. A bit like a swan, calm above the water but maybe paddling like mad underneath.’ Bloom is known to travel to away games via train and engages with fans, when he could easily afford to get there via a chauffeur-driven car. But for all the niceties, there is, predictably for such a successful businessman, a ruthless streak. The Lizard has cold blood. Bloom said in one interview, having declined to speak to The Mail on Sunday: ‘When it comes to football, people get very emotional and when I’m watching a game, I’m as emotional as the rest of them. ‘But running the football club, it’s really important to get that emotion to the back. Otherwise you’ll end up doing what a lot of chairmen always do and make some horrendous decisions.’ When Bloom first offered the money to build the Amex Stadium, then chairman Knight wanted to remain in charge, teach Bloom the job then unveil him as the man taking over when the stadium was opened two years later. Bloom had other ideas. In has autobiography Mad Man, Knight wrote: ‘Tony looked at me, it was an odd look as if to say why? He said, “I don’t need to do that. I’m going to run the club in a very different way from the way you have. I don’t think I need your advice”.’ Brighton boss Chris Hughton (left) will hope his side can put their poor league form to the side in the FA Cup . According to sources close to Knight, that is a much more polite version of events than the reality. Bloom had his way and fans welcomed this local lad whose family are intrinsically linked to the club. His grandfather, Harry, was vice-chairman when they were promoted to the old First Division in 1979 and died of a heart attack on the team coach on the way to an away fixture against Stoke. His uncle, Ray, was a director at the club before Bloom stepped up, and remains one. Bloom attended games as a youngster, but is not recalled on the terraces and fans suspect he was a guest in the directors’ box with family. His ownership of Brighton feels less like a gamble and more an act of love. He has covered their losses in recent seasons, totalling 10s of millions and paid for their £32m training ground and academy which opened last summer and was awarded the highest ever score by the Premier League’s independent auditor for a facility. They are struggling this season but have narrowly missed out on promotion via the play-offs in the previous two and there is no denying that, based on the structure of the club, they are ready for the top flight. Their 30,250 stadium will be packed for the visit of Arsenal. Lizard, swan or just a businessman with a soft spot for his local club, Brighton can be happy Bloom is leading the way.

"Andy Murray practised under the scorching Melbourne sun on Saturday - but the British No 1 will be playing under the lights on Sunday. Murray's last-16 clash against Wimbledon conqueror Grigor Dimitrov has been scheduled as the second match on Rod Laver Arena on Sunday night at around 8:30pm (9:30am UK time). And sixth seed Murray prepared for the blockbuster match with a practice session lasting just over an hour as the temperature reached 30 degrees on the outside courts of Melbourne Park. Andy Murray practices ahead of his crunch fourth-round clash with Grigor Dimitrov on Sunday . Murray arrives for his practice session after winning his opening three matches in straight sets . Sunday's match against Dimitrov, the No 10 seed, gives Murray the chance for revenge in their first Grand Slam meeting since the Bulgarian beat the then-defending Wimbledon champion in the quarter-finals at the All England Club last July. Murray has been in fine form so far Down Under, winning nine of nine sets played so far, and has also received a boost with 17-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer being removed from his quarter of the draw on Friday. Sunday will be Murray's first appearance on the main show court in Melbourne since losing to Federer in the quarter-finals last year. And Dimitrov admitted he expects to face a completely different Murray than the man he beat at Wimbledo. 'That day it was not him out there on the court. I think we all know that. I think it's a different scenario this time,' he said, who twice came from a set down to beat Marcos Baghdatis in five sets in the third round. 'It just happened for me on that day to really play good. I used every single mistake that he did. I'm sure in the next round he's going to be really focused and composed and wants to do everything to stop me.

'But at the same time, I feel that I'm pretty stable around me as well. I think the only thing I can do is get out there and play my tennis. 'It's a great match-up for me. I'm always excited to play against him. I always like that kind of challenge. I think physically and mentally I'm ready to play that match and really give 100 per cent. 'We always had good battles. We know how we play, so there's no secrets out on the court, which in a way is nice to have. At least you know what to expect. I think it's going to come down to those kind of little moments that we can use.' Murray has yet to drop a set in Melbourne and needed just over two hours to beat Portugal's Joao Sousa 6-1 6-1 7-5 in the third round. 'It will be a tough match (against Dimitrov) obviously,' said Murray, who won his last match against Dimitrov in the Paris Masters last year. 'He's played well in the slams the last year or so. 'He's obviously a talented player. He's one of the young guys trying to make a breakthrough, so he'll be motivated. Hopefully I can play a good match and make it tough for him.'

Thorough tests have been completed by Celia Marr, an expert on equine cardiology, and a recent trip to Newbury for a workout suggested the vim and vigour so apparent in Sprinter Sacre’s pre-Kempton outings remain. Barry Geraghty and Sprinter Sacre smash through the open ditch during a schooling session . However, that was only a racecourse spin and tackling Tingle Creek Chase winner Dodging Bullets, solid benchmark Somersby and recent Leopardstown scorer Twinlight presents a much sterner examination. The vibes leading into today’s contest have been extraordinary, with Sprinter Sacre’s price bouncing out to around 2-1 from odds-on before the punting public stepped in to support one of their favourite sons. Hopefully, that faith will prove well placed as plenty have invested heavily in returning the nine-year-old to the track and connections would surely not be risking one of the highest-profile horses to grace jump racing if there were any doubts. Comparisons have been drawn with Denman, who returned from a similar ailment to win the 2009 Hennessy Gold Cup, although he had been well beaten on his comeback at Kempton the month before. Sprinter Sacre has been compared to Denman (above) who returned from a similar ailment to win the 2009 Hennessy Gold Cup, although he had been well beaten on his comeback at Kempton the month before . Sprinter Sacre is a different entity, a sharper model, racier in design, not a bulldozer like the formidable Denman, for whom Kempton was always going to be too tight a track and the wrong way round. Henderson’s management skills are under scrutiny but Sprinter Sacre has passed every test to date. Earlier, LAND OF VIC (Ascot, nb, 1.50) makes a step up in class in the OLBG.com Mares’ Hurdle but Peter Bowen’s horse has a decent record when the accent is on stamina and could surprise more high-profile rivals.

"The last time Roger Federer lost this early at the Australian Open the world was a very different place. In January 2001 the dreadful events of 9/11, for example, had yet to happen. There was no such thing as Facebook or Twitter, and the great Swiss was still two-and-a-half years from winning his first Wimbledon. It is almost a whole career ago for Federer, who showed he is now much nearer the end than the beginning with his third-round exit at the hands of world No 46 Andreas Seppi. VIDEO Scroll down for Australian Open: Seppi shock win vs Federer 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 . Roger Federer (left) congratulates Andreas Seppi on his four-set victory at the Australian Open . Federer appears frustrated during his first ever defeat by Seppi in his 11th match against the Italian . Seppi raises his arms in victory after sealing an impressive 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) win . 2013 - Wimbledon . The defending champion loses to world No 116 Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second round. It is the first time since 2004 Federer has not made a Grand Slam quarter-final. 2013 — US Open . Loses in straight sets to Spain’s Tommy Robredo in round four. 2014 - French Open . Latvian Ernests Gulbis wins in five sets in the fourth round. 2015 — Australian Open . Andreas Seppi’s third-round win ensures Federer’s earliest Australian Open exit since 2001. Federer went down to a 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 defeat in which he seemed to feel all of his 33 years, producing an unexpectedly sluggish display against a player he had beaten 10 times out of 10 before Friday. Nobody would have thought he would be heading back to Europe before Rafael Nadal, who came in so desperately out of form but is now safely into the fourth round. It is a tribute to Federer that Melbourne Park was in a state of shock after his loss to the uncelebrated Italian, and that the result should spark such debate. There is so much mileage on the clock, so little to prove for the now father of four, that it is extraordinary he arrived as one of the favourites following such a successful 2014. He had not even started this year badly, winning the Brisbane Open by beating, among others, Grigor Dimitrov, whom he could have played again here in the quarter-finals were he to beat Andy Murray in the fourth round. While Seppi is no slouch — his winning forehand pass was a shot for the ages — Federer admitted he was at a loss about his display. He made vague references to having a poor feel for the ball in the two previous days, and when it had come to producing his best form at the most important time he had failed. Federer plays a forehand during his third round clash with Seppi at Melbourne Park on Friday . Italian star Seppi connects with a backhand on his way to victory against No 2 seed Federer . Of course, this is just one loss so far this season, but it completes his recent collection of unscheduled exits from Grand Slams. In 2013 he lost in the second and fourth rounds of Wimbledon and the US Open respectively, while last May he tumbled out of Roland Garros in the fourth round. Federer is now going to take a scheduled holiday, just a little earlier than expected. He always planned it this way because of an unusually truncated off-season and Friday's loss may have have been connected to its brevity. During his rebound season of 2014 he emphasised how important his break and training bloc had been to lay the foundations. This time he did not finish the official year until late November due to the Davis Cup final, while in December he travelled to India to make a $4million appearance in the International Premier Tennis League. Given his charity efforts and corporate work in Switzerland, he would hardly have had time to catch his breath before heading to Australia for the start of this season. Federer stretches to make a forehand shot during a difficult afternoon in the Melbourne heat . Seppi executes a backhand during one of the most memorable victories of his career so far . Federer pondered this at length afterwards. ‘It allowed me to stay in rhythm and plan to take a break after here,’ he said. ‘I was playing great leading into the tournament so I don’t want to say I peaked too soon. But then again, margins are small and these things happen. Clearly I will have a look at it but I don’t think I did anything wrong.’ He now has four weeks off before his next tournament, at his secondary home of Dubai, and by then there will be another Australian Open champion. The feeling persists that by far his best chance of getting one more Grand Slam is Wimbledon this summer — and that would be three years after his last one. Nadal, who suffered cramp during his nervy five-set win over American Tim Smyczek on Wednesday, was fully restored in asserting his superiority over Dudi Sela, the world No 106, winning 6-1, 6-1, 7-5. The key thing for the Spaniard is to be able to play matches, as he has been unable to string together any kind of run since Wimbledon last year. If his confidence fully returns then many stranger things have happened than him winning this title. Nadal’s next opponent will be South African giant Kevin Anderson, currently at a career-high ranking of 15. Federer will be watching from his holiday idyll somewhere, or trying to ignore it.

"What a match we have in store at the Rec on Sunday. Both Bath and Glasgow have everything to play for, with qualification to the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup up for grabs. It is remarkable that, along with Toulouse, all three teams can finish first, second or third so the group is on a knife-edge. It is still in the hands of Toulouse as, if they win in Montpellier, they win the group and Bath and Glasgow are playing for second. But stranger things have happened and Montpellier look like they have improved under Jake White, so they’ll give Toulouse a real challenge. Finn Russell could be the key for Glasgow against Bath in the European Champions Cup on Sunday . Both Bath and Glasgow know that a win is vital if they are to have any chance of progressing and things would be even better if the win came with a bonus point as well. Those circumstances mean we should have a cracker of a game, with both teams throwing everything at each other. Bath are extremely confident after their amazing performance last week in Toulouse which gave them a bonus-point win, but Glasgow had a good result last week too against Montpellier — albeit without getting the bonus point. Bath go into this game  as clear favourites for a number of reasons — they look to be at full-strength whilst Glasgow have severe problems in the back row, they are playing at home and have momentum on their side. There are some fantastic match-ups throughout the teams that will go a long way to determining the outcome of the match. Here are just three: . George Ford v Finn Russell . Without doubt, if both stay fit, these two will start for their respective countries at stand-off in the Six Nations. Ford was immense last week, mixing his game up beautifully, kicking well when he needed to and seeing when things were on to attack, even when deep within his own 22. They are different physically, Russell is much taller, but they are very similar in how they play the game. Russell faces a battle for supremacy against Bath fly half George Ford . Both kick and pass well and they are both very brave in defence; they both attack the line at pace, too, which creates so much space out wide for the outside backs. They love to attack, have good awareness when things are on or not and they will have a go. This is a big test for Russell in his young career because he needs to try and get the upper hand over Ford, no small task the way the Englishman is playing. Ford can be put under pressure though, the big Premiership sides like Northampton and Saracens have really asked questions of him and he has not coped well. What does not help Russell is that his back row is decimated and they have a hooker playing openside. Back three . I have bundled the back three together because all three match-ups are good. The wingers — Matt Banahan and Horacio Agulla against Tommy Seymour and DTH van der Merve — all share many of the same qualities; size, power, and, above all, pace. Tommy Seymour (left) skipping past Montpelier's Benoit Sicart in their clash last weekend . They all work very hard off the ball as well, popping up on the other wing and usually being in the right place at the right time. The Glasgow wingers just shade it when it comes to form, DTH scored a hat trick last week and Seymour has been on fire all season. I have high expectations of the full-back contest between Anthony Watson against Sean Maitland. I am a big fan of Watson, who glides across the ground effortlessly but with genuine pace. Give him space and he can be devastating. Maitland announced this week that he is leaving at the end of the season to join London Irish so he will want to justify this by playing well. He has been more of a winger recently but he likes the space that full-back gives you and he can have a huge impact on this game. Back row . I don’t think there is much between the two sides in general, apart from in the back row. Glasgow have been devastated by injury here and it is such a shame. I would have loved to have seen Josh Strauss, Rob Harley and Adam Ashe take the field but all are injured along with Ryan Wilson, Chris Fusaro and Tyrone Holmes. This means that Warriors are fielding a second row, a hooker and a centre in the back row! Glasgow Warriors head coach talks to the press ahead of his side's forthcoming clash with Bath . Leone Nakarawe, Fraser Brown and Richie Vernon would not have expected to play together in such a big game but they are and they will need to produce miracles against a very good Bath back row. At openside Francois Louw was brilliant last week in Toulouse, running great support lines and being strong in defence, and this is the one position that might settle this game. Fraser Brown is a good player but he is a hooker, not an openside. My concern for Glasgow is that Louw could dominate things in attack and defence because he is a wily old fox and he could get to Finn Russell in defence with no recognised back row to defend him.","Glasgow face Bath for a place in knock-out stage of Champions Cup .

"Roger Federer might be out of Andy Murray’s path at the Australian Open, but there is still the player who — contrary to his wishes — is sometimes called Baby Fed. Grigor Dimitrov is talented, has a playing style similar to the Swiss, the same agent and, as a consequence, many of the same sponsors, so it is hardly surprising that he draws comparisons. Now he stands in the way of Murray making his sixth consecutive quarter-final at Melbourne Park as they meet in the fourth round. Andy Murray celebrates on his way to his third straight-sets win of the week in Melbourne in the third round . Muray will take on Grigor Dimitrov in the next round, the man who knocked him out of Wimbledon last year . In something of a surprise move, Murray’s match against Dimitrov has been given the prominence of the main night match, local time, on the Rod Laver Arena. They were expected to have been on in the day, but instead will play around 9.30am British time on Sunday morning.It means that, strangely, neither Nick Kyrgios or Bernard Tomic will have their fourth round matches on the Rod Laver, despite huge interest in them here. Meanwhile Rafael Nadal will make his fourth consecutive appearance on the biggest show court. There seems to be a message to the two young Aussies: don’t get carried away with yourselves. Every player has matches that they would like to forget, and from last year one that Murray does not recall with fondness is his lacklustre quarter-final defeat at Wimbledon to Dimitrov. It was a curious performance that came as a shock because the Scot was in form, and to this day he does not really understand what happened. ‘I played great in the first week at Wimbledon. I was feeling really good, I was playing extremely well. I happened to play a bad match and that obviously can happen at any time in an individual sport,’ said Murray, who fairly breezed through his third-round match with a 6-1, 6-1, 7-5 win over Portugal’s Joao Sousa. Murray's groundstrokes were often sublime however and left Joao Sousa with little answer . Murray was cheered on by usual colourful support on another warm day in Melbourne . ‘Unfortunately for me it happened at Wimbledon so it was disappointing but it didn’t take me long to get over, because I was playing extremely well and just had a bad day. ‘You can’t stop yourself playing a bad match. It happens three or four times a year probably to most of the players. ‘I don’t expect that to happen on Sunday, I feel good just now, I feel confident, I feel pretty calm and there’s no reason why I should be concerned of that happening.’ One reason is that Murray feels more comfortable at this Grand Slam than at any other outside Wimbledon. He has also beaten Dimitrov in their one encounter since, at the indoor Paris Masters in November, although the Bulgarian had a distinctly end-of-season look about him. For his part, Dimitrov does not think what occured at Wimbledon will have much bearing: ‘I’m expecting a different Murray from that day. I think you hardly ever see top players looking flat early in the match like that; I think it will be a different scenario.’","Roger Federer is out of Andy Murray's path in his Australian Open quest .

"Wales will have far more players fit and fresh to start Six Nations training next week compared with first opponents England, whose leading men are involved in fierce club combat this weekend. Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, would have viewed the raft of team announcements for the final round of European Champions Cup pool games with a sense of satisfaction. Several regular starters will be out of the line of fire, which is not a luxury Stuart Lancaster has. Of the 15 likely to be picked to start for Wales at the Millennium Stadium on February 6, seven are not in action, including first-choice half-backs, Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar of the Ospreys.

In contrast, 13 of Lancaster’s likely XV will start Champions Cup ties with qualification at stake. Bath lock Dave Attwood has been named as a replacement, but fly-half George Ford will start. Only Gloucester wing Jonny May, who was rested from Thursday night’s win at Brive, will have had the benefit of a weekend of rest and recuperation.

"After his golden season, Mike Brown is experiencing the flip-side of acclaim and recognition. He is striving to live up to that sustained near-perfection and finding it frustrating. Raised and distorted expectations are the issue for Harlequins’ England full back, who believes that his game continues to improve. The peaks of 2013-14 featured endless tries and awards and fanfare for his work in the England No 15 shirt he had always craved. The 29-year-old became seemingly untouchable as the national team’s last line of defence. Mike Brown celebrates after scoring the first try against Italy in the Six Nations last year . Brown (bottom centre) drives forward with the ball for Aviva Premiership side Harlequins . Brown  runs with the ball during the QBE International match between England and New Zealand in November . He was named Aviva Premiership Player of the Year, England’s player of the QBE autumn series and Six Nations Player of the Championship. He was identified by the All Blacks as the key threat to their home rule last June. But this season, Brown has not been feted in the same way. With Quins blowing hot and cold and England stumbling through their November campaign, his every isolated error has been identified as proof that the spell has been broken. He can sense murmurs of doubt, but points to a shift in his job description and his profile, which has diminished his freedom to run amok. ‘I’m pretty happy with how I’m playing,’ he said. ‘I think my game is a lot more rounded than it was last year and I have a different role this season, especially with Quins. I’ve been playing more as a distributor — putting others into gaps, which is frustrating at times because my strength is my running game. I’ve been doing more kicking, too. ‘I feel like more of a marked man this year, but that creates more space for other people. As long as I’m making the correct decisions about when to pass and when to run, that’s good. I think I’m still playing at that same high level; it’s just that people focus on the flashy stuff. Brown (right) tries to hold off the challenge of Wasps' Alapati Leiua during the Champions Cup . Brown (centre), pictured in action against South Africa, was named England's player of the QBE series . Brown attempts to evade the challenge of Aaron Smith during match against New Zealand in November . ‘People expect me to be making those long breaks and scoring tries in every game now, but there’s so much more to rugby. I’m working hard and improving in other areas. If I wasn’t, I certainly wouldn’t be starting England games.’ Brown has all the self-belief associated with a run of 17 consecutive starts at full back for England, after spending time filling in on the wing. Nevertheless, he is alert to speculation about selection, with Alex Goode of Saracens continuing to pressurise him and many observers championing Ben Foden until he suffered a season-ending knee injury. ‘Once a player gets to a certain level and gets talked up, there’s always going to be chat about how they are performing,’ said Brown. ‘Look at Chris Robshaw and how often he gets it — about who should be playing instead of him. Then he puts in another top performance. ‘It creates a debate, but I can’t really look at that. I just have to get on with it.’ Having spent so many years striving for his Test breakthrough, Brown has no intention of tamely allowing a challenger to usurp him — particularly in this momentous year of a home World Cup. England international Brown (centre) is an ambassador for the Great Britain wheelchair rugby team . Brown pictured with Coral Batey (left), Mike Kerr (centre) and Chris Ryan (right) ‘There’s no way I’m going to take my foot off the gas now,’ he said. ‘It’s such an important year and hopefully I keep getting selected. I’m trying to show that my game is more rounded, even if some people don’t want to see it! I’m sure the coaches recognise what I’m doing.’ When he is back on England duty again next week, the focus will be to prepare for a return to Cardiff, where a Grand Slam crusade was buried under an avalanche of Welsh points in the record 30-3 defeat two years ago. Brown recalls the fervent atmosphere in the Millennium Stadium that day and the fact that England were in the hunt for longer than the scoreline suggests. Lancaster’s men have finished runners-up in the Six Nations for the last three seasons and as the arch-competitor, Brown won’t settle for that. ‘We’re an ambitious squad and we want to win it this year,’ he said. On Saturday, Brown will hope that he and the rest of Harlequins’ international contingent can lead the way in putting Castres to the sword in France, in the faint hope that it will lead to a place in the last eight of the European Champions Cup. He will be desperate to come through unscathed, to resume his attempts to live up to heightened expectations, in the national cause.

"Owner Derek Richardson's 'vision and courage' to move Wasps to Coventry can spur the club back to 'the forefront of European rugby', according to chief executive Nick Eastwood. Irish businessman Richardson has been a private figure since his April 2013 takeover saved Wasps from bankruptcy, preferring to dodge the limelight despite his rescue act. Richardson founded Ireland's first online insurance broker, 123.ie, and was reported to have received almost £30million in the 2010 sale to Royal Sun Alliance. Wasps players celebrate during the European Rugby Champions Cup match against Harlequins last week . The Dublin native has helped revive Wasps' fortunes, with the club hosting Leinster at their new Ricoh Arena home in Saturday's pivotal Champions Cup clash. Chief executive Eastwood believes Richardson's stewardship can now help restore the two-time Heineken Cup winners to their 'rightful place' at the pinnacle of European rugby. 'He's a very modest, private individual, very engaging and personable in person but doesn't want to attract a huge amount of attention,' Eastwood told Press Association Sport of Richardson. 'Clearly he had a real vision for the club, wanted to return the club to its rightful place in the forefront of domestic and European rugby. 'He's very much had the view that rugby's a fairly traditional sport, but where we were as a club we needed to break the mould somewhat. 'If you keep doing the same things you keep getting the same results, and obviously the club was in significant financial issues, so to change that around we had to do something pretty radical. 'We didn't move to Coventry because of that, but once we'd evaluated all the options this became head and shoulders above all else as the best possible option for the club. 'And Derek had the vision and the courage to make the best decision on behalf of the club.' Wasps launched their move to Coventry from London in December with a record Premiership crowd for their clash with London Irish. Wasps beat the Quins 23-3 in the European competition at the Twickenham Stoop last weekend . A crowd nearing 25,000 is expected to flock to the stadium for Leinster's visit, with Champions Cup quarter-final qualification on the line. Wasps are closing in on securing a site for a new Coventry training ground the club hopes to have operational by 2016. Eastwood believes London-based Richardson has always viewed Wasps as much an engaging business challenge as a labour of love. While Wasps' committed figurehead may have a Dublin background, Eastwood said there will be no split loyalties this weekend. 'It's hearts as much as minds, it's obviously a huge emotional love of rugby, and the Wasps club,"" said Eastwood. 'And there's a challenge there, a business challenge too, in doing something difficult. 'The nature of men of this ilk, extraordinary people in their own right, they see opportunity where everyone else sees problems. 'They see challenges as obstacles to be knocked over and not get in the way. 'And they find something they can't resist. 'I keep joking he's going to have a double-sided tie with black and gold stripes on one side and blue on the other and he'll flip it over depending on the result. 'He's through and through Wasps now. 'Put it another way, we were all cheering on Castres last weekend! 'Native allegiances have been overtaken by club loyalty, so there won't be any mixed feelings.' Rugby director Dai Young famously had to dig into his own pocket for medical supplies at the peak of Wasps' financial woes, as staff feared for their next paycheques.

"Dylan Hartley can beat his 'red mist' disciplinary problems to save his England career by seeking help from sports psychologists, according to Lewis Moody. Former England captain Moody revealed Northampton hooker Hartley has turned to sports psychologists in a bid to curb the temper that has jeopardised his international future. Hartley's red card and three-match ban for elbowing Matt Smith against Leicester in December took his career suspensions to 50 weeks, adding to bans for eye-gouging, biting, punching and swearing. Dylan Hartley has just returned from three-match ban after being sent off for elbowing Leicester's Matt Smith . Moody cites psychology sessions in 2005 for safeguarding his own international career following his red card for brawling with Alesana Tuilagi in England's 40-3 victory over Samoa. 'I know Dylan has been seeing a psychologist, I did the same in 2005 and it worked wonders for me,' Moody said. 'When you find the red mist descending, you distract yourself. 'How do you do that? For me, I ensured my first move in future would be to look at the referee, because my next action would be decided by him. Northampton hooker Hartley has turned to sports psychologists in a bid to curb the temper . 'That simple process made sure that I never had another yellow or red card in my career, post-2005. 'The worrying thing for me is that Dylan still keeps having these moments of red mist, and that will mean that teams will pick on him more and more.' Hartley claimed he had no need for sports psychology after his red card in the 2013 Premiership final for swearing at referee Wayne Barnes. The 28-year-old was able to ride out head coach Stuart Lancaster warning he faced his 'last chance' with England after that misdemeanour. Lancaster selected Hartley in his Six Nations squad this week, shaking off suggestions the 61-cap front-rower's latest red card threatened his Test future. Hartley returned to action in Champions Cup match against Ospreys last weekend . World Cup winner Moody, nicknamed 'Mad Dog' for his frenzied playing style, admitted he had to beat initial scepticism before benefiting from psychology in his own career. The former Leicester and Bath flanker hopes Hartley's decision to seek outside help is a positive move forward in the gritty hooker's bid to curb his disciplinary wrangles. 'There is a concern over his temperament in games, but that said, Dylan is a very physical, competitive, combative forward who you always want in your team,' said Moody, speaking on behalf of Land Rover. 'It's just at what point does Stuart say 'right, your behaviour is now costing the team'. England forward Lewis Moody (left) throws a punch at Samoa's Alesana Tuilagi in 2005 . 'It is frustrating to watch and I'm sure it's frustrating to him that it keeps happening, so there's got to be a way for him to deal with his emotion and to be able to control it. 'I'd hate for him to have any more incidents or his England career to be stopped short because of something he does. 'I know Stuart Lancaster and the squad have been working very hard with him, and that he takes it very seriously. 'The hardest thing for me actually was admitting that I needed to see a psychologist. World Cup winner Moody was nicknamed 'Mad Dog' for his frenzied playing style . 'I always thought it was my personal weakness that I couldn't deal with my own mental issues. 'There was a level of scepticism about it, but actually I came away realising it's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of you wanting to be better. 'Sometimes you just need one simple distraction, you've got to be able to deal with those emotions very quickly when something gets to you. 'You need to have a trigger that distracts you - all of a sudden you're back calm and cool and can make the right decision . 'I was very proud to deal with it, it never stopped me playing the game with the same passion either. 'And hopefully Dylan can deal with it now too.'

"Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie has given his unequivocal backing to Stuart Lancaster ahead of a potentially career-defining year for the England head coach. Lancaster will take his troops to the Millennium Stadium in two weeks' time to begin the pursuit of a first Six Nations crown since he took over in 2012. Focus will then turn to a World Cup on home soil in the autumn where England must finish in the top two of a group featuring both Australia and Wales to make the quarter finals. England coach Stuart Lancaster has been given full support by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie . Ritchie has praised the England coach for the 'bigger role' he plays beyond just training the team . Ritchie admits the pressure will be on Lancaster to get to the latter stages of the tournament but he is confident the right man is in charge to lead the team forward. 'The number one objective is coaching the team - absolutely his focus in terms of 2015,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'But again I think he's got that bigger role. He's also got a role about engagement with the public, engagement with the game as a whole. 'You've heard me talk about inter-connection. If you want to engage the country you have to have someone who deals with that. 'And he gets, I hope - and I think he believes this - a lot of support internally, because yeah, of course he's under some pressure.' Lancaster, with Brad Barritt (left) and Tom Croft, has not won the Six Nations since taking charge  in 2012 . England face a bumper year that includes the Six Nations and the World Cup on home soil . If all goes well at the World Cup then Lancaster is likely to also lead England into the 2019 edition after signing a deal in October which ties him to the RFU until 2020. The awarding of a six-year contract the year before a World Cup raised a few eyebrows but Ritchie insists he has even more faith in Lancaster now than he did the day the coach was appointed. 'We had a great advisory panel. I was sat there at the first meeting with Ian McGeechan, Conor O' Shea, Richard Hill and Rob Andrew,' he said. Danny Cipriani (centre) has been called up into England's Six Nations training squad . 'They were a great bunch of people to help. You had to start with this old-fashioned idea; this is what we want, how does he (the candidate) fit against it? How does he measure up? 'Three years on, that view has been even more informed, because I spend a lot of time with him and the coaching staff. We talk about values. Not only does Stuart have that understanding and appreciation, but it's palpably clear that this is a guy who has values. 'We could all say, 'Yes, but it's all about winning'. Of course it's all about winning. But it's also about values, and you have to say they are doing a really good job.'","England are involved in the Six Nations and World Cup at home in 2015 .

"Jermain Defoe wants to lift the FA Cup in his club’s colours one day – as opposed to a designer suit. The 32-year-old was cup-tied when Portsmouth beat Cardiff in the final in 2008 but still made his way up the Wembley steps to get his hands on the trophy. On Saturday, Defoe makes his home debut for new club Sunderland when they entertain Fulham in the fourth round of the competition. Jermain Defoe trains with his team-mates on Thursday ahead of the FA Cup fourth round tie against Fulham . Defoe is desperate for FA Cup success after missing out on Portsmouth's triumph in 2008 . And he is already setting his sights on a return to Wembley. ‘I was gutted when I was cup-tied, it was really hard to be honest,’ he said. ‘I was in my suit and I still went up and lifted the trophy though. That kind of thing makes you more hungry to do well and get back there. ‘I was happy for the boys, happy for the team and I was a part of it, even though I didn’t play. The whole day was special but you want many more of those days. I look forward to this game now against Fulham and hopefully we can win and progress. ‘From there you never know, Sunderland got to Wembley last year and were unlucky to lose. If we can do that again it would be great.’ Defoe is perhaps a dying breed of player who still holds the cup in the highest regard. Indeed, rather than being rested, the striker has told manager Gus Poyet that he is desperate to step out at the Stadium of Light for the first time as a Sunderland player. And he added: ‘The FA Cup has always excited me. It’s a special competition - one of the best in the world. Defoe made his debut for Sunderland against Tottenham last weekend . Defoe was part of the Portsmouth squad that won the FA Cup in 2008 but was cup-tied . ‘I’ve always loved coming in and seeing the other results, but it’s been a long time for me since I’ve played in the FA Cup, so I’m looking forward to it. A big game, at home, it’s important that we approach it like every other game and try to win.’ Defoe, meanwhile, cannot wait to sample the Wearside atmosphere as one of their own. ‘Even before I signed I knew that it was a special club with special fans,’ he said. ’You speak to other players that have played for this club and they have always said that it’s a special place, and although I only played for 70 minutes the other day (at Spurs) the fans were fantastic. ‘I spoke to my mum after the game and she couldn’t believe it, she said she couldn’t stop looking at the supporters and talking about how they didn’t stop singing throughout the whole game. ‘I have always known that it’s a special club with special people and now I’m really looking forward to making my home debut.’","Sunderland take on Fulham in the fourth round of FA Cup on Saturday .

"Jermain Defoe was in Toronto International Airport the last time he had a conversation with Roy Hodgson. That was in May, and the Three Lions boss was ringing to tell the Toronto FC striker he would not be going to the World Cup. Defoe might well have been tempted to jump on a flight back to London, rather than the plane he was about to board for a Canadian Championship match in Vancouver. Jermain Defoe has set his sights on a recall to the England squad following his move to Sunderland . Defoe made his Sunderland debut in their 2-1 defeat at former side Tottenham on Saturday . For that was the point at which Defoe – already missing home and the Premier League – realised that his MLS move had been a case of misadventure. ‘I was devastated,’ said the new Sunderland frontman, recalling the moment Hodgson delivered the news. ‘I was involved in every squad. If I’m honest, I thought I was going. When I got the phone call it was hard. ‘At the back of my mind I thought the main reason was because I’d left the Premier League. Defoe has scored 19 goals from 55 appearances for his country but was left out of the World Cup squad . Roy Hodgson has not spoken to Defoe since breaking the bad news to the striker in May last year . ‘I think the manager looked at that and thought there are players in the Premier League who are performing there and deserve to go more than me, whereas I was in another country. ‘But even before that I always thought, “I miss the Premier League”.’ Defoe has not spoken to Hodgson since and won’t be calling the England manager any time soon, preferring to do his talking on the pitch as he bids for a recall. ‘I don't think I need to speak to him,’ said the 32-year-old, who has 19 goals from 55 appearances for his country. ‘What am I meant to say to him? Why? Defoe joined the Black Cats on a three-and-a-half year deal from MLS side Toronto FC earlier this month . ‘I had the conversation when I wasn't included. He said it was because he wanted to go with a lot of the younger players who had done well. ‘It was as simple as that. At the end of the day, Roy knows what he gets from me. He can look at my England record.’ There was speculation that Defoe could retire from international football in the wake of his World Cup snub. But that was never a consideration for the player, who instead believes his goals for Sunderland can win back his place in the England set-up. Defoe faced the media up in the north east during a press conference on Tuesday . ‘I still think I've got a lot to offer,’ he said. ‘I still feel sharp. I've always worked hard and I still feel like I've got a lot of goals left in me. ‘Yes, I was disappointed and upset, but at the same time I still want to play for my country. I still want to score goals for England. ‘If I’m scoring goals, I’d like to think I’ll get the opportunity to do that again.’ Defoe, meanwhile, refuses to criticise MLS or Toronto, but does admit to being taken aback by the culture of the league. ‘One of the strangest things was the reporters in the locker room,’ he said. Defoe says he joined Sunderland because a return to the Premier League proved too tempting . The striker turned his back on the MLS outfit after just 12 months at Toronto . ‘I used to forget and just come out of the shower and I would be like, “woah”. ‘I was sat there and surrounded by journalists and I had just got out the shower. I had never experienced anything like that before. ‘There was also a lot of travelling. My first game was five hours away against Seattle and that was one of the closer ones. ‘I came out on a red carpet and there were fireworks. I was like “wow, this is a bit different”.’ In the end, it was the differences which persuaded Defoe to come back to what he knows. He will be hoping Hodgson, too, turns to a familiar face when he names his next England squad.

"Ciaran Clark insists painful memories from previous cup upsets will spur on Aston Villa against Bournemouth and is confident his team can end their embarrassing scoring record. The Irish defender played in the FA Cup third-round defeat to Sheffield United last January, as well as their exit at the hands of Millwall in 2013, and also the infamous humbling by Bradford in the League Cup semi-final the same year. With Villa scoring just 12 goals in all competitions this season, Championship high-fliers Bournemouth will travel to Birmingham with sights on another shock. Eddie Howe’s side have actually scored the same number of goals in the city in one match as Villa have all season - following their 8-0 league win over Birmingham. Aston Villa defender Ciaran Clark says they are determined to beat Bournemouth to rejuvenate their season . The Villa squad were put through their paces in training on Friday ahead of Sunday's FA Cup tie . Villa’s eighth home goal so far, scored by Christian Benteke, came late on in the third-round win over Blackpool as supporters began to call for Paul Lambert’s head. Clark insisted the mood in Villa’s camp remains healthy. ‘We’ve got too many good attacking players to not be scoring goals,’ he said. ‘We’re confident in ourselves and do it every day in training. ‘We’ll use the disappointment we have had from previous years to spur us on. It’s a horrible feeling walking into the dressing room knowing that you’ve been knocked out of the cup. It’s even worse when it’s a lower-league team, it’s devastating.’ Clark called on his team-mates to relieve the pressure on Lambert by producing a convincing win. ‘The manager does take a lot of the flak when the results aren’t going our way,’ he said. ‘We know as a group of lads that some of the games we have played in we should have got better results. I think it’s time for us to step up and start taking a lot of the responsibility ourselves. ‘The manager can only do so much in the week. The lads are all happy with what we’re doing leading up to the games. It’s about the time we get out on the pitch. Cup runs bring everyone together. We want to go as far as we can in this competition.’ Bournemouth defender Adam Smith will be hoping his side can progress against Villa on Sunday .","Aston Villa host Bournemouth in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday .

"Darren McGregor says Rangers’ players can’t use the latest bout of turmoil at Ibrox as an excuse for failure. Facing a trip to Cowdenbeath in their quest to peg back Hearts in the Championship, preparations were interrupted by news of caretaker manager Kenny McDowall’s resignation in midweek. Just weeks after Ally McCoist was placed on gardening leave, McDowall’s decision added to the steady drip of negativity enveloping a dressing room where players can’t even be certain they will be paid on schedule next week. Defender Daren McGregor has urged players to forget about the unrest at Ibrox . McGregor insists the squad must focus on their jobs, winning football matches . ‘We could sit here and go: “The gaffer’s gone and now Kenny might be going, the off-field antics”, you could write a big massive list,’ said defender McGregor, ‘but at the end of the day what’s the point? ‘We’re getting paid to play football and to win matches so that’s what we need to concentrate on. ‘I’d be lying if I said that sometimes it doesn’t swirl around in the back of your head. Of course it does because it’s human nature, but you try and block it out as much as you can and get on with your job. ‘Obviously, it was a bit of a body blow, but you just deal with it. Kenny came in on Tuesday and we had a wee discussion about it and cleared the air and that’s it, you move on. We trained as normal. The Rangers players train ahead of Saturday's trip to Cowdenbeath in the Scottish Championship . McGregor (centre) trains on Friday with Kenny miller (left) and Lee Wallace . ‘In any walk of life you get ups and downs and football is no different. In football it’s maybe intensified a bit. Over the past year or so here it’s maybe intensified, too, because of what’s happened on and off the park. I just concentrate on the objective which is to win on a Saturday and everything else you just put the blinkers on.’ A former Cowdenbeath player, McGregor knows what to expect in Fife this afternoon. What no one can predict with any real accuracy is the impact McDowall’s departure will have on a Rangers team already playing catch-up with Hearts. Dismissing suggestions players will ease off the pedal after learning their manager has no plans to hang around, McGregor insisted: ‘Definitely not. It’s not in my character. I’m pretty sure with the group of boys we have in that dressing room, that’s not going to be the case. If anything, we’ll be pressing harder on the pedal just to try and prove a point knowing other people have been thinking we’ll falter. Rangers are currently 13 points behind league leaders Hearts going into Saturday's match . ‘It might make it a wee bit more difficult, but coming to a club like Rangers, it’s difficult at the best of times, so you just get on with it.’ Beyond Cowdenbeath, the latest indignities to strike the club could hardly be described as the perfect preparation for a League Cup semi-final against Celtic next weekend. ‘I can agree with that,’ said McGregor, ‘but we can only control what’s in our spectrum, turning up and applying ourselves in training and in games. Everything else we need to block it out like the professionals we are. You need to block out the negativity. You can probably use it for motivation or just totally ignore it and I tend to do that. ‘If you look for faults and pessimism, you’ll find it. For me, I just get on with it. We had Tuesday and Wednesday with Kenny and our day off yesterday, so nothing was discussed. It’s just one of these things. I totally respect how the gaffer is feeling, but we still have a job to do and I’m sure he’ll be no different. When he crosses the line in training he’ll still be the Kenny we know.’","Rangers travel to Cowdenbeath on Saturday in the Scottish Championship .

"Frank de Boer has designs on taking the Newcastle United job, should the club come calling in the summer. The former Holland international, now manager at Ajax, claims his options are open – but did reveal he wouldn’t be leaving the Eredivisie side mid-season. De Boer is making a name for himself in coaching circles and, when asked if a move to the north east appealed, the 44-year-old did nothing to suggest he wasn’t interested. Ajax manager Frank de Boer has not ruled himself out of contention for the vacant Newcastle job . ‘I have everything open,’ he said. ‘But I will be ready that’s for sure. I only said if they asked I don’t go now because I am with Ajax and I don’t want to go halfway through a season while also stepping into a team that are already halfway too. ‘So, for me, if there will be a chance it is always in the new season.’ The search for Alan Pardew’s successor at St James’ Park has stretched into a third week, with caretaker John Carver urging Mike Ashley to make a swift appointment – although managing director Lee Charnley has said they could wait until the end of the season. Carver has yet to win a game in charge – picking up a solitary point against Burnley on New Years’s Day.

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes has hailed Bojan Krkic as one of his all-time great buys after watching the Spaniard again make his mark on the Barclays Premier League. The Potters paid just £3million in the summer for striker Bojan, who has previously played for such illustrious names as Barcelona, Roma, AC Milan and Ajax. Although the 24-year-old took time to find his feet, he has quickly learned how to adapt in English football’s top flight, and as Hughes noted Stoke are now “reaping the benefits”. Bojan Krkic (right) celebrates with team-mate Jonathan Walters after scoring the winner for Stoke . At the King Power Stadium, Bojan’s 63rd-minute shot-on-the-turn in a 1-0 victory lit up a drab midlands derby, ending the Foxes’ four-game unbeaten run and keeping them rooted to the foot of the table. “It was a good, well-worked goal, and no more than we deserved as I felt in general play we were the more creative team,” said Hughes. “Defensively we were rock solid. In fairness we didn’t have to deal with too much because ahead of them the midfield nipped things in the bud and didn’t allow Leicester to gain momentum in the game.” As for the inspirational Bojan, a delighted Hughes remarked: “He’s getting better every game. “The Premier League is a strong league, and he understood that when he came, but initially he was taken aback by it. Bojan battles for the ball with Leicester's Anthony Knockaert during Saturday's game . “But he has learned very quickly, he is an intelligent player, and a very talented one as well. “We’ve had to wait a little bit, but now he is up to speed and he is enjoying being part of a good team, one that looks to involve him and recognises the ability he has. “He is thriving in this environment after feeling a little unwanted over the past two or three years, being on the edges of teams he has been involved with, but that’s not the case with him here. “Obviously he is an outstanding player, but I’ve also been really impressed with his personality. “Given his career path some players’ heads would have been turned, but he is very level, he has great humility, is a good professional and we’re really pleased with him.” Suggested Bojan has become one of his better acquisitions, Hughes concurred, adding: “He is up there. “The money we paid for him takes people aback I would suggest given some of the figures bandied about for other players. Bojan is sandwiched between Leicester duo Danny Simpson (left) and Knockaert (right) “If you look at what we’ve got for the money we’ve paid then we have done really well.” After three wins and a draw in their previous four matches, by boss Nigel Pearson’s own admission his Leicester side were flat, with new signing Andrej Kramaric given little to work with following his introduction two minutes after Bojan’s strike. “It was a tight game settled by one moment of stand-out quality, and we failed to create the chances we had in previous games at home,” said Pearson. The home side’s best player on view was Jeff Schlupp, seemingly a surprise given his recent withdrawal from Ghana’s African Nations Cup squad with a knee injury. On the day of the tournament starting, Schlupp was creative and a thorn in the side of Stoke right-back Phil Bardsley. Quizzed on Schlupp’s inclusion, Pearson took umbrage as he said: “We said he would be out for 10 days to two weeks and that’s the case. “I don’t see how it (him playing) is a surprise. I didn’t pull him out of anything. “He had scans here and was advised not to fly because of the swelling and then he went down to London to have an independent medical that was organised by the Ghanaian FA, and they came to the same conclusion as we did. “They decided not to include him in their squad. If they’ve any problems then they need to look at their own administrators. It’s nothing to do with me. “What the Ghanaian FA decide to do in terms of making statements, how their administrators operate or comments the managers want to make, it’s entirely up to them, but quite frankly I couldn’t care less about that.”","Bojan scored the winner as Stoke beat Leicester on Saturday .

"Alan Pardew insists he did not dismiss the FA Cup during his time in charge at Newcastle - despite a dismal record in the competition throughout his tenure at St James' Park. The 53-year-old takes his Crystal Palace side to another former employer as the Eagles face a tough fourth-round tie at Southampton on Saturday, having already matched his win record at Newcastle following victory over Dover in his first game in charge. With cup humiliation coming with defeat at Stevenage in 2010 and Brighton knocking out the Magpies twice in successive years, many could point an accusatory finger at Pardew for his approach to the competition. Alan Pardew insists he did not dismiss the FA Cup during his time in charge at Newcastle United . A 2-1 success against Blackburn in 2012 was his only victory in the competition in a four-year spell on Tyneside, which came to an end when he left in December to fill the managerial vacancy at Selhurst Park. But Pardew maintains he always gave his best and understood what delivering silverware to a trophy-starved Newcastle fan-base would have meant to the city. 'That is the perception but it wasn't the case,' he said when asked if he took the competition lightly in the past. 'It was just at times we were unlucky in terms with selection of teams. We had a couple of bad results in that competition and, of course, the way it is with cups and their longing for a trophy after all these years, the hurt at going out was magnified each time. Under Pardew, Newcastle lost to Brighton in successive seasons in the FA Cup . 'Unfortunately I have to accept that but I can assure you we didn't plan for it. I have always done the same with cups. 'I have tried to make sure the team is competitive and sometimes you do have to look within your squad and give people the opportunity, as we did at Dover. Then hopefully you find out things about players, sometimes for the good and sometimes for the not.' Pardew does hold fonder memories of cup runs both as a player and a manager, having reached the final of the showpiece event during his time in the Crystal Palace midfield. Pardew has won all three games since taking charge at his old club Crystal Palace . He scored the winning goal in the 4-3 semi-final victory over Liverpool in 1990 and played both the final and the replay as the Eagles were pipped to the trophy by Manchester United. And he would suffer final heart-break 16 years later when he took West Ham to the Millennium Stadium, with the Hammers taking the lead twice against Liverpool before Steve Gerrard equalised in injury time and led the Reds to a penalty shoot-out victory. And now, if he can lead Palace to an unlikely win over high-flying Southampton at the weekend, Pardew will have already eclipsed his Newcastle record in the cup and will be dreaming of going one better than in 1990 and 2006.","Alan Pardew won just one FA Cup match while in charge of Newcastle .

'At the moment I am not in the least bit interested in qualifying for the Champions League next season.' Despite their domestic form, Dortmund have advanced to the knockout stage of the Champions League and face Juventus in the Round of 16 next month. With the league resuming on January 30 after the winter break, Klopp said he was confident his team would stay up and failure to play European football would not necessarily trigger a mass exodus of players. The 2011 and 2012 champions Borussia Dortmund currently sit in a lowly 17th in the Bundesliga . 'If there is a player who would want to leave just because of a one-year absence from the Champions League, then I must have completely misjudged him,' Klopp said. Dortmund have allowed key players such as Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski to be snapped up by rivals Bayern Munich in the past seasons. Current players Marco Reus and Mats Hummels are also on the wish list of many top European clubs. Failure to qualify for the Champions League would also put a dent in the annual turnover of the club, listed on the stock exchange, missing out on millions of euros of potential revenue.

"It has taken just seven weeks for John Guidetti to go from the hottest property in Scottish football to being frozen out of the Celtic team. In between opening his account against Hearts in a 3-0 League Cup win on September 24 and scoring a controversial penalty in a 4-0 win against the same opponents at Tynecastle on November 30, it rained goals for the 22-year-old. His 11 in 10 appearances, including a stunning League Cup hat-trick against Partick Thistle, had the Celtic fans beseeching their board to shell out the £3million required to land the Swede permanently from Manchester City. John Guidetti has suffered a dip in form in recent weeks after an excellent start to his Celtic career . That clamour has faded to bemused silence in recent weeks as Guidetti has gone from scoring hero to simply scoring zero. On the pitch, his miserable run of form included six appearances without a goal before Ronny Deila left him on the bench during wins at Hamilton and at home to Motherwell in midweek. The only YouTube highlights for Guidetti fans to watch in recent weeks have involved a video of the forward giving an impromptu rapping performance, with team-mate Virgil van Dijk on human beatbox. In Guidetti’s absence from the team Leigh Griffiths, who looked on his way out of Parkhead, has taken on the mantle of golden Bhoy at Parkhead, drawing plaudits from Deila this week for his ‘fantastic’ attitude and ‘world class’ left foot. With the Celtic manager preferring Stefan Scepovic as an impact substitute, Guidetti appears to have been pushed down to third-choice forward, with Anthony Stokes being deployed out wide left. It’s not thought Guidetti’s decision to stall talks on a permanent move until April are keeping him out of Deila’s starting XI. In recent weeks the manager has suggested it is just a form dip, saying: ‘All strikers go through periods like this. We have to focus on what is going to get him out of this situation.’ With Griffiths now seemingly in pole position to start next Sunday’s Old Firm QTS League Cup semi-final at Hampden, Guidetti may not get the chance to back up his bold promise to grab a hat-trick against Rangers. In the middle of his barren run, he vowed to become the first Celtic player since Harry Hood in 1973 to score a hat-trick against the Ibrox side, adding nonchalantly: ‘Diego Costa went four games without a goal a few weeks ago and no one mentioned it — but when John Guidetti does the same it’s the biggest thing in the world. I take it as a compliment.’ If the rise and fall of John Guidetti is a curious case indeed, one property he does not appear to lack is confidence. Yet, according Frank McAvennie, a former Celtic striker who shares Guidetti’s hunger for goals and his off-field sense of fun, it may be that the Manchester City forward is suffering an unexpected bout of self-doubt. On a previous loan in Holland, Guidetti scored 20 in 23 games for Feyenoord, only for food poisoning from eating chicken to leave him with paralysis of the right leg, ending his season. Prior to joining Celtic, he had not played for the best part of two years and McAvennie suspects the player may be harbouring an injury and that ghosts of setbacks past may be preying upon him. The Celtic forward looks dejected after missing a chance against Ross County last month . ‘Maybe John Guidetti’s just biding his time before bursting back into the limelight to score that hat-trick he promised against Rangers,’ chuckles McAvennie. ‘I love the boy’s confidence. You need confidence as a striker. I love his banter and I’d love to see John Guidetti — or anyone — score a hat-trick against Rangers! ‘But it looks to me he may have a wee knock that we don’t know about. Take it from me, you just don’t go from being a super-confident striker scoring 11 in 10 games to not scoring at all. ‘He was flying but almost overnight it’s all changed. That’s why I think he maybe has a knock. Unless you’re 100 per cent fit as a striker you’re maybe going to lack that little extra half-yard of sharpness to get in front of a defender and score goals. ‘Guidetti’s been out long-term before with illness and injury and even though he’s a confident boy, once you’ve had your first big injury you start to worry. It preys on your mind the next time. It’s only human nature. ‘I’m hoping it is just something minor like that and nothing else because I like the boy and he is a very decent player.’ Guidetti’s last goal was a controversial penalty at Tynecastle, awarded by Willie Collum despite there being no contact on the Swede by the sliding Hearts defender Brad McKay. Afterwards, Sky pundit Neil McCann — a former Rangers and Hearts winger — claimed the loanee had ‘thrown himself down’ and ‘conned the referee’. But McAvennie does not believe the ‘diving’ fallout led to Guidetti’s form crashing. Nor does he view Griffiths as the Swede’s main rival for the leading striking berth. Guidetti may not get the chance to score his promised hat-trick against Rangers next weekend . ‘Guidetti never claimed for the penalty, there was no action taken against him and it all died down quickly,’ he said. ‘And he doesn’t seem the type to let that sort of thing affect him anyway. ‘The change in Leigh Griffiths’ fortunes has been interesting. He was seemingly on his way out of the club but now he’s getting picked. ‘I watched him against Motherwell the other night and he’s a typical striker, he gets his head down and there’s no chance of him passing. People were screaming at him to pass against Motherwell. He reminds me of Andy Walker in that regard. He would never pass it either! ‘But I’ve actually got a sneaking feeling that Scepovic is going to be Celtic’s first-choice striker. He’s a decent player, he makes good runs and I think he will come good eventually.’ Frank McGarvey, another maverick former Celtic forward, admits he is equally puzzled as to why Guidetti’s goals have dried up. But he is clear that the player he rates as Celtic’s finest striker should not be given a crack from the start against Rangers. Guidetti in better times as he enjoyed a run of form that saw him score 11 in 10 earlier this season . ‘It’s a real mystery and there’s a lot of people scratching their heads on this one,” said McGarvey. ‘John Guidetti was scoring a lot of goals but now the other guys are all ahead of him in the pecking order. If it’s not an injury it must be some kind of internal issue because nobody can understand it. ‘I think Guidetti is the best striker at Celtic, and maybe also the best striker in Scotland. It’s not just his goals, but he brings workrate to the team and his attitude seems great as well. ‘Everyone is looking at the situation and saying: “Why is this guy not getting a game?”. ‘I’ve always thought that if Ronny Deila played Guidetti alongside Leigh Griffiths up front with Kris Commons in behind then Celtic would score goals for fun. ‘But Celtic without Guidetti won 4-0 against Motherwell in midweek and they’ve got maximum points in their last three games. You don’t change a winning team. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. So I wouldn’t start Guidetti against Rangers, even if he is promising to grab a hat-trick. ‘Everything comes out in the wash and I’m sure we will get to the bottom of this situation sometime. But, right now, John Guidetti’s situation is a big mystery...’","John Guidetti has gone from hero to zero at Celtic as his form has dipped .

"Manchester United central defensive target Mats Hummels has revealed that he may remain at Borussia Dortmund - even if the club fail to qualify for the Champions League. Dortmund have endured a terrible season to date and languish second bottom of the Bundesliga having collected just 15 points from 17 games. Qualification for Europe's premier competition looks extremely unlikely - they are 12 points behind fourth place - and rumours had suggested Hummels would leave if Dortmund did not reach the Champions League. Borussia Dortmund centre back Mats Hummels has been linked with a move to Manchester United . Hummels has revealed that Champions League football is not the 'only requirement to be happy' But the 26-year-old German international has intimated that is not necessarily the case. Speaking to Die Welt, Hummels said: 'We have worked to the maximum in every game but a few times but opponents were better than us. 'We have to get up and move up the ranks as soon as possible.

"Hearts owner Ann Budge absolved Rangers of blame following what she described as ‘a very frightening experience’ for supporters in the aftermath of last Friday’s abandoned match at Ibrox. But she branded the lack of segregation of fans leaving the ground and the parking for supporters as ‘clearly inadequate’ as police enquiries into reported scuffles and allegations of missiles being thrown at visitors’ buses continued. Budge, who has spoken to police as part of her own investigation, insisted there had been no intelligence to suggest there would be crowd disorder. Hearts owner Ann Budge absolved Rangers of all blame for what happened in the aftermath of their game . She said: ‘The SPFL match delegate’s report states unequivocally that the events were in no way caused by poor or ineffective match operation preparation on the part of the home club. Our own safety officer shares that view. ‘While we may not all agree with some of the decisions taken on the night, I am confident those decisions were taken in good faith, by appropriately experienced professionals using their judgement, and taking the big picture into account. ‘Both we, and Rangers’ security staff, will be working closely and co-operatively with the investigation, to assist in any way we can. Rangers' match against Hearts was abandoned due to severe weather at Ibrox . ‘As well as trying to identify those responsible, we will work very closely with all parties to try to ensure there is no repetition of this behaviour at the re-arranged fixture.’ When the match is replayed, with Saturday April 4 being discussed as a possibility, Budge has promised to personally oversee security arrangements in a bid to ensure it passes off peacefully. She said: ‘Lots of questions have been asked about what went wrong on Friday night. Extenuating circumstances conspired to turn what should have been a showpiece football match into what was at times, a very frightening experience for many supporters. Hearts players leave the pitch at Ibrox after their game against Rangers was postponed . ‘I have agreed with Police Scotland that we will personally discuss every aspect of the re-arranged fixture in detail, in advance of the pre-operational planning meeting. ‘We will focus closely on segregation issues both inside and outside the stadium, as well as car park security and on ensuring safe ingress and egress from Ibrox. ‘Last Friday was not a good experience for any of us, for many reasons. We must all do our best to ensure no repetition in the future. As ever, I have to ask that all of our fans play their part in stamping out unacceptable behaviour.’","Ann Budge absolves Rangers of blame for incidents at Ibrox .

"Phil Parkinson hailed a result to put Bradford City back on the footballing map as the League One side stormed back from two goals down to dump Premier League leaders Chelsea out the FA Cup. The City manager set his sights on Manchester United in the next round after an incredible comeback at Stamford Bridge left Jose Mourinho’s hopes of the ‘Quadruple’ in tatters. Trailing to first-half goals from Gary Cahill and Ramires, a terrific strike from Jon Stead shortly before the break gave them hope and second-half goals from Filipe Morais, Andy Halliday and Mark Yeates ensured a famous win against all the odds. Bradford City manager Phil Parkinson is congratulated by Mourinho having masterminded a shock win . And Parkinson, who guided the then-League Two side to the League Cup final in 2013, reckoned this result was every bit as good. ‘It has put Bradford on the map again,’ said Parkinson. ‘Two years ago we did that and today we have got a lot of people talking about Bradford again. ‘When we were on the pitch at the end celebrating, it did feel a bit surreal. We’ve come to the league leaders and scored four goals. Bradford manager Phil Parkinson (right) and his players and staff celebrate their third goal . ‘It’s a great feeling and it will be remembered in Bradford for a long time and the rest of the country as well. It was a great performance from the lads, we were disciplined throughout and we always carried a threat going forward. ‘We’re at our best when we’re positive and we showed that today. To be 2-0 down, the heads never dropped. As much as the goals were highlights, the honesty and the discipline of the performance was brilliant.’ The thrilling 4-2 win sent Bradford’s 6,000 travelling fans at Stamford Bridge into dreamland and Parkinson hopes another glamorous tie awaits. The Bradford squad celebrate their famous FA Cup fourth round win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . ‘If Man United get through against Cambridge, I’d love to have a go at them,’ he said. ‘I’m sure if we went to Old Trafford, we’d have 15,000 fans there. It was like a home game in the second-half and I’m just so pleased for every one of them.’","League Two Bradford City beat Premier League leaders Chelsea 4-2 .

"Olly Lancashire hopes there will be one interested spectator in Madrid when he leads out Rochdale in Monday's FA Cup fourth round clash against Stoke. The League One side have made the last 32 for the second successive season and their reward is a home tie against Premier League opposition. It is a big occasion for club and captain, but for some of Lancashire's former team-mates, big games are the norm every week. Rochdale captain Olly Lancashire is hoping to impress a selection of his former team-mates . Lancashire progressed through Southampton's academy alongside the likes of Theo Walcott and Gareth Bale . Lancashire came up through the Southampton academy at the same time as Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott and Adam Lallana and shared a house with the trio, now of Real Madrid, Arsenal and Liverpool respectively. 'There were about 17 of us in the same house,' said the defender. 'My age, there were seven of us. Unfortunately four aren't playing any more but obviously Gareth and Theo have done well. Then there was Adam Lallana, David McGoldrick, Nathan Dyer. 'It was a good house to live in, some very good times. I'm very good friends with Adam Lallana and Gareth Bale. 'It's great to see those boys doing so well but you want a little bit of that yourself. You've just got to keep working hard and hopefully one day it will happen.' While Walcott, Bale and Lallana quickly made their mark at the top level, Lancashire spent three spells on loan at Grimsby before being released by Southampton in 2010. Former Saints duo Walcott and Bale have gone on to play for Arsenal and Real Madrid respectively . Two years later he was released by Walsall but the nadir was a season at his hometown club of Aldershot. Injury restricted him to only 15 appearances and at the end of the campaign he was made redundant after the club went into administration. Lancashire admitted he questioned his future in the game, saying: 'There were definitely times. 'My injury didn't seem to get any better. I had operations and injections and there were times when I sat down with my girlfriend and my dad and discussed it. But thankfully now that's behind me and I can look forward.' In the summer of 2013, the 26-year-old headed north to sign a one-year contract at Rochdale and his career has been back on an upward trend ever since. He quickly established himself as a key member of the side and was given the captain's armband on a permanent basis following the departure of Peter Cavanagh last summer. Lancashire is hoping to emulate Liverpool's Rickie Lambert by working his way up the Football League . Settled with his girlfriend and four-and-a-half-month-old son Bobby - 'a little northerner' - Lancashire is at last looking back up the leagues. And it is the tale of another former Southampton and Rochdale player, Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert, that provides encouragement. Lancashire added: 'I'm not saying I could play for Real Madrid but obviously every player wants to play as high as possible. 'I'm in League One at the moment and everyone wants to play Premier League or Championship. I'm still quite young and hopefully with Rochdale and the gaffer here I can keep improving. 'You've only got to look at Lambert, who played at Rochdale. To see what he's done is inspirational. I think as footballers, and as people, you should never stop dreaming.'","Olly Lancashire is expected to face Stoke City on Monday night .

"Kenny McDowall cited 18 years in the Old Firm goldfish bowl as his reason for quitting Rangers. A former Celtic development coach, McDowall moved to Ibrox as first-team coach when Walter Smith returned as manager in 2007. Assistant to Ally McCoist for four years he was thrust into the spotlight as caretaker manager when McCoist was placed on gardening leave. Kenny McDowall cited 18 years in the Old Firm goldfish bowl as his reason for quitting Rangers . Uncomfortable in the role, McDowall compounded the storm clouds over Ibrox when he resigned on Wednesday after just three games in charge. The interim boss will remain in the technical area as he serves 12 months’ notice, but admitted he needs a break from the chaos of recent times. ‘To be quite frank, the last four years have been tough,’ said McDowall, explaining his shock decision for the first time. ‘That aside, I have been nearly 18 years at the Old Firm and it takes its toll. ‘I just told the club I’m happy to honour my contract for the next 12 months and then step aside. I’m not complaining because you can’t be involved in clubs like these and not have stress – it’s all part and parcel of the job. ‘It was a really tough decision. I made it last Wednesday and the club received a letter on the Thursday. ‘In terms of making the decision, after having discussions with my family I felt it was the right thing to do at this point in my career. ‘I have had fantastic times but I just feel I will do my 12 months then step aside, take a break and see where it takes me. I expect to be here for the next 12 months unless I’m told otherwise.’ Assistant to Ally McCoist for four years he was thrust into the spotlight when McCoist resigned . Wary of the impact his decision would have on his stuttering side’s promotion bid, McDowall asked for the news to be kept in-house. Disappointed it then leaked, he admitted: ‘I tendered my resignation on the Thursday after deciding the day before I was going to do it. ‘But it came out on TV, so the players saw it before I could get to them. I just had to tell them and ask that they keep working hard. Was I surprised when it came out? Yeah. I was working my notice so (it was supposed it to remain in-house) for 12 months.’ He had pondered his options for some time. ‘When Ally was put on gardening leave and I was appointed as caretaker manager I was happy to do so. Assistant managers do it all the time. ‘Once the dust settled a wee bit and I had time to think it through this is what I have come up with. It’s maybe time I had a break.’ Notice periods in football rarely work, as even Walter Smith and Gordon Strachan can testify, with many professional footballers subconsciously compelled to down tools the moment their gaffer calls it quits. Rangers caretaker boss McDowall speaks to Hearts manager Robbie Nielson earlier in January . Publicly, McDowall and his players — as they must — will make the right noises. Yet the truth is this. If an already stuttering promotion campaign suffered further water damage in Cowdenbeath on Saturday, no one would be remotely surprised. Neither can anyone offer cast-iron assurances that a team which has lost two managers in a month will be ‘at it’ against Celtic in the League Cup semi final at Hampden next weekend. Asked if those in his charge are up for the task right now, McDowall replied: ‘I absolutely hope so, but can I guarantee it? I have said to the boys they have my respect and I expect it back. ‘They have worked very well this week and we look forward to the league game at Cowdenbeath. ‘I can only ask them to keep at it. I pick the team and once they go out on the park, you need them to play, whether it’s Rangers, St Mirren or Liverpool. They are paid to play and you hope they would want to do it for themselves as much as anything.’ In mitigation, the Rangers players can plead a level of disruption which, even by Scottish football standards, is unparalleled. McDowall has urged them to draw on the levels of professionalism which took them to the club in the first place. However, asked if there was a legitimate worry they may ‘chuck it’ and begin to think of their own future first and foremost, McDowall nodded: ‘I wouldn’t disagree with you. When the news came out, I had to get the boys in the next morning and explain my situation. McDowall moved to Ibrox as first-team coach when Walter Smith returned as manager in 2007 . ‘A lot of them are out of contract in the summer, too, so all I could do was be as honest as I can over why I did it. I told them they have to play for themselves and look after their own futures.’ What comes now for McDowall is far from clear. Cast into a hot seat he looked uncomfortable with from the start, he may have expected the Rangers board to follow the path adopted for McCoist and place him on gardening leave. McDowall, you sense, could live with it if they did. ‘I was surprised to be appointed,’ he conceded. ‘I can’t say I expected it. I’m not going to say I had my boots all polished and I was ready to step in. ‘Of course, it was a big task but I was probably as experienced as anybody out there, given what I have learned over my career. ‘But absolutely, it’s a daunting task. You have to get on with it. It’s a great opportunity and a massive honour for me to be the caretaker manager for the team I supported as a boy. ‘Never in a million years would I have thought I’d be leading the team out on a Saturday and that’s why it was such a difficult decision to resign. McDowall said he expects to serve his 12 months notice, unless the board tell him otherwise . ‘Who wouldn’t want to manage a club of this size? I am not any different from anyone else, but unfortunately the circumstances are what they are. I’ve made my decision for myself and my family and that’s where I am at the moment.’ In the statement confirming his departure, the board suggested he would carry on for the next 12 months with ‘normal duties’. ‘I’m still trying to think what is normal at the moment,’ he grinned. ‘This job is totally different from when I came here eight years ago. ‘The staff has been diluted from when Walter brought me as his first-team coach and Ally was assistant. ‘I’m sure I’ll sit down with a glass of wine some night and say: “Wow”. I’ll think: “That was an incredible journey.” ‘But I’m still in it and I’m focused on winning the game at Cowdenbeath, and we need to try to peg Hearts back. If we can’t do that, then it’s the play-offs. But we need to try to get promotion and get the club back to where it should be.’ Meanwhile, McDowall declined to comment on the SFA charging goalkeeper Steve Simonsen over breaches of gambling rules after he was alleged to have bet on 55 matches, although none involving Rangers. ‘The club issued a statement and I can’t comment any further until after the hearing,’ he said.’","Kenny McDowall was made Rangers manager after Ally McCoist resigned .

"STEVIE THE EMBLEM . To get an idea how much of an emblem Steven Gerrard is to Liverpool, you only had to take a glance through the match programme and look at The Kop. Before kick-off, a banner was unveiled proclaiming him 'the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be' in homage to the LA Galaxy-bound talisman. More intriguing, though, were the 11 images of him in the programme. His commercial worth to Liverpool is huge, as he was the main face on every sponsored page. Who will possibly fill that void when he is gone? Liverpool fans unveiled a Steven Gerrard banner before the clash against Chelsea on Tuesday night . Gerrard is playing his final few months with Liverpool before leaving for LA Galaxy in the summer . JOSE IN GAME MODE . Watching Jose Mourinho is an experience in itself and from the moment he emerged out of the tunnel, you could tell he was in game mode. Ditching his usual smart attire, Mourinho wore a tracksuit, overcoat and snood and that casual ensemble sparked memories of the way he was dressed for the game that decided the title race on April 27.

During their traditional pre-match stroll, Chelsea's squad – who were staying in the near-by Malmaisson Hotel – started doing a warm-up to get them ready for the challenge.

No sign of Mario Balotelli at Anfield again and he let the world know his whereabouts by posting a picture of himself at home on Instagram. Balotelli, whose last start for Liverpool was against Chelsea on November 8, was, according to Brendan Rodgers, ill with a chest infection last week, which is why he missed he trip to Aston Villa. He was photographed out in Manchester over the weekend and then on Monday morning informed Rodgers he was still under the weather. It is now, surely, a question of 'when' rather than 'if' there is parting of the ways. Confused locals watched on as the Chelsea players warmed up in the street on Monday morning .

"Chelsea are weighing up a bid in the region of £27m for Colombian star Juan Cuadrado as they expect to lose either Andre Schurrle or Mohamed Salah. Fiorentina's Cuadrado has also been linked with Manchester United since his outstanding performances at the World Cup last summer. But who is the flying winger who has struck fear into the hearts of so many defenders over the last couple of years? Fiorentina and Colombia star Juan Cuadrado has been linked with Chelsea and Manchester United . Name: Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello . Age: 26 . Position: Winger . Teams: Fiorentina and Colombia . Where do I recognise his name from? Most likely from last summer's World Cup in Brazil and his integral part in that vibrant Colombia team that reached the quarter-finals. While James Rodriguez was the undoubted star, Cuadrado also made a name for himself with his performances of the right wing in Jose Pekerman's team, combining a bold, direct approach, lightning pace and lethal crossing. He registered four asissts during the tournament, putting him joint-top of the ranking with Germany's Toni Kroos, who played in two more matches. Cuadrado celebrates after converting a penalty in Colombia's 4-1 win over Japan at the World Cup . Two of those came as Greece were swept aside 3-0 in Colombia's opening group match and Cuadrado also scored a penalty in the third group game, a 4-1 win over Japan. And in the last-16 clash with Uruguay, after Rodriguez had scored his award-winning volley, Cuadrado soared into the air to cushion a very high cross down for the top scorer to grab a crucial second. To followers of Italian football, these performances came as little surprise following a stellar season at Fiorentina as Cuadrado helped them to fourth place and a spot in the Europa League, realising his potential in spectacular style. Whereabouts does he play? Cuadrado is a versatile player, capable of performing on either wing. He can also fit in as a wing back, right back or even centre forward if required. Indeed, he played as a centre forward earlier in his career and his idol growing up was Brazilian hero Ronaldo. These days, he is stationed on the right wing as this allows him to inflict most damage. The flying winger in action for Colombia against Uruguay in the last 16 of the World Cup . What are his strengths? Blistering pace is Cuadrado's main asset, as plenty of dizzy defenders have found out when it's already too late. Indeed, the 26-year-old was given the nickname 'Vespa' by his former Fiorentina team-mate Luca Toni because of the ways he nips between defenders like the ubiquitous scooters between cars on Italian city streets. The right wing is his highway and with his direct approach, close control and accurate crossing, Cuadrado would be a real asset for any team. His athleticism also enabled him to withstand a fair deal of punishment - defenders don't take kindly to the type of humiliation Cuadrado doles out and, as one of Serie A's most-fouled players, needs resiliance. One aspect of his game that has improved is his finishing, as shown by the 15 goals he scored for Fiorentina last season, a three-fold increase on the campaign before that. Speaking in 2013, Cuadrado revealed how he'd worked hard at improving this aspect of hs game. 'I spend hours and hours shooting at goal after training,' he said. 'Who knows how angry the goalkeepers Neto and (Cristiano) Lupatelli are at having to hang back with me before they're able to hit the showers.' Cuadrado holds off the challenge of Brazil's Marcelo in the World Cup quarter-final in Fortaleza . What's his background? Cuadrado was born in the coastal town of Necocli, which is one of the oldest settlements in Colombia, though he was raised further south in the city of Tumaco. His father, Guillermo, a truck driver, was shot dead when he was just five years old. Speaking on a Colombian interview show, his mother Marcela said he had to be the perfect student in order to play football. Playing as a forward, Cuadrado started out at Atletico Uraba but on the recommendation of the club's founder Nelson Gallego, he was moved to the wing. After a brief spell at second division side Rionegro, where he mostly languished on the bench, he was signed by Independiente Medellin, one of the country's biggest clubs, in 2008. Cuadrado scored on his debut against Boyaca Chico and the wheels were soon in motion. Cuadrado in action for Lecce during his loan spell at the Italian Serie A club from Udinese . Italian jobs . Cuadrado only actually spent one season at Independiente. He attracted interest from Italian clubs and duly joined Udinese on a five-year contract in July 2009. Opportunities were initially limited for the 21-year-old, who made just 12 appearances in his first season and the same number in his second, failing to score a goal in either. A change of scenery was probably a good idea and he was sent out to fellow Serie A side Lecce for the 2011-12 campaign. With more regular football, Cuadrado started to show his talents, scoring three goals and setting up two more in a season of 33 league appearances. It wasn't enough to keep Lecce in the top flight but his performances did catch the eye of Fiorentina. They paid £4.5m for a 50 per cent ownership stake in Cuadrado. The winger became a popular figure at Lecce for his dance celebrations with team-mate Luis Muriel . In his first season at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, he opened his account in a 4-1 win over Cagliari and finished the season with five goals and seven assists as the Viola finished fourth. But 2013-14 was his breakthrough season, with a string of impressive performances leading to 15 goals and 11 assists in all competitions. The most important came against his former club Udinese in the semi-final, second leg of the Coppa Italia, securing a 3-2 aggregate success and a place in the final against Napoli (which they lost 3-1). His profile boosted by the World Cup, Cuadrado has continued to excel and has five goals and three asssits this season so far. International honours . Cuadrado earned his first international call-up for Colombia a year after his transfer to Udinese, playing and scoring against Venezuela in September 2010. Since then, he has been a regular in the side, with 37 caps and five goals to his name.

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report from Anfield. For half an hour here on Tuesday night we saw the embodiment of the vision Brendan Rodgers talked about when he arrived at Anfield two-and-a-half seasons ago. Players swarming like red ants towards the Kop. A good team - perhaps the very best in the country - pinned back in their own half. Blitzkrieg football. That Liverpool didn't win - they didn't do tangibly more than remind Chelsea they remain a team of which they should be very wary - was due to the thickness of a post and the fact that visiting goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is 6ft 7ins tall. It was Steven Gerrard who struck the post and substitute Adam Lallana who brought a terrific full-length save from the Belgian with a rasping drive from the edge of the penalty area. Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring for Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea . Brendan Rodgers has promised all season his side would regain their tempo and they did on Tuesday . Sterling showcased his blistering pace as he cut Chelsea's defensive shape to pieces before sliding home . Almost the entire Liverpool  XI rushed to congratulate their 20-year-old attacker at Anfield . This was the kind of football that Rodgers has been waiting for this season. The dextrous, high-tempo full-court press that he drills into his players' brains on a daily basis at their Melwood training base. Through the difficult times of the first half of the season, Rodgers promised this style of play - this relentless rhythm - would return and on Tuesday night it was spectacularly evident during a second half that they dominated. Liverpool had to come from behind but the statistics show that they should really have won. They had 20 shots as opposed to Chelsea's two, for example, while the only time Liverpool's Simon Mignolet was really examined properly was when Eden Hazard beat him with a penalty in the first half. This was a night that was good for Liverpool and indeed good for English football. Chelsea need teams other than Manchester City that can genuinely challenge them. Thibaut Courtois was out quickly to thwart Sterling as Liverpool looked to get back in the game . But for Courtois, Liverpool would have won the game against Chelsea at Anfield on Tuesday evening . Had Rodgers' team being facing anyone other than Chelsea - dogged, cussed, resilient Chelsea - and Courtois then they surely would have won and it will be intriguing now to see if Liverpool can go to London next week and dismantle a Chelsea home record that is rather formidable. Jose Mourinho's team have played 15 games at Stamford Bridge this season. They have won 14 and drawn one. That's the nature of Liverpool's task. After the final whistle on Tuesday night, Mourinho was perhaps as magnanimous as he gets. 'Liverpool didn't deserve to lose,' he said. Eden Hazard comfortably stroked home a penalty in the 18th minute to give Chelsea the lead . Emre Can (right) had been caught out of position in the build-up to the penalty incident before tripping Hazard . Deep down he will know the truth, though, and it says something for his own team's spirit that they came away with anything at all from this game. For a spell they were in charge. There was little between the teams for the opening quarter of an hour and, when Hazard scored his penalty, it was easy to wonder if Chelsea would just ease away as they did when they won here 2-1 in the Barclays Premier League last November. Ultimately, though, Chelsea needed something more than their usual stylish purpose as the game turned around on the back of improved Liverpool football. Hazard coolly wheels away after sending Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet the wrong way from the  spot . They needed some resolution, some endeavour and some mental stubbornness. On nights like this, when the red tide has turned, you simply need a refusal to lose. It helps if you have a terrific goalkeeper as well and Courtois perhaps showed again  just why he rivals Manchester United's David de Gea as the best in England and perhaps Europe. The 22-year-old possesses a remarkable confidence and if this was an audition for the No 1 position ahead of Petr Cech for the rest of the season then it is perhaps one he passed. Steven Gerrard epitomised how Liverpool have improved from earlier in the season . Liverpool supporters hold a banner in support of their captain aloft during the semi-final first leg . There is an assurance about the Chelsea goalkeeper's work that makes him so difficult to criticise. He does the routine things effortlessly and the difficult things regularly. In the first half he was only really tested by one Gerrard shot from distance but when Liverpool moved through the gears in the second half they found him all but unpassable. The goal that did beat him was superb and scored by a wonderful talent. Rodgers will hope that his centre forward Daniel Sturridge returns to fitness soon so that Raheem Sterling can be used where he is most dangerous, running from deep to score like this. Sterling bought himself a yard off Gary Cahill and placed across Courtois to send Anfield wild . Mamadou Sakho rose highest against central defender Gary Cahill but wasn't able to force home his header . After that it seemed likely that Liverpool would break through again. Chelsea rode their luck at times and the save that Courtois produced from Lallana with a few minutes remaining really was deserving of earning an away draw all on its own. Ultimately, it was wonderful to see these teams locked in genuine battle once again. The game Chelsea won here to deny Liverpool the title last April was a one-off for its sheer peculiarity while the match back in November saw Liverpool running at half-tilt. Next week in west London Chelsea will start favourites. They will play better than this. Liverpool will travel in expectation, though. It won't be one to miss.

"Chelsea are launching a bid to sign Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina as they anticipate losing either Andre Schurrle or Mohamed Salah. Cuadrado, a Colombia international winger, has a release clause of £26.8million and Fiorentina do not wish to negotiate for less.

Jose Mourinho may decide to make a move for Juan Cuadrado (left) if Andre Schurrle leaves for Wolfsburg . Cuadrado celebrates after scoring for Fiorentina against Palermo earlier this month . Cuadrado (left) fights for the ball with Palermo's Andrea Belotti during the Serie A match . Fiorentina have cut short the loan of Chelsea’s Marko Marin, who joined Anderlecht on Tuesday, and have asked about Salah themselves though the Egyptian favours a move to Roma. Chelsea are also awaiting a £23million offer from Wolfsburg for Schurrle but are holding out for a £30m fee for the 24-year-old German. Conscious of fitting within FFP guidelines they will want to cover the purchase price of Cuadrado and make a profit. Andre Schurrle could be waving goodbye to Chelsea fans in January as Wolfsburg prepare £23m bid . Mohamed Salah has been linked with a move to Roma, but Fiorentina have also enquired . Mourinho was keen on the 26-year-old while Real Madrid and Manchester United were linked with him last summer before they realised they could sign Angel di Maria. Cuadrado can play on either flank and can also operate as a wing-back. Although he has not been in the best of form this season, he has experience, good pace and works for his team. He finished the World Cup alongside Toni Kroos with the most assists.","Andre Schurrle is wanted by Wolfsburg and is keen to leave Chelsea .

"Jamie Carragher has criticised Liverpool's Emre Can for his sloppy display in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup draw against Chelsea. The German midfielder has been used as a makeshift defender in recent weeks, but bundled Eden Hazard to the ground in the box before the break as the Belgian fired the visitors ahead from the spot. Raheem Sterling's second-half strike spared Can's blushes as the Reds came from behind to leave the semi-final on a knife-edge ahead of next week's second-leg at Stamford Bridge. Liverpool's Emre Can flattened Eden Hazard in the box to give Chelsea a first-half penalty . Can had a night to forget and was criticised by Reds stalwart Jamie Carragher . But former Liverpool defender Carragher stuck the boot in to the 21-year-old. 'He played really well in the last five or six games bringing the ball out,' Carragher told Sky Sports. 'But against top-class players he's been found wanting. He got beaten too easily and tried to rectify it and made two mistakes. 'He found it really difficult and looked like a midfielder playing at the back. People say he's been doing well recently in relation to bringing the ball out, but it was clumsy and a penalty, no doubt about it.' Cesc Fabregas tries to catch Can during Tuesday's game at Anfield . Carragher received a backlash on social media but took to Kicca to explain his comments. He wrote: 'When I've seen him (and I watch every game) defend he's struggled at times in the game against Leicester, Wimbledon & on the one occasion tonight it may seem harsh but Lfc had over 60% possession so didn't have much defending to do. 'My point is tonight was the first time he's come up against top class attackers as the teams previously Lfc would expect to dominate and win as they have done & he's impressed.' Can keeps tabs on Chelsea striker Diego Costa but did struggle at times on Tuesday . Great game tonight at Anfield proper cup tie, but my comments regarding Emre Can at ht & afterwards seemed to get most reaction on social media from Lfc fans! My thoughts on Can at CB in a back 3 is that he gives control to the team on the ball and helps the team build from the back. In a back 3 he will also have less defending to do but, when I've seen him (and I watch every game) defend he's struggled at times in the game against Leicester, Wimbledon & on the one occasion tonight it may seem harsh but Lfc had over 60% possession so didn't have much defending to do and he was good as you'd expect with the ball & with Hazard defensivley a couple of times second half. My point is tonight was the first time he's come up against top class attackers as the teams previously Lfc would expect to dominate and win as they have done & he's impressed. But if the opposition dominate he'll have to do more defending, and CB's in a back 3 think if you had to put them in a 2 in a back 4 would you want Can there probably not but why? Because his main strength is not the defending its bringing the ball out which he'd do less in a back 4!! hopefully that clears my thoughts up And yes I wasn't quick & also made mistakes!!","Emre Can's clumsy tackle on Eden Hazard gave Chelsea first-half penalty .

"West Ham have had a £2million bid rejected for Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie. The highly-rated 20-year-old is out of contract in the summer and has been attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs. Hendrie has made more than 100 appearances for the Scottish Premiership side and said earlier this month that he was ready to move to a big club. Stephen Hendrie (right) has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs as well as Celtic .

Norwich, who recently appointed former Hamilton manager Alex Neil, are also interested in the 20-year-old full back. Hendrie has already made more than 100 appearances for the Hamilton first team . Meanwhile, the Hammers have approached Arsenal about making Carl Jenkinson's move a permanent one and have been quoted a whopping £12m for the right back. The England Under 21 international is on a season-long loan at Upton Park and has impressed manager Sam Allardyce with his performances and attitude but a permanent deal will be difficult to seal at that price.

"West Bromwich Albion will not sell Saido Berahino this window because his goals are too valuable in the club’s battle to stay up, chairman Jeremy Peace has insisted. It had been thought a £20million offer from Liverpool or Tottenham might see Albion accept, after head coach Tony Pulis and technical director Terry Burton admitted every player has his price. But Peace has moved to reaffirm that the England Under 21 striker, who has six goals in his last four games and 14 for the season, will remain at the Hawthorns for the run-in. Saido Berahino is set to stay at West Brom, despite interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool . 'I said in the autumn that the club had no interest in selling Saido and that remains the case,’ said Peace in a statement on the club’s website. 'Unless Tony decides otherwise, the view will surely be that he is far too important to us to consider trading. His goals are capable of keeping us in the Premier League and would be hugely difficult to replace.' Berahino has been in the spotlight over his conviction for drink-driving, while Albion suspended negotiations on a new contract over concerns about his attitude. The 21-year-old was fined for turning up late to matches. Peace said Berahino has reacted well to the arrival of Pulis, however. 'The club takes seriously the charges to which Saido pleaded guilty and as a result he will be subject to the club’s disciplinary procedures,’ added Peace. 'This unfortunate episode has been unsettling for the club generally and Saido specifically. Berahino (right) played 70 minutes of West Brom's 0-0 draw at Everton on Monday night .

"Asked on Monday to reflect on his record against Chelsea as Liverpool manager - played five, won none - Brendan Rodgers smiled ruefully and recalled the last time the teams met, at Anfield at the start of November. ‘Let’s face it, it was not just the Chelsea game early in the season... there were plenty of other games we didn’t do well in. But at this moment, there is a different feeling, a different aggression, a different mood in the squad so hopefully we can go into these two games and be positive.’ There, in a nutshell, is the essence of Tuesday night’s first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final. The extent to which this is a new Liverpool, a reborn Liverpool, will shape the nature of a tie that begins on Merseyside on Tuesday and ends next week in west London. Brendan Rodgers has failed to win any of his five games against Chelsea as Liverpool manager . Chelsea's (from left) Oscar, Gary Cahill, John Terry, Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic celebrates the Blues' 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield back in November . Rickie Lambert celebrates scoring Liverpool's second against Aston Villa in a 2-0 win on Saturday . Rodgers believes there is a 'different mood' around Liverpool to when they last faced Chelsea . We know what we will get from Chelsea. Jose Mourinho’s side are strong, dextrous, physically intimidating and have one of Europe’s most prolific goalscorers in Diego Costa. Liverpool, on the other hand, are tentatively emerging from a slump that began when Chelsea ended their Barclays Premier League title hopes last April. But are Liverpool improving enough to slug it out with Chelsea over two legs? Or do victories against teams such as Swansea City, Sunderland and Aston Villa count for little when faced with an enduring European heavyweight? Certainly, opportunity knocks for Liverpool. Not only are they in far better form than they were when Chelsea came from behind to beat them 2-1 in November, their opponents will go into next week’s second leg with one eye on a league fixture with champions Manchester City the following Saturday. ‘They are very strong, so yes, it’s the biggest test in English football right now,’ said Rodgers. ‘You see their quality. They are a very good side. But we will look at it as an opportunity to win at home. ‘Now our confidence is high, and we are looking forward to it, because we go into it on the back of a decent run. ‘Against Chelsea, we haven’t played as well as we would have liked in my time here. It would be good to change that.’ In fairness to Rodgers, some of his team’s performances against Chelsea - such as an unjust and narrow defeat at Stamford Bridge last Christmas - have been better than the results.

Rodgers (left) and Mourinho gesture from the touchline during the huge Premier League clash last April . There has been evidence, too, in recent weeks that the players who can make a difference - such as Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and now Lazar Markovic - are beginning to find something approaching their optimum form in Rodgers’ new formation. Certainly Chelsea captain John Terry knows from experience that trips to Anfield can go very wrong very quickly if you aren’t prepared. ‘It’s going to be a tough place to go,’ said the veteran defender. ‘They proved, when we went up there in the league, that it’s a tough game. ‘You have to forget form and where they are. It’s Chelsea-Liverpool. It’s going to be tough over the two legs and I just hope we are strong enough.

Reds captain Gerrard (right) appeals to referee Anthony Taylor for a penalty against Chelsea in November . ‘We have shown in the first half of the season that we are capable of pushing the top sides and that is what we aim to do.’ Rodgers spoke glowingly of some of Chelsea’s players on Monday, especially Costa. ‘I love his game,’ he said. The Liverpool manager also knows the value of winning your first trophy in charge of a new club, having been on the Chelsea staff when Jose Mourinho steered his team past Liverpool in the 2005 Carling Cup final in Cardiff. ‘I joined Chelsea 2004,’ he reflected. ‘At that point they were a club who wanted to win titles and trophies. They showed once you win that first one, you want to go on and sustain it. Diego Costa scores against Swansea City on Saturday during Chelsea's 5-0 rout of the Welsh side . John Terry slides in to challenge Swansea's Tom Carroll during Chelsea's 5-0 win on Saturday . ‘The first one is really important and the players who were there then will tell you that. They will tell you that getting across the line on the first one is important. I think it is that taste of success that hopefully pushes players on. ‘We have worked really hard in the majority of the two-and-a-half years of my time here but we are here to win.

"Steven Gerrard will miss Liverpool's Premier League game at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon as Brendan Rodgers looks ahead to Tuesday night's Capital One Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea. Gerrard, who has agreed to sign for American MLS side Los Angeles Galaxy after admitting he couldn't cope with the prospect of not playing regularly at Liverpool, spent Saturday morning at the club's Melwood training ground being put through his paces with team-mate Glen Johnson, effectively ruling him out of the 3pm kick off at Villa Park.

Gerrard was taken off with a tight hamstring during Liverpool's 1-0 win over Sunderland last weekend . Gerrard, 34, was substituted with a tight hamstring at half-time of last weekend's 1-0 win at Sunderland and clearly Liverpool are reluctant to take a risk with him with Jose Mourinho's men lying in wait. The near-freezing conditions on Merseyside meant that Gerrard, a one-club man from Huyton, was not embarrassed to wear gloves as he trained with Johnson. Defender Johnson is out of contract at Anfield in the summer and expected to move on. His last first-team appearance came at Manchester United on December 14 when he suffered a groin injury but his participation alongside Gerrard may mean he has a chance of playing some part against Chelsea.","Steven Gerrard will sit out Liverpool's Premier League game at Aston Villa .

"Jose Mourinho has ordered Chelsea’s supporters to stop taunting Steven Gerrard with chants about the slip that wrecked Liverpool’s title run last season. Chelsea fans still revel in the remarkable moment last April when Gerrard tumbled and allowed Mourinho’s former striker Demba Ba to blow open the title race. Mourinho has previously gone as far as saying the fall and the 2-0 Anfield defeat directly handed the title to Manchester City — and Chelsea’s fans have been ruthless since, chanting: ‘Steve Gerrard, Gerrard, he fell on his f****** a***, he gave it to Demba Ba.’ Demba Ba (left) slots past Simon Mignolet after Gerrard's slip at Anfield at the end of last season . A closer angle shows the mistake, which Jose Mourinho said gifted Manchester City the Premier League title . That is sure to be heard again at Anfield on Tuesday when Chelsea face Liverpool in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final. Out of their last 16 Premier League games, Chelsea play only four outside London — Aston Villa, Leicester, Hull and West Brom. Manchester City must go to Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham . But Mourinho, who this season complained Stamford Bridge was too quiet, insisted supporters need to cut USA-bound Gerrard some slack. He said: ‘He’s a historic player for Liverpool, a historic player for the Premier League. He’s an opponent I always admired and respected. There is a song that my fans have that I don’t like at all. ‘A couple of times it’s good fun but to go and go and go, especially when a player like him deserves respect, we don’t need that.’ Mourinho’s admiration for Gerrard is nothing new. Even though the Portuguese is leading what may well be the most dynamic Chelsea side in the Premier League era, he still has regrets over his failure to land the midfielder in 2005. Those resurfaced after he watched his side produce a magnificent performance of speed and imagination to demolish Swansea. Liverpool captain Gerrard looks dejected as he walks back towards the centre circle after his mistake . Chelsea manager Mourinho believes that Chelsea fans should stop singing about Gerrard's slip . He said: ‘I was dreaming of Claude Makelele, Gerrard and Frank Lampard. We were playing in an open triangle without a No 10, we were playing with Maka in front of the defenders and me and Mr Abramovich and Peter Kenyon were dreaming that. We did everything. It was almost there. But the decision for me was proven right because he will be always a red forever. Gerrard’s people were open to it and the feeling to join a top side like Chelsea, I think the feeling was there but to me personally he never said “I will go”.’ In words that might be interpreted as a dig at Lampard, who has done so much this season to help Manchester City keep Chelsea in sight, Mourinho added: ‘I love these quotes when he (Gerrard) was saying that in this life he would never score against Liverpool. I understand why he was almost coming to Chelsea and he didn’t.’ There cannot be much Mourinho feels he is lacking at the moment even if he said a quadruple was ‘not possible’. Chelsea led within 49 seconds against Swansea and had four by the break. On Saturday, Diego Costa (left) and Oscar (centre) masterminded Chelsea's 5-0 drubbing at Swansea . Mourinho's side now look ahead to a trip to Anfield on Tuesday night in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Diego Costa scored his 16th and 17th goals of a wonderful season, though the blitz came from deeper positions, with Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic, Eden Hazard, Willian and two-goal Oscar surely the match of any midfield in Europe. The speed of the blitz was neatly encapsulated by Swansea’s goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, who said: ‘Compared with City, Chelsea look stronger — the midfield, their attacking force, is on a different level. They are so sharp, so quick and they try to surprise you. ‘After the last goal (scored by Andre Schurrle), I turned round to see what had happened and there were already three of their players celebrating in my six-yard box. I couldn’t believe how quickly they were there.’ The debate over where this Chelsea side ranks against earlier versions is perfectly natural, though Mourinho insists trophies are the only true gauge. Much will be learned this month with their two semi-final matches against Liverpool, as well as an FA Cup fourth-round tie with Bradford and the huge league fixture against Manchester City.","Steven Gerrard slipped to gift Chelsea an important goal last season .

"An auction into Marussia's remaining assets has been cancelled with the team understood to be involved in advanced talks with a potential buyer. Birmingham-based GA European Valuations (GAEV) conducted one auction in mid-December when minor items such as steering wheels, manufacturing and office equipment and drivers' race suits were sold. That followed the team falling into administration in October with debts of around £60million, resulting in them missing the final three grands prix of last season. Marussia driver Max Chilton looks on from a Silverstone test last season, with the team now subject to last-minute takeover talks which could see them line up on the 2015 F1 grid . However, work has been ongoing behind the scenes in a bid to get the team on the grid for this season, albeit with a deadline of Wednesday fast approaching. That is when GAEV was scheduled to sell off last season's race cars, along with all components, spares and race-day equipment, along with the team's cars that took part in the GP3 series. That would have signalled the end of the team - provisionally listed under their old name of Manor on the FIA's entry list for 2015 - as a going concern. Marussia missed the last three races of the season after going into administration, with Chilton driving down the pitlane in Sochi during their last appearance at the Russian Grand Prix in October . The Russian Grand Prix featured just Chilton driving for Marussia, with his team-mate Jules Bianchi left in hospital having suffered a serious accident at the previous race in Japan . GAEV has now confirmed that auction is to no longer take place, with no new date rescheduled, and with a spokesperson refusing to confirm a reason as to why the auction has been cancelled. It is understood sporting director Graeme Lowdon and team principal John Booth are conducting last-ditch negotiations to save Manor. One of the few positives is that 40million US dollars (£26million) in prize money awaits should the team compete again after its 10th-place finish in the 2014 constructors' championship.","Marussia missed last three races of 2014 Formula One season .

"CLICK HERE to read Dominic King's match report. Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher slammed Kevin Mirallas after the Everton midfielder refused to let Leighton Baines take a penalty against West Brom, only for the Belgian to then miss. Baines, Everton's regular penalty-taker, tried to convince Mirallas to surrender the ball after Roberto Marinez's side were awarded a spot kick minutes before half time during the 0-0 draw at Goodison Park on Monday night. But Mirallas ignored Baines and team-mates Romelu Lukaku and Steven Naismith, who both tried to reason with the Belgian, before firing his effort from 12 yards wide via the base of the left-hand post. Kevin Mirallas looks distraught after missing a spot kick against West Bromwich Albion on Monday . The Belgian stepped up to take the spot kick despite Leighton Baines also being on the field . Mirallas (right) talks to regulation-taker Baines and holds the ball in his hands, determined to take the penalty . Gary Neville described Mirallas' decision to take the penalty as a 'despicable breach of team orders' It proved to be Mirallas' last impact on the game as he was hooked at half-time, replaced by Bryan Oviedo, and pundit Neville was heavily critical of the winger. 'It was a despicable breach of team orders,' Neville said on Sky Sports during halftime. 'Letting your team-mates down. It was a selfish act on the pitch by taking things off a specialist. 'At 0-0 in such a crucial match, it's unacceptable. Free-kick and penalty-takers are usually listed and discussed in a team meeting.' Sportsmail columnist Carragher described Mirrallas' decision to take the penalty ahead of Baines as shocking and questioned why the club's senior players didn't intervene. Baines then slapped Mirallas across the face to offer some encouragement ahead of the spot kick . Everton boss Roberto Martinez did not look overly impressed from the sidelines by Mirallas' penalty . Jamie Carragher said Everton's senior players should have intervened and told Mirallas to let Baines take it . ‘Where are your senior players and why aren't they getting involved?' Carragher said. 'Gareth Barry walking back, Roberto Martinez talking to John Stones. In the back four you naturally would think Leighton Baines would be taking it. 'It doesn't matter how well you're playing, you don't take the penalty off the penalty-taker. It was a shocking decision. There's no bigger chance than a penalty. 'It's like kids football. Whoever got the ball first took the penalty. Kids fighting over the ball.' Baines' penalty record in the Premier League is brilliant - he has netted 15 of his 16 spot kicks - yet Mirallas was determined to take the set piece. Baines also slapped Mirallas on the side of the head in encouragement before the Belgian took the penalty . Baines wipes his face during the match between Everton and West Brom at Goodison Park on Monday . And that is despite the Belgian not having scored from the spot since March 2012. Gary Neville, while on commentary for Sky Sports, was fairly scathing in his analysis of the incident. He said: 'If he's gone against team orders it's despicable, but we have to wait until then.' Interestingly, Craig Bellamy took a penalty against team orders while playing for Liverpool against Birmingham City and was fined by then-manager Rafael Benitez as a result. Bellamy missed the penalty during Liverpool's last-16 League Cup victory over Birmingham in November 2006.

"McLaren have been given a boost after Formula One's governing body tweaked the rules to allow Honda, the team's new partner, to develop their engine this season in line with rival manufacturers. The Japanese company, who have replaced Mercedes at McLaren, are returning to Formula One as the sport's fourth engine supplier. Mercedes, Renault and Ferrari are allowed to introduce limited upgrades during the season but Honda, as a new entrant, had been told to present their engine for approval on February 28 with no further development permitted. McLaren have reunited with Honda for the 2015 Formula One season . Honda met International Automobile Federation officials last Monday to present their view that the situation was unfair. A document issued to teams on Friday by Formula One race director Charlie Whiting did not name Honda but clarified the situation with an amendment in their favour. 'As each of the four 2015 manufacturers will have an homologated power unit at the start of the season, we believe it would be fair to ensure that each of them enjoys equal opportunities for upgrades during the season,' it said. 'We will therefore allow the new manufacturer to use the same number of tokens that the other three manufacturers have available to them, taken as an average of the three. Stoffel Vandoorne drives the new car in testing in Abu Dhabi at the end of last season . 'For example, if the three 2014 manufacturers have eight, seven and five unused tokens respectively at the start of the season, then the new manufacturer will be allowed to use six during the season,' The current manufacturers are allowed to improve their engine using a complicated system of 'tokens' within set limits. Tne tokens are assigned to parts of the engine and divided into three categories, meaning that some parts require more than others and manufacturers must choose which areas to improve. There are 66 tokens and the existing manufacturers can use 32 during the course of 2015, with the number reduced over time so that by 2018 there will be only 15 tokens available. Honda, who partnered McLaren from 1988 to 1992 when they won four constructors' titles, quit F1 as a constructor at the end of 2008. McLaren have not won a race since 2012 and finished fifth last year. Double world champion Fernando Alonso has now joined from Ferrari to partner Briton's Jenson Button.

"A new management team has finally been appointed at Silverstone, ending months of uncertainty behind the scenes. In October, Richard Phillips, Ed Brookes and David Thompson were suspended on full pay from their positions as managing director, financial director and legal director respectively pending an undisclosed internal investigation. Silverstone has plans to enlarge the business after appointing a new management team . It resulted in British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) chairman John Grant and director Lawrence Tomlinson taking up the role of joint-acting chief executive of Silverstone Circuits Limited (SCL). The BRDC made clear at the time the suspensions were coincidental to the plans of Grant and Lawrence into the restructuring of the Silverstone business. The BRDC has now appointed Patrick Allen as managing director given his experience in sales and marketing, supported by Stuart Pringle, who has taken on the new position of sporting director. Securing future of the British F1 Grand Prix was pivotal to plans for famous track . Pringle will oversee the event management and circuit operations side of the business. Commenting on his vision for the circuit, Allen said 'Silverstone has great potential to become the ultimate entertainment venue, and with the support of the team I believe we can make it the place to go.

"Brighton captain Gordon Greer admits his team may have to resort to the ‘dark side’ to stop Arsenal in Sunday’s televised FA Cup tie if they want to upset the FA Cup holders and have a chance of progressing to the fifth round. Even though the Championship side have a reputation for playing expansive, passing football in the same style of Arsenal, the Scotland centre half concedes that they may have to sacrifice their principles on Sunday and be more physical and direct to stop Arsenal. ‘All football teams need that,’ said Greer, who was labelled ‘brutal’ by Poland striker Robert Lewandowski after a recent clash against Scotland. ‘You can’t just play football all the time. You need the dark stuff and we’ve got that and I’m sure Arsenal have as well.’ Brighton skipper Gordon Greer has told his players to be physical during their match against Arsenal . Robert Lewandowski said Greer was 'brutal' after Poland's match against Scotland in October 2014 . But Greer insists that he wants Arsenal to play their best team, including Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla, even though it will make their task that much harder. ‘If you asked anyone in our dressing room, they would rather see the strongest team out there. It’s great to see how you can compete against them. It’s not something you get the opportunity to do that often. ‘I watched Arsenal last week against Manchester City and they were unbelievable. But you don’t play football to play against people who are easy – you want to play against the very best players.’ And Brighton manager Chris Hughton knows how Arsenal can pass their way through sides all too well. Hughton was manager at Norwich last season when Jack Wilshere scored the goal of the season against his side – after a stunning ten-pass move. Seagulls manager Chris Hughton expects a difficult challenge against Arsenal at the weekend . Asked whether he could admire the artistry involved, Hughton said: ‘It’s certainly not what you think at the time! 'When you see it again you try to evaluate and see could we have stopped it at source. There was probably one time in the move itself where we could have done better. 'But the last parts we couldn’t have done and eventually you have to hold your hands up. There are times when it’s very, very difficult to cope with Arsenal. ‘We all know the magnitude of the job, irrespective of the team they play on Sunday. In the past, if they made changes they had good young players to come in and the age of the team would have gone down dramatically. What they have now is experience and if they make changes they will have players that have played a lot of games for them.’","Seagulls defender Gordon Greer believes his side will need to be physical .

If he fails to make it then it could be a memorable return to the Santiago Bernabeu for Fernando Torres. 'He is here to give us experience and goals when the team most needs it,' said Simeone in the build-up to the game. His players were snubbed in the FifaPro team of the year announced at Zurich on Monday without a single player making the XI and that will only fire them up more in-front of a global audience. 'I am not imagining a calm game; I'm imagining an intense one,' said Simeone who added: 'We have a positive result from the first leg but we are up against the world and European club champions.'

Garcia strokes home his penalty after being brought down by Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos in the box . Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo stare on in disbelief as Real Madrid slump to defeat against Atletico . Real Madrid are expected to start the game with Gareth Bale, joining Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema in the so-called BBC front three. Bale was criticised for not passing to Benzema in the opening defeat of 2015 against Valencia. And he was then in trouble for not passing to Ronaldo at the weekend against Espanyol. 'I don't think it was so easy for him to make the pass,' said Ancelotti, as he defended the player who scored the goal that won Real Madrid the Spanish Cup last season. He also confirmed that Bale's relationship with Ronaldo was 'excellent'. Madrid's frightening front three have proved too much for defences all over Europe and beyond across the last 18 months but Atletico Madrid have frequently frustrated them. Simeone issues instructions to his team from the sidelines at the Vicente Calderon stadium . Simeone has won 16 of 19 knockout matches he has taken charge of and since Atletico Madrid beat Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final in 2013 – ending 14 years without a victory over their neighbours – they have beaten them four times, drawn twice and lost on only three occasions. Ronaldo will be wearing his new micro-diamond encrusted boots to celebrate his third Golden Ball win. That is unlikely to do much to lessen the desire Atletico have to turn over their wealthier city neighbours one more time.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his side's week-long trip to Abu Dhabi did not influence their shock FA Cup loss to Championship side Middlesbrough. The Barclays Premier League champions spent the five days prior to Saturday's fourth-round tie at the Etihad Stadium at a warm-weather training camp in the United Arab Emirates. The team only returned to Manchester on Friday evening and questions were quickly asked about the wisdom of the venture after goals from Patrick Bamford and Kike dumped them out of the cup. Manuel Pellegrini watched on as his Manchester City side were beaten 2-0 by Middlesbrough on Saturday . But the City boss refused to blame their week-long trip to Abu Dhabi for the FA Cup defeat . Manager Pellegrini and his players arrived back in Manchester at about 8pm on Friday night . David Silva and Vincent Kompany headed straight to the club's training base to prepare for Saturday's game . But Pellegrini, who did have the option to return on Thursday after playing a friendly against Hamburg the previous day, denied the travel was a factor. 'I don't think so,' said Pellegrini at his post-match press conference, when asked about the matter. 'I don't agree but you can have your opinion. I have a different opinion. 'We had six or seven clear chances to score at the beginning. I think we played very well. 'After they scored the goal we were disorderly and they had another counter-attack and they could score more goals. 'But it is very easy to say that (about Abu Dhabi). I don't think that is the reason. 'You can analyse the game and if you think that is the reason, that is your reason but I have a different opinion from that.' Patrick Bamford raced through to put Middlesbrough ahead early in the second half . Bamford (second right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring  at Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup fourth round . City players James Milner (left), Dedryck Boyata (centre) and Fernando look dejected after their side concede . Middlesbrough substitute Kike celebrates after scoring in stoppage time to seal his side's FA Cup passage . City dominated the first half but were repeatedly denied by Middlesbrough's former Real Madrid goalkeeper Tomas Mejias. Bamford's strike after 53 minutes changed the complexion of the game and substitute Kike put the result beyond doubt in injury time. Pellegrini said: 'We had two games in the same match. Before they scored we did played very well. After that I think Middlesbrough deserved to continue in the cup. 'But I feel it is not normal not to score in the last two games at home. 'I think there are a lot of football reasons rather than Abu Dhabi. They are different things.'","Manchester City beaten 2-0 at home to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup .

"'I know that with 4-4-2 the stats are giving the positive results, but when you analyse the game I have twitched my ass on the bench because we were out of balance.' The expert analysis of Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal captured the imagination this week when he admitted playing his 4-4-2 formation resulted in a very unhappy derrière. But does that deserve a place in the Hall of Fame for bizarre managers' quotes? Let's compare. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal complained about 4-4-2 leaving him 'twitching my ass' Jose Mourinho . Seeing as we all knew he'd make an appearance, we may as well get the Special One out of the way immediately. But how do you choose from one of his many press conference quips? Well, firing a parting shot at owner Roman Abramovich for not investing in the squad before being forced out of the club in 2007, Mourinho said: 'No eggs, no omelette. And it depends on the quality of the eggs. 'In the supermarket, you have eggs class one, class two, class three. Some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. So when the class one eggs are in Waitrose and you cannot go there, you have a problem.' Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is never far from a memorable quip during press conferences . Rafa Benitez . Perhaps best remembered for his infamous 'FACT!' rant against then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, but Benitez was another who had a thing for breakfast ingredients. The former Liverpool manager answered Roy Hodgson's remarks on Kenny Dalglish's involvement in the club by saying: 'White liquid in a bottle has to be milk,' - apparently, a Spanish phrase which means things are so obvious for everyone to see (except perhaps the meaning of the saying itself). Benitez then followed this up when accused of having a poor transfer record and inheriting a poor squad by exclaiming: 'Some people can not see a priest on a mountain of sugar,' - which again means something akin to stating the obvious... without actually doing so. Rafa Benitez (right) made some memorable speeches during his time as Liverpool manager . Sir Alex Ferguson . And so to Fergie. He wasn't against using food to make a point, either. Before a Champions League game against a notoriously tricky Inter Milan side, the ex-Manchester United manager indulged in an opening course of mind games: 'When an Italian tells me it's pasta on the plate, I check under the sauce to make sure. They are the inventors of the smokescreen.' Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was not immune to making an infamous quote . Bill Shankly . Shankly was Liverpool's greatest ever manager, and will also be remembered by Anfield fans for his cutting put downs of hated rivals Everton, which included this collection of pearls: . Former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly liked to add to the rivalry between the Reds and neighbours Everton . Brian Clough . Clough was never short of sharing a few words. The former Nottingham Forest manager wasn't even scared to engage Fergie in a war of words. Clough, before the then-United manager had claimed a second European Cup, said: 'For all his horses, knighthoods and championships, he hasn't got two of what I've got. And I don't mean balls!' And the testicular references didn't end there as, when discussing the influx of foreign players into the English game, he said: 'I can't even spell spaghetti never mind talk Italian. How could I tell an Italian to get the ball? He might grab mine.' Brian Clough was never short of sharing a few words as the ex-Nottingham Forest manager proved . Ian Holloway . Never short of a decent quote. Holloway, in between being 'more chuffed than a badger at the start of mating season', had this to say about an 'ugly' result against Chesterfield. Please note, it should be read with that typical deadpan Bristolian accent for full effect. 'To put it in gentleman's terms if you've been out for a night and you're looking for a young lady and you pull one, some weeks they're good looking and some weeks they're not the best,' he said. 'Our performance today would have been not the best looking bird but at least we got her in the taxi. She weren't the best looking lady we ended up taking home but she was very pleasant and very nice, so thanks very much, let's have a coffee.' Ian Holloway has become renowned for memorable quotes during his managerial career in England . Sir Bobby Robson . The late, great Sir Bobby was rarely short of a quirky comment. So, try these on for size: . Newcastle United legend Sir Bobby Robson had a few quotes up his sleeve at St James' Park . Gordon Strachan . Strachan was another manager who must have missed the media training classes, much to the delight and amusement of anyone listening... Here are just a few examples that left reporters wishing they had chosen a different profession. Reporter: 'Bang, there goes your unbeaten run. Can you take it?' Strachan: 'No, I'm just going to crumble like a wreck. I'll go home, become an alcoholic and maybe jump off a bridge. Umm, I think I can take it, yeah.' Reporter: 'So, Gordon, in what areas do you think Middlesbrough were better than you today?' Strachan: 'What areas? Mainly that big green one out there...' And, probably the finest one word answer in the history of football interviews. Reporter: 'Gordon, can we have a quick word please?' Strachan: 'Velocity.' [walks off] . Gordon Strachan is among the best for leaving journalists stunned during interviews after and before matches . Arsene Wenger . Wenger usually gives well rehearsed and educated answers to questions from the press, even if it sometimes appears as he is struggling to keep a straight face. But the Frenchman has occasionally drawn into using strange metaphors, especially when baited by enduring rivals. In response to Ferguson's jibe that Arsenal weren't deserving double winners in 2002 and United were the better team, Wenger simply answered: 'Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home.' And, he also reverted to the female form when describing his inability to convince a homesick Antonio Reyes to stay at Highbury. 'It's like you wanting to marry Miss World and she doesn't want you, what can I do about it? I can try to help you, but if she does not want to marry you what can I do?,' he said. The answer being to let Reyes leave and sneak Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona's youth academy. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger usually gives well-rehearsed interviews but has been known for his own quips . ...King Eric quit football to preach about Islamophobia and star in soft porn films . CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY . And finally... It not just  football managers that are renowned for memorable quips during press conferences. Sometimes, it comes down to the players. Step forward, King Eric himself. Greeting the journalists before him in the wake of a lengthy ban for his kung-fu kick on a Crystal Palace supporter in 1995, Cantona read out the following statement before abruptly leaving. 'When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea. Thank you very much.' Quite what you make of the Cantona's musings should be determined by you but as Strachan - yes, him again - later said: 'If a Frenchman goes on about seagulls, trawlers and sardines, he's called a philosopher. I'd just be called a short Scottish bum talking crap'. Eric Cantona launches a a kung-fu kick at Crystal Palace supporter Matthew Simmons in 1995 .

"Ibrahima Conte was denied a last minute penalty as Guinea and Cameroon played out the fourth consecutive 1-1 draw in Group D of the Africa Cup of Nations in Malabo. In a dramatic finish to the match the Guinea striker burst clear into the left side of the box where he fell under a challenge by Jerome Guihoata, but referee Tessema Bamlak took no action. Moments earlier, Stephane M'Bia should have won it for Cameroon when he was served up a free header from Benjamin Moukandjo's free-kick but flashed it inches wide from eight yards. Cameroon's defender Benjamin Moukandjo kicks the ball to score a goal during the Group D clash with Guinea . It proved another frustrating night for Cameroon who had needed a late equaliser to salvage a draw against Mali in their opening match and were hoping for better second time round. Moukandjo forced an early save out of nervy Guinea keeper Naby Yattara then the same player opened the scoring in the 13th minute when his corner from the left struck Yattara and deflected into the net. Mohamed Yattara almost drew Guinea level within five minutes when he intercepted a sloppy clearance by Cameroon goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa who recovered just enough to flap the ball out of play. Guinea's midfielder Ibrahima Traore celebrates after scoring the equaliser in the Africa Cup of Nations clash . Borussia Monchengladbach striker Ibrahima Traore drew a good low save out of Ondoa before the Guineans drew level in the 42nd minute. Traore picked up a neat pass from Issiaga Sylla and turned his marker M'Bia before lashing a low left-foot shot past Ondoa's out-stretched arm. Cameroon had the better of the second half chances with only a superb challenge from Abdoulaye Cisse preventing an almost certain goal from Edgard Salli at point-blank range. Cameroon's midfielder Stephane Mbia challenges Guinea's forward Mohamed Yattara for possession . Vincent Aboubakar headed inches wide and a Salli effort was deflected out for a corner but Guinea still looked dangerous on the break and Naby Keita should have done better with a rising shot which flew over Ondoa's bar. Yattara saved bravely at the feet of Salli with 10 minutes remaining before M'Bia ought to have won it after Cisse fouled Eric Choupo-Moting on the left. And there was still time for Conte to claim a stoppage-time spot-kick which was waved away as both sides were forced to settle for another draw.

"Garry Monk has told Bafetimbi Gomis to forget any idea he has of leaving Swansea this month. Gomis’s apparent agitations to leave the club threatened to plunge Swansea into a major striker crisis so soon after Wilfried Bony’s departure for Manchester City. But in talks this week Monk has told the Frenchman he cannot leave until the summer at the earliest, suggesting also that a move to Crystal Palace – known admirers of the 29-year-old – would represent a ‘sideways or downwards’ step in his career. Bafetimbi Gomis controls a ball during a Swansea training session on Wednesday . After the sale on Wilfried Bony, Swansea are expected to hold on to want-away striker Gomis (right) Monk attempted to play down the issue on Thursday, but that should not disguise the strength of anger felt among senior members of the club’s hierarchy, who Sportsmail understands were furious with the comments Gomis made in a French television interview last weekend. There is also expected to be a backlash from the club’s supporters, when Swansea face Blackburn in the FA Cup on Sunday, despite Monk’s suggestion that naivety was the root of the issue. Monk said: ‘I had a chat with him and what I said to him I will keep between me and him. He is a good player and I can’t afford to lose any more good players. ‘Every player in the world has a possibility of moving but it doesn’t mean that possibility has to come to a reality. It is up to the club what happens and Bafe is far too important to us. The Frenchman (right) has previously claims that Swansea broke their promise of an agreed amount of playing time for him . Ivory Coast striker Bony joined Manchester City for £28million last week . ‘He has got a great chance now to make a name for himself in the Premier League and finish the season strongly. Then, if he had ambitions at that point, we could discuss them.’ Monk added: ‘What I did talk to Bafe about was how these things are perceived inside and outside the club. 'He probably wasn’t fully aware of what those comments cause and I made him aware of that when I spoke to him. ‘He’s not stupid, but I don’t think he honestly thought it would be perceived the way it was. It’s not the type of culture you want here in Britain, but it happens a lot on the continent.’ Bony was the top scorer in the Premier League during 2014 - netting 20 goals for the Swans . Palace are keen on a £9m move for the striker, while Arsenal, Newcastle, Schalke and Borussia Dortmund are reportedly interested. Monk said: ‘If he did have ambitions to play for other clubs it should be big clubs. 'We have proved that with Bony and other strikers, if you do well at this club, you score goals and perform you will get the opportunity and get linked to big clubs. ‘There should be no thinking of a sideways move or a downward step which a lot of the links are coming to.’","Swansea have already lost Wilfried Bony to Manchester City this month .

"Swansea have offered £4.3m for Norwich left-back Martin Olsson but the Championship side want £5m. The Welsh club signed Kyle Naughton for £5m and want to sign Tom Carroll from Tottenham on a permanent deal also. Olsson joined Norwich in 2013 when they were in the Premier League and the 26-year-old is keen for a return to the top flight. Swansea have offered £4.3m for Norwich left-back Martin Olsson but the Championship side want £5m . Swansea manager Garry Monk wants Olsson to act as defensive reinforcement given he could lose full back Neil Taylor before February. Swansea are also continuing to negotiate with Tottenham over a deal for Carroll. Tottenham want roughly £5m for 22-year-old Carroll, who has impressed Monk during his loan spell. However, Swansea were hoping to bring him in for £3.5m with add-ons to follow.

"Max Gradel levelled late on as Ivory Coast snatched a 1-1 draw with Mali in Group D of the African Nations Cup. Bakary Sako gave Mali a seventh minute lead and although Mali more than held their own for large parts of the contest, Ivory Coast levelled late on through substitute Gradel.

Mali boss Henryk Kasperczak kept faith with the same XI who drew their opener 1-1 with Cameroon, while Ivory Coast's Herve Renard made three changes, with Siaka Tiene replacing the suspended Gervinho, Ismael Diomande replacing Serey Die and Seydou Doumbia preferred to Salomon Kalou. Doumbia's strike rescued a draw for the Elephants in their last game against hosts Equatorial Guinea and in the game at the Nuevo Estadio de Malabo they were also left chasing the game after just seven minutes. Siaka Tiene was out of position and Sambou Yatabare sped into a crossing position before crossing to the back post where Sako hammered home on the half volley. Soumbeyla Diakite was tested for the first time after 21 minutes when Yaya Toure played in Serge Aurier, who instead of playing in Doumbia elected to shoot, with his weak effort easily stopped.

Renard made a change six minutes before the break with Gradel replacing Diomande. Gradel made an impact shortly after the restart as he played in Manchester City striker Bony, whose powerful header fell just wide of the post.

"Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson is not expecting any backlash from the Ghana Football Association despite claims of fury after Jeff Schlupp returned from injury at the weekend. Schlupp did not team up with Ghana's African Nations Cup squad earlier this month due to a knee injury reported by the Foxes and confirmed following an independent assessment. After being out for a fortnight, as predicted by Pearson, Schlupp was back in action in Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Stoke City, starting the match and playing for 70 minutes before being withdrawn. Jeff Schlupp (right) played for Leicester City against Stoke City on Saturday after recovering from injury . Schlupp had pulled out of the Ghana squad for the Africa Cup of Nations due to the injury . A report this week suggested Ghana coach Avram Grant and officials were angry over the situation, adding there was a possibility they would even report the Foxes to FIFA. Dismissing the story again, Pearson said: 'There isn't a situation with Ghana. 'I've not heard anything. If there is it's contrary to information I've heard officially. 'The rules are there, we've acted well within them, and there you have it. It's their choice.' Asked whether he could understand the frustration of those within the Ghana camp, Pearson replied sternly: 'No!' He added: 'I made it perfectly clear he would be out for 10 days to two weeks, which he was. But Leicester boss Nigel Pearson says he is not worried about it and has 'not heard' from Ghana . Schlupp (right) clears the ball for the Foxes as Stoke's Marko Arnautovic tries to make a challenge .

"FIFA says it is in advanced talks with companies to replace a number of sponsors whose contracts have expired. Tier one sponsors Sony and Emirates plus tier two World Cup sponsors Castrol, Continental and Johnson & Johnson have all chosen not to renew their deals, which expired at the end of 2014. Moscow-based oil and gas giant Gazprom has joined as a tier one partner ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, while talks are continuing with others companies, understood to include Qatar Airways, the national airline of the 2022 hosts. FIFA marketing director Thierry Weil is not concerned by five sponsors not renewing their deals . FIFA's marketing director Thierry Weil said in a statement: 'Rotations at the end of a sponsorship cycle are commonplace in the sports industry and have continuously occurred since the commercialisation of the FIFA World Cup began. It is natural that as brands' strategies evolve they reassess their sponsorship properties. 'The contracts with Castrol, Continental and Johnson & Johnson were always planned to run until the end of 2014 and therefore expired on December 31, 2014 accordingly. 'As in previous FIFA World Cup cycles, we are now in advanced negotiations with a number of companies related to sponsorship agreements in all three of our categories, ranging from tier 1 FIFA partners, tier 2 FIFA World Cup sponsors and tier 3 regional supporters. 'Each category provides tailored marketing opportunities for companies with a range of varying rights and we expect interest to grow even more as the FIFA Confederations Cup 2017 and 2018 FIFA World Cup draw closer.' None of the sponsors have blamed the bad publicity surrounding FIFA corruption allegations for the decision to end their relationships with world football's governing body, however.

"It was a disappointing night for the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Premier League stars, as both Yussouf Mulumbu and Yannick Bolasie were subbed off in a 0-0 draw against Cape Verde. Congo captain Mulumbu seemed to damage his hamstring in the 15th minute, and despite attempting to continue, he was stretchered off six minutes later. Bolasie, so superb in a man of the match display on Sunday against Zambia, was practically anonymous. Democratic Republic of Congo defender Issama Mpeko (left) challenges Cape Verde's Julio Tavares (right) Cape Verde Islands: Vozinha, Carlitos, Fernando Varela, Stopira, Gege, Rocha, Lima, Babanco, Kuca (Almeida Ramos), Ryan Mendes (Fortes, 73), Tavares (Almada Soares, 79). Congo DR: Kidiaba, Mongongu, Kimwaki, Kasusula, Issama, Mbemba, Mulumbu (Munganga, 23), Mabidi (Mubele, 86), Cedrick, Bolasie (Bokila, 63), Mbokani. Having been unlucky to only pick up a point in their first game, the Congolese side were surprisingly off the pace against the competition’s smallest country, failing to get their dangerous attacking players into the game. Bolasie briefly burst to life in stoppage time at the end of the first half, running at the Cape Verde defence before driving a shot from the edge of the box which was saved, relatively comfortably, by Josimar Dias. It was his only meaningful contribution in a thoroughly disappointing performance, which was cut short soon after when the winger replaced after an hour. The result leaves both sides knowing a win in their final game will guarantee progress to the knockout stages, but anything less could see them crash out. Cape Verde defender Stopira (right) tries to win the ball from Mpeko (left) The Leopards were indebted to their keeper  Robert Kidiaba to even get away with a point. The 38-year-old made a superb double save five minutes from time following a corner, and another stunning stop two minutes later to deny substitute Heldon Ramos. The closest Congo came to a goal was when the Blue Sharks’ centre back Gege almost beat his own keeper with a back-header, but Josimar reacted just in time to stop the ball going over the line. Cape Verde, on the other hand, appeared to have taken confidence from holding Tunisia in their opener, and showed the greater invention. Estoril forward Kuca was a particular threat, using his pace to get in behind the Leopards defence several times. On one such occasion the speedster should really have scored, but having beaten the offside trap he took far too many touches before getting his shot away, and eventually wasted the chance.

"Three major FIFA sponsors have ended their relationships with world football's governing body, it has emerged. Oil manufacturers Castrol, tyre and car parts business Continental and healthcare company Johnson & Johnson have each chosen not to extend deals with FIFA, the Daily Telegraph reported. The three companies were among a group of eight businesses identified as 'World Cup sponsors' by FIFA, which also had six top-tier 'partners' at the time of the 2014 tournament. It was confirmed in November that two of the elite group of backers, Sony and Emirates, had ended their relationships with FIFA, with Moscow-based oil and gas giant Gazprom joining ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Three major FIFA sponsors have ended their relationships with world football's governing body . The Daily Telegraph reports Castrol stating: 'We have not been sponsors of FIFA since, I believe, the World Cup last year.' Of its own decision to end its FIFA association, Johnson & Johnson told the newspaper: 'It was a decision that was made for business reasons after a comprehensive review.' Continental stated: 'It was a great platform for us and now we're using football on a regionalised level.' Campaigners lobbying for reform of FIFA, which has faced a number of instances and allegations of corruption, have said they will target its sponsors. FIFA have become embroiled in scandals relating to the World Cup bidding process . The strategy emerged at this week's 'New FIFA Now' summit in Brussels, the first organised campaign to challenge the leadership of FIFA in its 111-year history. Former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman, who has previously made allegations in Parliament about FIFA corruption surrounding the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, attacked the culture and governance of FIFA under president Sepp Blatter. Jaimie Fuller, the chairman of the SKINS sportswear company who has previously campaigned for reform of cycling, announced he will be writing to all FIFA sponsors. Candidates for the FIFA presidency must secure five nominations from national associations by January 29, with the contest in May expected to be a battle between long-term incumbent Blatter and Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein from Jordan.

Chikhaoui headed in a cross from Youssef Msakni in the 89th minute to give the Tunisians four points in Group B. Zambia, who have not won a match at the tournament since winning the title in 2012, has one point. Emmanuel Mayuka gave Zambia the lead in the 59th, smashing in a cross from captain Rainford Kalaba.

"Alan Pardew wants to banish his nearly-man reputation in the FA Cup and lead his Crystal Palace side all the way to Wembley glory. The 53-year-old lost as a player whilst with the Eagles as Manchester United lifted the trophy in 1990 after a replay, and came within seconds of leading West Ham to the famous cup in 2006 only for Steven Gerrard to thrash home a stoppage-time equaliser - with Liverpool going on to win on penalties. Since then Pardew's luck has been in short supply, winning just one FA Cup tie in his near-four-year reign at Newcastle before he left the club to return to Selhurst Park at the start of the year. Alan Pardew said Crystal Palace have no chance of winning the league, but could win the FA Cup . But he led Palace to victory at Dover in the third round, his first game in charge, and visits another former club in Southampton on Saturday looking to push on for another tilt at the trophy. 'I've had a couple of near shaves,' he said. 'I think I've been in a winning position after 12 minutes against Man United and it got away from us. And about two minutes against Liverpool. 'So it would be nice to get a big trophy over the line but they're not easy to come by in today's game when you're at clubs with such a disadvantage but the club does even it up. 'The chance of us winning the Premier League is more or less zero or one per cent I should think. But winning the cup is a possibility.' Pardew stressed the importance of cup success when it comes to building relationships with the fans . Pardew knows how a good cup run as a manager can endear you to the club's fans - something he has already enjoyed since being appointed as Neil Warnock's successor in south London given his previous spell with the club. 'We (West Ham) came within two minutes of winning it, a penalty shoot-out - my god,' he said when asked about his links with the competition. 'It gives you an affinity with the fans, here (at Palace) and at West Ham. Every West Ham fan that talks to me talks about the FA Cup final, they ingrain you into the history of a football cub so it is very important for a manager's CV, his ego and his personal ambition. It is an opportunity I think.' Pardew could be forgiven for spinning his FA Cup yarns to his players ahead of their tricky tie at St Mary's, but he is loath to do so - backing his side in a difficult game. Pardew has won all three games since taking charge at his old club Crystal Palace . 'Sometimes I might use an example of the fighting spirit from cups in the past but I don't really bring up my time too much, it can get a bit boring for players. They would just say, 'Oh yeah? When was that, when the ark was built?',' he said. 'For us, this group are a good fighting team and should make for a good cup team, they don't throw the towel in even when they are under heavy pressure. Cup games ebb and flow and you get surprising results. 'I think it would be a surprise if we beat them but it is possible.' The trip to the south coast will not be the first time Pardew has revisited the club he managed for a 13-month spell until a falling out with then-chairman Nicola Cortese in August 2010. He helped rebuild Southampton and led them to the Football League Trophy and admits he enjoys seeing their successes and his role within it. Pardew and Palace face Southampton at St Mary's in their FA Cup fourth round clash . 'I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a few players we had,' he added. 'In particular (Jason) Puncheon, (Rickie) Lambert and Adam Lallana a little bit. I think they are three great guys and I've followed their careers since. I take a lot of pride in that they have done so brilliantly. 'I don't really look for praise, to be honest. I think when you go into a football club you try to put some foundations down and I've tried to do that at all my clubs. 'I thought we were good in the transfer market at Southampton in the first year I was there. We brought in Rickie Lambert, Dean Hammond and Jose Fonte and they went through all the divisions with them. Puncheon as well. And we picked them up for peanuts really.'","Alan Pardew said Crystal Palace have no chance of winning the league .

"Garry Monk has promised Swansea will respond in the FA Cup at Blackburn following their Chelsea embarrassment last weekend. Swansea suffered their worst home defeat for 24 years as Jose Mourinho's Barclays Premier League leaders ran riot to win 5-0 at the Liberty Stadium, but Monk says his players have been impatient for Saturday's fourth-round cup tie at Ewood Park to come around. 'I've been on the end of those results as a player and you can't wait for the next game to come - it doesn't matter if it's a friendly,' Monk said.

'We've been fantastic this season and we just have to show what we have done in the majority of the games. 'I had a good chat with the players when they came back into training and we will respond at Blackburn.

Costa wheels away in celebration after converting a pass from Spanish playmaker Cesc Fabregas (right) Swansea's players look dejected during a shambolic first-half performance that saw them concede four times . Monk knows the value of a good cup run having been part of the Swansea squad which went all the way to Wembley in 2013 and lifted the Capital One Cup. The former centre-half played the last half-hour as a substitute in the 5-0 final victory over Bradford and is now keen to experience that feeling as a manager. 'I've watched a lot of Blackburn in recent weeks and they're a very good side,' Monk said about opponents who are 10th in the Sky Bet Championship and 21 places below Swansea on the league ladder. 'They'll want to do well at home but we want to put last week right and go on a cup run ourselves. 'We've experienced that already and it's magic to go on a run like that because it creates confidence throughout the whole club and the city.' Monk is confident that his Swansea side can bounce back from their defeat to beat Blackburn this weekend . Monk (bottom left) himself achieved success in the cup as a Swansea player, in the 2012/13 League Cup . Full-back Kyle Naughton could make his Swansea debut after completing his £5million move from Tottenham on Thursday and Monk seems set for a busy end to the January transfer window after confirming his interest in Norwich full-back Martin Olsson and Stuttgart midfielder Alexandru Maxim. But he admits that he hopes to sort out any business well before the end of the transfer deadline on February 2. 'I like to get any business done and dusted because I don't like leaving it to the last minute - that's why I leave it to the chairman,' Monk said. 'We've spoken about targets and shortlisting them and we'll see whether it's right for the club. 'This period can be good or bad for the club. 'It was a great opportunity for us to sign Kyle but we don't want to lose important players like (Wilfried) Bony. 'It depends who walks in or who walks out whether you have enjoyed the transfer window.'","Swansea lost to Chelsea 5-0 at the weekend in the Premier League .

"Ravel Morrison appears to be a step closer to securing a summer move to Lazio. A team of agents flew to Rome on Friday to discuss a possible transfer for the out-of-favour West Ham United midfielder. And reports in Italy now suggest a three-hour meeting with Lazio’s technical staff concluded in an offer of £500,000 a year plus bonuses for the 21-year-old. Ravel Morrison has been offered a contract worth £500,000 a year by Italian club Lazio . Morrison's only Premier League game for West Ham United this season was against Southampton in August . The midfielder has spent the majority of his two-year West Ham career out on loan in the Championship . West Ham are allowing Morrison to leave Upton Park on a free after manager Sam Allardyce lost patience with one of England’s most talented but controversial footballers. Here in England his representatives have told prospective employers he seeks only £15,000 a week - his current salary at West Ham  - and will even waive his right to any compensation should a club want to terminate his contract if he steps out of line. But the Italians seem to be showing more interest than clubs in the Premier League, who see Morrison as a risk despite three assault charges against him being withdrawn at Manchester Crown Court earlier this week.

"The most talented young player Sir Alex Ferguson has seen on a training pitch is on the market and available. Aged 21. On a free transfer. It was three years ago when Manchester United became tired of his antics and sent him packing. Now West Ham too have reached the conclusion Ravel Ryan Morrison is damaged goods. Banned from West Ham’s first-team training ground as they continue to flirt with the top six, Sam Allardyce has demanded that he ‘changes his whole life’ and — in the meantime — trains with the reserves elsewhere in Essex, away from their Chadwell Heath base. West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is not wanted by the club and is available on a free transfer . Morrison's only Premier League appearance for West Ham this season was against Southampton in August . Midfielder Morrison appears to smoke a cigar (left) and chats on the phone in August, 2014 (right) The talented midfielder takes a shot against Brighton and Hove Albion during a loan spell at QPR last season . Teams played for: West Ham, Cardiff (loan), QPR (loan), Birmingham (loan), Manchester United . Appearances: 81 . Goals: 14 . Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) Such is his declining reputation, Morrison — ambitiously considered by some to be a contender for the World Cup with England last summer — has let it be known that, if anyone will take him, he will sign a new contract with all the risk on his side. Morrison is seeking a relatively modest £15,000 a week (the same wage he is paid by West Ham). And there is a further incentive for his next club: he is prepared to waive any right to compensation should a club terminate his employment for stepping out of line. Even then, one Premier League chairman approached by Morrison’s advisers this week described it as ‘too risky’, and could not be convinced otherwise even when it was pointed out the risk was all Morrison’s. In England, according to one source close to Morrison, clubs are ‘paralysed by fear’ when presented with the prospect of hiring him. They can see he has ability, outrageous ability. And they remember the goals. But they also fear, in the high-stakes world of Premier League football, that introducing Morrison to a dressing room could prove incredibly divisive. One imagines they are influenced by the stories they hear; some well documented, some less so. But as events at Manchester Crown Court have demonstrated this week, not all of them are true. Morrison poses with three friends in a picture posted to his official Instagram account in February 2014 . Morrison was controversially pictured wearing an Arsenal home shirt before the start of the current season . The 21-year-old made seven Championship appearances and failed to score during a loan spell with Cardiff . Talking this week to people who have encountered Morrison, to people who know him extremely well too, the lack of consistency in their accounts of the 21-year-old is every bit as startling as the stories themselves. One reason given for why West Ham lost patience with Morrison was the suspicion that he had been driving without a licence. It is true Morrison is yet to pass his test but his representatives insist that he, like any learner driver, always has a qualified driver of the correct age siting alongside him. When the allegation was put to one source who was keen to defend Morrison, he rather worryingly replied: ‘He hasn’t done that (driven) for weeks and weeks.’ Concern about whether Morrison will turn up fuels the doubt in the boardroom, even among the Premier League’s most desperate clubs such as QPR, Hull and Aston Villa. It is claimed he went AWOL for a few days during the Christmas period of 2013. The reason has since been given as emergency dental work, the records of which were then presented to the club. Over the years he does appear to have missed training without proper explanation and it is said he was even late reporting for a recent Under 21 game, although coaches at West Ham are said to have been impressed by the midfielder these past few weeks, not least with his attitude and application. And he can play. Clearly the relationship with Allardyce has disintegrated, with claims and counter claims as to why that is. Allardyce has denied his own representatives once tried to recruit Morrison from his current agent when negotiations with the club over a new contract broke down. But Allardyce, like Sir Alex Ferguson before him, has decided he does not want the kid around, however good he might be. Morrison's last start for West Ham came in their Capital One Cup defeat by Sheffield United in August last year . The former Manchester United youngster regularly posts pictures of himself on his Instagram account . Morrison scored this memorable solo goal in a 3-0 win against London rivals Tottenham in October 2013 . After returning recently from an unsuccessful loan spell at Cardiff, Allardyce expressed his concern earlier this week that Morrison may ‘struggle’ to find a new club. ‘It’s the old metaphor isn’t it; you can lead the horse to water but you can’t make it drink,’ he said. ‘If they don’t want to take it on board, then there’s little they can do. It’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent. He just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he’ll become the player he should be.’ It is not just Allardyce and Ferguson, either. Harry Redknapp had Morrison at QPR for a loan spell and is said to have ‘quite liked the lad’. He recognised, at least away from the pitch, that he could be polite and respectful. He even entertained the idea of having him back. But Redknapp also reflected in his book how frustrating Morrison can be. ‘If he’d played consistently at his best, he might have gone to the World Cup,’ said Redknapp. ‘But on his bad days you wouldn’t put him in our reserve team. ‘The kid can really play. He goes past people and makes them look silly. He’s like Alan Hudson. He doesn’t run, he glides. ‘By the time we came to the end of the season, though, he couldn’t get in our starting line-up. He’s an amazing talent but his attitude makes you think about where he will be in six years’ time.’ Morrison made 17 appearances for QPR last season but dropped out of the team near the end of the campaign . Morrison's mother Sharon (left) is said to have strong moral principles and is a central figure in his life . Morrison came through Manchester United's academy but was let go by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2012 . An 18-year-old Morrison celebrates after scoring for United's Under 18s against Chelsea in the FA Youth Cup . Redknapp tells a story of how Morrison responded with a ‘petulant pout’ when he asked him ‘to do a job’ on the left flank in one game. And only after a serious talking-to did he respond the way his manager demanded. ‘In the second half it was like watching a player with Gareth Bale’s class in the Championship,’ writes Redknapp. He also recalls a story told to him by Lee Clark, who as the manager at Birmingham City also had the player on loan. Clark told Morrison he was ‘the best player since Gazza’. ‘Who’s Gazza?’ Morrison is said to have replied. This is not necessarily what puts off Premier League clubs and their managers. It is the more serious stuff. The stuff that has led to Morrison appearing in a courtroom and only narrowly escaping a jail sentence in February 2011. Morrison received a 12-month referral order and was ordered to pay costs and compensation after admitting to two counts of witness intimidation. It related to threats made to a mugging victim in an effort to stop him giving evidence against two people, described in court as ‘friends or associates’ of Morrison, accused of carrying out the attack. A district judge, warning that Morrison would be locked up for a year if he got in trouble again, described his behaviour as ‘appalling’. A further charge of assault was dropped when Morrison’s girlfriend refused to testify. He was, however, convicted of criminal damage for throwing her mobile phone from a window and advised to undergo domestic violence counselling. Morrison, pictured in action against Lithuania's Under 21 side, is yet to represent his country at senior level . Lazio target Morrison looks relaxed in this photo taken after he'd eaten dinner on Christmas Day . Morrison, pictured with Will Keane, scored twice in the FA Youth Cup final in 2011 to help United lift the trophy . This week three more charges brought against Morrison, for assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother, were withdrawn at Manchester Crown Court. The prosecutor told the court the charges had been dropped after Morrison’s defence team recovered CCTV footage of the first alleged assault outside a Manchester nightclub. The video showed Morrison had not hit his ex-girlfriend, as was alleged, and it appeared that she had simply ‘slumped’ to the floor. The young woman also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off in his Porsche, while there was also ‘reluctance’ from her mother to proceed over the alleged assault on her. His representatives dread to think what might have happened had that CCTV footage not materialised. After all, his ex-girlfriend is understood to have sustained injuries to her face when she fell. But even though the charges were withdrawn, with the CCTV evidence showing that he was actually rather chivalrous that night, some damage has been done. A video of him emerging from Strangeways Prison after the initial arrest became a YouTube sensation available to any prospective employer. Morrison is said to have been brought up by his grandparents in one of the more deprived areas of Greater Manchester, the impression being that he had a difficult upbringing. This is not quite true. There was a spell when he lived with his grandparents and his childhood was not always easy. But a mother said to have strong moral principles is a central figure in his life.","West Ham boss Sam Allardyce wants Ravel Morrison to find a new club .

"A new doping scandal involving Russian athletes has erupted after the IAAF confirmed it is investigating allegations that race walker Elena Lashmanova, who won gold at the London Olympics, took part in a race in December despite being subject to a two-year doping ban. The IAAF, athletics' world governing body, has confirmed it is looking into the claims, and alleged attempts to cover up her participation. The IAAF is already involved in a major investigation into allegations from German broadcaster ARD that doping and cover-ups are rife in Russian athletics. Former Olympic and world race walk champion has been accused of competing while serving a drug ban . Lashmanova, 22, who in 2012 became the youngest winner of the women's Olympic 20-kilometre walk, is banned until February 2016 after testing positive for banned hormones and modulators of metabolism. Claims surfaced in Italian race walking periodical Marcia dal Mondo that she competed in the indoor regional championships of her home region of Mordovia in Russia last month, and photographs were published of her participating. The event organiser has claimed the photographs were wrongly used and were from a 2012 event. Canadian race walker Evan Dunfee has posted a blog about the claims however, saying the footwear being worn by the walkers in the pictures where Lashmanova is photographed were not available until 2014. If the claims are proven, Lashmanova faces being banned for an extra two years until February 2018. An IAAF spokesman told  Sportsmail: ' The IAAF has been informed of this and our anti-doping department is investigating.' THe Russian athlete celebrates after wining gold in the 20km walk at the 2012 London Olympics . Last month, the son of IAAF president Lamine Diack stepped down from his activities with the governing body pending the investigation into the allegations from German television. Papa Massata Diack, who works for the IAAF as a marketing consultant, joined Valentin Balakhnichev, the president of the Russian athletics federation and the IAAF's treasurer, in agreeing to step down. Balakhnichev continues in his role with the Russian federation and said the allegations about Lashmanova were being looked into. He told R-Sport agency: 'We've started an investigation into the case. Its results will be announced shortly.' The IAAF investigation also covers a list of 150 athletes obtained by ARD named as having suspicious blood results between 2006-2008. It included three Britons, one with a high profile.","Elena Lashmanova won gold in race walking at the London 2012 Olympics .

"Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes there is still time for Ravel Morrison to turn his career around, despite an exit from West Ham United looking increasingly likely. Morrison was handed one of the biggest accolades a young player could ever receive when he was touted as a possible successor to Scholes in the United midfield.

'The problems Ravel has had in his life have been well documented and it is fair to say that I saw first-hand the issues he presents when our careers overlapped at Manchester United,' Scholes wrote in his Independent column. 'What I can also say is that he has remarkable skill and vision for a footballer. I saw a lot of great young prospects at United but he really stood out on the days when he wanted to shine. 'No one could have done more for him than Warren Joyce, the club's reserve team manager and latterly the Under 21s coach, who went out of his way to try to understand what made Ravel tick. Morrison (left) was tipped by many to take the place of Paul Scholes (right) in the Manchester United midfield . 'If there is one consolation it is that Ravel is still young. He turns 22 next month.

"It's 20 years since Blackburn Rovers were crowned champions of England. A replica Premiership trophy sits on display at Ewood Park and there is a statue to Jack Walker, the local millionaire who made it all possible. Dotted around the club that Jack built are memories of those heady days when Shearer, Sutton and Sherwood helped seize the title from Manchester United. Sadly, there is little else left of Blackburn’s former glory. Today, they are £80million in debt, operating under a transfer embargo and still taking orders from India. Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton parade the Premiership trophy after Blackburn won it in 1994-95 . Gary Bowyer has overseen the slow climb back towards respectability after relegation from Premier League . The fierce opposition to Venky’s has subsided but the mistakes made by the chicken farming family from Pune in those first catastrophic years in charge continue to haunt their football club; the sacking of Sam Allardyce, relegation from the top-flight, boardroom battles and reckless spending. Blackburn’s rookie owners talked about qualifying for the Champions League and signing Ronaldinho, but became a laughing stock. They have learned a painful lesson and adopt a significantly lower profile these days. Meanwhile the manager who has overseen the slow climb back towards respectability – though still a million miles from prosperity – seems remarkably laid-back for someone asked to work with at least one hand tied behind his back. Gary Bowyer twice stepped in as caretaker after Henning Berg and Michael Appleton were sacked in the tumultuous 2012-13 season before getting the job on a permanent basis. Balaji Rao (left) and Venkatesh Rao, directors of Venky's, took control of the club in 2010 . ‘At the time it was nothing short of a mess,’ says Bowyer. ‘There were a lot of people who were quick to jump on the bandwagon and call the club at any second. ‘We’re not stupid or naïve, I understand why. But I think that’s credit to the owners. They’ve made progress, educated themselves, learned lessons and improved. I think that’s why they have been out of the papers for 18 months. ‘The task was obviously to bring credibility back to the football club which we’ve done, but there’s still a long way to go. ‘We’ve stabilised it from where it was. But that doesn’t mean that it’s in the place we want it to be. Now we need to kick on and go again.’ The trips to India to speak to the owners are less frequent these days. Bowyer has not been over there for two months. But the transfer embargo imposed for breaching Financial Fair Play rules prohibits Venky’s from throwing more money at the problem even if they want to. The club were relegated in 2010-11 and the supporters were vehemently opposed to Venky's . It means that he is spending the transfer window fending off bids for his best players instead of signing new ones to get back into the top-flight. Even if Crystal Palace meet Blackburn’s £5m valuation of their top scorer Rudy Gestede, it won’t knock much of a hole in the £79.8m debt. The figure is almost twice what Venky’s paid to buy the club in 2010. Bowyer has done his bit to steady the ship and only narrowly missed out on the playoffs last season. But there’s a thin line between stability and mediocrity in the eyes of some supporters, and he was booed after the recent defeat to Wolves as Blackburn continued on a disappointing run that has brought just won win in the last eight Championship games. ‘We said it would take time and that’s something the supporters have to be extremely aware of,’ he said. ‘Of course the debt makes it more difficult, there’s no denying that. The teams above us are all looking to spend big in this window if you believe the figures and we can’t compete with that. ‘But that’s the job. I was aware of what was coming, and we just get on with it. ‘I can’t control other clubs showing interest in our players.

On Saturday, Blackburn can enjoy a rare moment back in the spotlight when they face Swansea City in the lunchtime tie, having held Manchester City to a draw here in the third round last season. Sadly, according to Dan Clough from the club fanzine 4,000 Holes, the cup competitions might be Rovers’ only opportunity of rubbing shoulders with the elite of English football from now on. ‘The fans’ previous experience of a takeover was extremely positive with Jack Walker,’ said Clough. ‘For it to go the way it has is even more disappointing. ‘But pre-1985, we were a Second Division club until there was a massive injection of cash. In terms of the size of the town, you can’t say we deserve to be in the top-flight. ‘The fans were spoiled a bit and it couldn’t last forever.

Reah Mansoor also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home while there was ‘reluctance’ from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her. Morrison last night played for West Ham Under 21s in their league game against Everton in Southport.

"The huge cost of the adidas kit deal with Manchester United that starts next season is going to impact on the England cricket team. Adidas will need to make cutbacks elsewhere in their global business to afford the staggering £750million over 10 years that they have invested in United - with cricket one of the endangered sectors. The German company have been the teamwear suppliers to all England cricket sides since 2008 and in 2011 the deal was extended to run until 2017. Adidas have agreed a £750million, 10-year sponsorship deal with Manchester United . That huge deal will impact on their other sponsorships, including their relationship with England's cricket side . But it’s understood that adidas, who will not renew the contract again, want to downgrade the deal in its remaining seasons - so it becomes more similar to the licensing agreement they have with England Hockey rather than one of their marquee partnerships. This follows not only the vast sum set aside for Old Trafford, but the poor sales of England replica kit with cricket fans far less likely to wear the team strip to matches than football supporters. And adidas have made the strategic decision to concentrate on core sports that will not include cricket. The ECB are reported to have already started talking to other sportswear companies.

Allen, who was in talks to buy Southampton in 2007, part-owns MLS side Seattle Sounders. Villa are sceptical about any bid but a source involved with Allen’s investment vehicle Vulcan said: ‘This is Americans talking to Americans.’ The FA’s highly embarrassing decision to start concentrating on finding an FA Cup sponsor for next season rather than continue their botched search this campaign follows the realistion that any brands showing interest will not be able to free marketing funds to activate the elusive sponsorship for the rest of the tournament.","Adidas have agreed a £750million, 10-year deal with Manchester United .

"Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy has been publicly called out by the owner of a local eatery for leaving a 20-cent tip on a bill totaling more than $60. The Philadelphia burger joint PYT shared a receipt online showing what was described as Mr McCoy's paltry tip. 'The twenty cent tip that the Eagles' LeSean McCoy just left our server on his $60 check is going to come in really handy for that new official NFL McCoy jersey he had his heart set on,' the message that accompanied the receipt read. 'That is a .03% tip. New record!' Paltry tip: The owner of Philadelphia's PYT burger joint shared this receipt from Monday showing the 20-cent tip that Eagles star LeSean McCoy left for a server on a $61.56 tab . Unsatisfied customer: PYT server Rob Knelly (left) indicated that the meager tip did not come as a surprise given that LeSean McCoy (right) and his friends were rude and disrespectful from the moment they sat down . According to the document in question, McCoy and three guests patronized PYT on North Hancock Street at around 3pm Monday, ordering $57 worth of food, plus $4.56 in taxes. McCoy paid the tab with his Visa credit card, writing in by hand a '$00.20' tip for a grand total of $61.76. McCoy's party of four was served that day by a waiter named Rob, identified later in an NJ.com article as Rob Knelly. The PYT staffer revealed to the paper that LeSean McCoy and his guests were being loud and rude from the moment they sat down at the table. ‘I kept my cool for as long as I could, where you just don’t want them yelling and cursing you,’ Knleyy, who is a Baltimore Raves fan, said. ‘I asked some questions; they weren't really responsive. They were cursing, making derogatory comments. I put their order in and forgot one of their appetizers, which I apologized for. They ordered things and, once they got it, said “We ain't eating this s***. We don't want it.""’ After giving the patrons’ drink orders to the bartender, Knelly said McCoy and his party continued to call for him. ‘They didn’t know my name,’ Knelly told NBC Philadelphia. ‘They just said, “you’re my server right?” They were being rude so after I gave them their food I didn’t go back to them until they were done. I just avoided their rudeness.’ Fast-food landmark: Tommy Up, the owner of the popular eatery, wrote on Facebook that everyone at PYT was excited to see McCoy, but he responded by making derogatory comments and mistreating the staff . When a Philadelphia Daily News reporter reached out to McCoy for comment, the NFL player said, 'It's bull****, man,' but he declined to further elaborate on the tip controversy. In 2012, LeSean McCoy signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million. Slip-up: Knelly admitted that he forgot to bring an appetizer for the group, but apologized for his mistake . The image of the receipt posted on PYT’s Facebook by the owner has been shared more than 2,800 times, drawing sharp criticism from many commenters for calling out McCoy as a bad tipper. User Taryn Woods wrote: ‘This is very distasteful and unprofessional of PYT. So what if the man left a .20 cent tip? It’s his right to be cheap or more than likely disappointed with the service.’ Another Facebook commenter Phil Penny wondered: ‘is there a minimum we should tip to avoid you posting receipts online?’ In response to the firestorm, the proprietor of the burger joint, Tommy Up, penned a lengthy status update Tuesday afternoon offering his side of the story. Mr Up opened his letter by taking full responsibility for sharing the receipt online and saying that he stands firmly by his staff. He then went on to describe how ‘pumped’ his employees – many of them loyal Eagles fans – were to see the famed running back walk through the doors of their establishment. ‘Mr McCoy and his friend sat inside at a booth next to my management and next to me. They were given excellent service. Impeccable service. If anything, our server was a little nervous as was our food runner, because they are big, big fans,’ the owner wrote. Millionaire's response: The running back, who signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million in 2012, responded to the tip-gate by saying the eatery's claims were 'bull****' ‘He and his group, from the moment they sat down, were verbally abusive to our staff in the most insulting ways. The derogatory statements about women and their sheer contempt for the staff serving them wasn't the end, however. ‘After Mr McCoy and his group left I looked over and saw their server, my friend, with his head bowed down and with a very confused look on his face. I took the receipt out of his hand and I couldn't believe that anyone could be so callous. Mr McCoy had left a .03% tip for our staff. ‘Our staff that was beyond excited to see him walk into our burger joint and was excited to serve him. That's twenty cents on a tab of over $60. Twenty cents that our server has to split with the food runner and the bartender. Two dimes from an insulting multimillionaire. The owner went on to dismiss reports the McCoy and his party received poor service as ‘a complete slanderous lie.’ ‘At the end of the day, I did what I felt my heart told me to do. And I don't want anything from Mr McCoy, but...maybe an apology to his server who gave him excellent service would be cool,’ Mr Up summed up, before directing all hate mail to his email address.","McCoy had lunch with three friends at PYT in Philadelphia Monday, leaving only 20 cents for his server on a bill totaling $61.56 .

"Manchester United midfielder Anderson is in danger of becoming European football’s most unwanted man after it emerged there has not been a single official enquiry for him during the current transfer window. The 26-year-old – who cost in the region of £20m when United bought him in 2007 – has not played a game for the club since he was given a 20 minute run out by Louis van Gaal against Burnley in the Barclays Premier League back in August. The former Brazilian international is officially for sale, just as he has been virtually since David Moyes took over as United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the early summer of 2013. Manchester United midfielder Anderson is in danger of becoming European football’s most unwanted man . Anderson, pictured in 2013, has not played since a 20 minute cameo against Burnley in August and is for sale . Mna United are yet to receive a single official enquiry for Anderson during the current transfer window . However it is understood that – with three weeks of the January transfer window already gone – United have not had a single serious enquiry for a player who the club hoped would be the mainstay of the midfield at Old Trafford when he arrived from Porto seven-and-half years ago. While many clubs would understandably wish to wait until the summer when Anderson will be a free agent, he is available for a knock-down fee now and would certainly be allowed to go on loan. However, it seems that clubs around Europe have been put off by stories of Anderson’s lifestyle and weight issues. At United he is privately lampooned, for example, for his liking for fast food. Anderson was pictured last week having been for lunch with a female friend  in Manchester . Anderson's career at Manchester United appears doomed with the midfielder appearing just once this season . Attached to the Gestifute stable of influential agent Jorge Mendes, Anderson should in reality have little problem finding a new club. However his spell on loan at Fiorentina last spring saw him start just four games and there was little interest from mainstream clubs in him during the summer that followed. One option for United this month would be pay up Anderson’s contract and effectively allow him to walk away from Old Trafford.","Manchester United midfielder Anderson has not played since August .

"Not since Colin Firth emerged from a lake in that wet shirt in the BBC’s adaptation of Pride And Prejudice nearly 20 years ago has there been anything like it. But if these exclusive pictures are anything to go by, Aidan Turner is sure to set pulses racing once more when he graces our screens in Poldark next month. Sporting a rippling torso, tousled hair and trendy stubble, the 31-year-old Irish actor, who starred in the Hobbit films, was snapped topless at Dollar Cove in Cornwall as he filmed scenes for the much-anticipated BBC remake of the hit 1970s drama. Scroll down for video . Aidan Turner was spotted filming scenes at Dollar Cove in Cornwall, sporting a rippling torso and stubble . The saga, based on Winston Graham’s acclaimed novels set in Cornwall in the 18th Century, tells the story of Ross Poldark (Turner), an Army officer who returns to England after fighting in the American War of Independence to discover that his fiancee Elizabeth (Heida Reed) had believed him dead and has since married his cousin. Poldark then marries his maid, Demelza (Eleanor Tomlinson), but is forever torn between the two women. The original series – a feast of heaving bosoms and bodice-ripping played out on a backdrop of windswept Cornish landscapes – attracted audiences of up to 15 million. This time around, the eight-part adaptation is scheduled for a post-watershed slot and audiences can expect even steamier scenes. In a short trailer for the programme, flame-haired Demelza watches from a clifftop as Poldark emerges from the sea in a state of undress.

"The tumultuous history of Europe over the last Millennium, including its many revolutions and wars, has been captured in a remarkable video lasting just over three minutes. From the Crusaders until modern times, the lines on the map of Europe have been redrawn many times and tell a tale of the rise and fall of nations including the creation of vast empires to small countries fighting for their independence. The hypnotic video shows the lines on the map of Europe subtlety changing over 1,012 years as a result of major historical events. Scroll down for video . This map contains the names of long-forgotten places as well as showing the demise of the Byzantine Empire in a map that looks very different to modern Europe . The video invites viewers to test their historical knowledge as well as consider the vast human impact of major events such as the world wars, which are simply shown by the movement of boundaries on a map. The video, which contains animations and maps by the creator of the Historical Atlas, Frank Reed, begins in the year 1140 at the end of the Viking Age and the beginning of the Crusades; a time when religiously-motivated military expeditions set up small states in the eastern Mediterranean. The expeditions culminated in the Sack of Constantinople in 1204, which ended the Byzantine Empire. Europe in the 17th Century, at the end of the Renaissance. Much of northern Europe is visibly carved up into tiny states and over a few hundred years there were many wars and revolutions . The map shows how the High Middle Ages was dominated by the rise and fall of the Mongol Empire, which at its peak stretched from China to the Baltic sea in Europe, with the Mongols led by Genghis Khan. While England fought with France in the Hundred Years' War, beginning in 1337, the House of Habsburg got stronger, Russia expanded southward and eastward into former Mongol lands and the Ottoman Empire also grew in size as it swallowed up former Byzantine lands over time. The Renaissance spread throughout Europe between the 14th and 17th centuries, but despite the beginning of what many people consider to be modern Europe and the proliferation of new artistic and scientific ideas, a number of religious wars and revolutions rocked the continent, changing boundaries between small states and countries. Europe in 1913 ahead of World War One. Germany and Italy are unified nations but the boundaries between countries were set to change dramatically in just a short space of time . Between 1815 and 1871, some Balkan nations regained their independence from the Ottoman Empire and after the Franco-Prussian War, Germany and Italy unified into nation states ahead of World War One, during which time, boundary changes in Europe were dramatic and rapid. Following the war, the Treaty of Versailles altered the map of Europe and ultimately led to the outbreak of World War Two, as nations were divided, radical politics was fueled by angry citizens and countries subsequently invaded as Europe entered a second state of flux with boundaries and areas of ocupation that changed in a short and violent period of time. Since 1918, when poverty triggered the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union had been growing and came to dominate the continent up to 1991, when smaller Soviet countries regained their independence. Following two devastating world wars, Europe looks very different in 1960 with an occupied and divided Germany and the huge Soviet Union.

"Schools of bait fish may have enticed a shark involved in a fatal attack in northern NSW closer to shore and there are concerns it could happen again in the lead up to summer. A man, believed to be in his 50s, was bitten on his right leg by a shark around 15-20 metres offshore at Byron Bay on Tuesday morning. Michael Brown, a shark expert who runs Surf Watch Australia, believes the attack was a result of recent stormy weather and an increased number of bait fish in the area. Scroll down for video . 19-year-old Zac Young had to be pulled from the water by three friends after he was attacked by a shark while bodyboarding near Coffs Harbour on the NSW north coast in November . 'A lot of these big schools of fish are coming in close to shore and the rough weather we’ve had is dredging up the bottom. One thing leads to another… and as the bait fish come in, the sharks are following,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Michael Brown, a shark expert who runs Surf Watch Australia, believes the fatal attack was a result of recent stormy weather and an increased number of bait fish in the area . 'When you have swimmers in the area where sharks are coming in to feed on the bait fish… that's where the problem lies. 'I think that’s the underlying issue that’s caused today’s (incident).' Mr Brown said Byron Bay was 'absolutely a hot spot' for shark sightings due to the high number of fish close to shore. 'I wouldn’t say Byron is the worst spot in NSW but it’s up there. The water is nice and clear and there's a lot of fish,' he said. He warned the amount of bait fish moving up and down the east coast could see an increased number of sharks closure to shore in the coming months. 'At the moment there’s a lot of bait fish in the area and that leads to a lot of sharks. With rough conditions and the way things are going at the moment, there’s definitely grounds for concern. If this carries on into summer, we could definitely have a problem,' Mr Brown said. 'Best thing we could do is forget about shark culling and invest time and money in establishing a program to monitor where bait fish are and pre-empt where sharks are going to be. 'If you look back at every serious shark attack over the past 20 years, they’re all coming in to feed.' The man's death on Tuesday is the latest in a string of fatal shark attacks that have plagued Australian waters. Christine Armstrong, 63, was swimming with a group of five others including her husband when she was taken by a shark at Tathra off the south coast of NSW in April . Five other fatal attacks have occurred in the past two years, including a 63-year-old woman who was taken by a shark while swimming off the south coast of NSW in April. Christine Armstrong was swimming with a group of five others, one of which was her husband, when she was attacked at Tathra. Mrs Armstrong and her husband Rob regularly swam in the area but on the day she was attacked she had turned back a little earlier due to spinal pain. A widespread search was launched and Mrs Armstrong's cap and goggles were later located. A 19-year-old man had to be pulled from the water by three friends after he was attacked by a shark while bodyboarding near Coffs Harbour on the NSW north coast in November last year. Zac Young had been sitting astride his bodyboard when an eight-foot tiger shark came up behind him on November 29. Chris Boyd, pictured with partner Krystle Westwood, was killed instantly in November when he was mauled by a great white while surfing 270km south of Perth . It's believed both of Mr Young's legs were nearly severed in the attack. His friends tried to perform CPR when he was pulled from the water, but the teenager later died of cardiac arrest. Just a few days earlier on November 23, Chris Boyd, 35, was attacked by a great white shark off Gracetown in Western Australia. The father of two was killed instantly when he was mauled by the shark while surfing at popular break Umbies, 270km south of Perth. Witnesses said Mr Boyd was dragged to shore on another man's surfboard and he was missing his left arm and part of his right leg. The attack on Mr Boyd prompted the WA Government's controversial catch-and-kill shark program, which was trialled earlier this year. The body of 24-year-old Ben Linden was never found after he was taken by a great white near Wedge Island in Western Australia on July 14, 2012 . Ben Linden, 24, was killed near Wedge Island in Western Australia on July 14, 2012, after being taken by what was believed to be a great white shark. He had been at the surf spot, 180km north of Perth, for about an hour before the great white attacked and swam away with his body. Mr Linden's body was never found. A witness who was riding a jetski near where Mr Linden was attacked told a coronial inquest into his death that he tried to scare away the shark with his jetski. 'There was just blood everywhere and a massive, massive white shark circling the body,' Matthew Holmes said, according to the ABC. 'I reached to grab the body and the shark came at me on the jet-ski and tried to knock me off and I did another loop and when I came back to the body the shark took it.'

"With its promise of forbidden sex and themes of submission and control, it already has millions of cinema-goers in a lather of anticipation. Yet there has been another steamy drama going on behind the cameras on the set of Fifty Shades Of Grey. Because author E. L. James and director Sam Taylor-Johnson have been scrapping over how realistic the sex scenes should be – and it is James who has emerged very much the dominant partner. But this should be no surprise. Because the woman who is, by her own admission, a ‘rather ordinary’ housewife from less-than-fashionable Brentford in West London has become a Hollywood sensation. And she wields a staggering degree of control over the movie, insisting on an authentic rather than an artistic depiction of the graphic scenes made famous by her books. It is, say sources close to her, an ‘obsession’. Scroll down for video . Author E. L. James was at loggerheads with director Sam Taylor-Wood over the sex scenes in the screen adaptation of her best-selling book - but the writer got the realistic sex scenes she wanted in the end . The film is to be released on Valentine’s Day, and stars Irish actor Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey, the tycoon with a taste for kinky sex, and Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, his submissive virgin lover. Insiders say James has ended up with one of the most all-encompassing deals in Hollywood history, with final approval over the script, actors and director – even having control over the costumes, set and merchandising tie-ins. And she had approval over the sex scenes which, according to one film insider, ‘push the boundaries of a mainstream movie in a way they’ve never been pushed before’. When James first created the characters of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and their extreme fantasy world of bondage and sadomasochistic sex, it was, she admits, ‘purely a fulfilment of my own fantasies’. But today it has made her a fortune. James is thought to have earned around £50million in the past year alone, a sum which could be increased by the extraordinary range of merchandising now on offer. The books have sold a staggering 100million copies worldwide and Hollywood made her a £3.5million offer for the rights to them, resulting in a £27million big screen version of Fifty Shades which is one of the most hotly anticipated films of the year. The £27million movie, starring Jamie Dornan, pictured, is expected to be one of the biggest releases of the year - making James one of the most powerful players in Hollywood at the moment . Today, home in LA is the famed Chateau Marmont hotel, where she stays in the £1,500-a-night bungalow where Blues Brothers star John Belushi overdosed on a ‘speedball’ cocktail of heroin and cocaine. One insider said: ‘It’s her home away from home. You see her most nights in the hotel garden, sipping her favourite chablis. ‘People come up to her all night, industry types and the odd celebrity, paying homage. She is loving it. ‘She is a real power player in Hollywood, although everything depends on the movie opening now, of course. ‘If it becomes a phenomenon, she’ll remain everyone’s darling. If it bombs, she’ll become a pariah.’ James' book tells the tale of a tycoon with a taste for kinky sex, and his submissive virgin lover . In the UK, E. L. James drives an Audi, in LA it’s a chauffeur-driven Maybach limo – not to mention the journeys by private jet around America. During her regular visits to Hollywood over the past two years, she has mingled with Christian Bale, Jake Gyllenhaal, Katy Perry and Robert Pattinson who, allegedly, was her first choice for the role of Christian Grey but turned it down because it was too similar to his part in Twilight. James’s attention to detail – and that of her colleagues – has been extraordinary. Dornan, best known until now for his role in BBC drama The Fall, went to Vancouver sex clubs to make sure his interpretation tied in with James’s vision. Reports of in-fighting between James and Taylor-Johnson over the sex scenes became so rife the pair posted a cheeky Instagram photograph together posing cheek to cheek with both raising their fists accompanied by the caption ‘the gloves are off’. Now the rumours have been confirmed in an astonishing series of interviews by Taylor-Johnson, who admitted she and James, 51 (real name Erika Leonard) were at loggerheads for much of the shoot, with sex the biggest bone of contention. Taylor-Johnson told Vanity Fair magazine: ‘We battled all the way through. She’d say the same. There were tough times and revelatory times. There were sparring contests. It was definitely not an easy process.’ James authorised a friend of hers to confirm the rift saying: ‘There’s an Erika who is fun, fancy-free and enjoying her success a lot, and the Erika who is obsessively controlling the property. ‘She truly believes she has to control it because of the fans, because she’s the only one they trust.’ James herself said: ‘I was always concerned how the sex would be handled in the film. I think we got there in the end.’ While Taylor-Johnson fought for a more ‘subtle’ interpretation of some of the book’s raunchiest sequences, James insisted on being on the closed set for the lovemaking scenes – including inside Christian’s notorious ‘Red Room Of Pain’. ‘Sam was for the less is more approach but Erika wanted more,’ says a source. ‘Her vision ultimately won out because, after all, she created the books. There were numerous run-ins on set. E. L. James has even got final approval over the merchandise being sold to accompany the film, including underwear (left) and a suited teddy bear, complete with handcuffs and mask (right) E. L. James stands to add to her fortune with a range of products tied in to the movie. These include mugs, jewellery (featuring tiny handcuffs and whips), keychains, a themed CD, a coffee table book and a range of lingerie and T-shirts. James says she hopes that fans will be able to ‘live the experience’ of the characters in her books by dressing in the lingerie, listening to the music and sipping Anastasia’s favourite wines. There is a range of silver and grey nail polish with names such as Embrace The Grey and Dark Side Of The Mood. Make-up giant Sephora is selling a Tease Me make-up line along with Desire Me brushes. James personally approved the blending of two wines – Red Satin and White Silk – travelling to Northern California wine country to taste dozens of varieties. There is even a Fifty Shades tie, such as Christian used to tie up Anastasia, and teddy bears with handcuffs and a mask. James is so fastidious, she insists on approving every product, often running them past her millions of fans on Twitter and Instagram. ‘Erika stayed up late night after night at the bar in the hotel reworking scenes and putting sex back in. We were working for two masters, Sam and Erika, but Erika won most of the time. This is her baby – whips, chains and all.’ It is a long way from 2009 when James, then a low-ranking TV executive, created the characters on a Twilight fan blog, writing under the pseudonym ‘Snowqueens Icedragon’ so that none of her friends would know the ‘Mummy porn’ was written by her. The stories quickly took on a life of their own and were shared and reshared by mothers from London to Long Island until publisher Random House came calling, and the rest is history. For James – who is set to walk the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere with husband Niall, an Irish author who described himself as ‘the least romantic fecker that ever lived’ – the next few weeks will be all-consuming. Taylor-Johnson, an artist whose last film was the low-budget John Lennon biography Nowhere Boy, remained in her LA editing suite last week putting the finishing touches to the film. And if the movie is a success, there will be two further releases – based on James’ follow-up books Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.","Director Sam Taylor-Wood admitted they were at 'loggerheads' over film .

Keen gardeners from the UK, Europe and even the United States flocked to the 'Great Snowdrop Rush' sale at Myddelton House Gardens in Enfield, Greater London, on Saturday to get their hands on the in-demand bulbs. Many paid up to £100 for a single bulb of the white flowering Galanthus – also known as the Castle Green Dragon – which were on sale from Cambridge's Monksilver Nursery. Keen gardeners from the UK, Europe and even the United States flocked to the 'Great Snowdrop Rush' sale at Myddelton House Gardens in Enfield on Saturday to get their hands on the in-demand £100 'snowdrop' bulbs . Many paid  £100 for a single bulb of the white flowering Galanthus – also known as the Castle Green Dragon . The sought-after bloom – which has green outer leaves and a stunning white 'snowdrop' flower – was described as a 'lovely virescent plicate from Scotland' and a 'snowdrop of great quality'. While several people splashed out on the bulbs, others paid between £10 and £20 for a plant at the event. Andrew Turvey, head gardener at Myddelton House Gardens, said 'people will pay a lot for a particular snowdrop.' He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'They attract a very dedicated breed of enthusiast.' Despite the considerable price tag for the snowdrops at the event, it is not the most ever paid for a Galanthus bulb. In February 2012, a single Scottish Elizabeth Harrison snowdrop bulb was sold for a record £725 on eBay. The record-breaking sale more than doubled the price of the previous most expensive bulb, a Green Tear, which went for £360 at the beginning of 2012. Snowdrops are considered highly-valuable among keen horticulturists, with many collectors hiring security guards or using tags to protect their rare species. The sought-after bloom – which has outer green leaves and a stunning white 'snowdrop' flower – was described as a 'lovely virescent plicate from Scotland' and a 'snowdrop of great quality' and priced at £100 .

There are at least 20 species of wild snowdrops in the world, with more than 2,000 cultivated varieties. Saturday's sale comes after a study by the Botanical Society of England and Ireland recorded a whopping 2,908 plants currently in flower across the country. The study of Britain's flora and fauna – dubbed the New Year Plant Hunt – found a total of 368 different species of flower across England and Ireland. Dr Tim Rich, co-founder of the Society's plant hunt, said: 'With 2014 being the warmest year on record, we were expecting lots of wild flowers still to be in bloom over New Year. '368 species in flower is an unprecedented 15 per cent of the flowering plants in Britain and Ireland. The books suggest there should only be 20-30 species in flower. 'The most commonly recorded plants were daisy and dandelion, each of which were recorded in 115 lists (75 per cent). 'As expected, the mild south and west of Britain had the highest numbers of species still in flower, but we also had lists of over 50 species from the east and north of England, and an amazing 39 flowering in Edinburgh.'

Cheryl Prudham (left), from Gravesend, Kent, who claims £38,000 a year in benefits, says she has broken up with her husband Robert (right), just days after announcing she was pregnant with her 12th child . The 32-year-old says her husband Robert - the father to six of her children - has been constantly 'leaving her' for other women throughout their five-year relationship. Pictured: The large Prudham family . Mr Prudham, 29, started cheating on her two weeks before they were married, when she already had six children by two other men, she told the Sunday People. But now she has vowed to draw a line under their tempestuous relationship. She said: ‘This time something snapped and I realised I deserve better. He makes me sick.’ Mrs Prudham, who lives in a five-bedroom council semi in Gravesend, Kent, had her first son George when she was 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in the summer of 2000. She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son Jack, now 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight. She then had three unplanned pregnancies: Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four. The family were photographed last summer enjoying a two-week holiday in Menorca, which Mrs Prudham insisted they 'deserved' In March 2009 she met Mr Prudham and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, two, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year. She then had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose last August. Mrs Prudham told how she went through with the wedding to Mr Prudham because she was eight months pregnant with Leon and thought her husband’s alleged cheating was a one-off. She said: ‘I was desperate to have a more stable family life and give the kids a home with a mum and a dad – something I’d never had but always craved.’ But, she claims, six months after they were married he left her again, saying he needed space. Then, after returning three weeks later, he apparently walked out in March 2011, while she was seven months pregnant. Despite being pregnant with her 12th child, Mrs Prudham says she is drawing a line under her relationship with her husband . Mrs Prudham claims that, despite returning two months later, his leaving became a pattern and he would become distant and absent every six months. She said: ‘I’d spend night after night wondering whose bed he was in. I felt so worthless that by the time he begged to come back, I actually felt grateful.’ Mrs Prudham said she gave birth to the twin girls in August by emergency caesarean while her husband was ‘hundreds of miles away’. She said the couple were soon reunited and agreed to have no more children. He even had a vasectomy. But, only days after the procedure, Mrs Prudham found out she was expecting a girl. She announced the news on Facebook last week, but claims she then found ‘incriminating messages’ on her husband’s phone, to a woman he had never met, which she says was the final straw. Mrs Prudham, who works part-time as a carer, posted this image to Facebook last week, announcing she was again pregnant with another girl . The couple both work 20 hours a week as carers for the elderly. She is able to claim around £30,000 of tax credits and benefits a year on top of this. Mrs Prudham was previously criticised for saying that their benefits allowed to them to set aside thousands for foreign holidays and presents for their children. The family were then photographed enjoying a two-week holiday in Menorca. When asked about his wife’s claims, Mr Prudham called her a liar, then admitted he had cheated while the couple were ‘on a break’ from each other. He also alleged she was pregnant with someone else’s baby, a claim she strongly denies.","Cheryl Prudham, 32, announced last week she was expecting another girl .

"The eyes of a turkey are not the most obvious place to look for sadness, empathy and pride. But these moving images show the dignified twilights of farm animals who made it through most of their natural lifespan to reach old age. The selection of images, showing animals as young as five and as old as 33, were taken taken by photographer Isa Leshko, and often involved spending hours with the animals before they would be comfortable enough with her to pose for the photographs. Her project, which was also compiled into a video, was dreamed up as a way to cope with the deaths of her grandmother and mother, who both suffered from dementia. She said: 'I am creating these photographs in order to take an unflinching look at aging and mortality. ... Photographing geriatric animals enables me to immerse myself in my fear of growing old. I have come to realize that these images are self-portraits. 'Or at the very least, they are manifestations of my fears and hopes about what I will be like when I am old.' Scroll down for video .

"A missing dog whose owner hired a £750 helicopter to look for her has been found drowned a few miles from where she disappeared. Sylvia, a Japanese Shiba Inu, was discovered in the sea at Anglesey, north Wales, a week after going missing. Owner Janice Bannister had scoured the island for up to 12 hours a day since Sylvia went missing. Scroll down for video . Owner Janice Bannister, pictured right, had scoured the island in north Wales for up to 12 hours a day since Sylvia, left, disappeared a week ago . More than 40 volunteers turned up to help search Mrs Bannister, from Telford, Shropshire, for her beloved pet . People from all over the UK joined her on Saturday to look for Sylvia after her story attracted attention thanks to a Facebook campaign. Mrs Bannister, of Telford, Shropshire, said she was devastated but wished to thank all those who had helped her. A group set up on Facebook called Lost Dog Sylvia attracted more than 700 members all trying to help. And thanks to the generosity of locals, she had been staying in Anglesey during the search and was even offered a caravan to stay in whilst she looked for her dog. Mrs Bannister even hired a £750-per hour helicopter to help her search for her Japanese Shiba Inu . Sylvia bolted while walking on sand dunes at Newborough Warren, Anglesey, last week . The dog was found drowned in the Menai Straits not far from Newborough where she went missing. Locals feared the dog may have tried to swim off the island to get home after losing her owner. Mrs Bannister cycled around the island in a desperate attempt to find her beloved pet - and even hired a private helicopter to scour the largest expanse of sand dunes in Europe. She had also been leaving food at the Newborough beach car park in the hope Sylvia would come and eat but with no luck.

"There is every chance that most people will hate it, but this Easter will see the launch of a Marmite chocolate egg. The egg is being launched alongside an equally unlikely Pot Noodle version by food giant Unilever, which argues they will ‘broaden the appeal of Easter’. The idea of mixing the savoury and salty taste of Marmite with the sweetness of chocolate is not the first flavour combination that would spring to mind – even for the likes of chemistry set chefs like Heston Blumenthal. Scroll down for video . Love it or hate it? Marmite and Pot Noodle are both bringing out chocolate Easter eggs this year . However, it does have a beefy taste and there are a number of recipes where bitter dark chocolate is used to add a depth of flavour to chilli, stews and casserole. The sticky dark brown paste has been a staple of the British diet since it was first produced in Burton-on-Trent, Staffs, in 1902. But while it has survived a long time, it triggers very strong feelings of love and loathing. While a distinctly British product, the name came from the French word to describe a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot. It was originally made from yeast supplied by the Bass brewery and became so popular that a second factory was opened in Camberwell Green, London, in 1907. In the early 1900s it was revered as a health food because it is rich in B vitamins and was issued to British troops in World War I as part of their rations to stave off conditions such as beriberi, which left them feeling weak and sick. Bosses at Unilever hope they will not be left with egg on their face after the Marmite Easter treat's release . Today, it is the nation’s second best-selling spread behind Rowse honey, which took the top spot in 2013. Unilever has formed a partnership with the confectionary firm Kinnerton to deliver the chocolate egg which carries hints of Marmite and is promoted under the slogan ‘love it or hate it’. The firm’s UK head of licensing Julie McCleave said: ‘Building on the success of our first ever Easter egg launch last year with iconic ice cream brands Magnum, Cornetto and Mini Milk, we wanted to bring something new to the Easter egg market once again for 2015. ‘By broadening the appeal of the Easter egg fixture, we anticipate that the new additions will drive sales for retailers by offering an exciting new product from brands that consumers know and love.’ The firm is hoping to tap into a growing Easter egg market that is now worth £365million in the UK every single year. The product will sit on the shelves next to a specially created Pot Noodle Easter egg, news that is set to delight chocolate loving students up and down the country. Marmite will be launched in a shell egg format, which saw an 18 per cent annual growth last year, and Pot Noodle will launch in mug and egg format, which has seen growth of 13 per cent. Competitors: The Pot Noodle and Marmite eggs face egg-cellent competition from Cadbury's, Nestle and Lindt . One manufacturer, Kimm & Miller, has been selling a Marmite flavoured milk chocolate bar, which contains two per cent of the spread, for five years. It has received some positive reviews as ‘suprisingly nice’ and a rating of 4.2 out of five on Amazon, however some complained that the Marmite taste was not powerful enough. Kinnerton’s Rachel Wyatt said: ‘Easter isn’t just for kids. We want to bring fun to Easter fixtures by using these two iconic brands. ‘The Marmite Easter egg, which shoppers will either love or hate, combines Marmite with chocolate.’ The two eggs, which go on sale in February, will each cost £5.","Marmite and Pot Noodle are both launching chocolate Easter eggs .

"The Ministry of Justice forked out more than £2,500 for the funeral of child killer Raymond Morris, who died in prison last year, aged 84 . A paedophile killer was given a taxpayer-funded funeral costing more than £2,500, which included a bunch of flowers from the prison where he died. Raymond Leslie Morris, dubbed the Monster of Cannock Chase, spent 45 years in jail after raping and murdering a seven-year-old girl. He was also suspected of strangling two other children. It has now emerged that the Ministry of Justice - which is advised to pay a 'reasonable' contribution for the funerals of those who die in prison - spent £2,686 on his send-off, including £15 on a floral tribute. The other costs included £1,165 on the registration of his death, £285 on the coffin, £185 on hearse and a cremation fee of £751. The 84-year-old paedophile was jailed in February 1969 after snatching schoolgirl Christine Darby off a street two years earlier and strangling her to death. The notorious killer was also prime suspect in the murders of five-year-old Diane Tift and six-year-old Margaret Reynolds, both of whom disappeared in 1965. The bodies of all three girls - who had also been sexually assaulted and strangled - were dumped within a few miles of each other beside the A34 on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire. Maureen Freeman, a retired police officer who spent 18 months tracking down the child killer, said she was horrified that taxpayers' money was used to pay for Morris's funeral. She said: 'Taxpayers' money should not be spent in this way on that particular prisoner, especially buying flowers for him. 'I'm sure the families of his victims would be disgusted. Cannock Chase will never forget what he did.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said added that the MoJ should only pay 'the bare minimum'. He said: 'In circumstances like these, the prison service should do nothing more than the bare minimum required of them by law. Morris was convicted of the murder of Christine Darby, seven (left) and was the prime suspect in the murders of Margaret Reynolds, six, (centre) and Diane Tift (right) whose bodies were all found near the same spot . Morris, 84, died in HMP Preston (pictured) after being diagnosed with leukemia. The prison paid £15 for a floral tribute at his service . 'Using taxpayers' money to do anything above and beyond that is little more than an insult to the families involved, and to the people of Cannock Chase.' Under the Prison Service Instruction 64/2011 directive, prisons are advised to offer a contribution towards 'reasonable funeral expenses' of up to £3,000. The MoJ said it considers these 'reasonable costs' to include funeral director's fees, a hearse, a coffin, cremation and burial fees and ministers fees. A wreath can also be included on behalf of the prison, but not on behalf of the prisoner's family. The news of Christine's death as it was reported on the front page of the Daily Mail in 1967 . His alibi fell apart when his wife Carol revoked her statement that they had been shopping together . In contrast, a so-called paupers' funeral - known as a Public Health Funeral by its proper name - can cost the Government as little as £100. These funerals usually take place when a person does not have family or friends to arrange the funeral. Local councils have a duty under public health law to dispose of bodies where no one else takes responsibility but can claim back the costs from the deceased's estate. These services are very simple and usually involve being transported by a van - rather than a hearse - and being buried in a communal grave, depending on what is available locally. The convicted killer being hidden from public view as he was taken to Cannock Police Station in 1967 . Raymond Morris's crime sparked one of the biggest manhunts in British history. The three girls were all found near the A34, Staffordshire (pictured) Although the cost can vary from as little as £100 to £3,000, the average cost is around £1,000 - around a third of the maximum grant for a prisoner's funeral. If a prisoner dies in custody in England and Wales, the governor or director of the prison in which the death occurred is able to offer a financial contribution to cover reasonable expenses for a basic funeral. Under the directive Prison Service Instruction 64/2011, the prison is advised to pay a contribution towards 'reasonable funeral expenses' of up to £3,000. The maximum grant is around three times the average amount paid out by the state for a so-called pauper burial. The only exceptions are where a prisoner's family have a pre-paid funeral plan or are entitled to claim a grant from other government departments, for example the Department of Work and Pensions. The MoJ said it considers 'reasonable funeral costs' to include: funeral director's fees; a hearse; a simple coffin; cremation and burial fees (which does not include the cost of the burial plot) and ministers fees. These costs do not include a headstone, embalming for viewing the deceased, clothes for the deceased and mourners, a wake, obituary notices or an order of service. A wreath or floral tribute may be purchased on behalf of the prison, but the prison should not pay for flowers from the family. Separately, benefit dependent families can apply to a Government fund known as Funeral Payments to assist with the cost. And another another provision, local councils have a duty under public health law to dispose of bodies where no one else takes responsibility. Officially known as a Public Health Funeral - but still widely known as paupers’ funerals or welfare funerals - the deceased is given a simple service before being cremated or buried in a communal grave which could have been reused up to three or four times, depending on what is available locally. Often the body is transported in a van rather than a hearse while the service is conducted in a vacant slot, such as early in the morning, at a local crematorium or cemetery chapel. A study conducted by the Local Government Association in 2011 estimated that there are around 2,900 such services a year. The cost of paupers' funerals can vary from around £100 to up to £3,000, depending on the local authority. A spokesman for the Ministry Of Justice said it considered the single floral tribute at Morris's service as a 'reasonable cost' in the funeral arrangement. The spokesman added: 'If a prisoner dies in custody in England and Wales the governor or director of the prison in which the death occurred is able to offer a financial contribution to cover reasonable expenses for a basic funeral. 'Prison Service Instruction 64/2011 advises that prisons must offer to pay a contribution towards reasonable funeral expenses of up to £3,000. This is considered to be moral and decent in the circumstances. 'The only exceptions are where a prisoner's family have a pre-paid funeral plan or are entitled to claim a grant from other government departments, for example the Department of Work and Pensions. 'The Funeral Directors responsible for Mr Morris's funeral have confirmed that embalming is standard practice at their business in order to preserve the body should anybody wish to view it at any stage. 'A wreath or floral tribute may be purchased on behalf of the prison, but the prison should not pay for flowers from the family.' 'Taxpayers' money should not - and in future will not - be spent on flowers for offenders who die in prison.' At the time, the killings of the three young children sparked one of the biggest murder investigations in British criminal history. The former engineer, from Walsall, West Midlands, then spent 45 years in prison before his death on May 11, 2014. He had been treated for leukaemia at HMP Preston in Lancashire after being diagnosed with the condition three years earlier. But on March 1, 2014, Morris signed a disclaimer refusing active medical treatment. On March 10, he was transferred to the prison's medical unit and he died the following day. Morris made a final bid for freedom in June 2012 when he instructed a solicitor to make an application for release on compassionate grounds, however the papers were never filed. Just last week, more than 1,000 people attended the funeral of an RAF veteran who died without any family or friends. RAFA, The Royal Air Forces Association, had appealed for strangers to attend the funeral of Keith Ingham Nutbrown, after believing that no-one would attend. The 83-year-old, who died at a care home in Llandudno, North Wales, was given a 'heroic send-off', including a full military guard of honour. Had the money not been raised by the charity, it is likely Mr Nutbrown would have been given a 'pauper's funeral'. Morris initially convinced his wife Carol to give him an alibi for the day Christine Darby had been murdered . September 8, 1965: Six-year-old Margaret Reynolds goes missing on her way to school in Aston, Birmingham. December 30: Five-year-old Diane Tift goes missing on her way to her grandmother's house in Bloxwich, West Midlands. January 12, 1966: The bodies of Margaret Reynolds and Diane Tift are found at Cannock Chase. August 14: 10-year-old Jane Taylor disappears near Cannock Chase and is never seen again.

"Seeing your friends and families often won't make you live longer, a new study has found. Researchers, from McGill University in Canada, examined ideas that social contact, or a lack thereof, is linked to mortality. The study examined the strength of family ties and challenged long-held ideas that frequent social contact is linked to better health and longevity. Spending time with your family could lower your chances of living longer, a study suggests. Pictured, television's The Royle Family . It explored the effect of various social stressors - using data from more than 100,000 people from across the world - and found a close-knit family has little effect on your lifespan. And it found repeated contact with friends was more beneficial than with relatives - improving the chances of a longer life by around 7%. But spending time with family members is actually worse for your mortality, as they can add stress to your life. Dr Eran Shor, who led the study, told the Independent: 'Our findings show a minimal effect of social contact frequency on mortality and call into question interventions and clinical advice that simply seek to increase one’s social contact frequency' Researchers at McGill said that while the majority of existing studies reported a positive link between increased contact and longevity, their own study found only a very moderate effect when considering other variables, including age and scoioeconomic status. But repeated contact with friends was found to be more beneficial than with relatives - improving the chances of a longer life by around 7%. Pictured, the cast of Friends . He added: 'Simply associating with others may not be enough to provide emotional comfort or instrumental assistance or to push an individual to adopt a healthier lifestyle, resulting in greater longevity. 'One may have frequent social contact with others, but still feel lonely, especially if these contacts are perceived as superficial and unsatisfying.' Earlier studies found links between relationships and better health - including a study in the US which concluded those who feel lonely are almost twice as likely to die prematurely. Recently, a US study found that friends know our personality so well, they could accurately predict whether we’ll die young or live to a ripe old age. Researchers at Washington University in St Louis made the discovery after analysing data from a study that tracked 300 young couples from their 20s to their deaths. At the beginning of the experiment, the couples and their best friends had to answer the same questions about the couples’ personalities. Recently, the replies were compared with how old the subjects were when they died. It was found that the friends’ impressions were a better predictor of someone’s lifespan than their own assessment. Dr Eran Shor, who led the study, said the findings show 'a minimal effect' of social contact frequency on mortality .","Researchers from McGill University in Canada examined idea that social contact is linked to mortality .

"Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green has put struggling high street store BHS up for sale after a sales dip and pre-tax loss of £69.9million. The billionaire businessman's decision to put the retail chain, with more than 185 stores, up for auction, signals the break-up of one of Britain's best-known high street empires. It comes after the 62-year-old received several serious approaches in the past few months, senior city sources told the Sunday Times. Scroll down for video . Sir Philip Green has put struggling high street store BHS up for sale, pictured (l-r) with Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell . BHS has been a central part of Sir Philip's empire, which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge and Wallis, since he bought the chain for £200million in 2000. Sales at BHS dipped 3.5 per cent to £675.7million in 2013 and it made a pre-tax loss of £69.6million, according to accounts at Companies House. Sir Philip brushed off a fall in annual profits at his retail empire in November last year, saying he could be 'a buyer or a seller' of high street chains due to the strength of his group's balance sheet. Pre-tax profits for Taveta Investments, the group which includes Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Burton and BHS, fell 3.4 per cent to £189.3m in the year to 30 August 2014. Sales at BHS dipped 3.5 per cent to £675.7million in 2013 and it made a pre-tax loss of £69.6million . Despite a near 1 per cent rise in sales to £2.7billion Bhs slid further into the red. The group also did not pay out a dividend for the ninth year in a row. Sir Philip has rejected previous offers for BHS on price grounds. But, for the first time he is understood to have received a handful of bids that match his expectations. The chain has attracted interest from rivals such as Primark, and late in 2013 it was briefly targeted by the South African billionaire Christo Wiese. American hedge fund Apollo and the turnaround firm Hilco, which took over HMV, are also believed to have looked at it. BHS has 150 stores with permission to sell food and one approach is believed to have come from a grocery retailer. The billionaire businessman's decision signals the break-up of one of Britain's best-known high street empires, pictured on the front row with Anna Wintour (far left), Kate Moss and Lottie Moss . Sir Philip bought BHS - then known as British Home Stores - in 2000 from the Storehouse conglomerate. The businessman made his first billion at the company by turning around the chain, a process he described as 'torture'. He later bought Arcadia, amassing more than 2,000 shops nationwide, and famously paid his wife a £1.2bn dividend in 2005. Sir Philip has increasingly focused on Topshop, which he has taken to America and Asia after selling a minority stake to the private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners two years ago. In 2014 three new standalone Topshop stores opened in the US, including a new flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. Topshop now has seven wholly-owned stores in the US, as well as 52 concessions in Nordstrom department stores. Sir Philip was no available for a comment when contacted. Sir Philip's most ambitious move came in 2004, when he put together £10billion to take over M&S . Sir Philip Green was born on 15 March 1952 in Croydon, south London, the son of a successful Jewish property developer and retailer. He then went on to learn the raw facts of business as an apprentice in a shoe warehouse and at 23-years-old he set up his own business importing and selling jeans. The moment Sir Philip Green finally 'arrived' was when he bought British Home Stores chain for £200million in 2000 and rebranded it BHS. Two years later he copied the same buyout model when he bought the giant retail empire Arcadia, which owns brands such as Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Topshop and Topman. Sir Philip's most ambitious move came in 2004, when he put together £10billion, much of it from investment banks, to take over Marks and Spencer. He has also forged a business partnership with supermodel Kate Moss, whose line of clothes helped raise Topshop's profile in the world of high fashion. The businessman commutes into London from Monaco in a private jet and is famous for throwing extravagant parties for friends including Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, and George Michael.","Sir Philip Green has put struggling high street store BHS up for auction .

"Former drug smuggler Howard Marks – once known as Mr Nice – has revealed he has inoperable bowel cancer. The 69-year-old, who spent seven years in a US prison, was diagnosed in autumn last year but said he has now ‘come to terms with it’. And after selling more than a million copies of his memoir, published in 1996, and being captured on screen by actor Rhys Ifans, Mr Marks says he has no regrets. Scroll down for video . Former drug smuggler turned bestselling author Howard Marks has revealed he has inoperable bowel cancer . The 69-year-old, pictured in 2013, who spent seven years in a US prison, was diagnosed in autumn last year . ‘I’ve come to terms with it in my own way – which for me was about learning how to cry,’ he told the Observer. ‘It’s impossible to regret any part of my life when I feel happy and I am happy now, so I don’t have any regrets and have not had any for a very long time.’ He added he feels privileged to have lived an ‘incredible’ life, which allowed him to spend time with ‘musicians, DJs and other lovers of dope’. The author said he has received messages of support from his vast range of celebrity friends, including Sir Richard Branson and artist Tracey Emin. And next month, friends – including Mr Ifans – will be holding a concert in north London in his honour. The concert, at the Kentish Town Forum on February 27, will feature Welsh band Super Furry Animals. Fellow Welshman and friend Rhys Ifans, pictured, played Howard Marks in 1996 movie Mr Nice and is taking part in the celebratory concert next month . Funds raised will go towards Mr Marks’ cancer treatment, help set up a charitable foundation and the completion of a documentary about his unusual life. Mr Marks was diagnosed with cancer last year and doctors told him there was nothing they could do – and the disease has now spread to his liver and lungs. The Observer reported he has completed eight cycles of chemotherapy and responded well to the treatment. Mr Marks, who has four children, is being cared for by his long-term partner Caroline Brown. Now, his aim is to continue his battle for the legalisation of marijuana. ‘Of course the legalising of marijuana for medical purposes is to be welcomed, but personally I never wanted to have to wait until I had cancer before I could legally smoke.’ Howard Marks promoting his bestselling confessional memoir Mr Nice, at Waterstones in Oxford in 2012 . Born in 1945 in Kenfig Hill, south Wales, Howard Marks' father was in the merchant navy and his mother was a teacher. After attending grammar school, he read physics at Oxford - which is where he became involved with drugs. As a drug smuggler in the 1980s, he had 43 aliases, 89 phone lines and 25 companies trading worldwide as fronts for money laundering. In 1980, he married Judy Marks but split in 2003 and divorced in 2005. He was given a  25-year sentence for drug smuggling in America, but was released in 1995 after serving seven years. In 1996, his memoir Mr Nice, sold more than a million copies and was made into a film starring his friend and fellow Welshman Rhys Ifans. He became a festival regular and gave talks around the country, as well as campaigning for the legalisation of cannabis. In 1996, Super Furry Animals released a song called Hanging With Howard Marks. He has a long-term partner called Caroline Brown and four children.","Diagnosis was in autumn last year but he has now ‘come to terms with it’

"Comedian Frankie Boyle's comeback show has reportedly been axed by the BBC over a tasteless joke about the IRA murder of Lord Mountbatten. The controversial comic had been lined up to to appear in a Blocked, a radio comedy on BBC Radio 4, starring fellow comedian David Mitchell. It told the story of a frustrated writer-turned theatre boss who is wrongly accused of the murder of Lord Mountbatten. Scroll down for video . Controversial comic Frankie Boyle, pictured, whose comeback show on the BBC has reportedly been axed over a tasteless joke about the murder of Lord Mountbatten . Lord Mountbatten, pictured, the Queen's cousin, died in 1979 after the IRA hid a bomb on his fishing boat, killing him and three others . The radio comedy would have marked a comeback for Boyle, who quit the BBC show Mock the Week five years ago, and had a segment from Comic Relief in 2013 axed. But it is thought that after BBC executives found the pilot show included jokes about the death of Lord Mountbatten, the Queen's cousin, who died when the IRA hid a bomb on his fishing boat in 1979, the show was scrapped. Mr Boyle, 42, told the Sunday Mirror: 'They didn't commission it because we made a joke about the assassination of Lord Mountbatten.' A BBC insider added that the show was deemed 'too risky' and 'controversial'. Boyle (far right) made his name on panel show Mock the Week, but quit the programme in 2009 claiming he was bored . Boyle last appeared on the BBC in 2009, when he left satirical panel game claiming he was ‘bored’. He caused uproar during his stint at the corporation when viewers complained a joke about the Queen was ‘sexist’ and ‘ageist’, but the BBC Trust decided he had not breached its guidelines and he was not fired. Frankie Boyle has become known for his controversial style of humour after appearing on popular panel shows including Mock the Week and Have I Got News For You. In 2008, the BBC received complaints after he made a joke regarding the appearance of Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington, with the corporation admitting the jokes were humiliating. Months later he also courted controversy after making a tasteless joke about the Queen, which was deemed 'sexist' and 'ageist'. Two years later both Katie Price and Peter Andre said they were disgusted and sickened after he made jokes about Miss Price's disable son Harvey. Then in 2012, he was axed from a BBC Comic Relief broadcast after saying he hoped the Queen had died before her Diamond Jubilee. In 2013, BBC bosses were forced to axe Boyle from a Comic Relief broadcast after he said he wished the Queen had died before the Diamond Jubilee. He has also attracted criticism for making controversial jokes about Katie Price's disabled son and the appearance of Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington. Meanwhile Channel 4's Head of Comedy Phil Clarke claimed the Glaswegian would not be returning to the channel in an interview last year. But Mr Boyle hit back at TV producers while appearing on stage at the Edinburgh Festival in August. He claimed: 'There's a layer of people whose job it is to kind of reject things that are interesting. And the trouble is, that layer is at the top.' He added that current TV guides look like 'the entertainment programme on a f****** cruise ship'. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'We commission pilots to help us decide which ideas should become series. 'A relatively small number make it to series, and on this occasion Blocked is not one of them.'","The comedian was set to make his comeback in a BBC Radio 4 comedy .

"Kieran Gibbs believes that Arsenal's 2-0 victory at Manchester City will have helped to silence some of their critics. A Santi Cazorla penalty and a header from Giroud stunned the champions and gave Gibbs reasons to be cheerful about the rest of the season. Writing in his Sportlobster blog, the defender said: 'I think the win on Sunday has proved a lot of people wrong and we also proved to ourselves that we can have a big say in the Premier League this season. 'It was a clinical game from us and it's the kind of result you get when everyone on the pitch is in sync.' Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs (right) says beating Manchester City will have 'proved people wrong' In recent years, Arsenal have had a poor record against other top-four sides, with Sunday's result their first league win over City since 2012. And Gibbs believes the win can serve as a catalyst. 'It was a long time coming,' he said. 'We needed a result like that against a top-four team away from home, not only to give the team a boost but also to prove to ourselves we can get results at places like the Etihad.'

"Liverpool have an interest in Karim Benzema and Isco at Real Madrid but won't upset the harmony of the squad to bring them in. Brendan Rodgers is signing Loic Remy and Dejan Lovren, while Divock Origi will return to Lille on loan. Benzema is close to agreeing terms on a new contract and Madrid are keen to bring in another striker as cove, with Alvaro Morata having joined Juventus. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Karim Benzema playing keep-ups with his shoulder . Wanted man: Liverpool are considering a move to bring Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema to Anfield . Benzema would cost £40million and wages of around £200,000 a week. It would give Liverpool the star quality they have lost with Luis Suarez's departure but is not a simple deal. Isco will be pushed further down the pecking order with the arrival of James Rodriguez but so far he wants to stay at Madrid. A loan could be feasible as the window draws to a close. Madrid, meanwhile, are discussing the possibility of Angel di Maria joining Paris Saint-Germain on loan with £47.5m following next summer to suit FFP regulations. On the move: Read midfielder Angel di Maria could join PSG on loan ahead of a permanent move next summer . Tiago Mendes was expected to be joining Chelsea on a free transfer from Atletico but he is now considering the option of joining Valencia instead. It is understood the deal has been complicated by his agent Jorge Mendes still holding a share of the player's economic rights. That compromises third party ownership legislation in this country and negotiations have stalled. Mendes has interest in Valencia and Tiago has an offer from them while Atletico have also made the 33-year-old a renewed offer of a one year contract worth £2m a year.

Barcelona midfielder Xavi is poised to announce his decision to join New York City this week. Following months of uncertainty over the Spanish star’s future, the Barca icon has decided to follow David Villa and Frank Lampard to the Manchester City-owned franchise.

Blanco is in his native Argentina while his team-mates are on a pre-season training camp in Austria but he is refusing to go back to the Ukraine following the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Six South American Shakhtar Donetsk players have also refused to go back to Ukraine. And Blanco told Argentinian paper Ole that he has no intention of returning to Kharkiv. Controversy: Leicester are keen on Sebastian Blanco, who is refusing to return to Ukraine with Metalist Kharkiv . Blanco said: 'With what happened I did not feel like returning to Ukraine. These are not normal times. My decision is to stay in Buenos Aires. I will not return to Ukraine.' Kharkiv is just 50km from the Russian border in the west of Ukraine where tensions are rising. Leicester were interested in Blanco earlier this summer and although they have moved on with some signings, notably the £7.5m deal for Leonardo Ulloa, they recognise the 26-year-old attacking midfielder could be available for a knockdown price of £2m. On the move: Leonardo Ulloa is close to completing his move from Brighton to newly promoted Leicester . Meanwhile, Watford are understood to have offered £1.2m for Leicester's Wales midfielder Andy King. Watford are bracing themselves for further bids for Troy Deeney with QPR in the running as well as Burnley and Swansea. A number of Championship clubs are weighing up a loan move for Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker. The 19-year-old had a hand in all three goals during their 3-2 win over AFC Wimbledon on Saturday. Former Leeds United recruitment director Luke Dowling and ex-Chelsea assistant manager Ray Wilkins were in the stands among others scouting for prospective signings and Baker was one of the Blues' best performers. Bright future: Bolton and Birmingham are among the clubs keen on Chelsea youngster Lewis Baker (left) He has been at the club since the age of nine and maintained steady progress, captaining the U21s and making his debut in the FA Cup against Derby last season. Competition is such in midfield that a loan may be his best route to the next stage of his development. Middlesbrough, Bolton and Birmingham are among those who are keen.

"I was never one for going up to a player and asking for their shirt, though I did quite a few swaps. The most famous shirts I have are probably from some of the great Arsenal players I played alongside. I kept England shirts and some precious Arsenal ones, but when you have kids they will often ask you to swap with somebody so I’ve got quite a few others. Sami Hyypia asked for mine after the FA Cup final in 2001. We had been winning 1-0 but then Michael Owen scored two to win it for Liverpool. Sportsmail's Martin Keown challenges for the ball with Emile Heskey in the 2001 FA Cup final with Liverpool . When Sami asked me I couldn’t care less because the last thing I wanted to keep was a shirt from that final! The trouble is his shirt now appears from a random box every now and then and every time it brings back all those bad memories. I remember seeing Leicester players queueing up before a game to ask for Dennis Bergkamp’s shirt. As soon as that happened we knew we had them beaten. With Thierry Henry so many asked for his shirt that the club threatened to start making him pay for ones he gave away! I can’t imagine why somebody wouldn’t want my shirt over Thierry’s... Thierry Henry swaps shirts with DaMarcus Beasley in 2004 and (right) Shaun Wright-Phillips, then of Chelsea . While it’s one thing swapping shirts after a game, it’s another doing it at half-time. That’s inappropriate, especially when you’re losing. When you’re 3-0 down, it looks like you’re giving up. It was probably deliberate from Real Madrid, trying to defuse Mario. But you shouldn’t be interacting with the opposition — you’re not out to make friends. There is a lot wrong with Liverpool at the moment and you have to take collective responsibility for that. Nobody should hide behind Mario Balotelli.

"Hill ponies are being shot with contraceptive darts to stop them overbreeding on Dartmoor in a battle to save their existence. Conservationist Charlotte Faulkner has been roaming moorland in the Devon national park firing doses into the hides of mares using a gas powered rifle. The unusual move to dose 300 of the ponies is the latest attempt to control growing numbers. Ms Faulkner, founder of the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association, is quick to point out that all owners must give permission and the horses hardly feel a thing. Hill ponies are being shot with contraceptive darts to stop them overbreeding on Dartmoor . The unusual move to dose 300 of the ponies is the latest attempt to control growing numbers . 'They just bounce forward and carry on eating, as if they had just had a bee sting,' she told the Exeter Express and Echo. 'Everything is about making it the very best as we can do it and it seems to be working very well. 'At the moment there is a problem – we need the ponies to look after the habitat but the by-product of that is foals – we need the stallion to keep the mares in the right place and this is the end result. 'We now have about 100 on this drug but we won't know the final result of the trial until May.' Each gas-fired dart contains a dose of the drug Improvac, a much cheaper and longer-lasting way to prevent mares becoming pregnant than the old system of injections. Conservationist Charlotte Faulkner (pictured) has been roaming moorland in the Devon national park firing doses into the hides of mares using a gas powered rifle . 'The gun has been brought over from America and uses an infra-red beam to judge the distance so you don't overshoot or hit them too powerfully – their welfare has been really carefully worked out.' Once the pony has been dosed a sharp-eyed assistant needs to retrieve the tiny dart. Ms Faulkner has previously spoken out in favour of eating ponies to save their species, saying a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home. 'Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales,' she wrote in a letter to South West Equine Protection (SWEP), . The numbers of hill ponies have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today . The native ponies – not to be confused with their pure-bred Dartmoor cousins – are an essential part of the ecology of the national park by keeping the gorse on the moorland under control. But their numbers have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to around 1,000 today. With ponies selling for as little as £10 at auction, they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation. In 2013 it emerged that unwanted Dartmoor ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos and their hides were being crafted into 'wild pony' drums. Ms Faulkner said she believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a 'sustainable market' for them. The tails of the ponies shot with contraceptive darts are trimmed back to mark them out in the autumn. The initiative has been backed by Exmoor Pony Society and the Exmoor National Park Authority.","Hill ponies are being shot with contraceptive darts on Dartmoor .

"West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis is continuing his search for strikers after going cool on a couple of early targets. Pulis watched Rudy Gestede of Blackburn on Sunday but the 26-year-old Benin international failed to impress as his side lost to Wolves. Albion have asked about Rickie Lambert but Liverpool will not loan him out and would only sell for the money they paid Southampton for him in the summer. Lambert himself wants to fight for his place. West Brom have asked about Rickie Lambert but Liverpool are not willing to loan the England international out . Baggies boss Tony Pulis has no interest in bringing Leicester's Jamie Vardy to West Bromwich Albion . Pulis will not pursue interest in Jamie Vardy of Leicester while any possibility of a move for Demba Ba would stall over his wages. The 29-year-old, who Pulis tried to sign for Stoke City from Hoffenheim, is on around £130,000 a week before tax in Turkey with Besiktas and Albion don't have that kind of budget to play with. Pulis is also reluctant to go back to Stoke to try and sign players although he does admire Jon Walters, Robert Huth and Marc Wilson. The Albion manager may be forced to continue without assistant Paul Jewell as the 50-year-old is understood to be considering his role at The Hawthorns just a week after joining the backroom staff. Manchester City are ready to rebuff Juventus interest in Stevan Jovetic. The Italian side want Jovetic on loan but City would like the 25-year-old to stay as part of the squad chasing domestic and European titles. A deal could be revisited in the summer when City will fine tune their squad again and look to add a different striker. Juventus have also asked about taking Paulinho on loan from Tottenham but the White Hart Lane club are reluctant to loan also. Manchester City are set to rebuff a bid from Sampdoria for Stevan Jovetic, pictured in action against Everton . Meanwhile, Anderlecht midfielder Denis Praet, who has been monitored by Manchester City says he would be reluctant to move to the Premier League champions. The 19-year-old Belgium international said: 'I think for my development it would be best if I switch to a middle-class club in a bigger league. Should I go to a club in Manchester, I would not have good prospects.' Wigan striker Shaun Maloney has attracted bids from Celtic and Leicester City this window but Chicago Fire are continuing to press for his signature. The MLS side believe Maloney, 31, can be a big hit in the USA and the Scotland international is impressed by the league's growing profile. Everton have also made tentative enquiries for Maloney, who joined Wigan from Celtic for £850,000 in 2011. Leicester had a £750,000 bid rejected earlier this month. Shaun Maloney - pictured celebrating for Scotland against Ireland - attracted bids from Celtic and Leicester . Owen Coyle iis keen for Huddersfield Town forward Martin Paterson to join him in the MLS with Houston Dynamo. Northern Ireland international Paterson, 27, played for Coyle at Burnley and was instrumental in their promotion season. He struggled with injuries and moved to Huddersfield where he has had loan spells with Bristol City and Fleetwood but with little success. Linking up with Coyle again for a new challenge appeals and he is ready to cross the Atlantic. Sampdoria held further meetings with Samuel Eto'o's representative Claudio Vigorelli on Monday evening. The Italians remain interested in the 33-year-old Everton striker but the parties are some distance apart on the player's current wages. They have proposed a two-year deal with the option of a third. Everton maintain they have yet to receive an enquiry from Sampdoria but it seems the Italians are working out if they can afford him before making an official bid. Samuel Eto'o poses with a fan outside Goodison Park, but his days as an Everton player could be numbered . Aston Villa will not be able to sign Adnan Januzaj on loan from Manchester United while they have Tom Cleverley. Under Premier League rules clubs cannot have two players on loan from the same club. United have been trying to reach agreement with Villa over a permanent deal for Cleverley but the player is reluctant to commit at this stage and is free in the summer. Everton have always maintained an interest in the 25-year-old. Aston Villa will note be able to take Adnan Januzaj on loan because they already have Tom Cleverley . Southampton scouts were at Braga vs Sporting Lisbon on Sunday as they ran the rule over midfielder Rafa Silva. The 21-year-old, who can play on either wing or behind the strikers, has been on Southampton's radar for nearly a year. He has a £15m release clause but Braga would negotiate as they need the money. Rafa was part of Portugal's World Cup squad although he didn't play and has also attracted interest from Sevilla. Rafa Silva hurdles a sliding challenge from Paulo Oliveria. Southampton are interested in signing the midfielder . Tottenham are understood to have turned down the opening salvo from Besiktas for defender Younes Kaboul. The Frenchman is available if the right offer comes in and has also been discussed as a potential bargaining chip along with Aaron Lennon should Tottenham step up interest in Everton midfielder James McCarthy. As revealed by Sportsmail, Tottenham like the Everton midfielder, as do Arsenal, but Everton do not wish to sell. Tottenham are waiting for Leicester and Swansea to formalise bids for Kyle Naughton but otherwise are anticipating a quiet window. They are prepared to wait until summer to restructure their squad and at better value prices. Tottenham are understood to have turned down the opening salvo from Besiktas for Younes Kaboul (right) QPR are continuing to show interest in Inter Milan midfielder Yann M'Vila. Inter want QPR to take over their loan of the player from Rubin Kazan and that means QPR picking up 80 per cent of his wages. M'Vila has so far shown little inclination in moving to Loftus Road but has few better offers. QPR's budget is limited but Italian clubs are continuing to court Adel Taarabt and his wages could go towards incomings. Manager Harry Redknapp is still keen to add another forward if possible and has shown an interest in Standard Liege winger Paul-Jose M'Poku. The 22-year-old was at Tottenham as a teenager.

"Steven Gerrard is walking away from English football having never lifted the greatest domestic trophy – the Barclays Premier League – but he is not alone. There are a whole host of other great players who have graced the game in this country but never got their hands on the holy grail. Sportsmail has compiled an XI of the greatest players to have played in this country but not won the title since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Brad Friedel . Premier League clubs: Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa, Tottenham . Set the record for most consecutive appearances in the Premier League at 310 between August 2004 and October 2012. Consistently been one of the league's top stoppers, but spells at Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa and Spurs, in 17 years in the top flight – and still going at 43 – did not lead to the league title. Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Brad Friedel smiles during a match against Manchester City in 2012 . Jamie Carragher . Club: Liverpool . The defender shared Gerrard's pain, winning countless trophies together – including the Champions League, the UEFA Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, two FA Cups, three League Cups, and the Community Shield – but never the league title. During his 17 years at Liverpool, Carragher was one of the most consistently high performing defenders in the top flight. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher gestures during the Merseyside derby at Anfield in May 2013 . Marcel Desailly . PL club: Chelsea . One of the best centre backs in the world during his six years at Chelsea, but though he won the World Cup and European Cup with France during that time it did not work out as well in west London. Lifted the FA Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Charity Shield while at Stamford Bridge and countless other titles across Europe – including twice the Champions League. Chelsea's Marcel Desailly (right) puts in a challenge on Michael Owen during a match at Anfield in 1999 . Ledley King . Club: Tottenham . On raw ability King is up there with the best of them, but chronic knee problems held him back. Once described as a 'freak' by Harry Redknapp because he could not kick a ball in training and only play one game a week but still be the best player on the pitch at the heart of defence. Won the League Cup in 13 years at Spurs, but nothing else. Ledley King (left) has his eye on the ball during Spurs' match against Wolves at White Hart Lane in 2010 . Steven Gerrard . Club: Liverpool . He is perhaps the greatest player not to have won the Premier League, given that he has been at a club who have had the squad to win it for countless seasons he has been there but never quite made it. Last season was the closest he came, slipping up at the death – literally, against Chelsea – to allow Manchester City to pip them to it by two points. Steven Gerrard celebrates his goal for Liverpool against Leicester City in the Premier League last month . David Ginola . PL clubs: Newcastle, Tottenham, Aston Villa, Everton . The mercurial Frenchman was an integral part of the Newcastle side who, in the 1995-96 season, agonisingly threw away a 10-point lead in January to finish four points behind Manchester United. That was as close as he got, despite seven years in English football. Frenchman David Ginola (right) controls the ball during a match between Chelsea and Newcastle United . Matt Le Tissier . Club: Southampton . Le Tissier did not win a single trophy despite 16 years dazzling English football with his skills and goals at Southampton. Perhaps his devotion to the south coast club cost him a chance at winning cups, but it did not stop him being regarded as one of the country's great midfielders. Matt Le Tissier celebrates a goal for Southampton in a Premier League match against Aston Villa . Cesc Fabregas . PL club: Arsenal, Chelsea . Remarkably never won the Premier League with Arsenal. He played League Cup matches for the club during the 2003-04 season when they won the title, but did not break into the first team in the league until the following campaign, and they have not won it since. This could be his year, at rivals Chelsea. Cesc Fabregas celebrates after scoring from the penalty sport for Arsenal against West Ham in 2010 . Gareth Bale . PL club: Tottenham . You would not bet against the Real Madrid winger winning the Premier League one day, but he hasn't yet. When he left Spurs in that world record £86million deal he was without a trophy but he has since gone on to win four in his first 18 months in Spain. Gareth Bale celebrates a goal for Tottenham Hotspur against Sunderland at White Hart Lane in May 2013 . Gianfranco Zola . PL club: Chelsea . Won the Serie A title alongside Diego Maradona at Napoli and lit up the Premier League when he moved to England in 1996. Seven years at Chelsea produced some sparkling football and moments of magic from the mercurial Italian and six other trophies – but not the Premier League. Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola celebrates with the fans after scoring against Coventry at Stamford Bridge in 2000 . Robbie Fowler . PL clubs: Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester City . The player to hit the most goals in the Premier League without winning the title, sixth on the all-time list with 162. He was known for his instinctive finishing, but though it brought him many trophies at Liverpool, the league was not one of them.

"Brendan Rodgers has insisted labeling Steven Gerrard a 'legend' does not do the club captain justice after the midfielder decided to end his 26-year association with Liverpool. The 34-year-old joined Liverpool when he was eight and will leave when the current Barclays Premier League season ends after opting not to renew his contract at Anfield. Rodgers has worked with the former England captain since becoming manager in 2012, and emphasised summing up Gerrard's contribution at Liverpool is an 'impossible task'.

CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY . 'It is almost an impossible task to find the words to appropriately sum up Steven Gerrard and his importance to Liverpool,' Rodgers told the club's official website. 'This is an era where the word ""legend"" is vastly overused, but in his case it actually doesn't do him justice. 'From a personal point of view I will always have gratitude for the support he gave me, when I arrived here as manager. 'Steven came to see me and promised he would be 100 per cent behind me and do everything he could to help as we looked to introduce new ideas and a new way of working. He wasn't just true to his word, he vastly exceeded it.' Gerrard turned down the offer of a contract extension in November and became free to talk with overseas clubs on January 1. Major League Soccer outfits LA Galaxy and New York Red Bulls are among potential suitors after the Anfield icon insisted playing against Liverpool is something he will not tolerate. Jordan Henderson is expected to fill the captain's void in his absence, though Rodgers admits Gerrard will be difficult to replace. 'As a player he is immense and the influence he has on games should never be understated,' the Liverpool manager continued. 'At times he has carried this club on his back and in my time here he has always shown the ability that has rightly seen him be regarded as one of the world's best for well over a decade.

"The national day brought some un-Australian weather to some of the nation's biggest cities this morning. But a bit of drizzle in parts of Sydney and Melbourne wasn't going to stop committed partygoers from making the most of Australia Day. And other parts of the land of drought and flooding rains - namely Brisbane and Perth - were turning it on, resplendent in the sunshine. Thousands of punters braved the gloom in the Harbour City, some waving miniature flags and others huddling together under umbrellas on the foreshore. Around 1000 swimmers dived into the water near the Opera House wearing only their trunks and a determined grimace as part of the Great Australian Swim series. They might not have been joined by many private vessels this year, but swimmers certainly had company in the HMAS Canberra. One of the Navy's biggest vessels, it blasted an impressive 21-gun salute at midday and played host to a dampened choir of yellow schoolchildren, who sung 'I Am Australian'. RAAF jets roared across the Harbour shortly afterwards but they could scarcely be seen under the dense cloud cover.

"West Brom face a fight from three other Barclays Premier League clubs to sign winger Callum McManaman from Wigan, who also look set to lose their FA Cup final heroes Shaun Maloney and Ben Watson. Latics boss Malky Mackay confirmed the Sky Bet Championship club had turned down the Baggies' second offer for McManaman, 23, this week but they are not the only top-flight club showing interest in the ex-Everton trainee. Hull are another of the quartet of clubs tempted by a player Roy Hodgson said he considered for a senior England call-up in 2013. West Brom are just one of several clubs interested in signing midfielder Callum McMannaman from Wigan . Huyton-born McMannaman has made 87 appearances for Wigan since his debut in 2009, scoring 16 goals . 'The second bid has been rejected, that's where we are with that,' Mackay said of West Brom's latest approach. Asked about interest from former Latics manager and current Hull boss Steve Bruce, the Scot added: 'There's been no formal bid but there's been an enquiry. There's been an enquiry from a few clubs but I have great respect for Steve Bruce so I don't want to say any more than that.' Mackay later admitted there were four Premier League clubs keeping tabs on McManaman, who is expected to be in Wigan's squad to face Huddersfield on Saturday after serving a three-match suspension. McManaman shone in the 2013 FA Cup final against Manchester City and the two men who were involved in the goal which provided the most memorable moment in Wigan's entire history that day are set to depart. Wigan are set to sell Scotland international midfielder Shaun Maloney to MLS side Chicago Fire . The club have reached an agreement with MLS side Chicago Fire to send Scotland international Shaun Maloney to the United States, while Ben Watson has joined fellow Championship club Watford until the end of the season. It was Maloney's corner which Watson headed home in the 1-0 victory over Manchester City and the expected exits of those two players represents the end of an era for the club. 'We've agreed terms with Chicago Fire for Shaun to leave imminently,' said Mackay. 'That's going to be happen in the next day or so. 'There's a deal been struck as to why Shaun's not going to be waiting until the summer. Chicago and ourselves have come to an agreement that he can leave immediately. 'He's a terrific lad but he wants to further his career somewhere else now.' Speaking before Watson's move was confirmed, Mackay said: 'He's a terrific lad but he's out of contract at the end of the season. 'He's a London boy, his family will be moving back to that area and I've got to be realistic. He's been a terrific servant for this football club, obviously he scored the winning goal in a very historic game for this football club, so there's fond memories there, and for the last seven weeks he's been a joy to be around. 'He wants to play every week between now and the end of the season and with his lifestyle he wanted to get back down to London. I'm not going to stand in the boy's way when his mind is somewhere else.' Ben Watson, who scored the only goal in Wigan's 1-0 FA Cup final win in 2013, is now on loan at Watford .","West Brom are one of several clubs interested in Callum McManaman .

"Superglue can solve many DIY dilemmas but one man had to resort to using it to fix his teeth thanks to being fitted with dodgy veneers. Dean, 36, from Liverpool, needed to have veneers after he fell down the stairs at work and cracked his two front teeth. The health worker had to have two veneers . put on his front teeth but years later, it started to wobble. He visited a dentist who recommended further veneers, leaving his mouth full of ill-fitting, discoloured and misshapen teeth. No more superglue: Dean can smile again after having his veneers replaced . Then the front veneer started wobbling again and would pop off at any moment. Tired of all his trips to the dentist, Dean decided to try and manage it himself by using superglue. He said:  'My coping mechanism to stop it falling off is superglue. I just stick it on myself. Unfortunately that meant I have had instances when my tongue has stuck to the veneer.' As well the danger of ingesting superglue, Dean's solution left him at risk of gum disease and low in confidence. He said: 'It stops me from smiling and laughing if I know it has come loose. My general mood is quite low. it effects my confidence in my job and puts . me off talking to people. 'When I look in the mirror I see the difference in the shape . and colour of my teeth and I don't like what I see. I often feel it has come loose in my mouth and the whole thing can come off.' Unstuck: Dean has been forced to stick his veneers in using superglue after a dentist bungled them . Before: The health worker's teeth were discoloured and wonky and one veneer kept becoming unstuck . Unstable: Dean's dodgy veneers regularly fall out - much to his acute embarrassment . Dean appeared on TV show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if there was anything their experts could do to help him. Skilled cosmetic dentist Dr Marius McGovern recommended Dean overcome his fear and get back in the dentist chair in order for his smile to be fixed. He was alarmed at the state of Dean's veneers that were causing his teeth to become decayed and left him at risk of infection and gum disease, and immediately suggested that Dean have all the original veneers removed and replaced. Before: Dean in his salad days before the succession of toothy disasters began . After: Now he has straight, pearly whites . After the treatment, Dean was delighted with the change and couldn't stop smiling. He said: 'I've got some much more confidence just from this change and I can actually use them as would normal teeth.' Dean was assured his new smile would last for years as long as he looked after them. His husband was delighted with the new look and by how happy it made Dean feel. 'There's such a difference - now I have a happy husband again.' he said. Extreme Beauty Disasters is on TLC Thursdays at 8pm .","Dean, 36, from Liverpool, broke his teeth after a fall .

"These are the terrifying scenes as a Syrian fighter jet streaks across the sky in eastern Al-Ghouta, near Damascus and drops two unguided bombs into a heavily populated civilian area. The jet, which appears to be an SU-24, flew low over the Al-Gouta area during its bombing run before leaving the area. The mission is believed to be in response to an earlier attack Islamist fighters struck the Syrian capital with at least 38 rockets on Sunday, killing seven people, a monitoring group said, in one of heaviest attacks on Damascus in over a year. Scroll down for video . The aircraft, believed to be an SU-24, dropped its two bombs on Al-Ghouta, near Damascus following an Islamic rocket attack on the capital . The two unguided bombs caused extensive damage to a number of buildings following the attack yesterday afternoon . A large plume of smoke billowed into the sky after the jet struck its target before leaving the scene at high speed . State media confirmed the attack and said at least four people were killed. It said the army was retaliating. The Saudi-backed Islam Army, based in the eastern Ghouta region near Damascus, had warned earlier that it would hit back against an air strike last week in Ghouta in which more than 40 people were killed. Damascus residents said Sunday's rockets seemed to be mortars and Katyusha. Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors the violence in the country, said this was the heaviest attack on the capital for more than a year. The Syrian army was shelling the rebel-held town of Douma where the Army of Islam is powerful, Abdulrahman said. Douma lies on one of the main roads linking the capital with Homs city further north. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Syria's air force has launched daily air strikes in the civil war, which started after security forces cracked down on pro-democracy protests in 2011. At least 200,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Throughout Damascus has been relatively calm, shielded from the war since government forces pushed the rebels back in 2013. The Red Crescent pulled several bodies from the rubble following the terrifying airstrike which is also believed to have injured children . A distraught young girl was taken to an aid station for treatment after being injured in yesterday's airstrike in the Douma area . The airstrike caused extensive damage to an apartment complex in the Douma area of eastern Al-Ghouta . A host of celebrities have written an open letter to David Cameron calling on Britain to do more to help Syria's refugees find safety in the UK. Oscar winner Emma Thompson, comedian Michael Palin and musician Sting are among those who told the Prime Minister they were 'ashamed' by Britain's efforts so far. The Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme was set up at the start of last year after the Government was pressured into dropping its previous opposition to admitting refugees directly from the region. Ministers argued that the UK, as the second biggest contributor to aid funds for the war-torn country, could contribute more by improving conditions on the ground. The scheme expects to relocate only a few hundred Syrians over the next three years. Emergency rescue workers arrived a the scene of the bombing only seconds after the explosion searching for injured people . Injured children was taken from the site of the airstrike to a makeshift hospital for treatment following the deadly attack . The Syrian Arab News Agency claimed the the airstrike was a response to a rebel rocket attack on Damascus, pictured . Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood and director Ken Loach also signed the letter to Mr Cameron, which was in support of a joint campaign by the Refugee Council, Amnesty International and Oxfam. They told the Prime Minister: 'In a climate where children are sent to work in order to help their parents survive, where young girls are sold off as child brides and where torture victims are unable to rebuild their lives, every resettlement place countries like Britain provide is a lifeline. 'Resettling ""several hundred people"" just isn't good enough for a global leader. This issue isn't about migration statistics or party politics, it's about people. It's about the values that we in Britain hold dear; compassion and humanity. 'Your choice is simple, yet historic. You are in a position to offer some of the most vulnerable people in the world safety in Britain. You can offer hope. You can offer a future.' Meanwhile several celebrities have written to Prime Minister David Cameron claiming that Britain should offer to rehome more Syrians . The letter also described how countries such as Germany and Austria have increased the number of places they are offering in light of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East with the rise of Islamic State. 'We are ashamed that the UK has so far failed to do likewise,' the celebrities added. The UN's Refugee Agency UNHCR is calling on governments around the world to offer 100,000 resettlement places for Syria's refugees in 2015/2016. Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said: 'The Syrian crisis presents us with one of the greatest refugee crises of our time and, arguably, one of the greatest moral questions of our time. 'The UK's commitment to the relief effort has been laudable but it's not enough. The question is, does David Cameron want to go down in history as the prime minister who rationed his compassion to a few hundred people when there was the opportunity to offer safety to so many more?'","A Syrian Air Force attack jet dropped two bombs on an apartment complex in an opposition area near Damascus .

The problem for Tom Watson is that Patrick Reed may be as liable to blow up in the silo as hit an opposition target here at Gleneagles. A shining example of both the strengths and weaknesses of American golf, his trash-talking individual style making him a ferocious competitor but perhaps not the greatest team player, the Ryder Cup rookie’s already-notorious sense of self has prompted some to ask whether anyone in this US team will actually want to partner Reed. If that sounds harsh, consider that Reed’s team-mates at Augusta State once reportedly held a vote among themselves – and decided that possibly the most talented player any of them had ever seen should be removed from the squad. Patrick Reed has the talent to beat anyone at the Ryder Cup, but could also implode for the US . Reed's trash-talking style has made him a ferocious competitor but not necessarily the greatest team player . Now, the 24-year-old has obviously matured from the kid who had to change schools in order to become the driving force behind Augusta’s remarkable back-to-back NCAA titles. Yet there is a suspicion that the unruly – unmanageable? – streak is still in there, constantly battling with the unmistakeably terrifying talent we’ll see in action this week. Recalling his move to Augusta, his then-coach Josh Gregory remembers speaking to Reed’s head of programme at Georgia, Chris Haack. ‘He told me: “You’re going to have your hands full. Patrick can really play - but he needs constant monitoring”,’ revealed Gregory, who later suspended Reed for two unspecified violations of team rules in 2009. ‘Patrick already thought he was twice as good as he really was.’ Former Augusta State team-mate Henrik Norlander added: ‘He shot his mouth off early when he shouldn’t have.’ Fortunately for Reed, it transpired that he had the game to back up the talk. The 24-year-old, however, says the Ryder Cup is completely different and that he's ready to be a team player . One college acquaintance recalls bombing a drive 275 yards down the middle of a fairway, celebrating appropriately, then watching in astonishment as Reed got down on his knees – and, from that kneeling position, hit one 10 yards further. On best behaviour on Thursday, the man who raised so many hackles by describing himself as ‘top five-player in the world’ earlier this year refuted accusations that he’s not a team player, the world No 27 insisting: ‘Did it upset me? No, I let a lot of things go and brush it off my shoulder. ‘Golf is an individual sport. I go to the golf course on a normal basis, I get out there in the morning, I pop in my headphones just to kind of get myself focused on to what I’m trying to do while I’m out there. ‘This week is completely different. This week, we have had so much fun with all the guys. Just a lot of activities we’ve been doing and all that kind of stuff. ‘When you play a normal PGA TOUR event, it’s a lonely sport, but here it’s totally different and I feel like the camaraderie that we have as a team is very high. I feel like the excitement and just the fun aspect that we’ve had, it’s been amazing.’ Reed and his partner Justine leave the Ryder Cup opening ceremony on Thursday at Gleneagles . Intriguingly, Reed names Ian Poulter as one of the three players he’d pick to make up his dream fourball, explaining that he’d had an enormous amount of fun playing with him on the Tour. ‘He made you laugh literally the entire 18 holes we played, it was always just one-liners and jabbing a little bit,’ he explained. ‘He was a lot of fun, real down-to-earth and easy to play with. I felt like if I spent some more time with him, (I would) get a couple more laughs and play some good golf.’ Asked the obvious question about whether facing off against Team Europe talisman Poulter would be quite as light-hearted this week, Reed deadpanned: ‘No. Angry Bird.’ It shouldn’t be a surprise that he likes the brash Englishman, though. Poulter is a guy who works best when he makes a borderline outrageous statement – and then forces himself to back it up. Reed, who built up a remarkable unbeaten record in college matchplay, certainly enjoys this format, saying he’d feel confident of promising captain Tom Watson a point any time he went on course. ‘I think every guy on our team would,’ he said. ‘All of us are confident, all of us feel like we’re playing really well. ‘I’ve absolutely loved watching the Ryder Cup since I was a little kid. My father used to play golf, so it didn’t matter whether it was played in the States or played over here, it was on the TV. ‘Whether I was up at two or three in the morning, we were always watching it. It was one of those things that I’ve always dreamed of making the team, and finally making the team means a lot. Hopefully we can do our job and hopefully the Cup comes back home. ‘I was 6-0 in matchplay throughout my career. I played a lot of things in college because, at Augusta State, half the team was international and half the team was US — so we played multiple times a year in a Ryder Cup kind of a format and events like that. Those are just the kind of things I feel like are going to help me this week. ‘I love being the underdog and kind of the team that’s not really expected to win. I mean, Augusta State, did you expect us to win two in a row? We still did it.’ Reed (left) takes in a practice round ahead of the tournament with experienced US team member Jim Furyk . Reed’s take on captain Watson is simple and honest enough, the rookie saying of the living legend: ‘He gets it.’ As for advice the great man has passed on, the three-time Tour winner revealed: ‘He just said be yourself, play your own game.’ The second part of that may be enough to beat anything Europe have to offer, up to and including Rory McIlroy. In a contest where par-fives are often crucial, Reed’s power and accuracy — stats fan Paul McGinley should look away from his numbers on approaches from 200 yards-plus — could be the decisive factor. As for whether he’ll work and play well with the others in red, white and blue? If he’s winning points for the team, that’ll be a lot easier. He certainly won’t be hiding in the corner of the team room, whatever happens out on the course. ‘Patrick Reed’s never been the type of player who’s going to go anywhere quietly,’ said one former team-mate. It is certainly likely that this noisy Texan will do some damage here. To whom, exactly, remains to be seen.","Patrick Reed is known as much for his comments as his talent .

"The home of Sir Cliff Richard was raided by police . A police officer suspected of leaking information about an investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has escaped severe punishment. South Yorkshire Police (SYP) gave the unnamed officer ‘management advice’ – tantamount to a slap on the wrist – after he posted information on Twitter in April last year. Management advice is the lowest sanction given for misconduct. Referring the incident to the IPCC, the police watchdog, SYP queried whether he or she could be the source of the tip-off that led to SYP agreeing with the BBC to broadcast a raid of the pop star’s home. Heavily redacted police files, obtained by The Mail on Sunday through a Freedom of Information request, reveal a complaint sent to former crime commissioner Shaun Wright days after the raid on Sir Cliff’s home on August 14 last year. The letter said that in April the unnamed officer tweeted about the arrest of a 73-year-old by Operation Yewtree detectives. Online rumours incorrectly said the man arrested was Cliff Richard, and it is believed the post referred to those claims. The IPCC handed the case back to SYP, which concluded that the junior officer (who was not part of the investigation into the allegations against Sir Cliff) was not the source of the leak – though it has not said why it came to that conclusion. The star was in Portugal during the raid on his £3 million Berkshire home. He has denied all allegations that he abused a youth, now in his 40s, at a Christian rally in 1985. The BBC faced criticism for broadcasting the raid live from a helicopter and stationing reporters at the gates of the property before police arrived. The uproar led to the Home Affairs Select Committee concluding ‘No citizen should have to see their home raided in this way.’ Last night, Keith Vaz, chairman of the Select Committee, said: ‘People will be puzzled that the officer should be treated so leniently for such a serious matter.’ Sir Cliff declined to comment.

"Asked whether he would rather win $11.44million at the FedEx Cup finale or be part of a winning American Ryder Cup team, Masters champion Bubba Watson hesitated for only a second. ‘That would be a tough one,’ he began, before delivering an answer suggesting it wasn’t hard at all. ‘When you look at my career, I’ve won a major, I’ve won other tournaments but I’ve never won the Ryder Cup. ‘At the end of my career I would love to have done that and who knows, this might be my last chance. So right now I would like to win the Ryder Cup. I would like to experience the team atmosphere that follows a win.’ Team player: Bubba Watson has his sights set on Ryder Cup glory . How they shape up: Watson is third in the rankings . That’s rather thrown the gauntlet down then, hasn’t it? His answer was certainly a refreshing contrast to the depressing one Tiger Woods gave to a similar question in 2002, when he said there were a million reasons why he would rather win the $1m first prize at the American Express Championship than the Ryder Cup played the following week. Watson showed how much he loves the biennial competition at the last edition at Medinah. He was a revelation, catching the Europeans off-guard completely on the opening day when he encouraged the crowd to cheer as he struck his drive off the first tee. Will he be doing something similar at Gleneagles? ‘No, I will not be doing that,’ he said, smiling broadly. ‘We were on home soil and it was just my little way of trying to grow the game of golf. I loved it when Ian Poulter joined in the following day but it was a one-time thing. And I would not do that especially on foreign soil, where they might be against it.’ The 35-year-old from Bagdad, Florida is often portrayed as country yokel but his answers display a real street intelligence. Getting into the swing of things: Watson during practice in Atlanta on Tuesday . At Gleneagles he will resume his pairing with Webb Simpson that delivered two points in the fourballs at Medinah. Here was his response when one reporter suggested Simpson was the calm one in the partnership. ‘Y’all got time for a little story?’ he began. ‘Webb was playing really well going into the Presidents Cup in Australia but he was really jumpy in our match against Ernie Els and Ryo Ishikawa. We were two down after just four holes, so I took him to one side. ‘I said: “Webb, look man you’re the 8th ranked golfer in the world. Half the players above you are European so that makes you the fourth or fifth best player here. Eyes on the prize: Watson wants the Ryder Cup to complete his set . 'Two of those are Tiger and Phil and they’re on our team. So that makes you second best. Now go out and play like it and make some putts. ‘And I think he birdied the next two holes. So I calmed him down and I see that as my role, trying to make my team-mates relax.’ Only once did we get goofy Bubba. Watson said he would prepare for the Ryder Cup like it was a major, with one big exception. ‘We don’t have to pack a suitcase do we, as all the uniforms are going to be over there,’ he said. ‘Socks and underwear. That’s all I got to pack. Other than that, it’s still golf. You still practice at your house, work on your short game, work on your irons, your driver. You just pack differently.’ Talking tactics: Watson sees himself as a calming influence in the American camp . As for the Tour Championship, the final leg of the FedEx Cup play-offs, Watson is one of five players — the others are Chris Kirk, Billy Horschel, Rory McIlroy and Hunter Mahan — in control of their own destiny. If any wins this event, with its $1.44m (£895,000) first prize, they will walk away with the $10m (£6.2m) FedEx bonus. Watson gave short shrift to those players moaning about fatigue, at the end of a run of six events in seven weeks. ‘You should be energized if you’ve got the chance to take home $11.44 million,’ he said. ‘How many chances are you going to get to do that in your lifetime?’ It was one more good answer in a press conference full of them. Go Bubba, as they say in these parts.","Watson chasing team prize to complete set of silverware .

"Engineers have told how they were sent to David Cameron’s house on New Year’s Day to fix his power after he suffered a blackout while watching The Sound of Music on TV.

"Sam Torrance has criticised Sir Nick Faldo for labelling Sergio Garcia 'useless' on the eve of September's Ryder Cup. Faldo caused controversy by questioning Garcia's attitude during the 2008 contest when the Englishman led Europe to their only Ryder Cup defeat since 1999. Spaniard Garcia insisted he was happy to 'forgive and forget' in the wake of Europe's 16.5-11.5 victory at Gleneagles but Torrance, who served as one of Paul McGinley's vice captains, was not so willing to move on.

The guys rallied round Garcia like he was an injured, well, goose. 'Really, it was pathetic from Faldo. I've no idea where he was coming from with that stuff.

Torrance captained the Europeans to victory at the Belfry in 2002 and, while he criticised Faldo, he was full of praise for McGinley, who was crowned Coach of the Year at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards on Sunday.

"Rory McIlroy received plenty of criticism when he switched club manufacturers almost two years ago and he has now conceded that it took nearly 12 months to feel totally at ease with his new equipment. The Northern Irishman was flying high at the top of the world rankings when he signed a 10-year contract with Nike in January 2013 that, according to media reports, was worth $250 million. A host of fellow golfers and media pundits lined up to tell McIlroy he was taking a gamble with his career and he went through a torrid time before ending a 12-month title drought by landing the Australian Open crown at the end of the year. Rory McIlroy celebrates after winning the US PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in August . McIlroy poses with the European Tour's Race to Dubai trophy in Dubai in November . McIlroy has not looked back since and an outstanding 2014 season yielded two major triumphs, a World Golf Championship win, victory in the European Tour's flagship event, a memorable Ryder Cup display and a return to the no. 1 spot in the rankings. 'The Australian win at the end of a very lean 2013 was a welcome bit of form,' the 25-year-old said. 'It was the coming together of some hard work on many aspects of my game and becoming completely comfortable with the club changes I'd made. 'I then had the confidence to get the job done. I'd say it was worth the wait to get things properly in place. 'The major wins were really a continuation of that process. And, of course, hugely important, satisfying and evidence that I could win majors when I had to dig deep, rather than by comfortable margins,' said McIlroy who has been voted the 2014 Reuters Sportsman of the Year. 'But don't get me wrong. I've nothing against a comfortable margin.' McIlroy's first two major triumphs, in the 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 U.S. PGA Championship, were both runaway eight-shot victories. McIlroy (left) celebrates Euope's Ryder Cup victory alongside team-mate Sergio Garcia . McIlroy also won the PGA Championship at Wentworth in 2014, the European Tour's flagship event . His third and fourth major wins, achieved this year, were much tighter affairs. He won the British Open at Hoylake by two strokes in July and had only one shot to spare when he lifted his second U.S. PGA Championship trophy, in Kentucky in August. McIlroy also had a stellar season in 2012, winning five times around the world, but believes he is a much more mature player these days. 'Two years on tour is quite a long time, even (or especially) as a 25-year-old,' he explained. 'I also think my game and mental approach are in many ways linked. 'With my swing, clubs and fitness in place, I feel confident enough to go out and win. 'Perhaps a lot of the maturity is just an extended learning curve, with each experience, good or bad, another lesson in patience, course management and knowing when, or when not, to take a risk.' McIlroy gave an exemplary exhibition of course management during Europe's victory over the United States in Scotland in September. Pitting his wits against an in-form Rickie Fowler in the final-day singles at Gleneagles, he simply blew the American away with a performance that showed just why he is the world no. 1. McIlroy reeled off four birdies and an eagle in a stunning six-hole start and went on to record a 5 & 4 demolition job on a dazed Fowler. McIlroy poses with his two major trophies, the US PGA Championship and The Open (right) 'That was really down to a confidence thing,' said the Northern Irishman. 'I'd been playing really well, my swing was in great shape and I felt I knew what I needed to do to get a win on the board -- get off to a fast start. 'The early birdies that day came as a result of some excellent driving, which effectively took any trouble out of the equation on the opening holes and allowed me relatively easy approaches. 'I thought that if I was well under par by the turn I would be difficult to catch.' The quality of McIlroy's golf this year has helped him establish a sizeable lead over closest pursuers Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott and Bubba Watson and he will certainly be difficult to catch at the top of the rankings in 2015.","McIlroy won two majors during a breathtaking 2014 campaign .

"Europe's golfers this morning gave a tempered response to Phil Mickelson's mini-salvo about Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell 'litigating' against each other. Martin Kaymer questioned whether the American's pointed observation was necessary but said that, more than anything, he found Mickelson's comments amusing. As part of what appeared to be a concerted effort by the home side not to ratchet up tension ahead of Friday's start talisman Ian Poulter also failed to bite back at the USA side, preferring to assure that McDowell and McIlroy still get on well together. Northern Irishmen Graeme McDowell (left) and Rory McIlroy (right) wait to tee off on Wednesday . McIlroy (centre) is suing his former management company, in which McDowell (right) is a shareholder . On Tuesday Mickelson had deliberately brought up the elephant in the Europe team room, the fact that McIlroy is suing his former management company, in which McDowell is a shareholder, as well as a client. 'Phil's comment, it's not a topic for us. It's one of those things, you read it, you laugh about it and that's it,' he said. 'I heard about it yesterday but I think in the end of the day we should just play golf. It's fairly simple. If things like this start it's a little… I don't know if that's necessary.' Poulter dismissed any notion that there was a problem between the two Northern Irishmen off the course. 'I did see the comments, but you need to see how Rory and G-Mac are in the team room, they are very comfortable. There's no animosity there whatsoever, the guys are good. So I just have to laugh at the comment.' Phil Mickelson brought up the subject on Tuesday, but Team Europe have denied any animosity . McDowell (left) and McIlroy (right) during Wednesday's practice round at Gleneagles . He also denied that there was any psychological angle at work with the Americans trying to disrupt the team that has beaten them with such regularity. 'I don't think there's mind games being put out there. Both teams want to win this trophy. We've had the upper hand in the past decade but you look at the board and there's still more red, white and blue on it than there is European blue.' Justin Rose was also diplomatic, saying: 'It's a bit of banter and getting things going. We don't have a problem with that at all. 'There's no real angst between the players and in our team room it's a non-issue.

"Retailer J.C. Penney may want to rethink the design of their new kettle after a string of customers complained it looks remarkably like Hitler. The retailer advertised the new kettle - which is exclusively available in its stores - on a huge billboard over the 405 Interstate Highway in southern California. But rather than being tempted into buying new kitchen equipment, commuters driving along the route near Culver City found themselves instantly reminded of the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Customers have complained that billboard for the JC Penny kettle on the 405 Interstate looks like Hitler . Several motorists took pictures of the sign, which is around 10 foot tall and 36 foot wide, and posted it on Twitter along with their views about the kettle's resemblance to the  World War II dictator. Jim @scplanetable tweeted: Every time I see that JC Penny billboard with the teapot, I keep seeing Hitler. Seriously, the thing looks exactly like Hitler. 405 S, man.' Proving the billboard may not be the best advertising for the retailer, another commuter, Benari @benarilee tweeted: 'Uh, no thanks, JC Penny. I don't think I want your HITLER teapot.' Other social media users added that they dreaded to think what the store's pressure cookers must look like.

Edin Mujagic also wrote. The Saturday night sketch comes just a week after de Leeuw sucked milk from a woman's breasts on the show. Host Paul de Leeuw had invited a group of women from a charity which allows the exchange of breast milk between mothers to his entertainment show, Langs de Leeuw. During an interview with the women, the host asked whether breast milk was 'nice and sweet' and asked if he could taste some. One of the women offered him a bottle of the milk but de Leeuw said he would prefer to drink from the source. 'Well, if you don't bite you may try it,' the volunteer, named Wendy, said. De Leeuw leaned in to drink from one of her breasts before pulling back and starting on the second breast. 'I find the second one better tasting, but I can taste that you've eaten asparagus yesterday,' de Leeuw quipped. The segment has generated criticism on social media but volunteer Wendy defended the unusual exchange, saying it was 'for a good cause'. VARA has today released this statement: 'Last Saturday ‘De Kwis’, the satirical part of the Dutch television program ‘Langs de Leeuw’, referred to the recent attack in London. This is experienced by some viewers as inappropriate. 'We would like to respond. The attack in the UK was shocking and is a human drama. This is not only public opinion but also the opinion of broadcaster VARA, presenter Paul de Leeuw and those involved in the making of ‘De Kwis’. 'Everyone handles the feelings that tragedies like these raise in their own way. Comedians often prefer to deal with difficult emotions by joking about them. Many times that works well. An important function of humor is it being an outlet. It gives air. But sometimes it doesn’t work well. The pain and the shock that a particular incident has brought about is so intense that there is – for some – no place for airiness. ‘De Kwis’ is an independent part within the program ‘Langs de Leeuw’ and is written and developed without host Paul de Leeuw. The creative team is responsible for what they do. 'The joke with the two Britons was actually not at the expense of the dead soldier. A very absurd side of reality (the insane attack) was compared to a trivial side of reality (the madness surrounding the Eurovision Song Contest). If people will feel hurt, we regret that.' It was signed 'The creators of De Kwis'","Langs De Leeuw appeared to make light of gruesome murder in Woolwich .

"Bill Nye, the Science Guy, has taken issue with Patriots coach Bill Belichick's explanation for 'Deflategate.' Belichick said at a press conference on Saturday that a sudden change in temperature or rubbing the footballs could be behind why balls used in the Patriots' AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts that paved the way for his team to reach the superbowl were under-inflated. But Nye, who used to host a popular science kids show, disputed that theory on Good Morning America yesterday. 'I don't think you can change the pressure (like that),' Nye said. To really change the pressure you would need to use an inflation needle, he said.  'What he said didn't make any sense,' said Nye. Scroll down for video . That's not how it works! Bill Nye the Science Guy (left) called out Patriots coach Bill Belichick (right) for his 'nonsensical' theory for why the teams game balls were deflated below NFL standard . Allegations: The Patriots and Tom Brady had been accused of deflating their game balls for the January 18 game against the Indianapolis Colts (picture of Brady throwing a ball during the semifinal game above) Still, Nye is a fan of the Seahawks - the team that the Patriots will play in the Super Bowl. 'I cannot help but say 'Go Seahawks!' Nye said. Coach Belichick went into detail during his impromptu press conference, saying that the team conducted an internal investigation in which they simulated how their balls were stored and treated that showed how the PSI changed from when they were measured for air pressure before the game to after they came off the field. And earlier this week Martin Schmaltz, a Professor of Physics at Boston University had said; 'If they had inflated the balls inside the building and put it to the minimum amount, and then brought it outside to temperatures that were about 30 degrees lower, that would drop the PSI by between 1 and 2. Meanwhile on Friday afternoon, the NFL broke their silence on the issue. In a statement, the league said; 'Our office has been conducting an investigation as to whether the footballs used in last Sunday’s AFC Championship Game complied with the specifications that are set forth in the playing rules.' Among other things, the league said they had conducted over 40 interviews, been reviewing video footage and even hired a forensics team to figure out what happened on Sunday. While Patriots coach Belichick has been speaking out about his theories on 'deflategate' his quarterback Tom Brady also denied to the press of having any part in deflategate or altering balls. On the field: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady winds up for a pass during a Patriots practice ahead of next Sunday's game . Inspection: Brady glares at a ball during the training session in Foxborough, Massachusetts . Response: Brady has denied deliberately deflating the balls as the NFL continues their investigation . The allegations of cheating using deflated balls and the accompanying press conferences are proving to be rich pickings for US comedians. Saturday Night Live's opening sketch featured coach Bellichick - played by Beck Bennett - giving a flat denial at a 'press conference' of any involvement in the unfolding scandal. Bennett opened his 'conference' saying: 'I have absolutely nothing to do with deflating those footballs. 'I'd like to spend the remainder of the press conference throwing my quarterback under the bus.' In case the implication wasn't clear enough, he then said of Tom Brady: 'I love him like a son, just more of an estranged son that I wouldn't trust around footballs.' 'Brady', played by Taran Killam, then took the stage and played comically dumb about the allegations - describing the much-discussed science of ball pressure as 'nerd stuff'.

"Belgian police have launched an investigation into hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s YouTube rants, it emerged yesterday. The married father of four, who receives an estimated £25,000 in benefits, is being probed over allegations he incited violence and threatened terrorist attacks in Britain and Belgium. Details of the Belgian inquiry emerged days after Scotland Yard officers went to Choudary’s East London home to help his family go into hiding in the aftermath of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby. Help: Critics say the police should stop Choudary's hate-filled speeches on the internet, rather than running up costs protecting his family from threats following the Woolwich terror . Evacuation: A member of Choudary's family are ushered out of their home. Information was later released by Belgian police that they are investigating allegations that Anjem Choudary incited violence and terror . Baby: A woman, believed to be Anjem Choudary's wife, is escorted from the house by a female police officer, while carrying a young child . Critics say the Metropolitan Police . should concentrate on stopping his hate-filled speeches on the internet, . rather than running up costs protecting his family from people furious . about the atrocity in Woolwich last week. In a new outburst unconnected to the . Belgian investigation, Choudary yesterday blamed David Cameron for a . ‘crusade’ against Islam which is turning young British Muslims into . potential terrorists. Officials in Belgium – which has . recently passed new anti-terror laws under which websites inciting . violence can be banned – said Choudary and a colleague, Abu Rahin Aziz, . are being probed over comments they made in two videos posted on . YouTube. Outspoken: Controversial preacher Choudary was interviewed on BBC2 Newsnight last week following the death of Drummer Lee Rigby . If the authorities decide to prosecute them, both men face the prospect of being deported from the UK to face terrorism charges. Peter Mertens, a spokesman for . Belgium’s ‘Crisis Centre’, which deals with the threat posed by Muslim . extremists, confirmed that security officials were studying both videos . to determine whether laws have been broken. He said investigators may be in touch with their counterparts in London for assistance. Choudary’s video of hate, called Message Of Support For Abu Imran, was posted on May 8 and has clocked up 17,818 views. It is still on the internet and was . released in protest at the imprisonment of the leader of a group called . Sharia4Belgium, which is backed by Choudary and other leading Islamic . militants. Imran, whose real name is Fouad . Belkacem, was arrested in June  last year and is serving a two-year . prison sentence for inciting  hatred and violence towards non-Muslims in . a video also posted to YouTube. During the near seven-minute video, . Choudary said: ‘So we say from England that we never spoke the truth . because our leaders, so-called leaders, said so – like Blair or Brown, . or indeed Cameron. ‘Rather, we speak the truth because . it is incumbent upon us, it is an obligation upon us to raise our voice . for the sake of Allah, to command good, forbid evil, call for the sharia . and khilafa. ‘And similarly, Sheikh Abu Imran – he did the same thing in Belgium and there will be others that come and will continue.

Accused: Michael Adebowale arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday in the back of a police van after being charged with the murder of soldier Lee Rigby . In his video, Aziz went as far as to . warn that Belgium will be ‘destroyed’ by Muslims and appeared to warn of . violence and terror attacks if a fellow militant preacher remains . imprisoned there.

"Disgruntled Hollywood Hills residents have told how up to 10,000 tourists flock to the area every weekend in a bid to catch sight of the famous sign. According to those living close to the landmark on Mount Lee, visitors brazenly trespass on grounds surrounding multi-million dollar homes to catch selfies and postcard shots. Guy Pohlman, who lives by a once-secret shortcut leading to a sign viewpoint in Griffith Park, described the sightseers as being out of control. Scroll down for video . Invasion: Residents living near the famous Hollywood sign have told how up to 10,000 tourists descend on the area every weekend making life misery . 'I've seen people stand on my wall to get a picture,' he told the Associated Press. 'I've seen them stand on my neighbor's garage. 'I've seen them stop in the middle of the street and stand on their cars. They block our emergency vehicles. They block our mail delivery. 'There will probably be 10,000 of them here this weekend.' Sometimes they get stuck at the top of Pohlman's narrow street and struggle to turn around without bashing into a neighbor's wall. Sometimes a resident comes out of a house to scream at them to go away. But still they come. 'It's as if you want to touch the feet of the statues of the saints,' said pop-culture historian Leo Braudy of what drives them. 'There's a kind of desire to get something of that aura for yourself.' You can't quite touch the Hollywood sign, thanks to a protective fence, a bank of security cameras and the threat of arrest. Determined effort: In a bid to get up close to the landmark on Mount Lee, the visitors brazenly trespass on grounds surrounding multi-million dollar homes . Warning signs: The city recently responded by restricting weekend parking to locals and putting up an electronic pedestrian gate to the trail's better known entrance . But you can get close enough for a great photo, one of those poses where you pretend to be holding the sign aloft like Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders. It's a fine souvenir to send home to let people know you've been to the land where the movie stars live. And the easiest way to do that is to drive right through one of their neighborhoods. It's a place called Hollywoodland that the sign, ironically enough, was erected in 1923 to promote when the homes were built. The people moved in, the sign was abandoned, and like a cheap movie set it began to fall apart. By the time the city got around to declaring it a landmark in 1973, it was falling down. Eventually, a deep-pocketed coalition forked over the money to fix it, and in 1978, the nonprofit Hollywood Sign Trust was created to protect it. In the years that followed, it became a Hollywood starlet of sorts, painted, facelifted and beautiful - but unapproachable. It was just too difficult to find a canyon route to the sign. That changed when smartphones became popular, and residents say the neighborhood hasn't been the same since. 'Now you have Sally or Suri or whatever her name is and she tells you just how to get there,' City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents the area, said of the directions-giving iPhone voice. Even worse, said Vincent Jeffords, who lives down the street from Pohlman, 'If you Google Hollywood sign and hiking trails on your smartphone, it will send you right here.' Indeed, doing so will even give you one website listing Pohlman's address (perhaps posted by the guy who stood on his wall) as the best place to take a picture. The city recently responded by restricting weekend parking to locals and putting up an electronic pedestrian gate to the trail's better known entrance. Breaking sweat: Now people coming to see the sign on weekends must at least walk really far . Modern era: For several years, people living in the area had a steady but manageable flow of tourists, but with the advent of GPS and smartphones, roads started becoming clogged with cars . Now people coming to see the sign on weekends must at least walk really far. LaBonge would like to see further parking restrictions and perhaps a shuttle service from the park. For his part, Pohlman says, he doesn't mind people walking through his neighborhood so long as they stay off his wall and don't trash his neighbors' property. He's come to accept that his home has become sort of a bivouac point. Seemingly to prove his point, two young women suddenly emerge at his carport sweaty, out of breath and asking for water. Zeta Kearney, a wedding planner from the Mediterranean island of Ibiza, and her friend Elyse Smith, an oil trader from London, have just taken selfies at the sign, one of which will be on Kearney's Facebook page. 'It was great,' Kearney says. 'We had so much fun we're coming back tomorrow.'","Guy Pohlman, who lives close to a once-secret shortcut leading to a sign viewpoint in Griffith Park, said the sightseers are out of control .

"A confounding and heartbreaking murder case alleging that a mother purposely poisoned her 5-year-old son with salt and documented his decline on social media began Monday in the New York suburbs. Lacey Spears, 27, of Scottsville, Kentucky, who presented herself online as a supremely devoted mother, is charged with depraved murder and manslaughter in the death a year ago of Garnett-Paul Spears. 'This mother was intentionally feeding her child salt at toxic levels,' prosecutor Doreen Lloyd said at Spears' arraignment. Mother: Lacey Spears is accused of killing her 5-year-old son Garnett-Paul Spears (seen right) by poisoning him with salt and documenting his decline on social media . The boy's sodium levels rose to a dangerous point with no medical explanation, prosecutors said, leading to a swollen brain, seizures and death. They believe his single mother, who was sharing his hospital room at Westchester Medical Center, administered salt through a feeding tube into Garnett's stomach. All the while, she was keeping followers up to date with 28 online postings in the last 11 days of his life, noting his death with, 'Garnett the great journeyed onward today at 10:20 a.m.' She had tens of thousands of entries over Garnett's lifetime, many about his doctor and hospital visits. 'My Sweet Angel Is In The Hospital For The 23rd Time,' Spears tweeted on Nov. 9, 2009, adding a sad-faced emoticon. 'Please Pray He Gets To Come Home Soon.' Jury selection began Monday with a pool of 90 potential jurors on hand at the courthouse. Several told the judge they had seen some of the extensive news coverage of the case. In rulings delivered last week, Lacey Spears' messages on Facebook, Twitter and MySpace were determined relevant and are likely to be introduced as evidence. Some of the posted photos depict Garnett's declining health, said acting state Supreme Court Justice Robert Neary. Neary also found that prosecutors can tell jurors about Internet research Spears did on her iPhone into the dangers of sodium in children and the properties of iodized salt. Garnett's sodium levels rose to a dangerous point with no medical explanation, prosecutors said, leading to a swollen brain, seizures and death. They believe his mother,  administered salt through a feeding tube into Garnett's stomach . All the while, she was keeping followers up to date with 28 online postings in the last 11 days of his life, noting his death with, 'Garnett the great journeyed onward today at 10:20 a.m.' In addition, the judge said Garnett's hospital records from Alabama, Florida and New York are relevant and 'inextricably interwoven into the fabric of this case. They provide a history of the child's medical issues and treatment leading up to his death. They illustrate the defendant's role as custodian and care giver.' Prosecutors believe Spears often lied to doctors about Garnett's health, for example claiming he had celiac disease when he didn't. Spears' lawyers have not publicly detailed a defense strategy and did not return calls seeking comment. Attorney Stephen Riebling said in July that the defense would focus 'on the relevant facts, not fiction.' Spears, originally from Decatur, Alabama, was living in Chestnut Ridge, New York, at the time of Garnett's death. She moved to Kentucky before her arrest in June and has been jailed since then. A man who says he is Garnett's father lives in Alabama. Liar? Prosecutors believe Spears often lied to doctors about Garnett's health, for example claiming he had celiac disease when he didn't . Other evidence in the case includes bags used to feed Garnett which prosecutors say have 'extraordinary' concentrations of sodium. The prosecution says Spears tried to cover up by asking a friend to take a feeding bag, 'get rid of it and don't tell anybody.' The trial apparently will not include any reference to Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers purposely but secretly harm children and then enjoy the attention and sympathy they receive. Some experts regard it as a mental illness and a defense to such crimes, while others consider it a motive. Several believe Spears' case fits the syndrome. Spears' lawyers asked the judge to prohibit any mention of Munchausen and prosecutors said they had no plans to bring it up. The murder charge alleges Garnett was killed 'under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life' rather than with intent. It carries the same maximum sentence as intentional murder, however — 25 years to life. The manslaughter count alleges Spears killed her son 'while intending to cause serious physical injury.'","Lacey Spears, 27, of Scottsville, Kentucky, is charged with depraved murder and manslaughter in the death a year ago of Garnett-Paul Spears .

Speaker of the New York State Assembly Sheldon Silver (pictured) has agreed to temporarily relinquish his powers as he battles federal corruption charges . The Democrat who has served as the highest-ranking state assemblyman since 1994 will become a virtual figurehead today but will not permanently quit his post . The 70-year-old will temporarily delegate his duties as speaker to a group of senior Assembly members, according to the New York Times. He has reportedly faced increasing pressure from Democrats in the assembly who were concerned that the criminal charges could impact his ability to carry out duties. Silver's spokesperson Michael Whyland said Silver is appointing senior members to take on responsibilities including budget negotiations to ensure a timely spending plan for the state, reported the New York Post. Whyland said this will give Silver the flexibility he needs so that he can defend himself against charges - with Silver confident that he will be found innocent. The delegation of duties will go to a five-person group which includes Herman 'Denny' Farrell of Harlem and Joe Morelle of Rochester, Joseph Lentol of Brooklyn, Cathy Nolan of Queens And Carl Heastie of The Bronx under the plan developed Sunday, sources told the Post. Silver pictured as he was transported to federal court last week. His decision to step aside comes days after he was taken into custody by the FBI on federal conspiracy and bribery charges . In court Silver said that after a full hearing and due process he is confident he will be vindicated of the charges . As one of the most powerful politicians in the state, Silver was taken into custody last Thursday and was later charged at Manhattan federal court with taking $4million in bribes disguised as legal fees. He was released on $200,000 bail. He is also accused of earning $700,000 from a real estate law firm which got work from developers he favored. In court Silver said that after a full hearing and due process he will be vindicated of the charges. Silver is one of the most powerful politicians in the state and has served as Speaker of the New York State Assembly (pictured) for 20 years . He is also accused of earning $700,000 from a real estate law firm . Last week, New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, came to Silver's defense, describing him as a 'man of integrity', and said he did not think he should step down citing his 'due process rights'. Silver is set to face the Assembly's Democratic caucus today for the first time following his arrest. Along with the Senate majority leader and the governor, Silver plays a major role in creating state budgets, laws and policies in a system long criticized in Albany as 'three men in a room.' He controls, for example, which lawmakers sit on which committees and decides whether a bill gets a vote. Silver would lose his seat if convicted of any of five felony counts and faces a maximum of 20 years of prison on each count. At least 30 New York politicians have faced legal or ethics charges since 2000. Silver's longtime Senate counterpart, Joseph Bruno, was acquitted in May at a retrial on bribery charges. One of his predecessors as speaker, Mel Miller, was convicted of corruption in the early 1990s, but the conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court. Two former state Senate Democratic leaders, John Sampson and Malcolm Smith, are facing criminal charges.","Silver to become 'virtual' figurehead but will not permanently quit post .

"He was asked by a New York-based photographer to name who has most influenced his life. His answer: 'My principal, Ms Lopez.' Why? Because she 'tells each one of us that we matter'. Now, Mott Hall Bridge Academy eighth-grader Vidal Chastanet's words have inspired photographer Brandon Stanton to launch a campaign to send students at the middle school to Harvard University. And the campaign has already far surpassed its initial goal of $100,000 - raising more than $700,000 for the Academy, situated in a 'crime-stricken' Brooklyn neighborhood, in just four days.

And one time she made every student stand up, one at a time, and she told each one of us that we matter.' Stanton later uploaded a photo of Vidal, alongside his kind words, to his blog. The post gained millions of views and prompted the Manhattan-based photographer to visit Mott Hall. There, he met Ms Lopez - whom he refers to as 'Superwoman' - and decided  to help send her students to Harvard to 'broaden their horizons and expand their idea of their own potential'. He set up an Indiegogo page last Thursday with the aim of raising $100,000. On the page, he wrote: 'Mott Hall Bridges Academy is a middle school located in Brownsville, Brooklyn. 'Let's send kids to Harvard': Stanton set up an Indiegogo page (pictured) last Thursday with the aim of raising $100,000. On the page, he wrote: 'Mott Hall Bridges Academy is a middle school located in Brownsville, Brooklyn. The neighborhood [has] the highest crime rate in New York City. It's not the best place to be a kid' Academy: The photographer's campaign has already far surpassed its initial goal of $100,000 - raising more than $700,000 for the Academy (pictured) in only four days. And the donations continue to come in . Generous donation: One woman, Lesley Charles, donated $30 to the campaign, saying she had been 'inspired' by Mott Hall's students 'to be more purposeful and to value education even more highly than I did before' 'The neighborhood [has] the highest crime rate in New York City. It's not the best place to be a kid. So Principal Nadia Lopez (aka SuperWoman) has a plan for her Brownsville middle schoolers. 'Since many of her scholars have never left New York, she wants them to know what it feels like to stand on the campus of one of the world's top schools, and know that they belong. 'She thinks the experience will broaden their horizons and expand their idea of their own potential.  So let's help her make it happen.' Stanton also posted a photo of Ms Lopez, 37, from Crown Heights, to the page, alongside her own words: 'This is a neighborhood that doesn't necessarily expect much from our children. 'So at Mott Hall Bridges Academy we set our expectations very high. We don't call the children ""students"". we call them ""scholars"". 'When you tell people you're from Brownsville, their face cringes up. But there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed.' Within just 45 minutes of its launch, the campaign had met its $100,000 goal. As of 9.45am on Monday, it had raised a staggering $700,174. And the donations are not stopping just yet. 'As a middle school educator, I understand the difference that the outside-of-the-classroom practices make,' one donor wrote on the site. 'I applaud you all for working so hard for these students.' Stanton, whose blog features photos of everyday people he meets on the street and has more than eight million followers, told CNN that Vidal's response to his question had deeply touched him. This photo, taken by Stanton, shows Vidal posing with his mother and younger brother outside the Academy . Crime-stricken area: This post, uploaded on Stanton's blog earlier this month, features another quote by Vidal . Prestigioujs: Mott Hall will use the first $100,000 raised by the campaign - which ends on February 5 - to provide each incoming sixth-grade class annually a chance to visit Harvard (pictured) in Cambridge, Massachusetts . 'I ask people all the time about the most influential person in their life. He was the first person who ever told me his principal,' he said.  'When I met Ms. Lopez, I could not have been more impressed. 'She is a force of nature. When she let me sit in on a staff meeting, I got a front-row seat to the challenges that her school faces, and I wanted to be involved in the solution.' During their meeting, Stanton revealed Vidal had also told him: 'When you live here, you don't have too many fears. You've seen pretty much everything that life can throw at you. 'When I was nine, I saw a guy get pushed off the roof of that building right there.'

"Richard Sherman isn't staying on the bench for the debate over Deflategate, saying that the Patriots will never see punishment because of the 'conflict of interest' between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Speaking to reporters Sherman said: 'I think the perception is the reality. It is what it is. Their résumé speaks for itself. The past is what the past is. Their present is what their present is. And, will they be punished? Probably not. 'Not as long as Robert Kraft and Roger Goodell are still taking pictures at their respective homes.

The New York Post reported that Sherman said that with their relationship strong and open there would not be any repercussions. 'But as long as that happens, it won't affect them at all,' he said. 'Nothing will, so....' However the Seahawk said he did not want to waste time worrying about how that friendship might affect the game. 'Not really. It is what it is at this point, whether it has impact or it doesn’t have impact,' he said. 'It is what it is.' He did, however, believe fans might back the Seahawks over the scandal. Sherman believes the Patriots will never see punishment because of the 'conflict of interest' between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Patriots owner Robert Kraft .

I think that this has been a special season for us and a special season for them as well. … I guess the controversy makes it, I guess, probably gives us a little edge in that respect, I guess.' The situation is an ironic reversal for Sherman, who was himself considered something of a bad guy headed into last year's game. 'Yes it is ironic, that I was a villain last year,' Sherman said, 'seeing as I didn’t break any rules or do anything despicable. I just play the game. To be painted a villain, you have to do something, I guess evil or something heinous, and I don’t know if I fit that description.'

"Louise Mulholland (pictured), 35, stole £84,000 from the Aldi store which she ran in Bootle, Liverpool . A cocaine addict Aldi manager who kept wads of cash in her handbag and drove around in a 'flash' sports car has been jailed for stealing £84,000 from her own store. Louise Mulholland, 35, was earning a £40,000 annual salary when she plundered the safety deposit box at the store in Bootle, Liverpool, to fund her cocaine habit and a luxury lifestyle. At the time, she drove around in a 'flash sports car' and lavished after-work drinks upon her colleagues. Mulholland also carried around huge sums of money in her handbag and was described as being 'flash with cash', the court was told. Sentencing her to two-and-a-half years in jail, Judge Thomas Teague QC said Mulholland was a 'highly intelligent woman'. The court had heard how she managed to cover her tracks by falsely editing the deposit slips to account for the money she had taken. He said: 'You were driving around in a fairly flash sports car and waving large sums of money around, almost literally.' 'You are an extremely capable highly intelligent woman of very considerable ability. 'If you had not resorted to dishonesty you might have gone far in the retail business. 'Unfortunately you became reckless, taking drink and drugs and went out of control.' During the trial, Liverpool Crown Court was told how Mulholland had been manager at the Aldi store in St John's precinct in the city centre. Prosecutor Andrew Ford said the theft took place in April 2012 when accounting records showed there should have been two weeks' takings in the safe of between £80,000 and £90,000. But Mulholland had started banking the takings a week in arrears and had 'exploited the accounting vulnerability', the court heard. Over the following months, she then 'doctored' details on the deposit slips to make up for the stolen money, the jury was told. Mulholland plundered the safety deposit box at the store in Bootle, Liverpool, before falsely editing the deposit slips to cover her tracks (file picture of an Aldi store) Mr Ford said there was evidence that she 'was flash with cash, had a sports car and cash wads in bank bands in her handbag'. He added that she had always been keen to buy the drinks on nights out with colleagues and regularly withdrew large sums of money from cash points. The court heard she was earning £40,000 and was living rent-free with her parents at the time. 'She lost control of proper responsibility for money and her colleagues, which is what Class A drugs can do,' Mr Ford said. Mulholland had denied theft. She instead blamed sloppy procedures and the computer system for the altered accounts. It was also only after trial that she confessed to a probation officer about her cocaine addiction. Mulholland was convicted of two offences of theft. The court heard that, since the offences had been committed, she had received a 12-week suspended jail sentence for doctoring a provisional driving licence and passport. They were discovered after she was stopped by police for driving erratically.","Louise Mulholland earned £40,000 a year as store boss in Bootle, Liverpool .

"The owner of British Airways today launched a £1billion takeover bid for Aer Lingus in an attempt to secure valuable take-off and landing slots at Heathrow Airport. IAG, which currently owns BA and Iberia, has offered a deal worth €2.55 a share, or €1.36billion in total, to buy Ireland's national airline. The company is keen to secure more space at the UK's biggest airport, which is almost full to capacity - meaning that landing slots are now worth millions of pounds. But the deal could be scuppered by the Irish government, which may block the move for political reasons, or by Ryanair, whose combative boss Michael O'Leary has long been trying to buy Aer Lingus. Bid: British Airways owner IAG has offered to buy Aer Lingus for a price of around £1billion . Full: The company is keen to expand at Heathrow, pictured, even though the airport is near capacity already . The Dublin-based airline confirmed this morning that its board was considering a new offer from IAG, having previously rejected two lower bids out of hand. IAG warned that this offer could be the last throw of the dice for the proposed deal, saying: 'There can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming.' The company's chief executive, Willie Walsh, was previously in charge at Aer Lingus before moving across the Irish Sea and joining BA. As well as the potential for efficiency savings by bringing Aer Lingus into a larger group, IAG is keen to expand its grip on Heathrow, where it is already by far the largest operator. BA controls more than half the landing slots at the airport, according to the latest available figures, and if it were combined with Aer Lingus and Iberia, IAG would have 56 per cent of all flights coming into and going out of Heathrow. Showdown: IAG, whose chief executive is Willie Walsh, left, could see its bid scuppered by controversial Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, right . If the three airlines joined forces, they would account for 51.6 per cent of passengers passing through the airport. Because Heathrow is running at almost full capacity, the only ways for an airline to expand its offerings at the airport are to trade in landing slots - worth several millions of pounds each - or to buy up a rival. Aer Lingus is currently the fourth busiest operator at the airport, behind BA, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, running up to 22 flights a day between Heathrow and Dublin. Heathrow could expand if a third runway is built, but the issue is politically controversial and no decision will be made on the matter until after the general election in May. Analysts suggested today that the IAG bid was likely to be accepted - but the Irish government could still step in to veto any deal. Grip: BA is already the largest airline at Heathrow, controlling more than half of landing slots . Aer Lingus is 25 per cent state-owned, despite the Irish government's promise to privatise it fully as part of the EU bailout deal struck in 2010. Politicians are keen to safeguard the airline's 3,900 workers, most based in Dublin, as well as ensuring that there is no decrease in the number of flights between Ireland and London. Deputy prime minister Joan Burton said yesterday: 'What we will want to do as a government, and what's absolutely important, is to protect these slots and the connections of direct flights in and out of Ireland.' The country's opposition has called on the government to rule out any sale, while trade union IMPACT warned that a takeover would pose 'significant risk' to the Irish economy as a whole. Another potential hurdle is Ryanair, Ireland's budget short-haul carrier, which owns a 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus following a series of unsuccessful attempts to buy the airline outright. Chief executive Michael O'Leary, known for his outspoken manner and aggressive attitude towards his customers, said last week he was open to considering a bid for Ryanair's stake. Aer Lingus shares rose by 3.8 per cent this morning, peaking at €2.44, while shares in IAG were up by 3.5 per cent.","IAG has offered €2.55 a share for Aer Lingus, valuing the firm at £1billion .

"A genuine European candidate in Dutch football chief Michael van Praag on Monday declared he will stand against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. Van Praag had been reluctant to put his name forward having witnessed a number of eastern European countries supporting Blatter and voting against UEFA proposals at last June’s FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo. The Dutchman can’t count on the support of his confederation, but has nevertheless put his hat in the ring along with Prince Ali of Jordan and the fanciful no-hopers Jerome Champagne, bookmaker-funded David Ginola and football agent Mino Raiola - none of whom will get the required nominations from five countries. Sepp Blatter faces another contender for the FIFA presidency in Dutch FA president Michael van Praag . Van Praag has announced hi candidature on the Dutch football association's website on Monday . Van Praag has decided to stand after, in his opinion, no credible contender emerged . Van Praag said: ‘It is high time that the organisation comes back into the real world and puts the focus back on football. ‘I had hoped that a credible opponent (to Blatter) would emerge, but that’s simply not happened. In that case you cannot just talk but you must also act decisively and take responsibility so therefore I am announcing my candidacy.’ UEFA did not back him on Monday. Chief executive Gianni Infantino said: ‘There is no candidate of UEFA because UEFA has no vote. We provide the platform for everybody to express their opinion. There has to be an open debate on the future of football.’ Dutch FA (KNVB) secretary general Bert van Oostveen added: 'It is clear that something has to change in FIFA to restore credibility. Michael is the right man for this. The KNVB will fully support him in his campaign.' Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein (left) of Jordan will also stand against FIFA president Blatter (right) Van Praag will formally announce his candidacy at a news conference in Amsterdam on Wednesday. UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said the European governing body would not be formally backing either Van Praag or Prince Ali. He told a news conference: 'We have heard about Prince Ali and we have heard about Michael van Praag and it is good there is a proper discussion. 'We are an open democracy, we have different views and the important thing is everyone can express his views.' Van Praag said he had obtained the minimum five nominations from national associations but the Football Association has yet to decide who it will support - that is likely to take place at a board meeting on Thursday. Van Praag (left) gave a lifetime achievement award to  Louis van Gaal, the current Manchester United boss . Van Praag believes something will have to change at FIFA so that its credibility is restored . David Ginola is expected to withdraw his candidacy to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA presidency on Thursday . Ginola is expected to be forced to withdraw as a FIFA candidate on Thursday after failing to gain the required nominations. The former Tottenham and France winger is being backed by a bookmaker but his campaign to raise £100,000 in public money has so far raised only £5,900. Meanwhile, UEFA confirmed England's David Gill and Welsh FA president Trefor Lloyd Hughes will contest an election voted for by European nations to be named Britain's next FIFA vice-president to succeed Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce. Current president Michel Platini will be re-elected unopposed at the UEFA Congress in March.

"Sir Mick Jagger's eldest son has posted a picture of himself online along with the caption 'stoned again'. James Jagger, 29, uploaded the picture on his Facebook profile pouting in front of the camera and wearing a big pair of dark sunglasses. The actor then captioned the photograph saying 'stoned again! How'd that happen??' Sir Mick Jagger's eldest son, James, posted this picture of himself with the caption 'stoned again!' 29-year-old James is the eldest son from his father's marriage to the former model Jerry Hall . In the comments below, his friends laughed at his apparent reference to the class B drug cannabis. One said: 'Your days are backwards. Waking up tired and going to bed wide awake. Lol.' Another wrote: 'I am in no way judging you for taking drugs...I used to take drugs myself but I have been drug free for four years now.' James is the eldest son from Mick Jagger's marriage to former model Jerry Hall. The couple also had two daughters, Lizzie, 30, and Georgia, 23, and son Gabriel, 17, from their marriage of nine years. Jagger has three more children from other relationships and five grandchildren. He became a great-grandfather in 2014. Ms Hall claimed in an interview last year her children were put off drugs for life because they spent their childhood with Jagger's Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards, 71, 'passed out on the couch'. Asked why her children have not been known for alcohol and substance abuse, the 58-year-old said: 'Well, my kids are just very grounded, that's just never been an issue. 'I mean they spent their life looking at Keith Richards passed out on the couch, you know.' Mick Jagger, pictured with Jerry Hall and children Elizabeth, now 30, and James, 29, in Barbados .

"Alan Pardew described it as ‘one of the best moments of his career’ when he scored the winner for Crystal Palace against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final. And on Monday night, Pardew was given the chance to repeat his heroics, this time as Palace manager, when his side were drawn at home to Liverpool or Bolton in the fifth round. Palace’s victory in 1990 was made all the more remarkable by the fact they were beaten 9-0 at Anfield in the league just seven months previously. Alan Pardew celebrates scoring during Crystal Palace's 4-3 FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool  in April 1990 . Sadly for Palace, they could not repeat the trick in the final, losing after a replay to Manchester United - a triumph that gave Sir Alex Ferguson his first trophy at Old Trafford. Pardew has won all four games as Eagles manager since leaving Newcastle for Selhurst Park at the start of January. Palace defeated Dover in the third round of the FA Cup in Pardew's first match before beating Southampton 3-2 on Saturday in the fourth round of the competition. The 53-year-old also masterminded a 2-1 victory home at London rivals Tottenham and a 3-2 win against Burnley at Turf Moor.

"Dejan Lovren has given an insight into Liverpool's pre-match preparations by posting a picture of him and team-mate Mario Balotelli on the train to London. Liverpool face Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, and the Reds squad travelled first class to the capital on Monday. After Raheem Sterling's second-half equaliser at Anfield, Liverpool are on level terms with their opponents ahead of the winner-takes-all clash. Dejan Lovren (left) posted an Instagram picture of him and Mario Balotelli on the train to London . Brendan Rodgers confirmed that Mario Balotelli will have another chance to prove himself at Liverpool . The victor will take on either Tottenham or Sheffield United, after their second leg decides a winner on Wednesday. Lovren's picture, posted on his Instagram to 226,000 followers, showed him with his feet up on a Virgin train, while Balotelli posed in the background. The Italy striker has had a difficult season at Anfield, but was backed by manager Brendan Rodgers on Monday morning. In his press conference, Rodgers claimed that Balotelli will be given another chance to forge a career at the club - and that he is ready to fight for his place. Balotelli's last start for the Reds came against Chelsea on November 8 (pictured) Balotelli challenges Jose Enrique (right) during a training session at Melwood last week . A cloud has hung over Balotelli’s future at Anfield for many months but Rodgers is not yet ready to call time on his chances of making a contribution and does not see the imminent return of Daniel Sturridge as a barrier to his prospects. ‘We will give Mario every chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘We brought him here to show consistently he can play at the top level. It has been a difficult period but he is a good boy who wants to fight for his place. Players have been out of the fold but shown they can get back in and stay in. ‘It doesn’t matter whether Daniel Sturridge is coming back. It improves our squad. They played well together at Tottenham. We will see how Daniel is today [Monday]. He trained very well with the team yesterday and it is as confident as he has looked. ‘We won’t risk him, that is for sure. We need to make sure he is ready and feels ready. He won’t be 100 per cent when he comes back. He will need game time, but all we can do is make sure he is in the best condition he can be physically and mentally.’ Daniel Sturridge (back left) is nearing a Liverpool return but will not be rushed back into the team . Raheem Sterling scored a superb equaliser for the hosts in the 59th minute of the Capital One Cup semi-final . Eden Hazard scored a penalty to give Chelsea the lead against Liverpool in the semi-final first leg last week . Rodgers, meanwhile, has urged his squad to exploit any lingering hangover Chelsea are suffering from the way they capitulated against Bradford; Liverpool’s manager recognises the threat of Jose Mourinho’s side and is respectful of them but, equally, he feels his own troops have nothing to lose. Liverpool finished the first leg in the ascendance last Tuesday and Rodgers feels they played well enough to have won comfortably. He now wants his players to replicate that effort and secure the club’s first trip to Wembley since 2012. ‘The result at the weekend does not help,’ said Rodgers. ‘They will have great motivation and after a game like that you want to put it right, but there is also in the back of your mind even if you are 2-0 up you can lose so there can be trepidation. ‘It is a different game at Stamford Bridge but we were a real threat going forward and good defensively. We controlled the counter-attack really well and looked a threat going forward. I thought we took that into Bolton but could not get the goal. ‘The team is on the up and confidence is really high. We have great confidence. It is very important and we will do everything we can to get there. Winning a trophy is a priority and it is a one-off game to get us there.’","Liverpool play Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi second leg on Tuesday .

"Cocaine addict Samantha Sumsion, 21, attacked a disabled grandmother on her doorstep in Brierfield, near Burnley . A cocaine addict asked a disabled Good Samaritan for help by claiming she had been the victim of domestic violence before attacking her in a cowardly doorstep robbery. Samantha Sumsion, 21, turned up at Linda Sutcliffe's door in Brierfield, near Burnley, claiming she was upset after a row with her boyfriend. The 55-year-old grandmother let Sumsion into her home and told her to return if she needed any further help. Just 15 minutes later, Sumsion turned up again at the victim's house. But this time, Sumsion punched her to the ground, before grabbing her by the shoulders and kneeing her in the face. Sumsion's former boyfriend Munir Hussain then held down the terrified victim while Sumsion stole the victim's mobile phone from her front room. The former drug addict has now been jailed for three years after pleading guilty at Burnley Crown Court to one charge of robbery. The defendant, also from Brierfield, broke down in tears as she was led from the dock sobbing, before shouting 'I love you' to current partner Ben Allen, who was sat in the public gallery. The court heard how the attack had left the victim so frightened that she has been unable to sleep or leave her home. Mrs Sutcliffe - who has several medical conditions, including a brain aneurysm - has since moved to a new address following the terrifying ordeal. Prosecutor Brian McKenna told the court how Mrs Sutcliffe was at home in October last year when Hussain knocked on her door. He told the court: `She (Mrs Sutcliffe) didn't know him, but he asked her to ring the police because he had been arguing with his girlfriend and was saying she was trying to get him into trouble.' Sumsion then appeared at the victim's door, appearing to be distressed and shaken up, the court was told. Despite not knowing the victim, Mrs Sutcliffe believed she needed help and let her into her home, before closing the front door to stop Hussain following. Mr McKenna said Sumsion then stayed at Mrs Sutcliffe's home for around 30 minutes, talking to her about the alleged row. The defendant, also from Brierfield, punched Linda Sutcliffe, 55, to the floor before kneeing her in the face . Sumsion (pictured left and right) then stole a mobile phone from the grandmother's front room before fleeing from the scene . Before Sumsion left, the pair even came up with a plan for her to knock three times on the door if she needed to return to Mrs Sutcliffe's home, so she knew who it was. About 15 minutes later, there was another knock at the door. Sumsion was again there with Hussain, the court was told. Mr McKenna said: 'Mrs Sutcliffe says the defendant looked straight at her and punched her in the face with a clenched fist. That caused her to stumble backwards and she fell to her knees. 'Sumsion then ran into to the vestibule area and into the living room. Mrs Sutcliffe tried to get up to go after her, but Hussain, on two occasions, pulled her back, restraining her by her shoulders.' After she was arrested, Sumsion denied being the robber, but she was picked out by the victim during an identification parade. The court heard how she later claimed she was addicted to crack cocaine and Hussain had been habitually violent to her. She also claimed her initial visit to Mrs Sutcliffe's had been a 'genuine attempt to escape as she has just been abused', the court was told. But she claims that, when she returned to the home she shared with Hussain, he allegedly interrogated her about where she had been. When she told him the story, he then asked if there had been any items of value at the victim's home, she claims. Mr McKenna added: 'She does accept she had noticed a mobile phone and mentioned this to Mr Hussain. 'He insisted she return to steal the telephone and threatened her with further violence if she refused to co-operate.' Mr McKenna told the court how Sumsion claimed Hussain sold the phone for £100 and went off to buy crack cocaine. When she returned home, she was arrested. The court also heard victim impact statements from Mrs Sutcliffe, which told how she had been 'terrified' since the robbery. Sumsion claims she was forced to carry out the robbery by her former boyfriend and had initially gone to Mrs Sutcliffe's house in a 'genuine attempt' to escape from him . Mr McKenna told the court: 'She is unable to sleep at all at night. She's afraid to go out of her house and has started to block the bedroom door when she goes to bed. 'She has been to her doctor for medication for her inability to sleep but he has been unable to prescribe anything because of the medication she takes.' The prosecutor added that, in a more recent statement, Mrs Sutcliffe described how she had felt like a recluse in her own home. She had since saved up and had moved to a new address. He continued: 'She says the robbery has changed her as a person, as previously she would help anyone, as she tried to help the defendant, but since then she has been reluctant to help again because of what happened to her on this occasion.' The court heard how Sumsion had a criminal record going back to 2011, with previous convictions for being drunk and disorderly, public disorder, police assault, battery, intimidation and assault. Sumsion has now been jailed for three years after pleading guilty at Burnley Crown Court (pictured) to one charge of robbery . Her lawyer James Heyworth said Sumsion clearly had a good upbringing, but that her life had taken a different direction when she turned 14, partly due to her relationship with Hussain. Mr Heyworth added: 'But for the intervention of Munir Hussain, it may be a reasonable inference, she would not have gone back to that address to commit the offence. 'He clearly wanted something he could sell quickly to fund his own addiction and she ultimately went along with that. 'She was cajoled to go back there and she decided to assault and steal from the complainant very much with his assistance. Fortunately for her, and no doubt for society at large, she's no longer in any relationship at all with Munir Hussain.' Mr Heyworth said Sumsion was now in a stable relationship with Mr Allen, adding: 'She no longer uses drugs and is clean of Class A drugs. She ultimately took it upon herself to go cold turkey from Class A drugs. She does now very much seem to have turned her life around.' Passing sentence, Judge Jonathan Gibson told Sumsion: 'This was a robbery of a lady, who, earlier in the day, had shown you nothing but kindness. 'The effect on the victim is immense as we have heard from her victim impact statements. One of the phrases she uses was: ""This was a life-changing experience"".'","Samantha Sumsion turned up at Linda Sutcliffe's home in Brierfield, Lancs .

"England will host the UEFA Under 17 European Championships in 2018, with the tournament to be staged at venues across the Midlands. UEFA’s Executive Committee announced their decision on Monday following a two-day meeting in Nyon, Switzerland and it means England will host the 16-team competition for the first time since its inception in 2002. John Peacock’s under 17 side are the defending European champions, having beaten Holland on penalties in last May’s final in Malta. England captain Conor Coady (third right) raises the trophy after beating Spain in the UEFA Euro 2010 final . The FA national football centre St George's Park will be headquarters for the 2018 Under 17 Championships . The Football Association’s national football centre at St George’s Park will be the headquarters for the tournament, with teams also based at Loughborough and Warwick Universities. Grounds likely to be used to host fixtures include Burton Albion’s Pirelli Stadium, the closest League venue to St George’s Park in Staffordshire. Wayne Rooney, who was voted UEFA’s golden player at the 2002 under 17 finals after scoring five goals, said: ‘As England captain, I am delighted that UEFA has chosen St George’s Park for the 2018 U17 European Championships. ‘I have no doubt the tournament will give us the opportunity to show the quality of our facilities. ‘I would also like to congratulate all those involved in bringing the tournament to England, I have never had the opportunity to play in a home-based tournament so the experience for our U17 squad should be extra special and I hope that the lads seize the opportunity before them.’ Reflecting on his experience of playing in the tournament in 2002, just two years before he announced himself as a global star at Euro 2004, Rooney added: ‘Playing for England in the U17 finals in 2002 was, at the time, the proudest moment of my life. England senior captain Wayne Rooney was voted as UEFA’s golden player at the 2002 under 17 finals . ‘I quickly discovered playing tournament football is completely different to normal competitive matches. Playing in Denmark gave me great experience and a first taste of the atmosphere and conditions of playing for your country in the finals of a tournament. ‘From my point of view, I found the experience invaluable. I can still remember that feeling you get when things are going well as we progress throughout the tournament. ‘We eventually lost to Switzerland, the eventual winners, in the semi-final, but bounced back with a great team performance in the third and fourth place play-off game, beating Spain and I was fortunate enough to score a hat-trick.’ Rooney, who made his full England debut the following year, added: ‘Looking back now I would say that a player experiencing tournament football as early as they can is a vital part of a player’s development. ‘In my case I was able to use my experience of 2002 in the 2004 Euros in Portugal with the senior England side.’ The incentive is there for the England class of 2018 to emulate the fantastic achievements of Patrick Roberts, Dominic Solanke, Adam Armstrong and co, who lifted the trophy last year in Malta.

"Having been in England for two-and-a-half years you might think that Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Oscar had acclimatised to the Great British weather. But the 23-year-old wasn't coping well with the conditions in Liverpool on Tuesday night as he warmed himself on the substitutes' bench with a hot-water bottle. Oscar was left out of the first leg of Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final and the playmaker, who is more used to the Brazilian sunshine than the cold nights on Merseyside, took measures to beat the low temperatures.

"Theo Walcott claims the return of Arsenal's injured stars has given the Gunners belief they can challenge for any trophy this season. Walcott and Mesut Ozil have started less than 10 Premier League games between them in the current campaign but the pair were both on target as Arsenal edged into the FA Cup fifth round with a 3-2 win over Brighton on Sunday. Walcott's goal was his first since New Year's Day 2014, with the winger enduring a 12-month absence with a cruciate ligament injury, while Ozil has had a knee problem and was making his first start since October. Theo Walcott (right) scored his first goal  in 12 months for the Gunners against Brighton on Sunday . Kieran Gibbs (left) congratulates Walcott after his early strike put his side ahead against the Seagulls . The duo's recovery is a timely boost for the Gunners, who have also been strengthened by the returns of Olivier Giroud, Laurent Koscielny and Aaron Ramsey in recent weeks. 'It's like having new signings in the dressing room,' Walcott said. 'Having the likes of Mesut back, getting a goal and playing very, very well - the chances will come to get games. 'There is competition for places now and it's going to be a headache for the manager to pick his best 11. 'Those players who have come back have done very well and it just shows we've got a great squad when everyone's completely fit. 'I think we can compete for anything this season now.' Mesut Ozil (left) made his first start since October in reserved style as his fellow goalscorer Walcott runs to congratulate him . Arsenal play Monaco in the last 16 of the Champions League on February 25 but are currently fifth in the Premier League, 13 points behind leaders Chelsea. The Gunners' best chance of silverware appears to be retaining the FA Cup after a weekend of shocks saw Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham and Southampton all exit the competition in the fourth round. 'We've got to believe that this is a great opportunity and we want to hold on to the cup,' Walcott said. 'It's our cup and it's a massive opportunity looking at all of those teams that haven't gone through. 'It depends on the draw but we believe that with the team that we've got and the players coming back to fitness, we can beat anyone.' Following some shock results in the fourth round Walcott believes his side have a chance to retain the FA Cup . Tomas Rosicky's superb volley ensured Arsenal held off a second-half fightback from Brighton, who twice reduced the deficit thanks to goals from Chris O'Grady and Sam Baldock. After an excellent first-half display, the Gunners were left hanging on at the end and Walcott admits the team were just pleased to be through. 'That's what the FA Cup's about,' Walcott added. 'You have to give credit to Brighton, they did very well and we did very well in places. It was a typical FA Cup tie. 'It was always going to be tough given the results that happened on Saturday so the most important thing is to go through - we did that and we're into the next round.'","Theo Walcott scored the opener in Arsenal's FA Cup tie against Brighton .

"Gonzalo Higuain scored two goals, both of them controversial, to give Napoli a 2-1 win over angry Genoa which lifted them into third place in Serie A on Monday.

"Eugenie Bouchard recovered from a second-set collapse to become the first player to progress to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open on Sunday. Bouchard was cruising at a set and a double break up against world No 42 Irina-Camelia Begu but was taken to a deciding set before eventually coming through 6-1, 5-7, 6-2. The victory ensures a mouthwatering last-eight clash in Melbourne on Tuesday between Bouchard and Maria Sharapova, which would be their first meeting since the latter won their semi-final match in three sets at Roland Garros last year. Eugenie Bouchard lost the second set but recovered to win the third and reach the quarter-finals . Bouchard was tested by Irina-Camelia Begu but showed her mettle to come through in three sets . Bouchard struggled in the second set but regrouped and fought back well in the decider . Bouchard, 20, said: 'I definitely look forward to that match. I think it's always great to play the best players in the world. We've had a couple matches, and a good match last year. I think I was close. It was just a tough battle. 'But I think I've progressed a lot since then, and I definitely want to keep playing my game no matter what. Really kind of take it to her, go for my shots. That's what I want to do on the court. And it's more fun when I play that way, too.' The Canadian seventh seed was bidding to reach her fourth quarter-final in the last five Grand Slam events, while Romanian Begu was playing her first ever last-16 match at one of the sport's four majors. Although Begu had a break point in the first game, Bouchard held and then raced to the opening set in 29 minutes for the loss of just one game. Bouchard's fan club, the 'Genie Army', were in fine voice when their favourite went 3-0 up with a double break in the second set but the momentum then rapidly swung and Begu reeled off five games in a row. Bouchard takes a rest on a line  judge's chair after losing point against Begu . Bouchard admitted she took a long hard look in the mirror before the third set after her struggles . Begu failed to serve out the set at 5-3 as she was broken to love and also failed to convert two set points in the next game but she finally levelled the match on her third as Bouchard hit a double fault. Bouchard took a toilet break and came back out refocused, immediately breaking at the start of the deciding set and in the end she eased across the finish line in two hours and six minutes. She said: 'I gave myself a good long hard look at the mirror [during the toilet break] and said ""Genie, this is unacceptable"" and I kicked myself in the butt. 'It's disappointing for me because I want to play so well and I want to be perfect. That's not possible. I think I started being a bit less aggressive, a bit too passive and that's not my game at all. I don't do well when that happens. 'But I learned a lot from it and I'll try to make sure it doesn't happen next time. I'm happy that I could regroup and play a bit better tennis in the third.

"With Tomas Rosicky rolling back the years against Brighton on Saturday to help Arsenal to a 3-2 win in the FA Cup fourth round, there has been no shortage of plaudits for the Czech midfielder. Certainly, the 34-year-old has proven himself to be one of Arsene Wenger's most successful signings since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2006. We asked JustArsenal blogger Bob Allock to give us the rundown on how Rosicky has won over so many fans' hearts and etched himself into Gunners' folklore. Tomas Rosicky is proving his worth to the Arsenal cause and deserves a contract extension at the club . Rosicky put in a man of the match performance as Arsenal beat Brighton 3-2 in the FA Cup fourth-round . After the Arsenal and Czech Republic star Tomas Rosicky put in a fantastic creative performance at the heart of midfield, which rightly earned him the Man of the Match award, Arsene Wenger was quick to heap praise on the 34-year old. The Frenchman said, 'He was wonderful. A player we all love. If you love football, you love Rosicky. On top of that he's a fantastic character, scored and I'm very pleased for him.' And this just highlights what the Arsenal fans have known for a long time, that Rosicky embodies the manager's football philosophy. The way that Rosicky plays the game, with superb technical ability and the drive and attacking intent to go with it, is what we want to see from the Gunners. The way he can control and set the tempo of the game, as well as some of the outrageous bits of skill he produces is the reason why the fans call him `little Mozart`. Some people do not seem to appreciate his talents quite as much, as Phil Neville showed by calling his reverse passes against Brighton `disrespectful`. Neville later claimed that his comments were tongue in cheek, but I for one don't buy it. Some people still seem to want football to return to the days of heavy leather boots and ball on muddy pitches, with defenders allowed to get away with GBH to stop these uppity skillful players making fools of them. Arsenal fans, however, and most modern football fans, appreciate special talents and Rosicky has certainly been one of them. He may not weigh in with lots of goals for the Gunners, but he has blessed us with some special and important ones and he is one of those players that is worth the ticket price alone. One of the longest serving Gunners, Rosicky embodies the way that Arsenal want to play the game, with panache and with entertainment a close second to results. He scored with a well taken volley to give help restore Arsenal's two goal cushion in the second-half . Rosicky joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortumund in 2006 and has since made 235 appearances for the club . His superb goal yesterday, giving the Brighton defenders `the eyes` and effortlessly volleying in the return pass from Giroud was special but his goal against Sunderland last February was probably his best and more typical of his all-round contribution. It was more of a team goal for one thing, with Rosicky picking the ball up on the right and going on a mazy run and making not one, but two deft one-two's with Cazorla and then Giroud as he made the Sunderland players look like they were standing in treacle as he burst into the box and finished with a sublime dink over the keeper. So there was no doubt from Arsenal fans that he was worth the contract extension that he signed towards the end of the last campaign or that he is worth another at the end of this one. More surprising to us is that Wenger has not made more use of him, with just six starts in all competitions so far this season and three of those in domestic cup games. Yesterday's performance was not unexpected from our midfield maestro at all. Rosicky is no spring chicken but he always shows the same energy, enthusiasm and ability as ever and I for one am hoping to be able to appreciate him more this season and at least one more. Sign him up Arsene, because talents like Rosicky do not come along too often. Follow @JustArsenal on Twitter .

Stoke manager Mark Hughes' attempts to sign Barcelona forward Adama Traore have been given the green light by the player's manager Eusebio Sacristan. Hughes watched the Catalan club's second string at the weekend with a view to asking after Adama and his team-mate the striker Sandro. Barça B lost again and are now just one place and one point above the drop zone but it seems Barça B coach Eusebio is still open to the idea of players leaving. He said: 'It is a question of talking to all parties. I wouldn't close any doors because it is no good having players here whose heads are elsewhere'. Barcelona youngster Adama Traore (left) has emerged as a target for Mark Hughes' Stoke revolution . Hughes watched Barcelona B at the weekend where he also ran the rule over striker Sandro . The comment was understood to refer to speedy winger Adama who has already starred and scored for the Barcelona first team in the Copa del Rey this season.

It is vitally important that Barcelona stay in the second division in Spain because of the drop in quality from the second division to the four regional divisions in the third tier.

"Kylie Radatti, 34, was given a six month jail sentence after she upset a stranger's child by spinning them too fast on a merry-go-round . A woman who upset a stranger's child by spinning them too fast on a merry-go-round has been given a six month jail sentence. Kylie Jean Radatti, 34, was attending the Bongo Beat event at a Gold Coast park on Sunday where she was playing with a number of children at a public playground. Ms Radatti asked a four-year-old boy if he wanted a turn but when she began spinning him around the boy became upset and screamed, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. On Monday, she pleaded guilty to one count of public nuisance and was handed a six month jail sentence but was released on parole. Ms Radatti said she told the four-year-old she was going to go fast before he jumped on the merry-go-round at Justins Park in Burleigh Heads. 'He said he'd have a go. He had a bit of a scream then he got off and the other kids jumped on and off we went,' she told the Bulletin. 'There was one family that decided they wanted to ring the police and they hunted me down and handcuffed me in front of everyone.' In Southport Magistrates Court, Prosecutor Ben Fotheringham told the court Ms Radatti spun the playground ride and caused the child to scream for help, adding that he was 'incredibly distressed' by being spun around fast. Ms Radatti's solicitor said the Burleigh Waters woman was 'heavily intoxicated' at the time but that the matter did not involve violence. Ms Radatti, 34, was attending the Bongo Beat event at Justins Park in Burleigh on the Gold Coast . 'This is possibly what could best be described as poor decision making, but no other parents were opposed to this,' he said. Magistrate Dermot Kehoe said Ms Radatti had risked injuring the four-year-old boy, and that she should not have been playing with strangers' children. Court documents show Ms Radatti has a criminal history dating back to 2005. She was convicted of a number of other offences including assault occasioning bodily harm, assaulting or obstructing a police officer, breaching probation and bail conditions, and other public nuisance offences. In Southport Magistrates Court she pleaded guilty to one count of public nuisance and was handed a six month jail sentence but was released on parole .","Kylie Radatti, 34, was attending the Bongo Beat event at a Gold Coast park .

"The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran visited the Bali Nine ringleaders on Australia Day as Indonesia announces that their executions will not be ordered for at least another week. Chan's older brother Michael arrived first at Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali, on Monday followed by Sukumaran's mother Raji, wearing dark sunglasses. Sukumaran's younger brother, Chintu, walked into the jail with his younger sister, Brintha, both looking visibly upset after the visit - which may be one of the last times they see their sibling alive. The relatives of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, who have had their pleas for presidential clemency rejected and are on track to face the firing squad, were accompanied by the Australian consul-general Bali Majel Hind.

As their lawyers are in the process of applying for a second judicial review, Bali governor, Made Mangku Pastika, says he believes most Australians would support the execution of Chan and Sukumaran for heading an operation to smuggle 8kg of heroin into Australia in 2005. 'I think that our brothers and sisters from Australia will agree with the process and law here,' he said. Spokesman for Indonesia's attorney-general, Tony Spontana, said the executions of six drug offenders last week were still under evaluation. 'Evaluation on the first execution implementation is predicted to be finished this week,' he said on Monday, Channel Nine reported. 'After the evaluation of the first executions is finished, then we will prepare for the second round.' Kerobokan prison governor Sudjonggo told reporters he saw Sukumaran meeting his mother and siblings in the visitors' hall, and Chan with his brother in a separate room. 'I don't want to bother them, let them make the most of the visiting hours,' he said. 'They have asked for more relaxed visiting hours, and with that, maybe (Sukumaran and Chan) will be stronger.'

Michael Chan getting out of the car to visit his brother at Kerobokan prison in Denpasar on Monday . The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (seen as a child in picture above) are pleading for mercy . The families made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates. On Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Joko Widodo , following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia. The decision comes as Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie and Alan Jones, have joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities. Quilty, who became a mentor and close friend of Sukumaran after he was jailed, has used his creative talents to create a powerful video in support of the pair. Claudia Karvan,  Missy Higgins Megan Washington, and  Andrew Denton are among those who have come forward to take part in the I Stand For Mercy video. 'The message is just for the boys to know there are people walking with them in this very dark time,' Quilty told news.com.au. The 41-year-old is trying to organise a candlelight vigil for the pair, to 'send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.' 'I want the barristers to walk into that prison and tell the boys how many people are thinking of them and supporting them,' he said. The relatives of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.

Megan Washington (above), and Andrew Denton are among those who have come forward to take part in the I Stand For Mercy video . Raji Sukumaran, Myuran's mother, said that she was 'sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed' if he saw their efforts towards reforming themselves and every aspect of the running of the jail. Mrs Sukumaran told The Sydney Morning Herald that she was confident that if the president could see how much they had changed he would put a stop to the executions, which have been scheduled to happen this year. The pair have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. Brian Brown joins other Australian media personalities in showing support for Chan and Sukumaran . Richard Roxborough has also joined the I Stand For Mercy Campaign . Ranjini Sukumaran, the mother of Bali Nine ringleader Myuran Sukumaran, said that he is a different person . Myuran's younger brother Chinthu Sukumaran said that Indonesian authorities needed to actually visit the prison to see the changes that had occured. 'Everyone who goes in there and spends a couple of minutes, they are just very impressed,' he said. The pair have dedicated much of their time to advocating against the very illegal activity that landed them in jail - drugs. Chan and Sukumaran have also instigated tertiary courses in computer studies, arts, English, and graphic design. Sukumaran is only a year away from completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts through Monash University, and along with Chan has aided the introduction of cooking, philosophy and psychology lessons and a first aid course. Bali locals have made a show of support, coming out to buy Sukumaran's art in the wake of his rejected clemency appeal. Chan and Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for execution and could face the firing squad next week . Chinthu Sukumaran (far left), Michael Chan (left), Ranjini Sukumaran (right) and Brintha (far left) speak to journalists about their desperate plea to have their family members freed . His mother made an emotional appeal on Saturday, speaking of how sorry her son was and how much he had changed as an individual. 'No mother should have to go through this, it's killing us. Please, something has to be done, please help,' Channel Seven reported Mrs Sukumaran as saying. Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified'. 'I've been told my son will be taken out and shot at any time. I don't know what to do. He doesn't deserve to die.' The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite. 'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days. 'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days . Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified' for her son . 'There are no words that would make it better, [it's] just to be there with him,' he said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke to both men's families on Friday and said the Australian government was 'continuing to make every possible effort' to stop the executions. Mrs Sukumaran did not comment on what's being done to try to save her son but said she had full confidence in the Australian government. 'I'm not giving up and I know the Australian government will do everything it can to bring the boys home or even to stop the execution,' she said. 'They can't do this to them.' Michael Chan said he was not giving up hope because 'there are things that are being done' that would remain 'behind closed doors'. But the reality of his 31-year-old brother's fate was hitting home. 'The last couple of days have probably been worse for wear,' he said. 'I don't think I've felt this way, probably, since the beginning when it first all happened. But to know that we're sort of nearing the end of the road is heartbreaking.' Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006 . Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution . Despite Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said earlier in the week that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed. 'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said. 'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC. If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot. Chan was arrested at the age of 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring . 'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said. Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad. Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them. 'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said.","Families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran visit pair on Monday .

"For Jack and Nancy Gatewood, not even death could separate them. A tale of true love, the pair, both 88, met as high school students in Ash Grove, Missouri. They soon became sweethearts and were married for 68 years, until recently when they died less than 16 hours apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Mrs Gatewood, who was a homemaker, had been in hospital dealing with complications related to a broken hip, pneumonia and flu before passing away around 5.30pm on January 15. A tale of true love, the pair, both 88, met as high school students in Ash Grove, Missouri (pictured in front of their family home's special oak door) Mr and Mrs Gatewood were highschool sweethearts and married for 68 years, until recently when they died less than 16 hours apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma (pictured on their 50th anniversary) Mr Gatewood, older by seven months, was heartbroken after spending three weeks away from his wife while she was in hospital - the first time they spent an extended time apart since the Second World War - and died without ever learning of his companion's passing, according to Tulsa World. Before his family could tell him of the news of his devoted wife, Mr Gatewood, a retired insurance worker, died around 8.30am on January 16 as a result of cardiac arrest. However, his family believes he suffered from a broken heart. 'I think he was missing her and didn't know where she was,' said son Jack Gatewood II, a pastor in Keller, Texas. He added: 'We believe it was a broken heart. I know that's old-fashioned to say, that it doesn't hold up medically. But she had been gone from his life, and we believe he was grieving for her.' As the time apart was difficult for Mr Gatewood, his family said people at his care home would find him wandering and asking where his wife was while she was in hospital. The couple married in April 1946 upon Mr Gatewood's return from serving in the Navy and then relocated to Oklahoma where they lived for 47 years (pictured on their wedding day) Suffering from dementia, he was unable to remember when they told him. And when she passed away, Jack II was on his way to see his father, who died before he reached him. The last time Mr and Mrs Gatewood were together was in December. Jack II said: 'The last time we saw them together they were kissing and holding hands. We were not expecting them to pass.' The couple married in April 1946 upon Mr Gatewood's return from serving in the Navy and then relocated to Oklahoma where they lived for 47 years. Originally from Three Sands, Oklahoma, Mr Gatewood was living in nearby Everton, Missouri, at the time, when he and his soon to be sweetheart were joined together. He transferred to her high school in Ash Grove following the burning down of his school. The pair began dating their junior year of high school and remained dating throughout Mr Gatewood's two years of serving in the Navy. After they exchanged vows, the couple lived in their midtown home where they raised sons Jack II, Brad, Todd and Marc. They are survived by their sons, four grandchildren and three great-grand children. The reason they were able to stay married for so long was because of their devotion and commitment to each other, said Jack II. He said: 'They were very committed to marriage. They loved each other a lot, they were both faithful and they depended on each other.' As they enjoyed traveling and visits with friends, their favorite time together was spent with family. By standing at the front door to their home, it was even evident family was important with the special door made of oak and that had symbols to mark each of their children. Serving as a model for a successful marriage, their sons said the pair were in sync in everything they did and it was not until later in life that they ever saw their parents argue. Jack II said it was a blessing his parents were able to depart together. Bonded together by love for nearly 69 years of marriage, Jack and Nancy Gatewood of Tulsa, Oklahoma entered into eternal life separately, less than 16 hours apart. Nancy passed away Jan. 15, followed by her husband Jack the next morning on Jan. 16. Jack Gatewood was born in Three Sands, Oklahoma on February 28, 1926. Nancy Gatewood was born in Ash Grove, Missouri on Sept. 26 also in 1926. Having met during high school in Ash Grove, MO Jack and Nancy were married in 1946 upon Jack’s return from service with the U.S. Navy during WWII. After marrying, they moved to Tulsa, OK residing here until their deaths this week. Nancy was a devoted wife and homemaker while Jack built a career in life insurance, working 43 years for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. until his retirement in 2005. The major focus of their lives was making a home for their four sons and enjoying extended family. They were long time members of Memorial Baptist Church in Tulsa. Jack was a Life Member of the Million Dollar Round Table and served on numerous Tulsa boards. He was also active in the Rotary Club of Southside Tulsa. Nancy was a member of the American Sewing Guild and used her gifted creativity in numerous ways but especially in designing her own clothing. Their favorite times together were spent with family, friends, and traveling. Jack and Nancy are survived by four sons: Jack Gatewood and wife Janie of Keller, Texas; Brad Gatewood and Todd Gatewood both of Tulsa; and Marc Gatewood and wife Alecia of Cape Coral, FL. They also leave four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Source: Ninde .","Jack and Nancy Gatewood were residents of Tulsa, Oklahoma for 47 years .

Then on Boxing Day her husband Troy Henricks re-proposed to her and gave her the engagement ring they never got around to buying when they eloped six years earlier. But she had also been suffering chest pains and just two weeks ago she decided to go to hospital to make sure it was nothing more serious than fluid on her lungs. A CT scan was done to check for lung clots but when oncologists started coming into the hospital room to check the results Ms Henricks knew something was wrong. The scans revealed that the breast cancer she had been cleared of in August had in fact spread to her lungs and chest, with three masses on her left lung and an 8-9cm node in the middle of her chest.

'I know it sounds really selfish but I want to make sure my littlest remembers me. 'I know my eldest will, but with those memories you don't want to have the older kid and the dad reminding the youngest what happened.' Also on her list is to go on a big overseas holiday. 'I've always wanted to travel with my husband,' Ms Henricks said. 'We've been married six years now, and the honeymoon was a one night camping trip.

"Only in Australia! A hilarious video of a policeman joining in with a street cricket match during Australia Day celebrations has gone viral internationally. In a quintessentially Aussie scene, the uniformed policeman enthusiastically smashes the ball all over the street whilst onlookers cheer him on. Rhett Lee, owner of Body Revival Personal Fitness Solutions (and with a name suitably similar to that of Australian cricket legend Brett Lee) posted the video and has already received around a million views. Lee and his flatmate Joshua Tootell, both 26, were hosting a beach-side Australia Day BBQ - cooking snags, listening to Triple J’s Hottest 100 and playing barefoot cricket on the road in the NSW town of Wollongong, south of Sydney. On Tuesday, they were reacquainted with their new mate and the star of the hysterical video: Constable Adam David, posing for a photo together with huge grins as they marvelled at their overnight fame. Scroll down for video . Australia Day party host Joshua Tootell (centre) and the street match fielder Eddie Pantoja (left) are reacquainted with cricket-playing policeman extraordinaire Constable Adam David (right) The policeman first began by bowling and was able to bowl someone out by his third ball . The policeman then took to the crease to bat, impressing with his ability but losing the ball for the day when he hit a six . The street, Cliff Road, had been shut down for Australia Day Wollongong City Council festivities. When a patrol car stopped at the end of the street, they were certain their game was about to be shut down by an officer. ‘He sat for a while in the car watching while we played. We thought he was watching us to try and shut the game down,’ explains Mr Tootell. ‘We had the speakers on the road for the countdown, we had all our beers with us,’ said guest, Lloyd van Gogh, who explains that his day started with a swim and some beers from breakfast. ‘We thought we were getting in trouble. 'A cop had come through earlier and told us you can’t have beers, but we just hid them and they came back out soon after.' Those present were all stunned when a smiling policeman exited the car with his hand extended, asking if he could join in and have a bowl. The policeman didn’t hold back, bowling fast and furiously to the delight of onlookers. Joshua Tootell (left) and Rhett Thomas-Lee hosted the Australia Day festivities where the match took place . Lloyd van Gogh (far left) also attended the party and says the policeman is a 'fulltime legend . The policeman runs between wheelie bin wickets as he joins in with an Australia Day street cricket match . ‘He bowled someone out, he had good form!’ said Mr Lee. ‘Everyone had their cameras out. He said “I hope this doesn’t end up on the Internet!” and we said “oh yeah, sure,”’ laughed Mr Tootell. The footage of the policeman’s excellent innings was indeed posted on the internet and has now being an Internet sensation. It was soon the policeman’s turn to show off his batting prowess. ‘We put him in to bat and he ended up smashing three good balls,’ explained Mr Lee. ‘He had good technique with the bat, I’d say he must play on weekends,’ said Mr van Gogh. However, the policeman inadvertently did shut down the cricket match when he sent the ball sailing over the fence. The crowd cheers as the policeman hits the ball for six - until they realise the ball has been lost for good . The three men all agree that it was wonderful to see a policemen get into the spirit of Australia Day and enjoy himself with the community . ‘He hit a six -so he was six and out. But he actually hit the ball over the fence and we couldn’t get it back, so that was the end of the game,’ said Mr van Gogh good naturedly. ‘But the police officer was a full time legend! Such a good bloke,’ said Mr van Gogh. ‘He was high-fiving people as he walked back to his car.’ After he lost the cricket ball, the policeman made a quick departure. ‘He said, “okay, time to move on, catch you guys later,”’ said Mr Lee. ‘He was having a ball, everyone was excited because he interacted and had a lot of fun.’ The three men all agree that it was wonderful to see a policemen get into the spirit of Australia Day and enjoy himself with the community. ‘He was just showing us that we’re all human. It was Australia Day so he was letting his hair down on a day you’re meant to enjoy yourself with everyone,’ said Mr van Gogh. ‘I've always had a good opinion of police. It’s a tough job but they keep our streets clean and safe,’ he added. ‘I have lived in Wollongong for eight years and I have never, ever felt unsafe, even if I’m walking home late at night.’ ‘I have a really good opinion of police.’ Mr Lee also says that the police officers interaction with the South Coast community is a wonderful quality. ‘It’s great here on the South Coast. Most of the police officers are very down to earth. ‘It’s really nice that even if they’re trying to shoo you along they will always be really happy and cheerful .There’s that South Coast vibe to it all and people really enjoy the interaction!’ As far as they know, everyone was well-behaved on Australia Day with a family-oriented feel on the streets of Wollongong.","A good-natured police officer has joined in with a cricket match .

"A catfight broke out in a Spanish maximum-security prison when a model accused of shooting dead her millionaire British businessman ex-boyfriend confronted a rival prison beauty over a stolen mini-skirt. Pretty Mayka Kukucova, 25, was punched in the face after confronting a suspected Mexican drug dealer she accused of stealing her favourite skirt. Prison guards stepped in to save the Slovakian after she was punched in the face in the gym at the Costa del Sol jail where she is being held for allegedly shooting wealthy jeweller Andrew Bush dead in front of his new lover last April. Mayka Kukucova was allegedly punched in the face in a row with another inmate over a stolen mini-skirt . The Slovakian model, 25, is accused of shooting dead ex-boyfriend Andrew Bush at his Costa del Sol villa . Inmates at the maximum-security Alhaurin de la Torre prison near Malaga have taken sides in the dispute . Kukucova (left) is said to have been jealous of Mr Bush's new love Maria Korotaeva (right) Governors at maximum-security Alhaurin de la Torre prison have now ordered staff to keep a close watch on the pair - revered as the jail's two best-looking women - for fear of another outbreak of violence. Gypsy women in the prison close to Malaga have sided with Kukucova while south American inmates are supporting the Mexican, known only as Guadalupe. An insider said: 'The two women have never seen eye to eye but now they hate each others' guts. 'The problems started because Kukucova accused Guadalupe of being behind the disappearance of her favourite skirt. 'They had an argument which ended up with some hair-pulling and Mayka getting punched in the face. 'The other woman took a kick to the back before she was pulled off from one of the gypsy women who jumped in to defend Kukucova. 'Prison chiefs are worried things could get out of hand because the inmates have divided into two rival groups with one supporting the Slovakian and the other the Mexican. 'Staff have been told to keep a close watch on both women to make sure there's no repeat. 'No-one was badly injured this time round but it might not be the same story if there is a next time.' Kukucova told prison bosses she was set upon first when she was quizzed about the incident but both women ended up being thrown into isolation as punishment. Kukucova is led away after being arrested in her native Slovakia for allegedly shooting dead Mr Bush . They promised to resolve their differences after a dressing-down before authorities agreed to keep it out of the prison register. Another source said: 'Kukucova is the only one who comes anywhere near to Guadalupe in the beauty stakes. 'They're both breathtakingly attractive. 'Kukucova's probably assumed there was only going to be one other woman in their prison that could possibly wear the miniskirt that went missing from her cell.' Police put out an international arrest warrant for the Slovakian beauty after she was seen driving off in Mr Bush's Hummer after allegedly shooting him dead on April 5 last year with an Italian-made .38 revolver inside his rented £2,500-a-month villa near Estepona. The divorced dad-of-one, 48, had jetted to the Costa del Sol with Russian girlfriend Maria Korotaeva, 22, for a romantic weekend away to celebrate their five-month anniversary. Maria told murder squad detectives Kukucova was lying in wait for them when they arrived and she heard a row and shots after leaving them inside the house to argue before his ex fled with the keys to her lover's 4x4. His car was later found abandoned about 20 miles from the scene of the shooting. Kukucova with Mr Bush in happier times before the pair split. She reportedly remained obsessed with him . Kukucova and the inmate she confronted are reportedly revered as the jail's two best-looking women . Kukucova was extradited to Spain last May after handing herself more than 2,000 miles away in Slovakia. She was remanded in custody by a judge who is still investigating the killing before deciding whether to recommend formal charges against the part-time model. Kukucova is being formally investigated on suspicion of Mr Bush's homicide, which in Spain carries a maximum 15-year jail sentence, rather than the more serious charge of pre-mediated murder. Miss Korotaeva revealed after the killing Mr Bush had the change the locks on his home in the UK because Kukucova was obsessed with her ex. She told a newspaper: 'His daughter told me she was crazy jealous because we in love and she kept looking at pictures of me. 'Andy couldn't bear to hear her name. She was not nice to anyone.' Mr Bush's daughter Ellie, 20, has claimed her dad had to ask Kukucova to find a new job after hiring her as an assistant in one of his Gold Trader shops in Bristol when she started behaving erratically because she was worried he was seeing other women.

"A rugby star dubbed 'scrumbag' after his wife accused him of cheating, gambling and lying has spoken of his joy as the reunited couple showed off their newborn son. Andy Powell's wife Natasha tweeted  his sexually explicit text messages, torched his clothes and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes following a split last year. But she later took back the former Wales and British Lions forward after he promised to change his ways.

'I've got a few days off now to spend time with Tash and Henry and then I'll be back training. The boys have been great and sent us a top with Powell on the back for little Henry.' On the day Henry was born, Powell called his team mates at the Newport Gwent Dragons to say he wouldn't make their afternoon match against Cardiff Blues. But Natasha's labour - which lasted just an hour and a half - was so quick he managed to get there in time to see them lose 11-9. Prolific tweeter Powell has also been sharing pictures on social media of his new experiences as a dad.

She auctioned his wedding suit, rugby memorabilia and even romantic letters and cards she had received from him. At the time she said: 'I've been pushed to the absolute limit. It's extreme to sell Andy's things on ebay but I can't get him to take me seriously. Everything about him I don't recognise anymore - he isn't the man I married.' But the pair then reunited in May when Natasha discovered she was pregnant and friends have said they are now very happy. Office worker Natasha, who had previously suffered two miscarriages, decided to give Andy one last chance for them to be a family. She has said: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time. 'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track. 'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.' The 6ft 4ins forward was capped 23 times for Wales and toured with the British Lions before turning to rugby league with Wigan. He then moved back to Wales to play for the Newport Gwent Dragons.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored for the first time in five league games, blasting home a penalty as Paris Saint-Germain secured a scrappy 1-0 win at Saint Etienne to stay four points behind leader Lyon, who beat 10-man Metz 2-0 in Sunday's earlier game with top scorer Alexandre Lacazette limping off shortly after scoring. The win moves PSG up to second place, level on points and on goal difference with bitter rival Marseille, while St Etienne remains in fourth spot. 'The whole team did well and we're starting to play the right away again. The team spirit's improved and we've won four (games in a row),' PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi said. Paris St.Germain team-mates Edinson Cavani and Marco Verratti congratulate scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Talisman striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic fires in this penalty to secure three points for Paris St.Germain . The Swedish striker fired in the winner from the penalty spot as the Parisians struggled at St Etienne .

'We're still within touching distance and that's a good thing, because it's very important not to let Lyon get too far ahead of us. We've beaten St Etienne three times this season, so that shows that PSG's not finished.' Ibrahimovic was kept quiet until the second half, when his 60th-minute spot-kick finally broke St Etienne's stubborn resistance. It was awarded after midfielder Jeremy Clement was adjudged to have handled the ball, with replays showing it struck him just at the top of his right arm. As he was preparing to take the kick, Ibrahimovic removed some debris thrown onto the pitch and composed himself before shooting hard to the left of goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier, who almost got his fingers to the ball. Moments earlier, Ruffier saved with his legs after Ibrahimovic latched on to a fine pass from midfielder Marco Verratti and tried to clip the ball over him. Ibrahimovic, who scored the winning goal away at St Etienne in the League Cup quarter-finals two weeks ago, missed a chance to make it 2-0 in the 70th when he rushed his shot and his strike partner Edinson Cavani hit the crossbar with a neat lob five minutes later. However, Ibrahimovic was lucky not to be sent off in injury time for going in late and high on Romain Hamouma with a wild and dangerous lunge, escaping with a yellow card. St Etienne lamented the penalty decision but failed to hit the target once. PSG midfielder Marco Verratti escapes the attention of three St Etienne players on Sunday night .

"Brendan Rodgers insists Mario Balotelli can still forge a career with Liverpool – and believes he is ready for the fight. The Italy striker has not started a game for Liverpool since November 8, when they lost 2-1 to Chelsea at Anfield, and there is a doubt about whether he will even be in the squad for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge. Rodgers spoke with Balotelli at Melwood last week about how he expects him to play and the demands that he places on his forwards, emphasising they have to press and be intense in their work – qualities which the 24-year-old has yet to show. Brendan Rodgers confirmed that Mario Balotelli will have another chance to prove himself at Liverpool . Balotelli's last start for the Reds came against Chelsea on November 8 (pictured) A cloud has hung over Balotelli’s future at Anfield for many months but Rodgers is not yet ready to call time on his chances of making a contribution and does not see the imminent return of Daniel Sturridge as a barrier to his prospects. ‘We will give Mario every chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘We brought him here to show consistently he can play at the top level. It has been a difficult period but he is a good boy who wants to fight for his place. Players have been out of the fold but shown they can get back in and stay in. ‘It doesn’t matter whether Daniel Sturridge is coming back. It improves our squad. They played well together at Tottenham. We will see how Daniel is today [Monday]. He trained very well with the team yesterday and it is as confident as he has looked. Balotelli challenges Jose Enrique (right) during a training session at Melwood last week . Daniel Sturridge (back left) is nearing a Liverpool return but will not be rushed back into the team . ‘We won’t risk him, that is for sure. We need to make sure he is ready and feels ready. He won’t be 100 per cent when he comes back. He will need game time, but all we can do is make sure he is in the best condition he can be physically and mentally.’ Rodgers, meanwhile, has urged his squad to exploit any lingering hangover Chelsea are suffering from the way they capitulated against Bradford; Liverpool’s manager recognises the threat of Jose Mourinho’s side and is respectful of them but, equally, he feels his own troops have nothing to lose. Liverpool finished the first leg in the ascendance last Tuesday and Rodgers feels they played well enough to have won comfortably. He now wants his players to replicate that effort and secure the club’s first trip to Wembley since 2012. Raheem Sterling scored a superb equaliser for the hosts in the 59th minute of the Capital One Cup semi-final . Eden Hazard scored a penalty to give Chelsea the lead against Liverpool in the semi-final first leg last week . ‘The result at the weekend does not help,’ said Rodgers. ‘They will have great motivation and after a game like that you want to put it right, but there is also in the back of your mind even if you are 2-0 up you can lose so there can be trepidation. ‘It is a different game at Stamford Bridge but we were a real threat going forward and good defensively. We controlled the counter-attack really well and looked a threat going forward. I thought we took that into Bolton but could not get the goal. ‘The team is on the up and confidence is really high. We have great confidence. It is very important and we will do everything we can to get there. Winning a trophy is a priority and it is a one-off game to get us there.’","Mario Balotelli has not started a game for Liverpool since November 8 .

"Lost in the snow: Julie Abrahamsen, 20, was in the wilderness for three days - but survived . A snowboarder who vanished into icy backcountry and was lost for three days and nights has been found alive. Julie Abrahamsen, 20, set off for a day on the slopes at Whistler resort in Canada on Wednesday - but got lost after heading off-piste, and was gone for two nights before the alarm was raised. Abrahamsen, who is from Norway, hadn't told her roommates when to expect her back, so neither they nor her family in Europe realized anything was amiss until days had passed. On Friday, police, dog teams and a rescue helicopter scrambled to comb the snow-covered mountainside where they feared she had been stranded. She was found more than a mile away from the limits of the resort after a rescue pilot spotted her footprints through thick fog, Canada's Global News reported. Thanks to mild conditions, which had seen temperatures higher than 40 degrees, Abrahamsen had been able to survive the nights, even though the fog and rain made her harder to track down. Her last known location had been 11am at the top of the Glacier Express chairlift in Whistler's Blackcomb resort. Rescuers said she was soaked to the skin when they found her, and had apparently tried swimming across a part-melted creek in the hope of finding help. She was more than two days' walking from the nearest roads. Rescue experts said that had the temperatures been more typical of the high-altitude ski resort, she could easily have died. They also said her Nordic heritage may have helped her survive the cold. Rescued: Abrahamsen is pictured above on Saturday getting off the helicopter that saved her. Rescuers say she was soaked through, but otherwise apparently unharmed . Two day gap: Abrahamsen's roommates did not realize anything was amiss until Friday - by which time she had been gone two days already . Abrahamsen's condition was not immediately clear, but she was able to walk a few paces to be loaded onto an ambulance from her rescue chopper. Global News reported that she is believed to have been discharged Saturday night, and she has since been pictured by friends on social media in her apartment. Brad Sills, of Whistler's Search and Rescue team, said of her survival: 'It’s not just three normal days. It’s three days of extremely inclement weather... To find somebody with a strong spirit that’s able to endure that past three night’s weather, that’s a big win for all of us'. Tough spot: The helicopter's pilot noticed Abrahamsen's footprints in the snow - despite fog and rain impeding the search . Safe an sound: Abrahamsen, center with chips and KFC, was reportedly discharged Saturday evening and was seen enjoying herself with friends later that day . Abrahamsen's father, Knut Peder, said he and his family feared the worst. He revealed: 'We were in deep, deep, deep grief and panic about our little girl, knowing that she was out there in the mountains alone. 'We were praying and hoping she was alive, fearing that she was injured or even worse.' In the wake of her resuce, Abrahamsen posted her thanks on Facebook, saying: 'After three rough days lost in the mountain, I have never been happier to be back to civilization and dear Whistler. 'Thanks to my concerned dad, the best roomies, a good rescue staff, good doctors and all the friendly, caring, helping people/seaoners of Whistler.'","Julie Abrahamsen went off-piste in Whistler, Canada, on Wednesday .

"David Cameron and William Hague will respond to intense pressure from mutinous Tory Eurosceptics today by unveiling an EU referendum Bill. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary will back draft legislation which, if passed in the Commons, would formally confirm Mr Cameron’s pledge to hold an ‘in/out’ vote on Britain’s membership of the EU by 2017. The extraordinary move emerged as around 60 Tory rebels prepare to attack the Queen’s Speech for its lack of a referendum Bill in an amendment tomorrow that has turned into a public relations disaster for the Prime Minister. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama provided back up for Prime Minister David Cameron at a joint news conference in the White House in which he echoed Cameron's stance on Britain's EU membership . David Cameron and Barack Obama were due to discuss the Syrian conflict and the G8 summit but the press conference was dominated by questions about Tory turmoil over Europe . Barack Obama and  David Cameron leaving the stage in the East Room of the White House in Washington . Barack Obama gives David Cameron a friendly pat on the back as they depart after a joint news conference . Speaking at a press conference US President Barack Obama offered a well-timed rebuff to Tory rebels calling for an early referendum on leaving the EU . In the past few days, a string of . senior colleagues, including two Cabinet ministers, have fanned the . flames by suggesting they would want Britain to quit the EU if a . referendum were held now. However Mr Cameron was thrown a . lifeline last night when President Barack Obama backed his plan to try . to ‘fix what’s broken’ before holding a referendum. The legislation to be unveiled today . will probably end up being put forward as a Private Member’s Bill but is . unlikely to become law because it would require a substantial amount of . Parliamentary time and Liberal Democrat co-operation. It has been drafted by Conservative Central Office, rather than the Foreign Office, because it is not a Government Bill. However a senior source confirmed the . Prime Minister would vote in favour of the legislation if it is brought . forward by a backbench MP. Mr Cameron’s aides hope the move will help . convince the public – and his party – that he is committed to holding a . referendum if he wins the next election. Socially the two leaders get on well, apparently discussing cricket and basketball outside their political duties at the press conference . Mr Cameron also used the meeting to launch a EU-US free trade deal ahead of next month's G8 summit . UKIP has doubled its support in a single month at the expense of the three main parties – reaching a record 18 per cent, a poll revealed last night. The Eurosceptic party has surged from 9 per cent as its leader Nigel Farage claimed the Tories and Labour were considering fielding joint candidates with him. Labour, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have all lost four points each, taking them to 34 per cent, 28 per cent and 11 per cent respectively, according to the Guardian survey. It is unprecedented for all the main parties to fall at the same time. Mr Farage’s approval ratings have also soared to 40 per cent in his favour, with 23 per cent against – a net positive of 17. David Cameron hit a new personal low of minus 15. They also hope it will force Labour leader Ed Miliband either to back it or be seen to be denying the public a vote. Downing Street was delighted by . President Obama’s support for Mr Cameron’s attempt to keep Britain in . the EU by negotiating a better deal with Brussels. At a joint press conference in the . White House, Mr Obama said: ‘David’s basic point, that you probably want . to see if you can fix what’s broken in a very important relationship . before you break it off, makes some sense to me. I know that David’s . been very active in seeking some reforms internal to the EU. Those are . tough negotiations. You got a lot of countries involved. I recognise . that. ‘But so long as we haven’t yet . evaluated how successful those reforms will be, you know, I, at least, . would be interested in seeing whether or not those are successful before . rendering a final judgment.’ His remarks represent a marked shift . in the attitude of the Obama administration, which had previously warned . the UK not to flirt with the idea of leaving the EU. However, he made . it clear that, in US eyes, Britain’s place in the world would be . diminished if it quit. Mr Cameron, speaking hours after . Education Secretary Michael Gove and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . revealed they would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were held now, . insisted there was no point answering ‘hypothetical’ questions about a . vote that will not be until 2017. He refused to say how he would vote if . a referendum were held now and made clear his irritation with ministers . who are fuelling the debate on Europe. ‘What matters now is making sure we do . everything we can to reform the EU to make it more flexible, more open, . more competitive, and improve Britain’s relations so that when we have . that referendum before the end of 2017 we give the British people a real . choice,’ he said. Should David Cameron bring forward the EU referendum? He hit back at Tory grandees, such as . former Chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont and former leadership . contender Michael Portillo, who warned last week that there was little . chance of securing enough meaningful concessions from Brussels. ‘We should not give up before the . negotiations have started. That is a pretty extraordinary way to go . about things,’ Mr Cameron said. The Prime Minister insisted it would . not be in Britain’s ‘national interest’ to hold a referendum now, as . some Tories are demanding. An immediate poll would offer the . public ‘a false choice between the status quo, which I don’t think is . acceptable, and leaving’, he said. ‘I don’t think that is the choice the . British public wants or the British public deserve. Everything I do in . this area is guided by a very simple principle, which is, what is in the . national interest of Britain.’ David Cameron is in Washington for talks with US President Barack Obama, but the trip has been overshadowed by questions over Tory splits back home over Europe . Mr Cameron was forced to slap down Tory ministers calling to leave the EU, ahead of talks with President Obama on tackling global tax avoidance and ending the conflict in Syria . Britain is to send another £10million in military aid to Syrian rebels, David Cameron announced yesterday amid ‘growing evidence’ the rogue regime is using chemical weapons against its own people. The Prime Minister said Britain would be stepping up military aid to rebel fighters, despite warnings the equipment could fall into the hands of Al Qaeda terrorists who have flooded into the country to help topple dictator Bashar al-Assad. Mr Cameron said Britain could not stand on the sidelines as thousands of Syrians were slaughtered, adding: ‘Syria’s history is being written in the blood of its people and it is happening on our watch.’ The £10million, which represents a doubling of military aid this year, will be spent on non-lethal equipment such as body armour and radios. Eurosceptic MP Andrew Rosindell . insisted Mr Cameron would not be able to refashion Britain’s . relationship with Brussels to a sufficient extent. He said: ‘I think . David Cameron has huge abilities and he is bound to secure some . concessions but will he secure the ending of political union for . Britain? I don’t think so. I’m not convinced that’s possible. ‘I do believe David Cameron is sincere . in wanting this referendum. I think that the people of this country . must understand that the only hope of getting out of this mess of Europe . is a Conservative government with a majority.’ Bridgwater and West Somerset MP Ian . Liddell-Grainger said Britain should ‘come out’ of the EU, adding: ‘I’m . sick to death with it. It’s bankrupt. It’s pushing us to do things we . don’t want to do. It’s a dictatorship from Brussels.’ Sheila Gunn, press secretary to John . Major when his premiership was dogged by Tory divisions over Europe, . warned there were ‘some parallels’. ‘Is now really the right time to make a . fuss of it?’ she said. ‘You could... say now that the Conservative . Party is handing the election to the Labour Party.’ Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable . said the Tories had ‘a bee in their bonnets and an obsession on Europe’ adding: ‘There’s no reason we should have a debate now, the focus . should be on the economy.’ Security briefing: Mr Cameron met FBI Director Robert Mueller against a backdrop of images from the Boston Marathon during a tour of the Strategic Information Operations Center (SOIC) at the FBI .

"A former Colorado jail officer who was arrested on suspicion of killing his wife three years after police ruled it a suicide insisted that scratches on his chest after her death were from shaving. But the marks across Tom Fallis' chest - and the fact his DNA was found under his wife's nails - suggest that the couple had been in a struggle before he shot her, KDVR-TV reported. The new evidence has emerged in the report by journalist Justin Joseph, whose damning reports about the case led to police agreeing to reopen the investigation in April last year. In November, Tom Fallis was arrested on suspicion of killing his wife, Ashley Fallis, in January 2012. Loss: Ashley Fallis, pictured with her children, was found dead on New Year's Day 2012 after he husband said she committed suicide. But three years on, her husband was arrested and further evidence has emerged . Ashley, a 28-year-old mother-of-three, was found shot in the back of the head after a booze-fueled New Year's Eve party at the Fallis home turned sour when Tom Fallis learned someone had brought marijuana to the party and became enraged. Fallis, who was working as a Weld County corrections officer, called 911 in screaming hysterics to say his wife had committed suicide. He angrily denied that he had anything to do with his wife's death and Evans police quickly ruled that Ashley had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. But Ashley Fallis' family never believed she had killed herself and campaigned for police in Evans to reopen the case and investigate whether her husband was responsible. A police interview after her death has now shown Tom Fallis denying the scratches across his chest and neck had anything to do with her death. 'I didn't shoot my wife,' he insists in the interview, which was recorded. 'Tell me what happened then!' the detective responds. 'Why do you have scratches on your body?' Denial: In an interview after his wife was found dead (pictured), Tom Fallis insisted they had not fought on the night of her death - despite witness accounts - and said he had not killed her . 'Evidence': Investigators took photos of his chest, which showed signs of scratches after her death . Wounds: Scratches can be seen on his neck - and investigators say his DNA was found under his wife's nails . Protests: In the interview, Fallis insisted the scratches were from his skin being irritated after he shaved. He can be seen demonstrating how he scratched his chest . 'When you shave your chest you do this all day!' he says, lifting up his shirt and scratching his chest. The marks were swabbed for DNA and photographed, KDVR reported. Arrest: After pressure from Ashley Fallis' parents, Tom Fallis, pictured, was arrested in November . Ashley Fallis' nails were also swabbed - and sources told the station that those swabs tested positive for her husband's DNA, 'calling into question whether Fallis lied that night', Joseph reported. But the DNA and scratches are not the only pieces of evidence that raise questions. Among the details that KDVR uncovered: A friend at the party who said he overheard Ashley crying for her husband to get off of her; a neighbor who said he heard outside his window as Tom Fallis confess to killing his wife; reports from Ashley's parents that he had been violently angry before Ashley's death; clear evidence of a struggle in the bedroom where Ashley's body was found. Most shockingly, one of the the Fallis' young children, age six, told police that she saw 'daddy getting the gun ready' and 'saw daddy shoot mommy'/ . 'He was irate and explosive. He was abusive with his words and he was telling us he hated us, and to 'F everybody' and then he went into the room and slammed the door,' Ashley's mother, Jenna Fox, told KDVR. But in the interview, Fallis insisted that he never argued with his wife. After he claimed the scratches were not from Ashley, the detective asked: 'Why would she tell you to get off of her then?' 'I was never on her,' he responded. Determined: Ashley's mother, Jenna Fox, who has fought for justice, called the new DNA evidence 'powerful' Scene: A photo shows the Fallis' bedroom at their home in Evans, Colorado where Ashley was found dead . And in a bizarre twist, he claimed he found two alleged suicide notes from Ashley late last year - nearly three years after her death. Ashley's mother, Jenna Fox, told KDVR that it's 'suspect' that he's only just come forward with the notes. 'If anything they are probably notes from Ashley discussing her struggle as a wife and not her alleged intention to kill herself,' she said. In November, he was arrested in Bloomington, Indiana, where he had been living with the couple's three young children after fleeing Colorado. He was extradited back to Colorado. He has always maintained his innocence. The children were handed over to Ashley's parents, Jenna Fox and Joel Raguindin. The couple had never gave up their search for justice. They rallied friends and supporters to picket outside the police station when Ashley's death was ruled a suicide.

"The National Football League sold prints online of a football player's obscene gesture after fining the athlete thousands of dollars for doing it. Earlier this week, the NFL fined Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch $20,000 for grabbing his crotch after a touchdown in the National Football Conference championship game  on Jan. 18. The NFL fined the player and threatened to give the Seahawks a 15-yard penalty if Lynch performed his infamous crotch grab during Super Bowl XLIX, according to NBC Sports. Fined: The National Football League fined Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch $20,000 for grabbing his crotch (photographed here) after a touchdown in the National Football Conference championship game .

The NFL was quick and strict in punishing the athlete, but meanwhile has been selling a framed photograph of the gesture online at its NFL Shop. The League has made a profit off of the crotch grab while Lynch has been forced to pay. On the NFL Shop website, a photograph of the crotch grab is seen along with four other photographs in a collage commemorating the Seahawks as the 2014 NFC Champions. The 20-by-24-inch print was listed at $149.95. The news about the League's action spread sparking outrage.

"The Green party does not believe people should be banned from joining ISIS or Al Qaeda, its leader has revealed. In an extraordinary claim, Natalie Bennett said people should not be punished for what they think and stressed it should 'not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation'. More than 600 people from Britain are thought to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadists, with security forces warning returning fighters pose the biggest terror threat to Britain. Scroll down for video . Natalie Bennett said people should not be punished for what they think and stressed it should 'not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation' The Green party has seen a surge in support in recent months, doubling from 5 per cent saying they would back them in October to 10 per cent in a recent YouGov survey. Party membership has also risen dramatically, with the Greens claiming to have overtaken both the Lib Dems and Ukip, bolstered by a row over whether Miss Bennett should be included TV election debates. But after years in the political wilderness, few people know what the party stands for, beyond its environmental credentials. Green Party policy states 'it should not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation or have sympathy with its aims, though it should be a crime to aid and abet criminal acts or deliberately fund such acts'. On BBC1's Sunday Politics Miss Bennett was challenged about the policy and whether that would make it legal for people living in Britain to join brutal terrorist groups such as ISIS. She said: 'This is a part of our policy that I think dates back to the age of the ANC and apartheid South Africa.' Pressed on whether that meant it would be allowed to be a member of Al Qaeda or IS, she said: 'Exactly. What we want to do is make sure we are not punishing people for what they think or what they believe. 'Obviously actions of inciting violence, supporting violence, those are absolutely unacceptable, illegal and should be pursued to the full extent of the law.' She added: 'What we are talking about is a principle that you shouldn't be punished for what you think. And we need to balance, we do not protect freedom by destroying it.' Security agencies warn Britain faces a severe threat posed by extremists inspired by ISIS fanatcis in Iraq and Syria . David Cameron will take part in TV election debates, the Tory party chairman indicated yesterday. Grant Shapps said discussions were 'edging towards a solution' and that the Prime Minister 'wants the debates to happen'. The move comes after broadcasters issued a 'take it or leave it' warning that the debates – now involving seven parties – would go ahead with or without the PM. Membership of ISIS was formally banned when it became prescribed organisation last summer. Security minister James Brokenshire said at the time: 'Proscription is a useful weapon in the armoury at the disposal of the government, police and security service to disrupt terrorist activity and protect the UK.' On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned Britain is at 'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists inspired by ISIS jihadis. Speaking ahead of a counter-terror summit in London, he warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack'. Mr Hammond stressed the danger of terror attack in the UK by people inspired by ISIS, also known as IS and Isil. He said: 'We have to regard Isil as probably the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security at the moment. 'There's a very significant risk of an Isil-inspired attack being planned and, if we are not successful in intercepting it, executed by Isil sympathisers who live in the UK but are inspired by what is going on in Iraq and Syria.' A YouGov survey last week put the Greens on 10 per cent, up from 5 per cent when the Labour party set up a unit designed to tackle the threat of the minor party . A surge in support for the Green party cld cost Labour 22 seats, a polling expert has warned. The Greens have been boosted by a row over TV election debates, with David Cameron refusing to take part if the Greens were excluded. Labour fears it could lose vital left wing votes to the smaller party, including former Lib Dem supporters. Robert Ford of the University of Manchester, carried out analusis of local election results 2010. It found 22 marginal seats Labour needs to win or cling on to where more than 10 per cent of voters are identified as being Labour/Green-inclined. It includes Lib Dem strongholds such as of Bristol West, Norwich South and Cambridge, Tory-held Hove, and Brighton Kemptown, and Labour-held Birmingham Edgbaston and Tooting. Mr Ford told The Observer: 'The voters fuelling the Green boom share one characteristic with supporters of the Ukip and SNP insurgencies – a deep-seated disaffection with the political establishment. 'Besides the general problem of disaffection, Labour also faces a specific problem with the Greens into political competition. 'Young, highly educated, cosmopolitan liberal idealists, Greens are more or less the polar opposite to Ukip's ageing, socially conservative, nationalist electorate. Labour is losing votes to both, but any policy that appeals to one pole will anger those at the other.' Mr Hammond added: 'Of course, our security and intelligence agencies, our police forces are working tirelessly around the clock to monitor, to identify, to intercept and to disrupt plots of this nature, and we've been very successful in doing so, but we mustn't be complacent. 'We know there are people out there who wish us harm and we have to be vigilant and we have to work extremely hard to make sure we identify and disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack.' Police and security officials have warned Britain is facing an 'almost inevitable' attack by fanatics who have been 'militarised' by ISIS. Miss Bennett also set out the Greens' views on defence, which include scrapping the Trident nuclear deterrent, leaving Nato and cutting the size of the armed forces. 'We obviously need to be able to defend our own borders, civil defence, and we have a real responsibility as a rich country to contribute to UN peacekeeping forces,' she said. Asked if that meant a home defence force, she said 'yes' but would not give figures on how many personnel that would require. On immigration policy, she said in the 'medium term' the party's policy was to progressively reduce UK immigration controls. She added: 'What we want to do now is allow people who should have the right to be in the country, to be in the country. What we have to do is stop the race to the bottom on immigration rhetoric that we have been hearing, led by Ukip and sadly followed by the other (parties). 'People who should have a right to be here - which means asylum seekers and refugees - we are not treating them properly and we need to. 'British people who want to live with a foreign, non-EU spouse or partner here, on the Government's own figures 19,000 Britons can't live in their own country. 'We saw last year the number of foreign students applying to British universities going down. 'All of those are things that are causing real damage to people's lives.' Asked whether the party was committed to an 'open doors' policy because it believed 'richer regions do not have the right to use migration controls' she said the short-term policies would be those in the manifesto but added: 'In the longer term, thinking about 20, 30 years hence, we are talking about a different kind of society, a society in which the world is more equal, where it is more balanced.'","Natalie Bennett insists it should not be illegal to join any organisation .

"A  woman could face the death penalty after she was charged with murder for allegedly luring a young mother from Georgia to her death in a plot to kidnap her two children and claim them as her own. Catherine Goins, 37, is accused of shooting dead Natalia Roberts, 30, last year, and if convicted, would be only the second woman on Georgia's death row. Goins, of Hixson, Tennessee, had pretended she was pregnant and called police claiming she had shot an intruder inside her ex-boyfriend's home. Twisted plot: Catherine Goins, 37 (left), could face the death penalty after police say she shot dead mother-of-two Natalia Roberts (right), 30, so she could claim her two children as her own . Lured to her death: Officials say Goins brought Roberts to her ex-boyfriend's house in La Fayette, Georgia, under the pretense of wanting to give her some baby clothes . Lookout Mountain Judicial Circuit District Attorney Herbert 'Buzz' Franklin filed a motion Thursday to seek the death penalty against Goins. But an investigation has revealed that Goins' home invasion story was nothing but a lie concocted to cover up a disturbing abduction plan, Catoosa County Sherif Gary Sisk told reporters, according to the station WRCB. Investigators say Goins met Natalia Roberts, a mother of two, last September and lured her to the La Fayette home of her former paramour, Tony Richards, claiming she had some baby clothes for her. When Roberts showed up at 227 Smoketree Circle sometime between 11am and 1pm, Goins allegedly shot her in the back of the head from a .380 caliber handgun as they were walking down a flight of stairs. Before fleeing the crime scene with the victim's two young children in tow, Goins allegedly tried to cover up her tracks and called her ex-boyfriend, Tony Richards, telling him she had shot someone inside his residence. Now, prosecutors are keen to seen the maximum penalty for her crime. However, the move is fairly rare, as prosecutors rarely pursue the death penalty against women. According to the Department of Corrections, out of the 85 inmates on death row in Georgia at the beginning of last year, only one inmate was a woman. Goins' attorney, Public Defender David Dunn, said the judicial circuit's four judges are deciding which one of them will preside over the case, according to The Times Free Press. Young mom: Roberts (far right) was a mother to a three-week-old baby and a three-year-old toddler . In cold blood: Sheriff's officials say Goins shot the woman (pictured) in the back of the head and then took off in her car with the victim's two children . After a decision is made, that judge will hold  pretrial hearings to decide whether prosecutors can seek the death penalty. 'We're calling it murder because that's what it is,' Sheriff Sisks told reporters. 'She flat-out murdered her.' In murder trials, lawyers typically choose between two routes of defense: Either the police mistook the defendant for the real killer, or the defendant killed the victim in self-defense. Dunn has not discussed which he will pursue. Gruesome sight: When the owner of the house returned home, he found Roberts' lifeless body . The sheriff added that Goins' most recent boyfriend broke up with her after discovering that she had been lying to him about being pregnant, so she decided to present Roberts' three-week-old baby as her own. When Tony Richards returned home, he discovered a woman's lifeless body on his property and called 911. He then contacted Goins, who was fleeing with Roberts' two children, and convinced to return. By the time police officers responded to the crime scene, the 37-year-old suspect made her way back to the La Fayette home. When interviewed by police, Goins reportedly said she was at Richards' house when she heard a noise. She ran to the bedroom, grabbed a gun and shot at a 'darkened shadow' in the hallway, according to Northwest Georgia News. Catherine Goins was arrested on September 23  on charges of malice murder; felony murder; tampering with evidence, and possessions of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Natalia Roberts' two children, a 3-year-old and a 3-week old, are currently staying with family members.","Catherine Goins, 37, is facing murder charges in the shooting death of Natalia Roberts, 30, a mother of two from Georgia .

"Arrest: Darriean Hess faces two charges of negligent manslaughter . A 19-year-old woman has been charged today after plowing into a group of cyclists, and killing two of them, as she drove without a license. Darriean Hess was charged with two counts of negligent homicide and two counts of assault after hitting four cyclists taking part in a charity ride on Saturday morning. Two Massachusetts friends, Pamela Wells, . of South Hamilton, and Elise Bouchard, of Danvers, were killed and two . of their friends were injured after being hit on a bridge at 8.30am. As Hess, from Seabrook, New Hampshire, was charged over the deaths, it emerged that police had stopped her the previous day for driving without a license. She has been accused of driving too fast for the road conditions and number of cyclists, when she crossed over a center line and hit the riders on a bridge, district attorney Jim Reams said. Her victims had been taking part in the 40th annual Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century ride. The 19-year-old had been stopped on the same road eight hours before the crash and ticketed for driving without a license. Hampton Police Chief James Sullivan said the officer in that stop followed policy when he issued her an appearance ticket then allowed a friend to pick her up and drive the car away.

"A 19-year-old unlicensed driver who killed two charity cyclists 'only looked away from the road for a couple of seconds', a New Hampshire court heard yesterday. Darriean Hess was charged with negiligent homicide and second-degree assault after plowing into four bike riders on a Seabrook bridge. Her court appearance came on the day police arrested a second woman who has been accused of providing drugs to Hess and allowing her to drive without a license. Charged: Darriean Hess, pictured in September, who is accused of killing two bicyclists while high on a cocktail of drugs and alcohol told witnesses her dead mother was coming to get her after the tragic crash . Cindy Sheppard allegedly supplied narcotics to Hess at about 1.30am on Saturday and, at 8am that day let her drive a car even though she knew the teenager did not have a license. The 48-year-old is being held on $10,000 bail and is due to be arraigned on Thursday, according to Boston.com. Police have not said what drug Sheppard allegedly gave Hess, but she was described as 'a significant source of heroin,' Seacoast Online reported. Sheppard had been arrested on charges of selling heroin and cocaine in June and was also said to be the person who picked Hess up after police pulled her over hours before the crash. Under New Hampshire law, no plea was entered on Hess's behalf, but the court heard from a retired police major, who said he saw her driving so fast over the bridge he thought she was being chased. As she went over the bridge she hit four cyclists, killing Pamela Wells and Elise Bouchard, and injuring Margo Heigh and Uwe Uhmeyer. Accused: Cindy Sheppard, left, allegedly let Hess, right, drive knowing she didn't have a license . Arrest: Cindy Sheppard is accused of supplying drugs to Hess on the day of the crash . She continued to drive a short distance, coming to a stop after crashing into the Welcome to Seabrook sign.

After the crash, retired police major David Kelley claimed Hess told him she only took her eyes off the road for a few seconds. She is being held on $50,000 bail after the court ruled she could be a flight risk as she has family in Alaska. Gordon Wiley, who was friends . with Ms Bouchard, said after the hearing he was pleased she was being held on a high bond. 'She didn't have any conscience when she got back in the car [after being stopped earlier] and I didn't see any tears rolling out of her eyes when she was sitting there,' he told Seacoast Online. Concern: Hess's fiance Scott Martin and sister Cassandra Clifton don't know if they can afford the bail . He added that his wife was a close friend of Ms Bouchard, and often cycled with her but had ducked out of doing the Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century because she was new to the sport. Hess's family and lawyer said the 19-year-old was 'traumatized' by the accident and her sister said they didn't think they would be able to afford the bail. Her sister. Cassandra Clifton, said: 'Everybody's devastated.' adding that Hess 'just wants to be close to her family'.

"A teenager was killed when he crashed a jet ski into his twin brother, an inquest has heard today. Simon Satchwell, 14, from Hertfordshire, was riding the ski while on a Christmas holiday with his family in Abu Dhabi, along with his twin brother Lucas and father Christopher. The family had been riding near Al Lulu Island on New Year's Eve, the last day of their two-week stay in the United Arab Emirates capital, for around half an hour when Mr Satchwell and Lucas headed back to the coast, an inquest heard. Simon Satchwell, 14, was killed when he crashed a jet ski into his twin brother in Abu Dhabi, an inquest has heard today . Hertfordshire Coroners Court heard the father and son stopped their skis and had a drink of water as Simon carried on by himself around 300 yards away. Mr Satchwell told the inquest he then saw his son turn to head towards them but momentarily lost sight of him as he passed behind Lucas' stationary jet ski. Moments later, the inquest heard that Simon, a talented science student, crashed into his twin at high speed. The impact threw both him and his twin from their machines and into the water. Simon was taken to shore by his father, who tried to resuscitate him as Lucas sought help from the local coastguard. Simon was believed to have died instantly. Mr Satchwell described seeing his son riding in circles to create small waves to jump over, around 300 yards from him and Lucas moments before the crash. 'He was aimed back towards us and I was still chatting to Lucas,' he said. 'When Simon hit the jet ski, I couldn't see him over the top of Lucas' jet ski at the point of impact. I was looking straight at Lucas as I spoke to him. 'There was no shouting and the engine note (of Simon's jet ski) didn't change at all until the point of impact.' When interviewed at the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital, hours after the death of his twin, Lucas told authorities: 'While I was talking with my father I felt a strong blow against my jet ski and fell in the water. 'I saw my brother come off his jet ski. My father took him toward the coast and we tried to give him first aid but to no avail.' Edward Thomas, senior coroner for Hertfordshire, heard that the family had also hired two jet skis on Boxing Day, five days before the accident. He rode one with a son as a passenger, allowing the other son to ride the second jet ski alone for 10 minutes at a time before swapping. Mr Satchwell said they had also previously ridden with him on jet skis during holidays in 2012 and 2013 to Tunisia and Lanzarote, and they 'fully understood' how to ride them responsibly, despite not having any certification or formal training for their use. Mr Satchwell said he had spoken with a forensic scientist in Abu Dhabi, five days after the death of his son, who had suggested that Simon may have been unconscious when the crash occurred. He said an emergency stop lanyard, attached to Simon's wrist as a safety precaution, had not been pulled before the crash. 'It was just a freak accident.' He said the sea conditions were very calm in that area and a small wave could have taken Simon by surprise, causing him to hit his head and lose control. The inquest heard that the jet skis had been hired at around 3.30pm on the same day. Mr Satchwell claimed he had hired a 1200cc turbocharged machine, with his two sons each riding 900cc models. However, the documentation from the hire company recorded that only two jet skis had been hired, a 1200cc model and an 1800cc model. Mr Satchwell told the inquest this was incorrect and said they appeared to have been altered after he had signed them. A public prosecutor in Abu Dhabi launched an investigation and spoke to Lucas, Mr Satchwell and emergency services before closing the investigation, with no technical report examining the jet ski ordered. Mr Satchwell said he had not requested one as it would have meant 'at least six months' in the country and the jet skis had all appeared to be in perfect working order. Mr Thomas said he would be writing to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to highlight differences in legislation governing jet ski hire in foreign countries and suggest that the Royal Yachting Association's guidelines - which require riders aged under 15 to be accompanied on jet skis at all times and formal certification for riders aged 15 to 17 - be adhered to. 'I can't imagine how awful this has been for all three of you, in particular Lucas,' he said. He recorded a narrative verdict, stating that Simon died of injuries sustained while riding a jet ski on his own in Abu Dhabi. Following his death, Simon's friends posted tributes on Facebook and Twitter, while Sir John Lawes School named an annual science lecture in his memory. Simon's parents declined to comment after the inquest.","Simon Satchwell, 14, was riding the ski while on holiday with his family in Abu Dhabi, along with his twin brother Lucas and father Christopher .

"A former Sky TV worker is fighting for her life in a coma today after breaking her neck in a horrific car crash in the Caribbean where she was living and working as a diving instructor. Kate Clayton from Southampton suffered the devastating injuries when her car swerved off a country road in the Cayman Islands. The 30-year-old expat, who moved to the islands in December 2013, was driving her Jeep Wrangler 4x4 home from a night out when she lost control going round a tight corner and slammed into a tree. Kate Clayton, a former Sky TV worker, who is now a diving instructor in the Cayman Islands, who is in a critical condition in hospital following a car crash . She was today fighting for her life and was in a coma after sustaining serious injuries to her back as well as a broken neck and pelvis. It was thought her father, Bill, had flown out to be at her bedside at George Town Hospital, on Grand Cayman, where her condition was described as serious but stable. The 30-year-old, pictured broke her neck in the horrific crash, while she was driving home in her Jeep Wrangler . Friends on the island told how Miss Clayton had been out at a bar and restaurant called Over The Edge on the night the crash happened. She moved to Grand Cayman, which is popular with British tourists, in December 2013 after leaving her job as an analyst at broadcaster Sky.

"Banks are behaving 'disgracefully' by refusing refunds to victims of conmen, the former boss of a major lender said yesterday. Peter Burt, who was chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said money stolen through 'vishing' should be returned to customers automatically. Vishing is where fraudsters masquerading as bank staff telephone customers and tell them to transfer money to another account as soon as possible. Scroll down for video . Peter Burt (pictured), who was chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said money stolen through 'vishing' should be returned to customers automatically . The victims – often old and vulnerable – are told their cash is at risk from cybercriminals but soon find it has vanished. The scam is a variant of 'phishing' using a voice on the phone instead of emails. Even after the fraud has been discovered, many customers do not get their money back because the transfers were authorised by the bank. Sir Peter urged such victims to take legal action. 'Somebody needs to bring a law suit against banks that receive money from fraud and refuse to give it back,' he said. 'If I had been defrauded, I would bring a criminal charge against the bank. 'A bank will, of course, say it carried out all the reasonable checks but I don't think that's good enough. It's a disgrace.' Vishing is where fraudsters masquerading as bank staff telephone customers and tell them to transfer money to another account as soon as possible (stock image) Sir Peter, who left Bank of Scotland in 2003 following its merger with Halifax, told The Sunday Times that banks were accomplices to fraud by opening accounts for conmen who, in most cases, provide false identification. The British Bankers' Association last year launched an awareness campaign called 'Know Fraud, No Fraud'. It stressed that no bank will ever ask for a full PIN or password by phone or email and that staff will not call for a transfer to be authorised. A spokesman said: 'Banks are determined to stop such crimes. It is important cases are handled on a case-by-case basis and banks work with customers.'","Peter Burt, former chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said money stolen through 'vishing' should be returned to customers automatically .

"A young driver accused of killing two bicyclists while high on a cocktail of drugs and alcohol told witnesses her dead mother was coming to get her after the tragic crash, it has emerged. Darriean Hess is awaiting trial on charges of negligent homicide, DUI, second-degree assault and manslaughter after she veered across the double yellow line and into a group of cyclists competing in a bike race in September last year. After sending bodies flying and plowing through a sign that read 'Welcome to Seabrook Beach,' the troubled New Hampshire 19-year-old's Honda came to a stop and, hysterical in the driver's seat, she told worried onlookers, 'My mom is coming to get me.' In fact, her mom, Cherie, had died six years earlier of a drug overdose, aged 48. Charged: Darriean Hess, pictured in September, who is accused of killing two bicyclists while high on a cocktail of drugs and alcohol told witnesses her dead mother was coming to get her after the tragic crash . Darriean's siblings found their mom kneeling in the backyard with her face in the dirt, ending a chapter of . heartache that only led to another. According . to the Boston Globe, the now-20-year-old is the youngest of five . children. Her mother battled drug and alcohol addiction throughout . Darriean's young life and her father, whom she never knew, had for years sexually abused her eldest sister, Cassie. With . her mother dead, Cassie left college and took up custody of her younger . siblings for a period, then Darriean moved to Alaska, her mother's home . state, to stay with her granmother. She moved back to Seabrook, New Hampshire, in her late teens but never truly settled. That hectic, drama-filled life culminated in the fatal crash on September 21. Pam . Wells, 60, controller of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wife, and . mother of two teens, and Elise Bouchard, a 52-year-old customer service . manager, had trained months for the charity ride that day. Accused: Cindy Sheppard, left, allegedly let Hess, right, drive knowing she didn't have a license . Fatal crash: Darriean Hess, pictured, is awaiting trial on charges of negligent homicide, DUI, second-degree assault and manslaughter after she veered across the double yellow line and into a group of cyclists competing in a bike race in January last year . Nearing . 8:30 a.m, Darriean, driving 59 mph in a 30 mph zone, crossed the double . yellow line and veered into the northbound lane, then plunged into the . two cyclists and fellow riders. Jim . Schofield, a school bus painter from Manchester, New Hampshire, was a . short distance behind the two women and witnessed, though he didn't . realise it until later, their bodies flying into the air. He ran to the Honda, and joined another onlooker in wrenching open its driver's door. That's when he saw Darriean, sobbing, and clutching a smashed iPhone. She told him she had glass in her eyes and her mouth and he told her an ambulance was on its way. 'Do I f**** look like I need an ambulance?' the teen asked, and the men said yes. 'My mom is coming to get me,' she said according to Schofield. Darriean grew more upset, before insisting, 'I only took my eyes off the road for a second.' Some bicyclists helped the injured while others vomited as they came upon the bloody scene. Wells and Bouchard's spinal cords were crushed, their hearts and lungs lacerated. Concern: Hess's fiance Scott Martin and sister Cassandra Clifton don't know if they can afford the bail . Driver: Hess was taken to Portsmouth Regional Hospital for treatment of minor injuries . Wells' windower, Tom Rogers, is following Darriean's case closely. He wants . her to take a plea bargain, but he doesn't want her to go to prison. 'I would like to see her come out of this a better person,' he told the Globe. 'People say I'm being soft, but I'm not sure justice would be served (if she goes to jail).' Yet, he doesn't want her to get off completely free. 'Her messed-up life has messed up my life and other families' lives, and now we're all damaged goods,' he said. Darriean, . who was driving without a license at the time of the crash, had her . last court appearance in September 2013, and came on the same day police . arrested a second woman who is accused of providing drugs to the . wayward then-teen. Cindy . Sheppard allegedly supplied narcotics to Darriean at about 1.30 a.m. the morning of the crash and, at 8 a.m. that day let her drive a car . even though she knew the teenager did not have a license. The 48-year-old gave Darriean fentanyl, a painkiller much more potent than morphine. Tragic: Elise Bouchard, left, and Pamela Wells, right, were killed in the crash on Saturday morning . Site: The scene after Hess allegedly plowed into four cyclists taking part in a charity ride in New Hampshire . Sheppard . had been arrested on charges of selling heroin and cocaine last May but . was out on bail when Darriean called her to pick her up after police . pulled her over hours in the early hours. Under . New Hampshire law, no plea was entered on Darriean's behalf, but the . court heard from a retired police major, who said he saw her driving so . fast over the bridge he thought she was being chased. As she went over the bridge she hit four cyclists, killing Wells and Bouchard, and injuring Margo Heigh and Uwe Uhmeyer. She continued to drive a short distance, coming to a stop after crashing into the Welcome to Seabrook sign. The . 19-year-old, who is engaged, had been stopped by police near the spot . of the accident only a few hours before for driving without a license. Gordon Wiley, who was friends . with Bouchard, said after the hearing: 'She . didn't have any conscience when she got back in the car [after being . stopped earlier] and I didn't see any tears rolling out of her eyes when . she was sitting there.' He added that his wife was a close friend of Bouchard, and often cycled with her but had ducked out of doing the Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century because she was new to the sport. Heartbroken: The family of Elise Bouchard, left, including her husband Robert Bouchard, right, are devastated . First time: Wells, pictured, was planning to ride 100 miles for the first time and had been working up toward it all summer . Darriean's . family and lawyer said she was 'traumatized' by the accident and her . sister initially said they didn't think they would be able to afford the . bail. Cassie Clifton, said: 'Everybody's devastated,' adding that her sister 'just wants to be close to her family'. Hess . has been accused of driving too fast for the road conditions and number . of cyclists, when she crossed over a center line and hit the riders on a . bridge, district attorney Jim Reams said. Her victims had been taking part in the 40th annual Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century ride. The 19-year-old had been stopped on the same road eight hours before the crash and ticketed for driving without a license. Hampton Police Chief James Sullivan said . the officer in that stop followed policy when he issued her an . appearance ticket then allowed a friend to pick her up and drive the car . away. 'It's unfortunate that the incident happened the next day but the officer had no way of knowing that,' Sullivan said. Reams would not say if the young woman's license had been suspended and . said only that she did not currently have a New Hampshire driver's . license.","New Hampshire woman Darriean Hess is awaiting trial on charges of negligent homicide, DUI, second-degree assault and manslaughter .

"An insider who was with Tiger Woods in Italy on Monday has poked a giant hole in the golfer's claim his front tooth was knocked out when he was smacked in the face by a photographer. Nicola Colli, secretary general of the organizing committee for the race Lindsey Vonn won in Cortina D'Ampezzo, claims to have been alongside Woods during the so-called crush of paparazzi his agent claims caused him to lose a tooth. 'I was among those who escorted him from the tent to the snowmobile and there was no such incident,' Colli said. 'When he arrived he asked for more security and we rounded up police to look after both him and Lindsey.' Scroll down for videos . Missing something? Tiger Woods lost one of his two front teeth after a cameraman knocked it out on Monday before he congratulated his skier girlfriend Lindsey Vonn on her win at the women's World Cup in Italy . Unrecognizable: Woods hid behind shades, a hate and a scarf as he prepared to surprise his girlfriend . The golfer revealed the gap in his mouth as he congratulated Vonn following her winning run- her 63rd World Cup victory. 'During a crush of photographers at the awards' podium at the World Cup event in Italy, a media member with a shoulder-mounted video camera pushed and surged towards the stage, turned and hit Tiger Woods in the mouth,' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg said. 'Woods's tooth was knocked out by the incident.' The identity and network of the camera operator was not included in the statement, nor was it clear what Steinberg claims became of the tooth. Previous pictures of the golfer show the tooth that was knocked out was discolored. Vonn broke Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 World Cup wins with a flawless run down the Olympia delle Tofane course, finishing 0.85 ahead of Anna Fenninger of Austria. Still wearing his skull-adorned ski mask, Woods weaved through the crowd unnoticed until he shared an emotional embrace with Vonn, who had no idea that the golfer was coming. 'No way!' Vonn exclaimed when she spotted him. 'I didn't think this could get any better than yesterday with my entire family here but now with Tiger here this is unbelievable,' said Vonn. 'I said, ""I can't believe you came."" And he said, ""I told you"".' Woods did not speak with reporters. Something to hide? Woods, who surprised Vonn after her win, covered his face with a mask on Monday . Cause for concern? Earlier photographs of the golfer show the front tooth was discolored. This image shows Woods during the 2011 Presidents Cup in Melbourne, Australia in November 2011 . 'I'm so happy to have finished the weekend with win No. 63. My family and Tiger is here. It's a really, really special day,' she said. Vonn had been on track to shatter the record two years ago before a high-speed crash at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria, when she tore two ligaments in her right knee. She attempted to return for Sochi but re-injured her knee in Val d'Isere, France, in December, 2013, requiring a second surgery. She is planning to compete through the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

"Lance Armstrong insists he would never cheat - at golf. The disgraced American cyclist - who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after admitting to doping throughout all of them - is a keen golfer and says the code of fair play is one of the things which most attracts him to the sport. He told Golf Digest magazine: 'Golf is different from the culture of cycling when I was competing, and that's putting it mildly. Cycling, it was the Wild West. Nobody considered doping cheating. Lance Armstrong insists that he would never cheat at golf, despite being stripped of cycling titles for doping . Armstrong (left) publicly admitted to cheating during his career in an interview with Oprah Winfrey (right) 'It was an arms race where absolutely anything went, and it was every man for himself. You might consider me the last guy to have anything to say about cheating, but golf is different. I love adhering to a code of honour that we in cycling didn't have. 'If I moved my ball in the rough and got caught, I wouldn't just regret it, I'd be heartbroken forever. When I think about reform in cycling, I think about golf.' Armstrong also expressed his sympathy for the way the media have treated 14-time major winner Tiger Woods after revelations about his private life led to the break-up of his marriage. 'Did the punishment for what Tiger did exceed the crime? As someone with some experience along those lines, I'd say it did. What happened was, the media changed,' Armstrong added. 'Somewhere between the end of Michael Jordan's career in 2003 and Tiger's scandal in 2009, the media stopped being compliant to athletes and celebrities. They no longer protected them, because they no longer needed them. Armstrong sympathised with how Tiger Woods (right) was treated by the media during his marriage breakup . Armstrong drew parallels to the technique's of cyclist Chris Froome (left) and Jim Furyk (right) 'In the digital world, all that matters is the scoop. The upshot is that there are no more sacred cows out there, and a lot more harshness. If John Kennedy and Frank Sinatra were alive and conducting their lives the way they did in their primes, they'd be devoured.' Armstrong also spoke about Britain's 2013 Tour de France winner Chris Froome in the interview, noting: '(Froome) does everything wrong. He's got a choppy pedal stroke. His arms are sticking out, his head is down, and he's all over the bike. 'He's the Jim Furyk of cycling, unconventional in every way. Except that it works. And the reason it works is superior cadence. His tempo is amazing. It's paced in a way that gives his unusual mechanics time to fall together.

Fewer than 10 days into his term as New York City's mayor in January 2014, Bill de Blasio was caught up in a huge scandal when he was caught eating pizza with a knife and fork. Now, every self respecting New Yorker knows that is a no-no, and caused de Blasio to have to issue a statement defending his enormous culinary faux-pau. The wrong way Mr. Mayor: Bill de Blasio caused controversy with his fork . The incident was dubbed Forkgate and de Blasio defended the approach, saying that his Italian ancestry that was behind his decidedly un-New York pizza-eating style. 'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and I’ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said. It's a method New Yorkers variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter. As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands. Schnatter knocked out a broom closet in the back of his father's tavern in Jeffersonville, Indiana, before selling his beloved 1971 Z28 Camaro to buy $1,600 worth of second-hand pizza equipment. Then, he started selling pizzas to the tavern's customers for a reasonable price. His pies proved so popular that Schnatter was able to expand his business just a year later. Now, the chain is the fourth largest take-out and pizza delivery service in the US, with more than 3,200 restaurants. Its slogan reads: 'Better Ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa John's.' A further 800 restaurants are spread across 33 other countries, including the UK and Cyprus. Thanks to the success of his business, Schnatter is now worth an estimated $600million.

"John Carver will remain in caretaker charge of Newcastle until the end of the season – and could yet land the role on a permanent basis. The 50-year-old has been told by managing director Lee Charnley to take control of United’s final 16 matches of the Premier League campaign. Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr – the men tasked with finding the new head coach by owner Mike Ashley – will now wait until the summer before making a permanent appointment. John Carver, searching for his first win, will remain in charge of Newcastle for the remainder of the season . The 50-year-old will take control of Newcastle's last 16  matches and could land job on full-time basis . Carver was on Newcastle's books as a youngster in the early 1980s but never made the breakthrough . That could yet be Carver should he impress between now and May 24, although he is still searching for his first win since taking over from Alan Pardew at the beginning of January. Derby’s Steve McClaren had been the club’s preferred choice to replace Pardew, but he wants to see out the season with the Rams as they bid for promotion to the Premier League. Following the announcement that Carver would be staying at the helm, Charnley said: 'At the beginning of this process it was my desire and intention to appoint an individual to the position of head coach who would be available to start immediately. 'Having now explored at some length the options available to us at this time, the decision has been taken to defer the appointment of a permanent head coach until the end of the season. 'The head coach will be a long-term appointment that will play a major role in shaping the future on-field progression of Newcastle United and it is vitally important that we get the right individual. Alan Pardew, left Newcastle earlier in January, and has made an immediate impact at Crystal Palace . Ajax manager Frank De Boer is among the contenders to be appointed the next Newcastle manager . Steve McClaren is Newcastle's No 1 target . 'John has a long history with the club and has the full support of the board. Our goal for the season of a minimum top ten finish remains unchanged and we are confident that John, supported by the backroom staff, will be able to deliver this.' Carver added: 'This is a proud day for me. 'I have worked with, and learnt from, the best manager that this football club has had in Sir Bobby Robson. I know what this club means to this city and its people. I believe in my players and the staff I have around me. ""I am confident that we can deliver exciting successful football and look forward with relish to my role as head coach of this great football club.' Other candidates include Ajax boss Frank De Boer and Christophe Galtier at St Etienne, although Sportsmail understands McClaren is their No.1 pick. The former England manager has a close relationship with Carr and has connections with the club’s hierarchy. His availability could depend on the success – or otherwise – of Derby’s promotion chase. Carver, meanwhile, would have to enjoy a winning end to season to enhance his chances of managing his hometown club on a full-time basis.","John Carver will remain in charge of Newcastle until the end of the season .

"An Israeli barber has created a yarmulke made from human hair to allow Jewish men to cover their heads without fear of being targeted by anti-Semites. Shalom Koresh said he was inspired to create the 'magic' skullcap, known as a kippa in Hebrew, by rising anti-Semitism- with a particular interest from buyers in France and Belgium. 'This skullcap is washable, you can brush it, you can dye it,' Koresh said in his salon in central Israel. 'It was created so people could feel comfortable going to places where they are afraid to go, or places where they can't wear it, and feel secure.' Israeli hairdresser Shalom Koresh places a yarmulke made of hair samples onto a man's head in the city of Rehovot, central Israel . France has seen a spike in anti-Semitic attacks in recent years. The killing of four French Jews in a hostage standoff at a Paris kosher market earlier this month has deepened fears among European Jews. Officials in Israel are expecting — and encouraging — a new influx of Jewish immigrants following the Paris standoff. Since the attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has encouraged European Jews to move to the Jewish state. Many Jews in Europe, especially France, say they feel unsafe walking around wearing the symbols of their faith. A 2013 European Union report found that one in five European Jews avoid wearing kippas or other Jewish symbols for fear of being harassed or attacked. The skullcap could also serve Jews traveling to the Middle East, where they encounter hostility in many Arab countries. Koresh's hairy skullcap, which he has dubbed the 'Magic Kippa,' comes in an array of shades and colors. He sells them online, starting at 49 euros (56 dollars) for synthetic hair and 79 euros (91 dollars) for ones made of natural hair. The skullcap can be fastened onto the wearer's real hair with hidden clips. 'You don't feel a thing. It feels like it is part of your hair. There isn't such a difference between this and a regular kippa. It feels the same,' said Maor Hania, who modelled a dark brown skullcap at Koresh's salon. Devout Jewish men traditionally wear skullcaps as a sign of respect and reverence for God. Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, who teaches at a prominent Jerusalem yeshiva, said that Jewish skullcaps must be visible and not hidden, but added that under certain unforeseeable circumstances, such as a risk of attacks, the 'Magic Kippa' may be valid. 'Our sages said that, for example, when we are in danger, then it's possible (to hide it),' he said, adding that the wearer should consult his own rabbi for guidance. The hairy kippa received mixed reactions among skullcap-wearing men in Jerusalem. Some said they felt ill at ease with the idea of hiding their identity abroad, but others welcomed the protection. 'It's very dangerous in France right now and it's dangerous for a person to walk outside with a kippa,' said Richard Altabe, who wore a regular black kippa atop his silver hair. 'So if this is how they can maintain their religious commitment, why not?' The barber said he had been inspired to create the skullcap, known as a yarmulke in Yiddish and a kippa in Hebrew, by rising anti-Semitism in Europe and elsewhere . The 'Magic Kippa,' comes in an array of shades and colours and is fastened onto the wearer's real hair with hidden clips after many Jews in Europe reported feeling unsafe walking around wearing the symbols of their faith .

"Chris Froome admits thinking about Tour de France rival Alberto Contador spurs him on in training, insisting the Spaniard can 'smell weakness' and knows 'when you're having a bad day'. The duo's battle for cycling supremacy began in 2013 when Froome stunned Contador with a superb display to seal his opening Tour de France victory. Contador, however, has two yellow jerseys to his name and the 32-year-old gained a psychological edge by outpacing Froome to win at September's Vuelta a Espana. Chris Froome insists his rivalry with Alberto Contador is one of sportsmanship and respect . Combat will resume at the Tour de France on July 4, with both riders desperate to reassert their dominance after crashing out last year. 'When I'm out training, I'm thinking, 'I wonder what he's up to today, I wonder how hard he's training',' said Froome at Team Sky's pre-season camp in Majorca. 'Alberto can smell weakness. He can smell it when you're having a bad day.' Contador was stripped of a third Tour triumph in 2010 after he tested positive for clenbuterol but Froome 'doesn't look back anymore' and insists his rivalry with Contador is one of sportsmanship and respect. 'If someone's better than me, they're better, I'm not even going to go down that road of thinking that they're on something or that they're cheating,' Froome said. Froome is desperate to reassert his dominance after crashing out of Le Tour last year . 'Alberto and I have both got mutual respect for each other as rivals, we don't glower at each other or try to put each other off the road or anything. 'And even from a sportsmanship point of view, if one of us punctures, or has a mechanical problem at the wrong moment you're not going to be racing off the road to benefit from that. 'I respect that side of Alberto. He is an extremely tough rival for me. If anyone knows how to win the Tour de France, it's him.' The duel takes on added flavour given the pair's contrasting styles. While Contador is a rhythmic racer, Froome is less orthodox, with Lance Armstrong describing him as 'the Jim Furyk of cycling', in reference to the golfer's unconventional swing. 'I'll take it. I know my style is different to other guys but like Lance says, it works,' Froome said. 'I am always someone who can put his head down, push on the pedals as hard as I can and try to get the most of what my body will allow me. 'Alberto compares himself to the other guys more than I do, he's more responsive to other riders. I probably like to ride my own pace. 'When guys start attacking, I don't necessarily have to follow them immediately.' Contador gained a psychological edge by outpacing Froome to win the Vuelta a Espana . Contador's challenge in Paris may be stunted by his decision to take on the Giro D'Italia less than five weeks before, while Froome is disadvantaged by the Tour route, which includes less time-trialling than in previous years. The Team Sky rider wants to weigh 66kgs - he is currently 70kgs - by the time the race comes around and, for all the strategic factors, Froome admits winning can come down to hunger, in both senses of the word. 'It's very much the battle of who's the hungriest, not just in terms of eating, but also how badly do you want that victory? How badly do you want to win the Tour de France? You can call it the Hunger Game,' Froome said. 'There's loads of days when I always tell myself, 'wait until September when the season's over and you can have as many of those as you want'. 'White chocolate, I have a weakness for white chocolate, nutella and pancakes - they're all dangerous.' Froome may be losing weight but he is building strength too, particularly in his lower back, putting in extra gym sessions five times a week to avoid the persistent problems he suffered in 2014. As well as the Tour this year, he plans to race at Vuelta Andalucia, Tirreno-Adriatico, the Tour de Romandie, Criterium Dauphine and the Fleche Wallonne. Long-term, however, Froome hopes to compete for another 11 years and take his place among the greats with multiple Grand Tour victories. 'I'd love to still be racing come 40, that would be my goal,' Froome said. 'I think it's as much a mental thing as physical. I just hope that I can keep this same hunger and determination.'","Chris Froome preparing for Tour de France, which starts on July 4 .
