"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . One day before the guffaw-inducing October 1 launch of the Obamacare program's healthcare.gov website, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough was telling friends that 'when we turn it on tomorrow morning, we're gonna knock your socks off.' Less than three weeks later, President Barack Obama asked McDonough whether it would ever be possible to make the website function reliably. 'Can it be patched and improved to work, or does it need to be scrapped to start over?' the top White House aide recalled the president asking him on October 17. Obama 'wanted to know if this thing is salvageable,' he told Time magazine. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama addressed the Affordable Care Act in a Rose Garden speech on October 1, predicting a revolution in health care, but sixteen days later he knew the online project could be unsalvageable; and three days later he was back in the Rose Garden to pivot away from the website as technicians scrambled behind the scenes . Tough times: White House chief of staff Denis McDonough (L) had the unenviable task of finding out whether or not healthcare.gov was completely dead, and telling the president . Day One: Healthcare.gov spat and sputtered its way to a horrible launch, with few Americans able to visit the site . The startling conversation happened on the day the federal government came back to work following a partial shutdown that lasted 16 days. Obama took a victory lap in a brief speech, launched into bilateral talks with Italy's prime minister, and handed the hot potato to Press Secretary Jay Carney. A frazzled Carney faced a hostile briefing room that afternoon, a gathering of dozens of reporters eager to move past the back-and-forth of shutdown politics and headlong into Obamacare. 'I think that the president’s goal is that . there’s a process in place through the various ways that people can get . access to the information they need to enroll,' he rambled during one sustained run-on, 'so that everybody who . needs affordable health insurance in states across the country can look . at the options available to them because of the Affordable Care Act, . because of the marketplaces, because of the increased competition . created by the marketplaces, and make choices that fit their budgets, . that work for them because of the subsidies available for those who have . low incomes.' CNN senior White House correspondent Brianna Keilar asked about her network's medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, who had already gone on the air twice to demonstrate the 'fixes' that had been applied to healthcare.gov. Both times, on live television, Cohen couldn't log on. Carney told Keilar that the president was personally engaged in fixing the problems. 'Nobody is more insistent that that work . be done and the experience be improved than the president, as he has . made clear,' he said, adding later that 'the people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work fixing the problems that need to be fixed, and that is the focus of the president’s attention.' Obama brought in Jeffrey Zients to supervise the repair process, but he didn't know at the outset whether it was an impossible job . CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner has been accused of keeping the White House in the dark about just how desperate the Obamacare website situation was -- and later stonewalled Congress about early enrollment numbers covering those first hectic weeks . Wunderkind: White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park may haev saved Obama's legacy by springing into action, recruiting tech-savvy veterans of the president's political operation, and patching enough software holes to get healthcare.gov working . But that focus, it turns out, was on determining whether the repair was feasible at all. When Obama addressed the nation that morning after signing the bill that sent government employees back to work, he didn't mention health care reform at all. But three days later the president delivered a passionate stemwinder in the Rose Garden, an event that White House sources at the time told MailOnline was hastily assembled. As a newly recruited team of young tech gurus worked 18-hour days to learn whether the online project should be patched or scrapped, Obama de-emphasized healthcare.gov entirely – almost telegraphing a future where call centers, walk-in appointments and paper applications would become more and more important. 'We’re also redoubling our efforts to make sure you can still buy the same quality, affordable insurance plans available on the marketplace the old-fashioned way – offline, either over the phone or in person,' he said. 'And, by the way, there are a lot of people who want to take advantage of this who are more comfortable working on the phone anyway or in person.' And in a moment that earned him mockery around the world as 'the Shamwow president,' Obama leaped into infomercial mode. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (2nd L) has been all smiles while hawking Obamacare -- except when testifying before Congress about it . All was not well: By November 7 the Obamacare website was spewing gibberish instead of communicating with medical insurance customers . 'The point is, the call centers are available.' he assured his audience. 'You can talk to somebody directly and they can walk you through the application process.' 'And I guarantee you: If one thing is worth the wait, it’s the safety and security of health care that you can afford, or the amount of money that you can save by buying health insurance through the marketplaces.' He even offered house calls of a sort. Spear-catcher: Press secretary Jay Carney took flak from all sides on Oct. 17, 2013, the day the president asked his chief of staff whether he should scrap the Obamacare website and start it from scratch . 'If you’ve already tried to apply through the website and you’ve been stuck somewhere along the way, do not worry,' the president said. 'In the coming weeks, we will contact you directly, personally.' While the president papered over the technical failures of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, White House chief technology officer Todd Park was building a dream team to right the ship, Time notes. But one recruited engineer looked at Obamacare's digital mess and delivered a stinging assessment: 'Maybe we had to tell the world we'll be back to you in six or nine months with a new site.' With turnaround specialist Jeff Zients as point man in the White House, Park's group took baby steps toward making healthcare.gov a workable site. Ten days into the project they told Ziients that they could have it shipshape by the end of November. That intermediate deadline became a Whtie House talking point, delivered by everyone from Carney to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who was desperate for good news. On Oct. 30, while she was preparing to testify before a congressional panel about the project's sequence of disasters, the website went down again – turning the computer engineers' punch list into yet another punchline. The White House did not respond to requests for comment about the president's deliberations in mid-October when he learned that healthcare.gov might not be fixable.","White House chief of staff told friends the day before launch that 'when we turn it on tomorrow morning, we're gonna knock your socks off'

"By . Richard Alleyne . The family of California teenager Jahi McMath said her 'healing begins' today after doctors successfully fitted her body with breathing and feeding tubes. Nailah Winkfield, her mother, claimed the 13-year-old’s body was fitted with a tracheostomy to her windpipe and a gastrostomy to her stomach this morning. She said the procedure meant that her daughter was getting the nutrition she needed for the first time since she was declared brain dead a month ago. Scroll Down for Video . Long road to recovery: Jahi McMath is making progress after being declared brain dead last month . It also meant that she could be 'kissed on the lips' without a ventilator tube being in the way. A spokesman for family said: 'Doctors are optimistic that her condition has stabilized and that her health is improving from when she was taken from Children's Hospital Oakland.' Jahi suffered massive brain damage while recovering from an operation to remove her tonsils at Children’s Hospital Oakland, in California, on December 9. Bleeding from the teenager's throat caused her heart to stop and, while doctors were able to resuscitate her, the resulting brain damage was so severe they declared her brain dead three days later. But the family disagreed with the doctors and successfully won a court order preventing the hospital from turning off her life support. They then organized for Jahi to be removed on Sunday to a secret facility in order to receive long-term care. At first reports said that the condition of her body was worse than first thought due to lack of nutrition, and that an operation to secure feeding and breathing tubes was proving difficult. Hope: Nailah Winkfield says she can now kiss her daughter as a ventilator tube has been moved . Optimistic: Sandra Chatman, with pictures of her and granddaughter Jahi, who is stabilizing since she has been moved to a different medical facility . But today the family posted that it had been carried out successfully and they were still hopeful she could heal. Her mother posted: 'Jahi had surgery this morning and it was successful!! Now I can kiss her lips without that damn tube in the way and now she can get nutrition!! 'Thank you Lord! My child will heal. I believe it.' Jahi’s sister added that she will be 'finally receiving nutrition' for the first time since December 8. 'We are praying for a strong recovery,' she wrote. Despite the success of the operation, the family admitted that she remained in poor shape and her body has yet to be stabilized. Chris Dolan, the lawyer who helped the family stop the hospital turning off Jahi's life support machine, hit back at criticism he had deceived a poor grieving family. Mr Dolan had been accused of being 'heartless' by the hospital for having a 'reckless disregard for the truth' and perpetuating the 'hoax' that Jahi could recover. 'The whole thing about me giving them false hope is a construction of public relations because they needed a villain,' Mr Dolan said. Steps to recover: Omari Sealey, pictured with Jahi's grandmother Sandra Chatman, are praying for Jahi to make a full recovery . 'Not only that but it is patronising to Jahi’s family if not bordering on racist: these minority people are being deceived by this white lawyer, it was they seemed to be saying. 'The family made the decision. This case was about who decides what happens to a child, the parents or doctors. 'I always said there was very little hope she will recover but this family needed to be able to fight for this girl,' he added.

"By . Associated Press . Possible victim: 'Dark Minds' have identified runner Gilbert Gilman (pictured), who disappeared from Washington's Olympia National Park in 2004, as a potential Keyes victim . An upcoming special episode of Investigation Discovery's 'Dark Minds' TV series says it has new information about confessed Alaska serial killer Israel Keyes, including the identity of a potential victim. Keyes was believed to have killed at least 11 people before committing suicide in his Anchorage jail cell 15 months ago while awaiting a federal trial in the rape and strangulation murder of his last known victim, Samantha Koenig. The 18-year-old Anchorage woman was abducted in February 2012 from the local coffee stand where she worked. The two-hour, season-opening 'Dark Minds' episode scheduled to air April 2 reports what it says are new details about the Koenig case. The episode, which includes dramatizations by actors, also suggests a man who disappeared from Washington's Olympia National Park in 2004 - Gilbert Gilman - was an undisclosed victim of Keyes, who had been in the region to participate in a marathon. And it claims Keyes identified himself as a bisexual and a necrophiliac. Series creator and host M. William Phelps told The Associated Press that he spent more than a year investigating Keyes, interviewing people including authorities, a serial killer he calls 'Raven', a criminal profiler, people who knew Keyes, as well as former Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Warner, who was present during many of Keyes's interviews with the FBI. 'It really exhausted me, emotionally and physically, this case,' Phelps said. 'I was just living it 24/7.' Scroll down for video . Confessed serial killer:  Israel Keyes (pictured left and right) is believed to have killed at least 11 people . After the Koenig kidnapping, Keyes reportedly sipped wine in a tool shed outside his home, telling his victim there exactly what he planned to do before he sexually assaulted and killed her, leaving her body in the shed before embarking on a cruise the next day. The series also claims Keyes later sewed open the eyes of the dead and frozen victim to make her look alive as he photographed her with a new copy of a local newspaper. Authorities have already revealed that Keyes wrote a ransom note on the back of the photo, demanding that $30,000 be placed in Koenig's account. He texted a message, directing the family to a dog park where the note could be found. Her family deposited money from a reward fund. Keyes also said he robbed banks to help pay for his travels to find random victims. Tragic: The TV series claims it has new information into the kidnapping, rape and murder of Samantha Koenig (pictured left and right) Surveillance footage: This image taken in Anchorage, Alaska, shows Samantha Koenig, 18, making a cup of Americano coffee for Israel Keyes, shortly before he abducted her on February 1, 2012, and killed her . Keyes, the second eldest in a large family, was homeschooled in a cabin without electricity near Colville, Washington, in a mountainous, sparsely populated area. The family moved in the 1990s to Smyrna, Maine, where they were involved in the maple syrup business, according to a neighbor who remembered Keyes as a nice, courteous young man. After leaving the Army, Keyes worked for the Makah Indian tribe in Washington, then moved to Anchorage in 2007 after his girlfriend found work here. Suicide: Keyes was found dead in his jail cell on December 2, 2012, afterhe slashed his left wrist and strangled himself with a sheet . A self-employed carpenter and handyman, . he was considered competent, honest and efficient. He had a young . daughter who lived with him and his girlfriend in Anchorage. Keyes was arrested in Lufkin, Texas, about six weeks later after using Koenig's debit card. Three weeks after the arrest, Koenig's dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage. The FBI and other authorities have been able to link Keyes to the only three victims he named - Koenig and an Essex, Vermont, couple, Bill and Lorraine Currier, who disappeared in 2011. Victims: Keyes has been linked to the deaths of Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont, who were last seen leaving work in June, 201 . Connected? Authorities have been trying to determine whether Keyes was involved in the 2009 disappearance of a New Jersey woman, Debra Feldman (pictured) In months of interviews with authorities . after his arrest last year, Keyes toyed with investigators, doling out . snippets and clues about other possible victims across the country as he . demanded a promise that he would be executed rather than spend his life . in prison. The FBI has publicly released a timeline of travels and crimes by Keyes, hoping to shed light on unsolved killings in the nation. Authorities have been trying to determine whether Keyes was involved in the 2009 disappearance of a New Jersey woman, Debra Feldman, who was last seen at her Hackensack home. Anchorage-based Special Agent Kevin Donovan with the FBI said yesterday he didn't immediately know the status of the New Jersey case. He also said authorities have received information about cases that could be tied to Keyes and are following up on it. But he said he wouldn't characterize any of it as strong leads. 'We are still looking for any additional information from the public or from law enforcement that might help us identify additional victims,' he said. At the end of the upcoming episode, Phelps urges viewers to help solve mysteries that remain about Keyes and his unknown victims. 'I hope the families can have some answers from this,' he said. 'That's my goal.' Keyes never disclosed much information . about the other crimes, trying to keep as many details as possible out . of the media so his daughter wouldn't be able to find any information up . on the Internet or his mother wouldn't have a heart attack reading what . he did.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Residents in a Boston suburb were stunned recently when they opened their sewer bills to find that they owe astronomical amounts - some as high as $55,000 - that will take them decades to pay off. Initially many people assumed that there had been a clerical error, but now they have been forced to come to terms with the grim reality that under the terms of their property contracts they are liable. The problem impacts about three dozen homeowners and just as many businesses who are part of a development on Route 20 in Wayland known as Town Center. Wayland resident Mary Farley has been hit with a $55,000 sewer bill because they have to pay to use a $5.5 million waste water treatment facility . Residents in the Boston suburb of Wayland were stunned recently when they opened their sewer bills to find that they owe astronomical amounts that will take them decades to pay off . Part of the complex of stores and modern condominiums is a $5.5 million waste water treatment facility. It was built on an ‘enterprise zone’ which means that only those people hooked up to it must pay all the associated costs. ‘When you add up all the fees, we are looking at close to $55,000,’ Wayland resident Mary Farley told WBZ4. Another resident, Abhilash Barot, has been told he owes $23,000. The vast majority of homeowners in Wayland have individual septic systems and therefore only 75 uses have to pay the costs of the expensive new sewer system . All the people impacted claim that nether the developer nor the town ever explained that they would be subject to such huge bills. The developer claims that if owner's read the legal documents they signed when they purchased their homes it would explain that they are liable. Most residents say that if the 'hidden costs' had been explained they simply would never have bought the properties. The vast majority of homeowners in Wayland have individual septic systems and therefore don't use the expensive new sewer system. As a result the entire cost for the facility falls to about 75 users. One of those business owners hit with the huge costs is Jonathan Buchman, who believes that all residents in the town should share the cost because they use many of the amenities hooked up to the expensive system. Wayland resident Abhilash Barot owes $23,000 and says he wouldn't have bought his property if the hidden costs had been explained to him . Most of the impacted residents say they wouldn¿t have bought their homes if they'd known about the huge bills they would be hit with . ‘Their building, their police station, their fire station is on the system. The main town hall with all the offices is on the system,’ he said. Town leaders are looking for a solution according to Wayland's interim Town Administrator. 'Hopefully we will take some action that will provide some relief. I don’t know in what form, but some relief to those rate payers,' said Robert Mercier. The impacted residents have until July to pay their huge bills.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An apartment building in a Virginia suburb of Washington D.C. has experience more than two dozen suspected arson fires in the past 10 months, and on Thursday authorities arrested an unlikely suspect: A 74-year-old woman who's lived in the building for more than 30 years. Shirley Vigneau was arrested Thursday after she was seen on surveillance footage walking out of a trash room on the seventh floor of the Stratford building in Alexandria where she allegedly started a fire on Wednesday evening. According to authorities, Vigneau used papers to start the blaze before quickly leaving the trash room. Pyro: 74-year-old Shirley Vigneau admitted to authorities that she has started as many as 25 fires in her own apartment building . On Thursday, officers from the Alexandria Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives executed a search warrant at Vigneau's apartment, and ultimately took her into custody. 'Most fires occurs after midnight when residents were sleeping, . resulting in numerous evacuations of the building,' ATF Agent Thomas . Faison told WJLA. In all, authorities suspect Vigneau started 25 fires over the past 10 months. 'There were no injuries reported, but these fires caused extensive fear . and anxiety on the part of the residents of the complex,' Alexandria . police said in a statement Thursday. One resident, who didn't want to be identified, told the station that she knew about the fires, but she was shocked to learn that one of her neighbors is responsible for starting them . 'It's been annoying,' said the unnamed resident. 'It's just really been a . lot. It's just really, really been a nuisance...and it's been dangerous . for people living here.'

"By . Sara Malm . A young student was charged nearly $800 for a two mile journey after she was ripped off by a driver and failed to check the charge on a mobile credit card app. Becky Siegel, 20, was taking a short cab ride in downtown Chicago, a journey which would normally cost her under $10, after running late to meet her friends in December last year. Miss Siegel, from Winniteka, asked to pay by credit card, to which the driver responded that his machine was not working and that he would use a mobile device if she handed over her card. Bad swipe: Student Becky Siegel, 20, took a two-mile taxi ride but paid with a credit card but did not look at the screen before signing and was charged $787 by the rogue driver . Shortly afterwards, her mother Susan Siegel was shocked to find a $787.33 transaction on her credit card statement and when she confronted her daughter, Becky concluded that she must have been overcharged for the cab ride. ‘At the end of the trip he gave her a price and she thinks it was under ten dollars, and so she asked can I use a credit card, and he said my swiper isn't working, here give it to me and I'll do it on my Square,’ Miss Siegel told FOX 32. She said she was given a price of under $10 and that she told the driver to add another two dollars in trips, before she signed off on the Square transaction on by using her finger on the smartphone screen. A Square is a small card reader which can be plugged into any smartphone through the headphone jack. The reader converts the magnetic card track data into audio form and transmits it to the phone, after which the payment is carried out through an app. Anger: Becky's mother Susan Siegel was shocked to find a $787.33 transaction on her credit card statement . Mrs Siegel was sent the receipt from the taxi journey which showed that the driver had charged her daughter $656.11 and that Becky 'tipped' $131.22 . Expensive trip: The ride through downtown Chicago was supposed to have come down to under $10 . When her mother discovered the overcharge she immediately contacted the credit card company, Chase credit which uses Visa, however as Becky had signed for the transaction there was nothing they could do. Fortunately Mrs Seigel was provided with a full receipt for the fare, which had the cab company and the driver’s name on it. But when she contacted the driver, a man named Ali Ghazanfari, he claimed the fare was valid. It was not until Mrs Seigel contacted  the local newspaper’s problem-solver column which in turn got in touch with both Mr Ghazanfari and Chicago’s Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. Once the department, which regulates taxicabs, suspended Mr Ghazanfari’s public chauffeur licence, things changed. ‘He called me two or three times, and he was in a panic. What I know now is that he is really sorry he got caught,’ Mrs Seigel said. Mrs Seigel has since been promised a full refund from Square.","Student Becky Siegel, 20, was charged $787 for a two mile cab ride .

In the footage, Ford is seen swearing, stumbling and acting erratically outside city hall while wearing a beaded necklace in honor of St. Patrick’s Day. Scroll down for video . In the footage, Ford is seen swearing, stumbling and acting erratically outside city hall while wearing a beaded necklace in honor of St. Patrick’s Day . The footage was broadcast by CTV on Sunday night and features Ford calling someone a ‘f***ing idiot!’ The video starts with a woman speaking to Ford from her car, while her son films it. ‘No problem, no problem, no problem,’ Ford is heard saying in the video as he tries to hail a taxi. After being hugged by one man, Ford approaches a cab and then can be heard shouting ‘f***ing idiot!’ Ford reacted with irritation when a CTV reporter questioned him about the video during the Patrick’s Day Parade on Sunday.

Were you drinking last night? You never drink, right? You guys don’t drink.’ The weekend incident comes two years after Ford’s drunken St. Patrick’s Day party inside the mayor’s office and months after he swore off drinking entirely after he admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in a 'drunken stupor.' After his crack-smoking confession last November, Ford swore off booze entirely, claiming that he had a ‘come to Jesus moment.’ He admitted to drinking again in January after video surfaced online of him inside the Steak Queen restaurant in Etobicoke where he appeared intoxicated as he swore and ranted in Jamaican patois.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Osama bin Laden's words to his son-in-law hours after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks were recalled during a surprise testimony in Manhattan today. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who was recruited as a spokesman for al-Qaeda, told the court how bin Laden had arranged for him to be driven to a meeting in an Afghan cave. When he arrived, Abu Ghaith recalled how bin Laden told him: 'Did you learn what happened? We are the ones who did it.' On trial: Bin Laden's spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, pictured giving a video message, testified in a Manhattan courtroom on Wednesday . When bin Laden asked what he thought . would happen next, Abu Ghaith testified that he responded by predicting . America 'will not settle until it kills you and topples the state of the . Taliban.' Bin Laden responded: 'You're being too pessimistic,' Abu Ghaith recalled. Bin Laden then told the onetime imam: 'I want to deliver a message to the world. ... I want you to deliver the message.' The testimony came at Abu Ghaith's trial on charges that he conspired to kill Americans and aid al-Qaeda as a spokesman for the terrorist group. He is the most senior person within bin Laden's inner circle to be put on trial in an American civilian court. His decision to take the witness stand was announced by his lawyer, Stanley Cohen, who surprised a nearly empty courtroom that quickly filled with spectators as word spread. In court: Abu Ghaith, right, testified in a New York courtroom where he is facing charges of conspiring to kill Americans . Spokesman: Abu Ghaith, left, with Osama bin Laden says his video messages were meant to inspire Muslims, not recruit terrorists . Prosecutors claim Abu Ghaith knew of planned attacks against the U.S. and provided support and resources to terrorists. Abu Ghaith, who has denied the charges, faces life in prison if convicted. The rare gambit by the defense on Wednesday was a last-ditch effort to counter a mountain of evidence against Abu Gaith, including an alleged confession and videos showing him sitting beside bin Laden on September 12, 2001, and another in which he warned Americans that 'the storm of airplanes will not abate'. The defense has never disputed that Abu Ghaith associated with bin Laden after 9/11, but they contend that he was recruited as a religious teacher and orator, and had no role in plotting more attacks. Testifying through an Arabic interpreter, the 48-year-old Kuwaiti-born defendant looked relaxed when he took the stand, wearing a blue shirt, open at the collar, beneath a charcoal-colored jacket. His hands were sometimes folded before him, though sometimes he waved or pointed them for emphasis. Hearing: A sketch from earlier in the trial shows Abu Ghaith, left, who denies charges of conspiring to kill Americans . He told jurors he went to Afghanistan for the first time in June 2001 because he had a 'serious desire to get to know the new Islamic government in Afghanistan'. He testified that he first met bin Laden when the al-Qaeda leader, who was living in Kandahar, Afghanistan, summoned him after hearing that he was a preacher from Kuwait. Abu Ghaith testified that bin Laden explained that the al-Qaeda training camps involved so much weapons-training and a rough, hard life that he wanted him to change that, to reach the hearts of recruits and show them another side of life. He also testified that he knew bin Laden was suspected in terrorist attacks but still 'wanted to get to know that person'. 'I wanted to see what he had, what is it he wanted,' he said. The defendant testified that videos he made warning that there would be more attacks on Americans and trying to inspire others to join al-Qaeda's cause were based on 'quotes and points by Sheik Osama.' He denied allegations by the government that he had prior knowledge of the failed shoe-bomb airline attack by Richard Reid in December 2001. He testified that his videotaped sermons were religious in nature, and meant to encourage Muslims to fight oppression. If 'oppression befalls ... any category of people, that category must revolt at some point,' he said. 'I wanted to proclaim the message that Muslims must bear some responsibility to defend themselves.' Abu Ghaith said he wasn't involved in recruiting aspiring terrorists. Meeting: Abu Ghaith, right, told the court what Bin Laden said to him hours after the 9/11 terror attacks . 'My intention was to deliver a message, a message I believed in,' he said. 'I was hoping the U.S. would say, ""Let's sit down and talk and solve these problems"", but America was going on and doing what I expected them to do.' On cross-examination, prosecutor Michael Ferrara zeroed in on Abu Ghaith's testimony that he accepted an invitation to meet bin Laden on September 11 because the al-Qaeda leader was a sheik who deserved respect, and his admission that he was aware bin Laden's organization was behind the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and attack on the USS Cole in 2000. 'You testified that, despite knowing that he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans, you met with him to be polite, correct?' the prosecutor asked. Abu Ghaith responded that he simply went to find out what bin Laden wanted from him. Asked about bin Laden's demeanor, he said: 'I would say he was worried.' U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan did not immediately rule on Cohen's request that the defense be permitted to call Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-professed architect of the September 11 attacks, as a witness via a video link from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he is imprisoned. Cohen said it wasn't the right time to pursue that request, which was denied by Kaplan on Tuesday but was renewed after Mohammed confirmed he would be willing to testify.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith on trial in New York for conspiring to kill Americans .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A sustained noise that could best be called a hoot and holler greeted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul at the mention of his name, before he took the stage at Friday's Conservative Political Action Conference and declared that cell phone records sought by government agencies were 'none of their damned business!' By the time he launched into his blue streak against the National Security Agency and quoted Pink Floyd to criticize President Barack Obama, the overflow crowd of thousands sounded like Beyonce concertgoers who had stumbled into the wrong ballroom. The crowd simultaneously drank it in . and shouted it out, making Paul the star of the Conservative Political . Action Conference's second day and giving him – by far – the event's loudest applause. 'If you have a cell phone, you are under surveillance' from the federal government, Paul warned in his biggest moment. 'I believe what you do on your cell phone is none of their damned business!' One group of partisans shouted 'President Paul! President Paul!' as he spoke. Kentucky Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul delivered the most enthusiastically received speech of the week at CPAC, targeting President Barack Obama for 'running roughshod' over civil liberties . Sen. Rand Paul has been a consensus favorite at the Conservative Political Action Conference, dominating hallways with 'I Stand With Rand' posters and creating a horde of giddy young acolytes . Paul spoke at CPAC, signed books and collected groupies all day Friday, telling conservatives that libertarian ideals should inform their politics . 'I don't question President Obama's motives,' Paul told an overflow crowd, 'but history will record his timid defense of liberty' Chris Christie stole Thursday's show with a comeback that shook the dust of 'Bridgegate' from his shoes. Rand Paul tapped into the libertarian undercurrent that has percolated throughout CPAC – and found its voice Friday afternoon. 'Imagine a time when the White House is once again occupied by a friend of liberty,' he said. 'You might think I'm talking about electing Republicans. I'm not: I'm talking about electing lovers of liberty.' 'It isn't good enough to pick the lesser of two evils,' he said, jabbing at both Democrats and establishment Republicans. 'Stand up and be heard,' he told the crowd during one stemwinder about anti-terror cases involving indefinite detention. 'We must defend our rights.' Paul put his concerns about the NSA on front pages with a class-action lawsuit last month – on behalf, he said, of hundreds of millions of Americans who have telephones. The federal government, the lawsuit alleges, has taken the idea of an individual search warrant and expanded it to apply to massive groups of citizens at the same time. CPAC attendees hold a straw poll this week to show potential presidential candidates where conservative voters stand, and Rand Paul may figure prominently in the results . Tea party groups, likely to wield huge influence in 2016 GOP presidential politics, have connected mostly with Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz during the three-day event near Washington, D.C. Rand Paul placards have been a hot commodity, pleasing his campaign staff despite a ban on politicking at CPAC . Who said bumper stickers are for progressives? This tea partier's Mazda minivan is a monument to right-wing causes -- and a portable parade unto itself. 'I believe this is a fundamental constitutional question: Can a single warrant be applied to millions of Americans?' he asked. 'No!' replied some in the audience. 'I took a stand,' he said. 'I sued the president.' Jabbing the White House, Paul asked his audience, 'How will history remember Barack Obaam?' Cult hero: Students Dragana Bozic (L) of New York City and Pi Praveen of Durham, NC, pose for a photograph with a life-size cutout photo of Sen. Rand Paul in the CPAC exhibit hall . 'I don't question President Obama's motives,' he said after the chuckles subsided, 'but history will record his timid defense of liberty.' Obama has sought to expand the National Security Agency's authority to collect and keep broad swaths of telephone call metadata – information including callers and recipients, dates and times, and call durations. Libertarians like Paul believe the government isn't entitled to indiscriminately snoop on citizens who are not already the targets of criminal investigations. The Obama administration has taken the position that phone records don't belong to individual Americans, but to the telecommunications providers who own the phone networks – clearing the way for a single search warrant to cover millions at once. 'Mr. President,' he yelled in mid-crescendo at an imaginary Obama, 'we will not let you run roughshod over our rights. We will challenge you in the courts. We will battle you at the ballot box. Mr. President, we will not let you shred our Constitution!' The CPAC event continues through Saturday. Former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin will end the conference, and attendees will also hear from Dr. Ben Carson, an African-American surgeon who is the subject of a 'draft' effort for the 2016 presidential race.","Paul, a Kentucky senator, got the Conservative Political Action Conference's loudest applause with a libertarian message .

"By . Sam Creighton . A jealous ex has been slapped with a restraining order for taking revenge on his former fiancee by posting naked pictures of her on Facebook. Ben Haddon, 29, uploaded two intimate images of his former partner Lisa Beckett, 29, on the social network site just weeks after they split up in January. The builder, from Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to harassment without violence at North Staffordshire Justice Centre yesterday and was issued with an indefinite restraining order, barring him from making contact with Miss Beckett. Lisa Beckett said she is 'disgusted' by the pictures and claims not to have known they had been taken . He was also ordered to pay £250 in compensation to his ex-partner as well as a £250 fine and £110 costs. The . court heard how the father-of-two had kept the x-rated photographs - . which Miss Beckett claims not to have consented to - from their 14-month . relationship and used them to humiliate her online. He . also tried to get her in trouble at work by claiming she was on drugs . and even sent threatening text messages and made abusive phone calls. Haddon texted Miss Beckett on February 4, saying he had uploaded . pornographic pictures of her on Facebook and was planning to post more. The couple pictured before the incident. Miss Beckett said she and Mr Haddon had been happy . The court heard how Haddon deleted the photographs minutes later - although Miss Beckett claims they were there for up to an hour - but they had already been seen by Miss Beckett’s friends and family. Prosecutor Katie Price said: 'Miss Beckett said he was ringing her and threatening her. 'He would ring her place of work to try to get her into trouble by telling them she had taken drugs. 'He said he was going to put things on his Facebook page and he continued to threaten her via text. 'He would also ring her and tell her he was going to blacken her eyes. 'On February 4, Mr Haddon sent a text saying he had uploaded some pornographic pictures and was planning to upload more. 'Miss Beckett was disgusted. The first photograph showed her and the defendant lying together naked on a bed. 'The second photograph was of a similar nature, but a close-up version. 'Miss Beckett claims she did not know these pictures had been taken and that she definitely did not consent to them.' In a statement read out in court, Miss Beckett added: 'When I found out the photographs had been uploaded I was at work. 'I didn’t eat or sleep for the whole day. I felt terrified of what was coming next. I feel that this has damaged my reputation. 'I never thought Ben would be capable of this.' The couple had been together for 14-months before the relationship fell apart and the harassment started . Miss Beckett told the court she was shocked Haddon was capable of doing something like posting the pictures . Defending himself in court, Haddon described himself as a 'first-class idiot' and apologised to Miss Beckett. He . said: 'I am ashamed of what I have done but I want to make sure that . you know that she did know these photographs had been taken and she was . quite willing to have them taken at the time. 'I am a father, and I am disgusted in myself. I have been a first class idiot. 'But I would like to apologise, I am sorry. I hope we can both move on with our lives.' The court heard the pair had been in a relationship for just over a year before things turned sour in January. They lived together from June 2013 and Haddon even proposed to her in October, while they were on . holiday in Wales. But . the relationship fell apart in January when he walked out on Miss Beckett . after his ex-partner started to let him see his two young children. Haddon apologised but Miss Beckett said it is not enough to make up for what has happened . Miss Beckett, . a support worker for disabled people, said: 'It was a good . relationship, he didn’t do anything wrong, it was just normal. We lived . together since June and we got engaged last October. 'He started getting contact with his children in January and as soon as that happened he just left. 'It just ended but we parted on good terms, I didn’t get an explanation. 'He . still wanted to see me and didn’t want me to see anybody else but he . had left the home and left me so I told him he had no right to tell me . who I was seeing. 'I think jealousy got the better of him and all the harassment started.' Speaking after the trial, the mother-of-one said: 'I . had never seen them [the pictures] before and they were disgusting. It . was intercourse from behind but I didn’t know the phone was there. You . could see genitals. 'You . don’t need your mum and dad or colleagues at work seeing that kind of . thing. I rang the police straight away because I didn’t know what else . to do. 'An officer came to my home and I had to initial every picture to say it was me, it was humiliating. 'I am happy with the restraining order because I know he would contact me again if it wasn’t for that. 'But I would have been happier if he had been jailed for three months to have time to reflect about what he did. 'He . hasn’t learnt his lesson, he called himself a first class idiot in . court but he thinks it’s funny. And this is a man who has a daughter, it . is absolutely disgusting. 'I don’t think I can ever trust anybody again. The thought that I let this man around my child makes my skin crawl.'","Ben Haddon, 29, posted two racy pictures of his ex on social network .

"By . Harriet Arkell . and Sam Webb . Andrew Salmon, 42, locked his wife in a shed because she was unkind when his mother died, a court heard . An angry husband locked his wife in a garden shed during a row when she insulted his dead mother. Andrew Salmon, 42, admitted attacking Beverley Salmon, also 42, at their home in Truro in a rage after she chanted 'Ding dong, the witch is dead' when his mother died. Furious Salmon punched his wife, ripped her top open and twisted her breasts, Truro Magistrates' Court was told. Prosecutor Gail Hawksley said the row began when Mrs Salmon arrived home from work to find the house locked, curtains drawn, and her clothes in bags on the ground. Her husband told her: 'It's my house now.  You are not getting in', before locking her in the garden shed, she said. Magistrates heard she managed to climb out of the shed window, and used her key to get into the house, but Salmon grabbed her by the clothes. As she slipped and fell, he tried to drag her out by her legs, the prosecutor said. They went upstairs and the row continued.  Mrs Salmon threw some of his clothes out of the window, and he threw her on the bed, got on top of her and ripped open her top. He then put his arm across her throat causing her to struggle for breath, and grabbed and twisted her breasts. When he was interviewed by police, Salmon admitted punching his wife, and claimed she was having an affair, the court heard. He said she had not liked his late mother, and had not been supportive or kind about his loss when she died, instead taunting him by repeating: 'Ding dong, the witch is dead'. Salmon, who has no previous convictions, told officers he had locked her in the shed to 'P*** her off' (file image) Salmon, who has no previous convictions, told officers he had locked her in the shed to ‘p*** her off’, but said he knew she would be able to climb out of the window. He told police he had been suffering from depression and said: 'I was provoked, but I am sorry for what I have done to my wife and regret everything I did.' Speaking after the court case Salmon said his wife of almost twenty years acted 'extremely unsympathetic' after his mother passed away on December 27 last year. Andrew said he has suffered from depression and stress since the incident on February 6 . He said: 'She never really got on with my mum or any of my relatives and when my mum died she was horrible and offered me no support - she was extremely unsympathetic. 'She would sing ""ding dong the witch is dead"" from time to time and didn’t even come to her funeral. 'It was a really difficult time for me and my family.' Andrew claims the argument initially erupted when a man - who Andrew suspected she was having an affair with - called her mobile. The dad-of-two had put her sim card in a spare mobile phone while she was in the shower before work and claims that twenty minutes after she left that morning, the man called. He said: 'The man hung up once I answered but I called Bev right away at work and told her that when she comes home, her clothes will be packed and outside the front door. 'She didn’t seem too bothered. She came back a couple of hours later. Andrew said he then decided to lock Beverly in the shed to 'annoy her' as he knew it would irritate her and she would be able to get out. He said: 'When she came back that morning her clothes were outside the house. 'I decided to lock her in the shed as I knew it would really annoy her and that she would be able to get out of a side door.' Andrew said he has suffered from depression and stress since the incident on February 6. He said: 'I shouldn’t have done it and I am sorry but I was provoked into doing it. The things she was saying about my mum were horrible.' Truro Magistrates' Court: Salmon pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife, Beverley, and is awaiting sentence . He added: 'I’m sorry the argument ever happened.' The couple, who have two children aged nine and 11, have been together for almost 20 years - though Andrew vows never to reconcile the relationship. When approached after the court hearing, Beverly, who works as a receptionist, refused to comment. Salmon pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife and will be sentenced next month.","Andrew Salmon, 42, was upset with wife's reaction when his mother died .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Texas couple have finally named their quintuplets after giving birth to the healthy babies at a Dallas hospital earlier this week. Michelle Seals of Maud, a town in the Northeast corner of the state, gave birth to four girls and one boy on Tuesday afternoon at Baylor University Medical Center via cesarean section. The newborns, now named Mia, Tessa, Brant, Gracie and Rayleigh, ranged in weight from 2 lbs 7 oz to 3 lbs 6 oz, and are all being monitored in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. Steven Seals had previously said that he and his wife had picked out names for the quintuplets but had wanted to wait to see which name fitted which baby. Scroll down for video . Happy and healthy: Michelle Seals, seen here in February after being put on bedrest, has now given birth to quintuplets on Tuesday at Baylor University hospital in Dallas . And five makes eight: Michelle and Steven Seals already have a two-year-old boy, pictured . 'We are so blessed to have welcomed five . new members of our family into the world Tuesday afternoon,' the couple said in a statement. 'They are . all healthy and doing well. We would like to thank everyone for their . prayers and support.' The quintuplets, who are the first in the hospital's history, join a two-year-old brother to bring the family's brood to six. Mrs Seal had been ordered on bedrest as of her 25th week of pregnancy at the end of February, and she told KLTV that feeling her babies move inside her was one of the highlights. 'I love it, it's the best part about being pregnant is feeling them move - except for the one that's in my ribs,' she joked. Ahead of the birth, her husband added: 'It's happiness, it's fearfulness and I'm scared to death.' Without going into specifics, Mrs Seal suggested that the multiple birth was a result of previous fertility work. Different places: Michelle was confined to bedrest at the hospital in Dallas for more than two weeks ahead of the birth while her husband stayed at their home with their son, 200 miles away . Final additions: The couple have been married since 2006 and said that after the quintuplets, they will not be having any more children . 'The problems I've had in the past, I had to take medicine and it just worked really, really well and we got five out of it,' she told KTLA in February. 'But one thing about it is we'll have four girls to help us when we're older.' Mr Seals works at the Red River Army Depot and graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University in 2004. Mrs Seals, who works as a first grade teacher, attended the University of North Texas and the couple married in December 2006.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The Roman city of Pompeii has been drawing visitors eager to get a glimpse of everyday life almost 2,000 years ago ever since it was discovered. And now a well-preserved Roman funerary complex has been unearthed 40miles (70km) northeast of Venice. It is the largest ancient necropolis found in Italy since the 19th century and, like Pompeii, was  preserved by a natural disaster. Iulia Concordia (aerial view, pictured) was hit by floods that covered it in sediment and rubbish in the fifth century AD. It is the largest ancient funerary complex found in Italy since the 19th century and like Pompeii was both destroyed and preserved by a natural disaster . The Roman colony of Iulia Concordia was discovered 70km northeast of Venice. It's the largest ancient funerary complex found in Italy since the 19th century. Like Pompeii, the complex was destroyed by a natural disaster. It was hit by floods that covered it in sediment and rubbish in the fifth century AD. Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a necropolis from the first century BC and a later podium with two elegant sarcophagi on top of it. The ancient colony is nearby the modern town Concordia Sagittaria in Gruaro, Veneto. Pompeii was buried by the volcanic . eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, whereas the Roman colony of Iulia . Concordia was hit by floods that covered it in sediment and rubbish in . the fifth century AD, according to reports by ANSA Med. The buried site has been likened to a ‘little flood-plain Pompeii’ and tours are being conducted of the site as it is excavated. The flood-preserved sarcophagi in the Roman colony, have lain invisible and inaccessible for 1,500 years. So far, the remains of a necropolis from the first century BC has been found, as well as a later podium measuring just under 7ft (2m) tall and 20ft (6m) long, with two elegant sarcophagi on top. Two more tombs were found nearby and another at the base of the monument. The colony is situated near the modern town Concordia Sagittaria in Gruaro, Veneto and a large monument from the third century AD can be found outside its ancient walls. The colony is situated near the modern town Concordia Sagittaria (marked) in Gruaro, Veneto and a large monument from the third century AD can be found outside its ancient walls . So far, the remains of a necropolis from the first century BC has been found, as well as a later podium measuring just under 7ft (2m) tall and 20ft (6m) metres long, with two elegant sarcophagi on top. Roman sarcophagi vary in style. This particularly elaborate example is the first century sarcophagus of a young girl . Excavations of the site are underway, financed by the Region of Veneto with the help of EU funding. The Italian government has freed up €2million (£1.66million) of funds to save the massive archaeological site of Pompeii, after several walls have been washed away as the result of heavy rain and important structures including the Temple of Venus were damaged. As well as being one of the world’s most famous archaeological sites, Pompeii is an important tourist attraction near Naples and draws around two-and-a-half million tourists to the area every year. Pompeii (the basilica is pictured) was buried by the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, whereas the Roman colony of Iulia Concordia was hit by floods that covered it in sediment and rubbish in the fifth century AD . Both the United Nations and the European Union had demanded urgent action to save the famous site from further damage, the BBC reported. It is believed that the UN has already made substantial funds available for routine restoration work, but the money seems to have been tied up in bureaucracy and Italy’s government has come under fire for neglecting and underfunding the site for years. Italy’s Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi has asked local businesses to chip in to help save the Unesco Heritage site and private businesses have already been called upon to help fund restoration work for the Colosseum in Rome. The Italian government has freed up two million euros of funds to save the massive archaeological site of Pompeii, after several walls have been washed away. It has come under fire over the years for neglecting and underfunding the site (a house is pictured) which attracts around 2.5million tourists a year .","The Roman colony of Iulia Concordia, 70 km northeast of Venice, was hit by floods that covered it in sediment and rubbish in the fifth century AD .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Rand Paul has continued to smear former President Bill Clinton by calling him a 'serial philanderer' that was a threat to women in the workplace as a result of his extra marital affairs. Today's appearance on CBS This Morning was just the latest interview where he was asked about comments originally made by his wife Kelly in a Vogue spread that ran this September. 'The only reason I'm bringing it up is because people keep asking me and if you ask me a question then I'll most likely answer the question,' he said on CBS. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bringing up the past: Senator Rand Paul now called former President 'a serial philanderer' which comes in contrast to how he said the Democrats consider him 'the greatest thing since sliced bread' 'There's been a lot of talk of a war on women and I am very concerned that women be treated equally and fairly in the workplace and one of the worst things that can happen is if your boss takes advantage of you in the workplace so really, for all these people who stand up for Bill Clinton who say he was the greatest thing since sliced bread- he was a serial philanderer but he also was someone who took advantage of women in the workplace and that's an old fashioned thing from a long time ago.' The Republican Senator's thoughts on the former President's affairs is being given more airtime recently because he is widely considered to be one of the top prospects for his party's presidential nominee in 2016. If that is the case, he will likely be facing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is in the front-runner position for the Democratic nomination, meaning that they may be competing for the same job. When asked what his accusations of Mr Clinton had to do with Mrs Clinton, he said 'it's hard to separate them'. Denial: Bill Clinton infamously claimed he never had sex with 20-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky . 'It's not her fault. She's had to tolerate the same sort of problems from him, I guess, over time. 'It's more a question of the entire Democratic Party who says there's a war on women and that somehow the other party's committing this and yet they support and defend a guy who really in the workplace was doing something inexcusable, should not be tolerated. 'So really there's a question of hypocrisy and I think people don't like hypocrisy.' This is not the first time of late that Paul has been questioned about the issue, and it seems the subject has come up in every interview he has given in the past week beginning with Meet the Press on Sunday where he called the former President as displaying 'predatory behavior'. Still together: Senator Paul said that while the former President's philandering ways were not the 'fault' of Hillary, he said that it was 'hard to separate' the husband and wife duo (seen here on New Year's Day) 'He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his . office. There is no excuse for that,' Paul said during the NBC show. In spite of Paul's effort to bring the former President's philandering ways back to the forefront, it hasn't had too much of an effect in his standing in the polls. Real Clear Politics averaged out the results from CNN, Quinnipiac, Public Policy and McClathy polls matching the former Secretary of state and the current Senator from Kentucky, and Mrs Clinton ended up winning by 10.2 points.","Rand Paul spoke this morning about the State of the Union and was asked again about his thoughts on the affairs of the former president .
Paul's wife first commented on Clinton's 'predatory' behavior in an interview in Vogue magazine in September .
Allegations are coming up again because Paul is a likely Republican presidential candidate and could face Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race ."

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An 11-year-old Boy Scout with Down syndrome has drowned in a canal near his home after trying to save his beloved dog. C.J. Udall was reporting missing from his home in Mesa, Arizona around 9.30am on Saturday after relatives heard their dog Sapphire barking and ran to see him clawing his way out of a canal. After retrieving the dog, they realized that C.J. was nowhere to be seen and alerted authorities. Mesa police and Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies initiated a search on the air and ground near to the property at Ray and Power roads before focusing the search on the canal. Loss: C.J.

She recounted the events of the day, saying C.J. and his dog 'ventured off and slipped through a fence unnoticed'. They found the dog but no sign of the boy. 'We didn't stop looking but soon realized that C.J.'s loyalty to his dog led him to try to save her,' she said. Family: The Udalls (also pictured with their 13-year-old son) said they will remember CJ as a 'rockstar' Winner: CJ, pictured with his family, was awarded his first Scouts merit badge the night before he died .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An ill-tempered 22-pound cat that trapped a family of three from Oregon in a bedroom has been sent to a shelter. Teresa Barker and Lee Palmer, from Portland, Oregon, called the Multnomah County Animal Services Monday and asked to come and pick up their now-infamous black-and-white house cat named Lux. Lux shot to Internet stardom two weeks ago when he turned on his family, forcing his owners to call 911. Scroll down for video . Not so tough anymore: A Multnomah County Animal Services employee holds Lux at the main shelter in Troutdale, Oregon, where the grumpy cat ended up after attacking his family . Mr Palmer told an emergency services dispatcher March 9 that he kicked the cat after it scratched his 8-month-old baby. In response, the feisty feline went ballistic, leading Palmer and his girlfriend to barricade themselves, their baby and the family dog in the bedroom. Portland police arrived and captured Lux on top of the refrigerator using a snare. Shelter director Mike Oswald the family have not made a final decision on whether to keep Lux. ‘They are wrestling with the decision whether to keep the cat,’ Oswald told The Oregonian. According to a press release put out by the shelter Tuesday, a local cat behavior specialist has offered his services for Lux whether he stays with his current owners or is put up for adoption. The owners of Lux, a 22-pound housecat that trapped them in their bedroom after attacking their baby insist they are not giving up on their pet and are instead getting it therapy . Escape: Jesse didn't need medical attention but his parents were concerned Lux would attack again . 'This is a very shy, somewhat . high-strung cat,' animal technician Karen McGill told KGW. 'Cats like . these... they can only take this much.' The . shelter employee added that the presence of a vocal baby in the home . and the house's close proximity to a train station may have contributed to Lux's aggressive behavior. Two days after the cat attack, Lux's owners insisted that they are not going to give up on their pet and will instead get it therapy. 'We're not getting rid of him right now,' Palmer said last week. 'He's been part of our family for a long time.' Palmer said Lux lunged at his seven-month-old child after the baby pulled its tail. The child, Jesse, suffered a few scratches on the forehead, but did not require medical attention . On the 911 call, Palmer tells the dispatcher he kicked the cat 'in the rear' to protect his child. Like butter wouldn't melt: Lux is a Himalayan with a 'history of violence,' say his owners. They were forced to call 911 on Sunday after Lux attacked their baby and then cornered them in a bedroom . Attack: Teresa Barker, pictured with her baby Jesse, who was starched on the forehead by Lux . Palmer says the animal then 'just went off over the edge' - leading him and his girlfriend to barricade themselves, their baby and the family dog in the bedroom for safety. The cat can be heard screeching in the background of the call as Palmer says in a panicked voice: . 'He's charging us. He's at our bedroom door.' Palmer also tells the dispatcher the cat has been violent in the past. Officers used a dog snare to capture the animal, and placed it in a crate. The cat attack story gained national attention after police put out a news release about it. Lee Palmer said the family had received offers from people wanting to adopt Lux, but the family said at the time they are not taking them up on it. Emergency: Lee Palmer and his girlfriend were too fearful of their cat Lux to emerge from their bedroom . Quiet moment: Teresa Barker posted this picture of herself and Lux on Facebook in happier times .","Police were called to a Portland, Oregon, home March 9 to subdue the 4-year-old part-Himalayan cat Lux .

"By . Emma Glanfield . An aviation fan aged just seven is opening his bedroom to visitors - after his collection of flying memorabilia was recognised as a museum. Sam Boore became obsessed with planes after a recent visit to the RAF base where his great uncle served in the 1950s. In the three months since the visit, he has spent all his pocket money collecting model planes, limited edition posters, medals and military books. Sam Boore, seven, has spent around £150 of his pocket money collecting the military memorabilia which has transformed his bedroom in King's Lynn, Norfolk . Sam became obsessed with planes and the war after visiting the RAF base where his great uncle was based during the 1950s. The trip to RAF Marham, in Norfolk, inspired the seven-year-old to start his collection . He's also picked up flight suits and a gas mask and covered his wall with camouflage netting. Sam, who wants to be a fighter pilot, wears army-themed pyjamas when he gets into his bed which has a military cover. His remarkable collection has now been designated a museum by The Children's University which means his school friends can claim credits for visiting the room. Youngsters will get a stamp in a special passport and Sam is asking visitors for donations for the Bridge for Heroes charity. So far he has raised around £300 from friends and family who have taken the tour of his room in King's Lynn, Norfolk. Sam said: ‘I want to be a pilot when I grow up so I can fly jets and tell loads of stories when I'm older.

He has been awarded Children's University Learning Destination status meaning members of the public will be able to view the incredible array of military memorabilia he has collected in his bedroom . Over the last three months, seven-year-old Sam has spent all of his pocket money collecting model planes, limited edition posters, medals and military books . Sam is proud of his bedroom and excited others will be able to enjoy it as much as him. He said: 'All my friends are going to come and have a look at it because it's got all kinds of things' ‘I have got all kinds of things in my room. My favourite bit is my wall with all my medals and flight suits. ‘All my friends are going to come and have a look at it because it's got all kinds of things. ‘I picked that charity because I thought of all of the soldiers who have been injured and have no legs. ‘I thought they might think I'm a nice boy and would have donated some stuff to the museum.’ Proud father Warren, 49, said Sam has spent around £150 on his collection. He said: ‘After the trip to the heritage centre at the RAF base Sam said he was going to start a museum and raise some money.

"By . Katy Winter . A couple now weigh less than when they got married 20 years ago after shedding 10 stone between them. Graeme Wharton, 42, and his 41-year-old wife Lisa finally faced up to the reality of how big they had become when they couldn't fit into their outfits at Christmas 2012. But things have changed and now they are celebrating winning Slimming World’s Couple of the Year just in time for their 20th wedding anniversary. Graeme and Lisa weigh less now (right) than when they got married 20 years ago (right) Lisa's weight crept up to 15st 6.5lbs and a size 20, while Graeme tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs with a hefty 48in waist . They started slimming after Graeme was . forced to go home and change into jogging bottoms at Christmas 2012 because he was 'spilling out' of his best trousers. The Sunderland couple met in 1989 when Lisa was just 16 and Graeme was 17 and married five years later with the bride in a Size 18 dress, while the groom wore a 48 inch waist suit. Their two children - Jack, now 18, and Alice, now 15, - came along and Lisa’s weight crept up to 15st 6.5lbs and a size 18/20, while Graeme tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs with a hefty 48in waist after over indulging on treats including ready meals and tea and biscuits. But eventually the couple replaced frozen lasagnes and pies with homemade goodies as well as pasta salad and fruit - and lost 10st 4lbs between them. The couple, pictured before they lost weight, feasted on a diet of ready meals and were spurred into action when Graeme couldn't fit into his best clothes . Lisa shed 4st 12lbs and now weighs in at 10st 8.5lbs and wears a svelte Size 12, while her hubby lost 5st 6lbs to weigh 14st 4lbs and fits into a 34ins waist. Breakfast now includes poached eggs with beans on wholemeal toast or a big bowl of fresh raspberries with fat free yogurt instead of cereal with milk. Old habits of eating ham sandwiches on buttered white bread with a side of crisps and chocolate for lunch have been replaced by homemade pasta salad with chicken or tuna, spring onions, peppers and sweetcorn. Frozen pizzas for dinner have been swapped for spaghetti and meatballs and a large salad, while the pair enjoy a mid-morning snack of fruit and mid-afternoon high-fibre cereal bar instead of biscuits. The slimmers have even replaced a normal cup of tea with milk for fruit or green tea - but still enjoy a beer at the weekend. Teacher Lisa said: 'My family always described me as ‘from good stock’ or ‘big boned’ and Graeme was just told he had puppy fat so neither of us worried too much about our size. Lisa and Graeme celebrate as they are named Slimming World couple of the year just in time for their 20th wedding anniversary . 'I suppose when we got together we were happy and content, and like a lot of couples that saw us gain more weight. 'I always say we were blissfully ignorant because we were young and content, we didn’t realise how big we were or the health implications of our weight. 'We didn’t think about what we were eating and just concentrated on enjoying our children.' In 2006 Lisa joined Slimming World and dropped 4st 7lbs, but when she stopped attending the weekly group because of work commitments, she struggled to keep up the healthy eating and piled the pounds back on. But when her clothes began getting tight in January 2013, Lisa decided to join her local group in Sunderland under the watchful eye of Consultant Wendy George, along with cab driver Graeme. The couple now snack on fruit and high fibre cereal bars instead of tea and biscuits . He said: 'The turning point for me came on Christmas Day 2012. 'We got dressed up for dinner, put our gladrags on as you do, but I felt so uncomfortable in my smart trousers and shirt because they were tight and I felt like I was spilling out over my trousers.

"By . Luke Garratt . New driving laws clamping down on lane hogging and tailgating have snared nearly 200 drivers a week, and have been welcomed by motoring groups. The new offenses have stopped a total of 5,472 since the regulations, which clamp down on bad driving habits, were instituted in August last year. Now, accelerating through a puddle or mounting the pavement could cause you on-the-spot fines of Â£100 or even three penalty points on a license, which can be reduced by taking a safe driving course. The new driving laws specifically target those who are driving inconsiderately towards their fellow drivers and pedestrians, but are not as severe as drink driving or speeding. Nevertheless, they still come with hefty fines and the possibility of points, depending on the severity . Among the offences, grouped under the 'inconsiderate driving' law, are driving too close to the vehicle in front, failing to give way at a junction and overtaking and pushing into a queue of traffic. More offenses include being in the wrong lane and pushing into a queue on a roundabout, lane . discipline, such as needlessly hogging the middle or outside lanes, . inappropriate speed, wheel-spins, handbrake turns and other careless . manoeuvres. Scottish drivers were given the most fines and penalty points with 1,454 motorists north of the border falling foul of the laws. In second place was Nottinghamshire with 977 motorists nabbed, according to figures obtained by motoring magazine Auto Express. Out of these 600 specific offences, there were 154 lane hoggers - the most at 48 in the Thames Valley area. So far, the new laws have stopped 5,472 drivers since they were instituted last year . Undertaking offences were recorded 84 times, as were 46 tailgaters. Drivers doing things like wheelspins or handbrake turns accounted for 143 offences, with the most at 42 in Lancashire. Police in this area also witnessed a lot of other offences that fall under the new legislation, including driving at speed through a puddle or deliberately driving up a kerb. Some of the police forces chose not issue penalty points, instead dealing with cases with traffic offence reports and re-education. Five forces - Northumbria, Durham, Dyfed-Powys, South Wales and Cleveland - are not stopping inconsiderate drivers at all because they do not have the facilities to offer the education course. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'The encouraging thing is that this new law is being used by police. The long-term test is whether accident rates fall.' Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'We had doubts about whether it would become a numbers game, but the figures suggest the power is being used in the right way.' Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'Officers have found the new procedures helpful as they seek to raise standards of driving and keep road users safe.'","People targeted under 'inconsiderate driving' laws given fines or points .

"By . Sara Malm . Kiwi sensation Lorde is encouraging her fans to respond to hatred with love, as Westboro Baptist Church plan to picket her concert this week. Westboro Baptist Church announced that they planned to picket outside the concert venue in Missouri, Kansas on Friday. Spotting this, the 17-year-old Royals singer tweeted her response while on tour in Chicago yesterday. Royal behaviour: Lorde took to Twitter to encourage her fans to respond to Westboro Baptist Church's hateful picket by spreading love and equality . Lorde asked her fans to wear rainbow clothing and kiss Westboro members of the same sex, in response to the church which is notoriously anti-gay. ‘Hahaha omg just found out westboro baptist church are going to picket my show in kansas city (sic),’ she tweeted. ‘Everyone wear rainbow clothing to that show ... [and] try to kiss church members who are same sex as you. They will so love it. Christmas comin early in kansas city. (sic)’ Westboro Baptist Church, believed to have a few dozen members, famously stage headline-grabbing protests at any event they deem ‘immoral’, holding ‘God Hates Fags’ placards at the funerals of soldiers, LGBT festivals and political events. The teenage singer, real name Ella Yelich-O'Connor, later deleted her tweets although it has not been made clear why she did so. Disgrace: Christian hate-sect Westboro Baptist Church are still planning on picketing Lorde's concert in Missouri on Friday . The Christian hate sect responded that Lorde ‘doesn’t have enough sense to put in a thimble’ as they posted an odious parody of her Grammy winning song Royals on their website. According to Westboro’s website, they are still planning on picketing outside Midland Theater in Kansas on 21 March. The news of their planned protest comes as their founder is said to be dying. Fred Phelps Sr. started the Westboro Baptist Church in 1955, and the sect has since protested at hundreds of funerals of military members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of their view that God is punishing America for tolerance of gays and lesbians. This weekend, his estranged son, who has left the church announced on Facebook that his 84-year-old father was 'on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka.' He also revealed that Pastor Phelps, a former civil-rights attorney, was ex-communicated from the 'church' back in August of 2013. Westboro Baptist Church spokesman Steve Drain has confirmed that Fred Phelps Sr. is in medical care but did not elaborate on the state of his health or the alleged ex-communication.","Westboro Baptist Church set to picket Lorde concert in Kansas .

"By . Ruth Styles . From pus-filled lumps to hard 'granuloma' and damaged fatty tissue, the perils of having permanent filler are well documented. But when a surgeon suggested that Deborah Kelly, a 47-year-old beauty tutor, have the treatment as a pre-wedding pick-me-up, she went ahead - even though she had originally opted for a safer, non-permanent version. Now, years after having the treatment, she is plagued with painful pus-filled sores and says she couldn't even kiss her husband on her wedding day. Pain: Deborah was left in agony after she agreed to have permanent filler injected into her lips . 'He was very reassuring so I decided to . have the injections because I'd already made my way there,' she says of the fateful moment she agreed to the jabs. 'I'd put my . trust in the surgeon because you do, don't you? You assume that they know their job . better than you do.' Getting married for the first time in her early 40s, Deborah had wanted to look her best for her lavish Sri Lankan nuptials and hoped that the beauty jabs would boost her confidence. 'It's fair to say I've always been insecure about my looks,' she admits. 'I do have some problems with my skin which have led to a great deal of self-confidence issues. 'But to get married in my 40s and to the husband of my dreams - I wanted to look the best I possibly could.' With the support of her husband-to-be, three months before the wedding, she decided to have a natural, non-permanent filler injected as a confidence boost. Sore: The jabs led to the appearance of pus-filled lumps that were so painful, even kissing hurt . 'The whole idea was that it would only last for three months so I would look lovely for the wedding and then get back to the natural look after the wedding,' she explains. But after being talked into having a permanent boost instead, she was horrified by the almost instantaneous bad reaction she suffered. 'My lips swelled up like footballs,' she remembers. 'I've never seen anything like it. I was told to keep freezing them with ice packs.' When the swelling subsided, she noticed painful lumps beginning to form in their place. 'I have never been in so much pain,' she adds. 'If you pushed onto my lips where the lumps were, they would swell up.' Excruciating: Years after she had the jabs, Deborah remains in pain and still has lumps all over her lips . Ruined: Deborah on her wedding day which was spoiled by her painful lips . As her wedding day approached, the . lumps continued to become increasingly agonising and by the time the big . day arrived, they were so sore just brushing them caused her pain. 'I was slightly dreading the kiss, so it ended up as quite a quick kiss,' she remembers. 'We did embrace because it was our wedding day but my lips were stinging and starting to get a little bit bigger. 'I was disappointed because I really feel the fairytale that I had in my mind wasn't what I ended up with.' The effects of the permanent filler also had an impact on the early years of her marriage and Deborah says she would love to be able to live a normal life again. 'Years after these injections, I still have sensitive lumps in my lips,' she adds. 'We were hoping they would go down, that we'd be able to kiss, hug and everything as a normal couple, but they haven't.' Commenting on the case, cranio-facial plastic surgeon, Niall Kirkpatrick said: 'Sometimes in the early stages when you get lumps forming, steroid injections can be very effective. 'But when you're a few years down the line and have really solid, hard lumps, it's very rare that injections will settle them down. 'I spend a lot of my time trying to remove permanent fillers for patients who have had complications with them.' He added: 'My personal feeling is that permanent fillers should be banned.' Deborah appears on Botched Up Bodies: Brides, tomorrow at 10pm on Channel 5 .","Beauty tutor Deborah Kelly, 47, was left in agony after having filler .

"By . Ruth Styles . Like any other new mother, Veronica Smith, from East Sussex, fell in love with her daughter, Catherine, the second she was laid in her arms. But her happiness was not to last because Veronica, then 24, was an unmarried mother brought up in a Catholic family in an era that frowned on unwed parents. Now 73, Veronica says the experience of being forced to give up her only child still haunts her and says her daughter, with whom she now has a good relationship, has suffered because of it. Tragedy: Veronica, pictured in the garden of her Sussex home, never got over the loss of her daughter . Softly spoken and with unlined skin that belies her years, the mother-of-one says she hopes that the British Government will follow the example of Australia and offer an apology to women whose children were taken away and adopted by others in the 1960s. 'I, and thousands of women like me, were coerced into giving up our children,’ she says. ‘I was a perfectly healthy, capable adult. I’m still angry that my child was taken away.’ Veronica, then in her early 20s, was working as a nurse in a Butlin's holiday camp in Bognor Regis when she became pregnant after a brief fling with a 'red coat'. When she realised she was going to have a child, the convent-educated middle class girl, was horrified. 'It was a big thing to deal with because there was a real stigma about unmarried mothers at the time. I . just knew I had a situation that needed to be dealt with.' Although she eventually plucked up the courage to tell her mother and sister of her plight, her father was never told and her mother went to extraordinary lengths to hide the pregnancy from him. Veronica Smith was sent to a Catholic hostel when she became pregnant, and forced to give up her daughter . 'It was a big thing to deal with because there was a real stigma about unmarried mothers at the time. I . just knew I had a situation that needed to be dealt with.' Like Philomena Lee, the Irish mother whose tale became a BAFTA-winning silver screen success, Veronica was sent to a Catholic hostel to wait out her pregnancy. 'I told my mother and my elder sister about my situation and they gave me me a solution which was to go to a Catholic Crusade of Rescue hostel,' she remembers. 'I was a trained nurse, how could I not . think for myself? But I was brought up to be an obedient Catholic.' When the time came for Veronica to give birth, her mother and sister were once more by her side, although she admits that many of her memories of that traumatic time have been blocked out. 'I have a memory of the labour and . delivery,' she says. 'I can vaguely remember birthing her and I can remember my mother . and younger sister taking her to be baptised.' Of the day her daughter was taken away, between five and seven days after she was born, Veronica has no memory at all. Glamorous: Veronica pictured in 1965 when she was a nurse working at Butlin's in Bognor Regis . Brave: Philomena Lee whose search for her lost son inspired a BAFTA-winning film . But although she can't remember much about the adoption process itself, Veronica was never able to forget her daughter, despite repeatedly being told to 'move on' with her life. 'I was told on numerous occasions to go home, forget about it and carry on with my life,' she remembers. 'As for my mother, she just wanted it all to be over.' While it might have been over for her mother, for Veronica, it wasn't quite so easy and she admits that the experience has had a lasting impact on her ability to form relationships. Worse, it meant that Veronica never had the chance to have more children, meeting and marrying husband Roger in her 60s. By the time she reached her late 40s, Veronica on the verge of a breakdown and when she suffered a series gynaecological problems, the grief she had hidden for so long came tumbling out. Signed off work, she watched programmes such as Killroy and noted with interest their success in reuniting adopted children with their biological parents. Inspired by what she saw, she began looking for her daughter in earnest. 'The Catholic Children's Society gave me a . few clues about her parents whereabouts and told me they'd emigrated to . Canada,' she remembers. 'Once you start on the searching mode, it almost becomes . obsessive.' Sure enough, in 1989, Veronica finally made contact with her long-lost daughter, by then a 24-year-old woman. At first, the relationship was shaky but that all changed when Veronica's daughter Catherine gave birth to a daughter of her own. 'She was glad I made contact,' remembers Veronica of the first time she reached out to her daughter. 'She told me she had my brown eyes and my smile but she said she wasn't quite ready to meet me and that she wanted to get on with her life. Starring role: Judi Dench played Philomena in the adaptation of Martin Sixsmith's book . 'I've never had the chance to be a . mother so I don't know whether or not we have a normal relationship. I . just try to do my best.' 'She told me she didn't want anything . further than knowing where I was.' After Catherine had a daughter, now 11, things changed once more. 'When her daughter was nine months old, she emailed me and told me she had a daughter,' remembers Veronica, 'but it was another year before we met.' When mother and daughter finally were reunited, Veronica says the meeting was 'fantastic' from the start. 'Oh God, it was fantastic!' she remembers. 'She [Catherine] parked on our driveway and got out and gave me . hug and we had a lovely day. She adds: 'She's coming today to spend the weekend with us.' But although Veronica says the pair now have a lovely relationship, she admits that not everything has been so easy - among them, playing the role of mother to Catherine. 'That's . the thing I find difficult - playing the mother role,' she says. 'I've never had the chance to be a mother so I don't know whether or not we have a normal relationship. I just try to do my best.' Unethical: Some of the children put up for adoption by the Adoption Association in the 1960s . And although in regular contact with Catherine, Veronica, who was unable to have other children, says she would like an official apology to compensate for some of the pain she went through. She also says that she has been unable to forgive the Catholic church for its stance on unmarried mothers and has since left the religion. 'The . Philomena film has done us a lot of good,' she adds, 'and she was so forgiving of her religion, but I'm not of that mindset. 'It was going on in the whole of the UK and all round the world. Just . because women weren't married, they lost their children. I find it . abhorrent.' She hopes too, that women who have lived with the guilt of giving up their children in the 1960s will hear of her story and come to accept that the situation was not of their making. 'Hopefully, the more I talk about what happened, the . more women will come out of their closet and stop feeling ashamed and guilty,' she says. 'They're not to blame. Many of them slept with a man just once and got . pregnant and they've paid the price for it ever since.' Philomena is out on Blu-ray and DVD on 24th March, and available on Digital HD now.

The style conscious two-year-old turns her nose up at Primark clothes and is happiest when riding in style in father Paul’s Porsche. Faye invests in quality for Scarlett and her sister Savannah, one, and wouldn’t dream of buying ‘cheap’ shoes from Next or M&S. Instead their dainty feet are clad in Hunter wellies, Ugg boots or pricy Russell and Bromley numbers. The jet-setting toddlers have travelled to exotic destinations like Dubai and Cape Town, and only stay in five star hotels with Michelin starred restaurants on site. Their designer suitcases are stuffed full of little Ralph Lauren dresses, Juicy Couture tops, Angel’s Face tutus and silk Merino Kids pajamas and already Scarlett knows the difference between high-end and high street.

Parents spend £3,000 on toys in the year, with an additional £2,000 on Christmas and birthdays . 'It’s important that they walk properly so I wouldn’t ever buy any sort of cheap shoes from Next or M&S or anything like that.' Scarlett developed her penchant for fine things at an early age. 'She only slept in Merino Kids when she was a baby,' said Faye. 'When it’s your first you think something awful is going to happen to them if they don’t have the best of everything. 'Her coming home from the hospital outfit was a little Ralph Lauren babygro. 'I never had her in it again because we didn’t find out the baby’s sex and the babygro was blue. 'That cost £65 I think.' Savannah sits on a pile of her expensive clothes. Faye has splashed out £7,000 on an extravagant designer wardrobe including labels like Diesel and Ralph Lauren . And Scarlett’s expensive tastes aren’t limited to fashion, extending to cars, holidays and even home decor. 'My husband drives a Porsche Cayman and Scarlett particularly likes being in the front seat of that,' said Faye. 'She thinks that my 4x4 Volkswagon is really boring in comparison. 'I think she’ll probably be into really fast cars.' Faye and her husband, Paul Jacobs, 35, a business development manager, live in a large four bedroom detached house in Camberley, Surrey. The couple spent £6,500 on decorating Scarlett’s nursery and first bedroom, opting for designer furniture from exclusive brand, ASPACE. The bed alone cost £1,000. And when it comes to holidays, no expense is spared. Faye said: 'They are a bit spoilt with holidays. 'In Scarlett’s first year she went to Cape Town, Mykonos in Greece, Dubai and Spain and since we’ve had Savannah we’ve been to Dubai again, France and Halkidiki in Greece. 'It’s really impressive but my husband doesn’t care how much a holiday costs. 'We always make sure it’s totally five star with Michelin star restaurants in the hotel. 'The holidays are world class and we’ve spent about £25,000. Faye describes Scarlett as a 'shoe girl' since 18-months-old, whereas Savannah is more fascinated by her mother’s Mulberry messenger bag. At age one, little Savannah has travelled more than some adults, having been to Dubai, France and Halkidiki in Greece . 'You have children and if you’ve got the money why wouldn’t you give them the best of everything?' Faye explains . Faye said: 'We bought her a pair of Cinderella shoes from the Disney shop and Scarlett absolutely hated them because they weren’t high enough and they weren’t expensive enough and they weren’t like proper shoes so she wasn’t interested. 'She likes to stomp around the house in stonking great stilettos and I’m always catching her in my Kurt Geiger heels. 'We take a photo because it looks really cute then we go mad. 'I’m really impressed at how she walks in them because I can’t walk that well in heels!' Faye says she wants her girls to have the best of everything - whatever the cost - and loves dolling up her daughters. She said: 'I always knew friends that were spoilt and I remember thinking when I have children I really don’t want that, I want them to be able to appreciate everything. 'But then you have children and if you’ve got the money why wouldn’t you give them the best of everything? 'I suppose they are spoilt but they’re not as spoilt as some children and I think if you can afford it then you can’t really justify not getting them the best.

"By . Luke Garratt . A banned driver who drove at 100mph during a Christmas day police chase, with his heavily pregnant girlfriend and a baby in the rear seats, has been jailed for 22 months. Ashton Dellamonica, 21, from Stapleford, Nottingham, pleaded guilty at Nottingham Crown Court to charges of dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, and having no car insurance. The police chase was filmed by Nottinghamshire Police using both a police car and helicopter involved in the chase, and shows Dellamonica swerving around the roads, narrowly avoiding other drivers, running red lights and taking to the wrong side of the road during his 11 mile chase on icy roads. Scroll down for video . The stolen Audi travels down icy roads with baby, pregnant girlfriend, and passenger in tow, with Ashton Dellamonica at the wheel . After being spotted driving the stolen car, Dellamonica speeds up and frequently swerves onto the wrong side of the road to escape police . Dellamonica approaches a set of red lights at a crossroads, narrowly avoiding the car that is trying to drive past, who is forced to do an emergency stop on icy roads to avoid the Audi . Ashton Dellamonica, a banned driver filmed speeding at more than 100mph during a Christmas Day police pursuit - with his heavily pregnant girlfriend and a baby in the rear seats . Dellamonica, of Moorfield Court, Stapleford, Nottingham, sped away from an unmarked police patrol late on December 25 last year after being spotted driving a stolen Audi. The offender later avoided a stinger operation that had been set up on the A610 with the intention of slowing him down, and then drove through Nottingham at speeds in excess of 100mph. A police helicopter was able to follow the Audi as it passed through six red traffic lights before it crashed into a parked vehicle in The Meadows area. At one point, Dellamonica speeds round a roundabout going the opposite direction, trying to lose line-of-sight with the police in order to escape . Frequently, Dellamonica swerves onto the wrong side of the road in an attempt to escape the police, keeping an average speed of around 80mph . The stolen Audi can be seen on the helicopter camera driving on the wrong side of the road with the police in hot pursuit . At one point, Dellamonica travels into an enclosed estate in an attempt to dodge police . Officers then chased Dellamonica on foot and he was arrested after being found hidden underneath a parked car in Lammas Gardens. His girlfriend, baby and another passenger were all uninjured. Commenting on Dellamonica's actions, Detective Constable Emma Pollard, of Radford Road CID, said: 'Officers involved said they had not seen such dangerous driving in years of policing. Dellamonica ditches the car in a cul-de-sac, jumping out of it while it is still moving and letting it career into parked cars while his pregnant girlfriend and baby are still in the passenger seats . He begins running through the estate, before attempting to get into somebody's house to hide . When he is unsuccessful he tries to hide underneath a car, where he is shortly arrested by the police . 'Anyone seeing the footage of his driving will be shocked that no one was seriously hurt by such wilful and dangerous behaviour. 'Claiming he was concerned about a small amount of cannabis on his person, he chose to risk the life of his unborn child, his girlfriend, brother and baby, by driving at speeds of more than 100mph in icy and wet conditions. 'I am pleased with the sentencing and I hope it sends out a message that we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our communities.'","Ashton Dellamonica, 21, from Stapleford, Nottingham, jailed for 22 months .

The hairy volunteer winces as the strips are pulled off his rather hirsute chest . Wax on, wax off: Holly and Phillip feel his pain . After the waxing, comes 'sugaring' where a sticky, sweet substance is smeared on, then ripped off with a strip to remove hair . 'Manscaping is important whether . you're a guy or a girl,' continued the immaculately-groomed Big Brother runner-up . and Made In Chelsea star. However, in spite of his fondness for manscaping, Ollie did not try out the various recommended hair removal methods, instead testing them out on volunteers. Ollie put a variety of hair removal . methods through their paces, ranging from the £449 Homedica Me Pro Ultra . at-home laser treatment to live - and extremely painful-looking chest . waxing and failed 'sugaring'. Homedica Me Pro Ultra, £449 . An at-home device which will remove hair permanently, with minimal pain and fuss. No No! Hair, £193.50 . You can use it on the bikini line, sensitive areas such as the face. There is a slight burning smell, however that just shows it is working on removing the hair . Braun Silk Epil, £89.99 . Removes . hair but also apparently has massaging, tightening effect. Uses 40 . tweezers to pluck out hairs from root. Not a permanent method of removal, although hair does grow back more sparsely after repeated use. Parissa wax strips, £10.99 . Removes hair efficiently but painfully, as shown on our clip. Anubis sugaring starter kit, £25.95 . Works in a similar way to waxing, but all-natural and made only of sugar. However, the sticky substance got stuck on the tester's chest hair, so didn't actually get rid of any fur. Nad's For Men hair removal cream, £8.99 . Gets rid of hair without pain, but re-growth very quick as not plucked from follicle. Could a new career in the beauty and grooming industry be on the cards? Ollie recently came third in Big Brother behind former N-Dubz singer Dappy and winner Jim Davidson, so his popularity with the public is in no doubt. Fans were hoping that he and TOWIE star Sam Faiers would start an on-set romance, but it was not to be. Sam first claimed to fancy Ollie during a task set by Big Brother earlier in the series but the pair's friendship seemed to grow stronger as time moved on. And, in the penultimate episode of the season on Tuesday night, Ollie attempted to tell Sam he was attracted to her but felt he couldn't express his true feelings in front of the cameras. However, things fizzled once the pair were out of the house and there are rumours that Sam and her ex Joey Essex are once more an item.","Ollie has a friend come round to his house to wax his bottom .

"By . Luke Garratt . Yang Zhiqiao, 75, dressed in the Mickey Mouse costume, earning money in the local park . The 75-year-old mother of a Chinese man has taken to dressing up as Mickey Mouse in order to raise money to help him find a girlfriend. Single man Yang Guan, 40, thought his mother was joking when she said she would use a second hand Disney costume to pose with tourists in the local park in Luoyang, Henan province, central China, so she could raise some extra cash to help him get his life on track. His mother Yang Zhiqiao said she had been feeling bad for her son because he couldn't get a girlfriend, and raising money was a way to help him support a potential wife. Local children have started calling Zhiqiao the 'Mickey Mouse Grandma', and she has taken to charging a 10 yuan fee to have a picture taken with her in popular tourist venues. However, many people have been paying her a lot more when they find out that she is a frail old lady struggling in a heavy costume. Locals have even been volunteering in order to help her take frequent breaks, taking turns to wear the secon-hand costume. Zhiqiao said: 'I have to make more money to find my son a wife.' Zhiqiao's son bought the costume originally, planning to use it to make some money, but now it is his mother that uses it, as his day job prevented him from doing so. Zhiqiao said: 'I really felt sorry for my son because he is now 40 and he still hasn't . managed to get a girlfriend. 'He is a very good man and hard-working but . he struggles to get a good job to earn enough money to be able to . support a wife, and so he has had difficulty getting a partner. 'I wanted . to help him but at my age it's hard to find a job where I can earn . money. Single Chinese man Yang Guan, 40, thought his 75-year-old mum (pictured) was taking the Mickey when she said she intended to get a job to help him to find a girlfriend. But he realised Yang Zhiqiao, 75, was serious when she turned up with a second-hand Mickey Mouse costume . 'Then I saw some pictures of people who had gone to Disneyland and . been photographed with some of the characters, and I thought to myself . that not everybody would be able to afford to go to Disneyland to be . seen with Mickey Mouse. 'So I decided to bring Mickey Mouse to them. 'I moved here with my husband and my son in 1987, and the future . seemed bright, but it didn't work out after my husband and I divorced . in 1996 and we haven't been able to get on our feet financially ever . since. 'My son is quite depressed that he is getting on now and has still . not managed to find a partner. That was why I decided to help him.' Yang Zhiqiao has to take frequent breaks (right) from the costume, saying that extended periods dressed in it can cause her to have trouble breathing. Nevertheless, she continues to work for her son's benefit, despite the fact the purchase of the costume, and business plan, was his to begin with . But while the costume might have positive effects on Guan, it has had negative effects on his mother. She said: 'The costume is too heavy, there is little air inside. 'If I wear it for a long time I cannot breathe.' Park visitor Fen Ts'ui, 37, said: 'It really hurts to see her dressed . like that. She is so old and should live a much easier life now.'","Yang Zhiqiao. 75, from Luoyang, Henan province, China, uses the costume .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This is the moment a train announcer stunned passengers by announcing over a tannoy as they pulled into a station to beware of pickpockets and gipsies. The London Midland service had been pulling into Telford Station, Shropshire, on Saturday when the comments were made. Passenger Chris Downes, 46, was recording on his mobile at the time and the announcer can clearly be heard saying: 'Telford Central - please be aware of pickpockets and gipsies'. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a train announcer stunned passengers by announcing over a tannoy as they pulled into a station to beware of pickpockets and gipsies . The remark was mainly greeted by cheers from Shrewsbury Town football fans travelling back from their game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. But London Midland said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury service. Yesterday Wolves fan Mr Downes, who was on his way home to Bayston Hill, Shropshire, with son Jack, 14, said: 'There had been loads of banter between the fans sharing carriages, which threatened to boil over. The atmosphere was a bit hostile at times. 'The announcement diluted the situation quite a bit and helped lighten the mood, to be honest.'But I thought at the time he might get into a bit of trouble for it. Which is shame really, because I’m sure it was intended in good humour. 'When we got to Shrewsbury he said ""Welcome back to civilisation"" and I for one am looking forward to travelling on his train again in future. 'There’s not enough train drivers with a sense of humour and I think his comments were only made in jest.' However, other passengers and residents of Telford yesterday reacted with disgust at the 'unprofessional' and 'offensive' comments. Mark Peaker, 47, a father-of-three, from Telford said: 'I couldn’t believe what I was hearing - they have not only used a derogatory term they have managed to offend an entire town. 'It suggests we are just a town full of thieves, which is not the case at all. Somebody in a professional role should not be insulting places while they are working. London Midland said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury service . 'I’m all for them having a sense of humour but this was not funny at all and I hope he is disciplined for his unprofessional actions.' One Wolves fan, who lives in Telford but wished to remain anonymous, was travelling back home from the derby match at Molineux, which ended 0-0. He said: 'I couldn’t believe it. I was utterly flabbergasted. 'Tensions among fans were already high after the match and I don’t think that helped the situation at all. The London Midland service had been pulling into Telford Station, Shropshire, on Saturday when the comments were made . 'Telford is actually a really nice place to live. It certainly isn’t up to a train announcer to make insulting comments about it.' The Gipsy Council called for the matter to be taken up with the police and branded the remarks as racist. Bill Kerswell, a spokesman for the council, said: 'This is unlawful, it is a racist comment. 'It is the same as using any offensive word relating to homosexuals or people of colour. 'I would think it is a police matter and I hope they take it up and look into it.' A spokesman for the train company thanked passengers for drawing it to their attention and added: 'We do not tolerate any sort of comment of that kind made by anyone on our trains and will be looking into it immediately.'","London Midland service had been pulling into Telford Station in Shropshire .

"By . Ruth Styles . Losing weight ahead of the big day has become a classic part of being a bride with 96 per cent of women admitting to going on a diet ahead of their wedding. But for Rachel Chew, 38, from the West Midlands, her bid to lose weight before her big day left her in agony after a bungling surgeon cut through her bowel during gastric bypass surgery. Three years and seven operations later, the open wound on her stomach has still not healed and Ms Chew remains unmarried. Upsetting: Rachel Chew had to postpone her wedding after a bungled gastric bypass left her in agony . Damage: Rachel's stomach still has a gaping wound and oozes revolting fluids . 'I just wanted to be healthy so that we could enjoy our lives together,' says Ms Chew of the decision that led to the disastrous operation. '[Fiance Michael] said he would support me in whatever I wanted to do. I thought this is the turning point, this is the start of my new life.' With three months to go before her wedding to her fiance Michael, she paid Â£7,000 for a private gastric bypass operation in a bid to slim down. But it only took 24 hours before she began to feel unwell. 'They found that during the first operation, the surgeon had accidentally cut my bowel,' she remembers. Although the hospital wheeled her straight back into the operating theatre to fix the damage, less than two weeks later, she had to be rushed to A&E after her stitches split, leaving her with a deep hole that oozed infection. 'Three years down the line, and I've had eight operations in total - seven to repair the damage from the initial cut,' she reveals. During her last operation, surgeons connected her stomach to an external drain to draw off the pus from the continuing infection. 'The pipe is attached to a drain which . goes into my stomach and the fluid from the wound is sucked out and goes . into the machine,' she explains. 'I have to carry it everywhere with me, I have to . shower with it, sleep with it... Everything gets done with this machine.' Ghastly: Rachel is permanently attached to a drain that draws away fluids created by the infection inside . Hope: Rachel says she's trying to focus on a happier future with her fiance and her wedding . The infection and resulting hole have also damaged her relationship with Ms Chew saying that any form of physical contact - even a simple hug - leaves her in pain. 'I don't like him [Michael] touching my stomach at . all,' she explains. 'It's awful for him because he just wants to give me a hug. 'I . wish I could allow him to give me the hugs and the closeness I so . desperately want but I feel so uncomfortable.' In spite of her injury, Ms Chew and her fiance have now set a new date for the wedding and she hopes a solution to her stomach will be found before she walks down the aisle. 'When I get really down and really low, I keep looking at my dress, thinking ""I know this is going to be one of the best days of my life"",' she explains. 'Because of the lumps in my stomach and because I'm attached to this machine, I can't actually get in my dress at the moment - it's too tight. She adds: 'I'm just trying to focus on my future with my fiance and on our wedding.'

"By . Mark Prigg . More than 400 years after its discovery by Galileo, the largest moon in the solar system has finally been mapped. The first geological map of an icy outer-planet moon ever created, it reveals a 'dual landscape'. One part is made up of complex grooves and ridges, while a second area is highly cratered. This mosaic was assembled using imagery from Voyagers 1 and 2 and Galileo spacecraft. This mosaic (right) served as the base map for the geologic map of Ganymede (left). Since its discovery in January 1610, Ganymede has been the focus of repeated observation, first by Earth-based telescopes, and later by flyby missions and spacecraft orbiting Jupiter. These studies depict a complex icy world whose surface is characterized by the striking contrast between its two major terrain types: the dark, very old, highly cratered regions; and the lighter, somewhat younger (but still ancient) regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges. With a diameter of 3,280 miles (5,262 kilometers), Ganymede is larger than both planet Mercury and dwarf planet Pluto. It’s also the only satellite in the solar system known to have its own magnetosphere. 'By mapping all of Ganymede’s surface, we can more accurately address scientific questions regarding the formation and evolution of this truly unique moon,' said Wes Patterson of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, who led the research. Published by the U.S. Geological Survey, the map technically illustrates the varied geologic character of Ganymede’s surface and is the first complete global geologic map of an icy, outer-planet moon. Patterson, Collins and colleagues used images from NASA’s Voyager and Galileo missions to create the map, which is only the fourth of its kind covering a planetary satellite - the others being of Earth’s moon and Jupiter’s moons Io and Callisto.

These features record evidence of Ganymede’s internal evolution, its dynamical interactions with the other Galilean satellites, and the evolution of the small bodies that have impacted Ganymede’s surface. The new chart will be a valuable tool for researchers to compare the geologic characters of other icy moons, since almost any type of feature that is found on other icy satellites has a similar feature somewhere on Ganymede. And with a surface over half as large as all the land area on Earth, Ganymede offers a wide variety of locations to observe. 'Ganymede also shows features that are ancient alongside much more recently formed features, adding historical diversity in addition to geographic diversity,' Collins says.

"By . Emma Innes . A 'fat gene’ has been identified, bringing the possibility of an anti-obesity drug a step closer, scientists have revealed. The protein, called IRX3, regulates metabolism and energy expenditure - and researchers found mice deficient in it are 30 per cent slimmer on average. The study found the ‘slim mice’ weighed less despite eating the same amount and doing as much physical activity as their counterparts. Scientists have discovered a 'fat gene' which they say could be responsible for obesity . When fed a high-fat diet, mice without IRX3 retained the same weight and fat levels as on normal diets, whereas others given the same food gained almost twice as much weight. Fat cells in IRX3-deficient mice were smaller and increased levels of brown fat - which burns up unhealthy white fat - were observed. In addition, these mice were better able to process glucose. Professor Chin-Chung Hui, of the University of Toronto, said: ‘These mice are thin. They lose weight primarily through the loss of fat. But they are not runts. ‘They are also completely resistant to high-fat diet induced obesity. They have much better ability to handle glucose - and seem protected against diabetes.’ The researchers said IRX3 interacts with another gene known as FTO which for some time has been known to be the most strongly related to being overweight. Researchers say that mice without the gene do not put on weight when they are fed a high-fat diet . Scientists say people carrying variants of this gene produce more of IRX3 - revealing a possible cause of obesity. Professor Marcelo Nobrega, of Chicago University, said: ‘IRX3 is probably a master regulator of genetic programmes in the cells where it is expressed. ‘We're interested in what its targets are and what they alter. The goal is to identify downstream targets of IRX3 that become models for drug targeting.’ Researchers showed the connection between IRX3 and FTO occurs in humans, mice and zebrafish - suggesting an evolutionary link across different species going back thousands of years. The study, published online in Nature, implies variants in FTO regulate obesity-related traits through links with IRX3 - identifying it as the likely ‘fat gene’. Professor Nobrega said: ‘Our data strongly suggest IRX3 controls body mass and regulates body composition. Any association between FTO and obesity appears due to the influence of IRX3.’ Tests on mice showed IRX3 interacts with FTO even though its locality on the genome is a long way away. An analysis of a human genetic database then found the same thing happens in people which was confirmed in experiments on human cells in the lab. Using data from 153 brain samples of Europeans the researchers then discovered the mutations to FTO affecting body weight are associated with IRX3 expression. Obesity-related FTO variants enhanced the expression of IRX3 but did not seem to play a direct role in this interaction themselves. The scientists believe their discovery could lead to the development of an anti-obesity drug . The researchers also discovered mice with altered IRX3 function in the hypothalamus - the portion of the brain known to regulate feeding behaviour and energy expenditure - showed an identical pattern of leanness as those which completely lacked the gene. So hypothalamic function of IRX3 seems to control body mass and composition in these animals - indicating the genetic predisposition to obesity is wired in the brain. IRX3 codes for a protein that regulates other genes and is present both in and outside the brain, in organs and cells such as fat cells. Professor Nobrega and colleagues are currently investigating how IRX3 interacts with genes and molecules it regulates and hope to identify targets for the development of drugs against obesity and diabetes.","A protein called IRX3 regulates metabolism and energy expenditure .

"By . Sarah Michael . Khloe Kardashian has launched a scathing attack on Australian morning show Sunrise after cutting off an interview over questions about her niece North West. The reality TV star's appearance on the show was cut short on Tuesday morning and Sunrise quickly tweeted that it was due to host Samantha Armytage's line of questioning. 'We thought it was a technical glitch but turns out @KhloEkardashian's people pulled the plug after @Sam_armytage asked about baby North,' Sunrise tweeted. Scroll down for video . 'Stop reaching for a story': Khloe Kardashian has slammed Sunrise in a foul-mouthed tirade after her live cross was cut off following questions about niece North West . Khloe fired back accusing the morning show of trying to create a story out of nothing. 'Why would I cut an interview short because of North? Get over yourself Sunrise... The call dropped... stop reaching for a story,' she tweeted. 'You are so f***ing desperate!' The 29-year-old later tweeted 'Sorry KhloMoney took my phone', referencing her outspoken alter-ego. Sunrise executive producer Michael Pell told the MailOnline Khloe's people did pull the plug on the interview and said her local rep had apologised. He also tweeted: 'What happened with @khloekardashian on the show is a good lesson for publicists everywhere. Don't try to censor natural conversation.' Sunrise host David Koch fired back and called Khloe an 'idiot' later in the program. '[My daughter] Brie's going to be very angry with me criticising Khloe, but she's an idiot,' he said. 'I'm sorry…  I'm sorry to do that.' Awkward: Tuesday morning's Sunrise interview with the reality star was cut off . Kochie and co-host Samantha Armytage also went on air after Khloe sent the tweets to deny her claims the call was dropped due to a bad satellite. 'Our information from LA was that the plug was pulled when we talked about baby North,' Sam said. 'We were not given any information that that was off limits, you are launching a babies' clothing line which you yourself admitted was inspired by your nieces and nephews.' Earlier in the show Khloe appeared live from LA to talk about the Kardashian Kollection's new lingerie and baby clothing lines. Sam asked the reality star about her niece, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's daughter North West. 'And I guess the baby line is inspired by nieces and nephews starting to arrive, how's baby North going?' Sam asked. 'North is fabulous she's so beautiful,' Khloe responded. 'Penelope's obsessed with her and it's so cute to see that cousin dynamic.' The live feed was immediately cut off following Khloe's response. Happy birthday: Khloe posted a picture collage to Instagram thanking Robert for 'being the best brother anyone could ask for' Perhaps Khloe is just shaky with international radio hosts, as she had another clunky moment later in the day. During an interview with Nova's Fitzy & Wippa she abruptly stopped talking; the hosts thought she had cut out, but she was just embarrassed after swearing, thinking cussing was taboo. After a few awkward moments of silence, she mustered up an apology, before the confused funnymen delicately assured her all was well. Later on Tuesday Khloe tried to change the subject after her Twitter tirade by posting about brother Robert's birthday. She posted a picture from Instagram to her Twitter account and also said that she was celebrating with Rob in LA. 'Birthday dinner and game night!!! Wooohoo #HappyBirthdayRob,' she wrote. Also on Tuesday Khloe did an interview with Jules, Merrick, Sophie and Mel B on 2Day FM, during which she opened up about her divorce to Lamar Odom. 'It's definitely not anything I’m through. I’m going through it, but I’m not through it,' she said. 'It's really hard to watch yourself on TV too – it's definitely different in that the world has to watch too. 'It's definitely not the easiest thing to do but it's my life now I guess.'","Khloe's PR team pulled plug on live chat following questions about her niece .

"By . Richard Spillett . A Second World War gun tower has sold for an astonishing £200,000 - despite having no running water or toilet. The tiny seaside property, last used as an artist's gallery, has no parking and is only ten foot by ten foot in size. But that didn't stop potential buyers queuing up to hand over its six-figure asking price. The seafront property (circled) commanded a large asking price despite being only ten foot by ten foot in size .

The one up-one down former wartime tower has only one real luxury - the use of an outside tap. But buyers were attracted by planning permission to convert the tower into a one-bedroom holiday home for tourists visiting the area. Estate agent Katherine Edwards said: 'It is the location that sold it and the views are amazing. 'We got a lot of interest from so many people up and down the country from people who wanted to use it as a second home or holiday let. 'It is a completely individual property which has a lot of character and will be used as a holiday home.' The property, once an artist's studio, has no running water, toilet or parking . It is thought the building, with has good views of the nearby coastline, will be converted into a one-bedroom holiday home for tourists . The white-walled property was constructed during the war as part of the Shaldon coastal defences. It was originally used as a guard room topped with a searchlight and small gun used to protect the mouth of the River Teign. It does have a power supply and a small outside area which, if carefully landscaped, could provide space for a small table and chairs. Shaldon is a highly desirable seaside village which attracts top prices. The five luxury beach huts on the nearby Strand were sold for up to £250,000 each in 2011. Ms Edwards added: 'Shaldon continues to be popular. It is right on the waterside and the village has a lovely community feel. 'It is starting to get a foodie reputation too with lots of restaurants and cafes and everyone says hello, even if they don’t know you. That is what people like.' Homes in the seaside village of Shaldon, Devon often command huge prices.

"By . Rachel Reilly . A Canadian academic is encouraging his students to pick their noses in a bid to see if the habit has any health benefits. Professor Scott Napper is requesting his pupils to investigate the possible health benefits of eating their mucous in a bid to understand the human immune system better. He believes that eating mucous in the nose may boost the immune system by introducing small and harmless amounts of germs back into the body. His theory follows others that suggest improved hygiene has led to an increase in allergies and auto-immune disorders. Getting stuck in: Parents discourage their children from picking their nose but it could be good for their health, claims one expert . His proposed study involves splitting his class into two. Half will eat their pickings whilst other will not engage in the antisocial behaviour. They will then observe how the immune system responds to the new habit. Professor Napper said: ‘All you would need is a group of volunteers. You would put some sort of molecule in all their noses, and for half of the group they would go about their normal business and for the other half of the group, they would pick their nose and eat it.' ‘Then you could look for immune responses against that molecule and if they're higher in the booger-eaters, then that would validate the idea.’ Professor Napper added that the greatest value of the snot-eating question is that, when he brings it up with his first-year science students they are instantly engaged in the class. ‘Get the student to think, rather than just sitting there taking down notes,’ Napper said. ‘[Science] should be about the exchange of ideas.’ But the associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Saskatchewan is a firm believer in the powers of picking your nose. He said: ‘Nature pushes us to do different things because it is to our advantage to have certain behaviours, to consume different types of foods. Other bad habits such as nail biting may also help boost the immune system . 'So maybe when you have an urge like this to pick your nose and eat it, you should just go with nature.’ 'From an evolutionary perspective, we evolved under very dirty conditions and maybe this desire to keep our environment and our behaviours sterile isn't actually working to our advantage,' he told CBC News. Experts such as Dr Hilary Longhurst, consultant immunologist from the Bart’s NHS Trust, believe a similar thing occurs when we bite our nails. ‘Unless your hands are filthy, the bugs we encounter when biting our nails could boost our immune system,' she said. The immune system works by developing a 'memory' and making a note of how to fight each bug it has ever encountered. When a bug is encountered a second time, the immune system reaches into its 'memory' and releases weapons — called memory lymphocytes — that know how to kill it.","Canadian academic Scott Napper wants his students to investigate the health benefits of the taboo habit .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Britain's fattest dog is on a crash diet because the owner kept forgetting he’d already been fed. Alfie the labrador weighed in at 12st 5lb (80kg) when the RSPCA took him in. That’s almost three times the normal weight of a labrador - and as heavy as Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney. It took four people using towels as slings to lift him when he arrived at the RSPCA’s Leybourne Animal Centre, in Kent. Scroll down for video . Britain's former fattest dog Alfie weighed 12.5 stone last year - as much as Wayne Rooney before arriving at the RSPCA's door for help . The 12-year-old canine was signed over to the RSPCA after his elderly owner kept forgetting he had already fed his pet. Christine Dooley, centre manager, said: 'He literally could not stand up when he arrived because he was so fat. I have never seen a dog that fat before in my 27 years with the RSPCA, he must be Britain’s fattest pet. 'He was just a massive blob with a leg at each corner. 'He was being fed to death, it’s amazing he was alive given his size. A healthy Labrador weighs about 30 kilos (4stone 7lbs), so poor Alfie was carrying the weight of two Labradors, and a Staffie too.' Alfie struggled to walk more than a few steps and could not even lift his legs a couple of inches into a raised bed in his kennel - so staff at the centre made him comfortable with a piece of carpet and blankets on the floor. Alfie's s neck is so big wears the same size collar as a St Bernard. Alfie was passed to the RSPCA after his elderly owner kept forgetting he had already fed his pet. He has been put on a carefully calorie controlled diet with two meals a day, weekly weigh-ins and strictly no treats. His obesity means he pants when he breathes and he may have damaged his joints and suffered pressure sores on his legs. Since arriving at the centre in March this year he has lost about four and a half stone. This means he is more than half way to his target weight. Wayne Rooney weighs the same as Alfie. Christine said: 'When he first came in he couldn’t go on walks because of his size but each day as the weight is coming off he is able to take a few steps further. We have to be careful when staff take him for a walk because if he sits down and refuses to get back up we have to call in extra people to lift him up again. 'We want the weight to come off slowly to give his leg muscles a chance to build up strength and for his skin to shrink. We cannot foster him out yet because he wouldn’t be able to get him into the back of a car. 'He’s such a lovely dog and his tail never stops wagging, everyone here has fallen in love with him.' Once Alfie has reached a manageable weight staff at the centre near Maidstone, Kent, will start looking for a home for him. His new owner will need to keep up his healthy diet and gentle exercise regime. Although Alfie’s obesity is extreme it appears to be a growing problem among dogs. Since 2009 the number of complaints and calls the RSPCA has received about fat, obese and overweight dogs has steadily increased from about 20 a month to more than 30. RSPCA Inspector Caroline Doe, based in Kent, said over indulging a pet is just as harmful as not feeding them enough. She said: 'Alfie’s case is exceptional, I’ve never seen a dog that big before, but there are lots of dogs out there which are overweight or obese. 'People don’t seem to realise it’s a problem because they think they are showing their pets love by giving them treats and titbits . 'In fact in terms of causing suffering, allowing your dog to become extremely obese is just as damaging as starving it and letting it get very skinny.'

"By . Jill Reilly . The French rogue trader who lost 4.9bn euros ($6.4bn; £4bn) at bank Societe Generale has lost his appeal against a three-year jail sentence. France's highest court today upheld the prison sentence for Jerome Kerviel, but threw out the 4.9 billion euros ($7 billion) in civil damages he'd been ordered to pay back. Kerviel was convicted in 2010 of carrying out one of the biggest trading frauds in history that almost took down his bank, Societe Generale, with 4.9 billion euros in losses. France's highest court today upheld a prison sentence for Jerome Kerviel, but threw out the 4.9 billion euros ($7 billion) in civil damages he'd been ordered to pay back . Kerviel is currently on a trek from Rome to Paris 'against the tyranny of the markets' He sees himself as a victim of a system that turned a blind eye to his illegal trades as long as they made money for the bank. Kerviel had appealed the sentence of three years in prison, which had already been upheld once before by a lower appeals court. In a statement, the high court said Wednesday that the lower court decision had not taken into account faults committed by Kerviel's former employer, French bank Societe Generale, when it ordered ordered Kerviel to repay the bank's entire losses in the fraud. He sees himself as a victim of a system that turned a blind eye to his illegal trades as long as they made money for the bank . Kerviel is currently in Italy, walking back to Paris on a pilgrimage after meeting the pope. Television images showed him wearing a red jacket and red backpack, walking swiftly and trying to ignore the numerous journalists trailing him. He made no statement. Outside the courtroom in Paris, Kerviel's lawyers claimed a partial victory. 'The errors of Societe Generale were at the heart of the concerns expressed by the judicial system, and it appears at the least surprising to lock up Jerome Kerviel when the existence of significant errors on behalf of his employer - and the consequences of these errors on events attributed to him - were affirmed,' said Patrice Spinosi. Kerviel's lawyer Patrice Spinosi talks to the press the Paris' court at the end of the appeal . The high court ordered the civil damages to be retried by an appeals court in Versailles. The bank's lawyer Jean Veil said that in the new trial the bank will explain that they knew 'from the moment that these events were discovered, that there were errors in our system, which we've repaired and spent hundreds of millions to be able to change our control system.' The appeals court had upheld the October 2010 conviction of Kerviel for forgery, breach of trust and unauthorized computer use for covering up bets worth nearly 50 billion euros - more than the market value of the entire bank. It sentenced him to a five-year prison term - with two years suspended - and ordered he pay 4.9 billion euros in damages. Jerome Kerviel, seen here in October 2012,  has not made a statement about the verdict . An internal report by the bank, however, found managers failed to follow up on 74 different alarms about Kerviel's activities. Banned for life from working in the financial industry, Kerviel was making 2,300 euros a month ($3,150 at the time) as a computer consultant after leaving the bank. Societe Generale had paid him less than 100,000 euros a year ($155,700) with bonuses, a modest sum for the 1.4 billion euros in profits he earned for the bank in 2007. A few of the bank's executives resigned in the scandal's aftermath, including longtime Chairman Daniel Bouton. Kerviel's superiors were questioned in the probe, but none of them faced charges.","France's highest court today upheld a prison sentence for Jerome Kerviel .

"By . Sophie Borland . and Daniel Martin . Top earner: Jo-Anne Wass will earn £155,000 a year for two years after quitting next month, it has emerged . One of the most powerful women in the NHS is to be paid £300,000 over two years  after leaving her job. Jo-Anne Wass, a senior director at NHS England, will earn up to £155,000 for each of the next two years – even though she is quitting next month. The 46-year-old is a close ally of NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, the ‘man with no shame’, who has been forced to retire early over his links to the Mid Staffordshire scandal. It is understood that Miss Wass arranged to leave before his replacement arrives next month, to take up an unpaid consultancy role at Leeds University. NHS England insisted they would carry on paying her salary for up to two years as she is ‘on secondment’, even though she will not return. Details of the extraordinary agreement, uncovered by Health Service Journal, have emerged as thousands of nurses and midwives will find out today that their pay will be cut in real terms. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is understood to have ignored the advice of independent experts to grant NHS staff a pay rise of 1 per cent. Instead, the increase will be between 0 and 1 per cent, but as the rate of inflation is just below 2 per cent it is effectively a pay cut. Charlotte Leslie, a Tory MP and member of the Health Select Committee, described the pay-off as ‘absolutely unbelievable’. ‘It shows that the NHS is a tale of two worlds,’ she said. ‘There is the hard-working front line who abide by economic rules and austerity. 'And then you have this kind of luxury bubble of NHS management which is completely unaccountable, still splashing out money like it grows on trees. It’s vital we burst this bubble. ‘This news is a punch in the face for people working on the front line and taking a hit, seeing people poncing around in quango bodies seemingly getting enormous pay-offs.’ Tory MP Andrew Percy said Miss Wass ‘should do the decent thing and reject this salary’. The 46-year-old is a close ally of Sir David Nicholson, NHS chief executive dubbed 'the man with no shame' The news comes after Jeremy Hunt refused to raise NHS staff pay by 1 per cent despite expert advice . Miss Wass was last year named as one of the ten highest earners in the health service, on a salary of between £155,000 and £160,000. She lives in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, with her husband John and has worked for the NHS for 24 years, currently as the national director of human resources and organisational development. A spokesman for NHS England said they had agreed with Miss Wass to continue paying her, adding: ‘There are real benefits to encouraging the links between local education and the health care sector. ‘Jo-Anne thinks it is right that NHS England has certainty in planning for the future. As a result, Jo-Anne has made it clear that she has no intention of returning to her role.’","Jo-Anne Wass, 46, is a close ally of NHS boss, 'the man with no shame'

"By . Faith Bleasdale . Last month it was my first wedding anniversary. Just like any new wife, I made an extra-special effort to look good. I wore one of my favourite dresses, put on heels and carefully applied my make-up. Then, standing back, I assessed my reflection in the mirror - and burst into tears. I should have been over the moon, heading out for a romantic evening with the man I loved. Instead, I had a meeting with a very different man indeed - my divorce lawyer. Nobody gets married thinking that one day they'll have to sign divorce papers. I was no exception. I might have been nearing 40 when I walked down the aisle, with a four-year-old son from a previous relationship, but I still believed in happily ever after. Swept off her feet: Faith agreed to marry John after they had been together seven momths . To sign along that doomed dotted line less than a year later was devastating and humiliating. How could something go so wrong in such a short period of time? I'd first met John - a 46-year-old carpenter - at my 39th birthday party in 2012 through his sister, who's a friend of mine. I was a single mother to Xavier, then three, and had successfully built a life for myself - I wasn't looking for a man to complete me. I'm not one of those women who feels they need a strong arm to hang on, and while it did get a little lonely on occasions, I didn't want to meet someone for the sake of it. I felt that any man would have to significantly enhance my and Xavier's life for me to feel they were worth our time. And from the moment I met John, this is exactly what he did. There were no lightning bolts - he wasn't even my type physically. Yet I felt oddly drawn to him. It might be a cliché but I really did feel as if I'd known him for years. After that first meeting, John persistently wooed me. He sent me roses and constantly texted and phoned. On our first date, he drove for miles just to take me to an Indian restaurant he thought I would like. I hadn't experienced this kind of attentiveness for a long time . I'd be lying to say I didn't feel a flutter of excitement - but I was also wary of letting my guard down. I can remember, late one evening, his number showing up yet again on my mobile phone. I was so unused to a man pursuing me that I pulled the duvet over my head and refused to answer. I'd been out of the dating loop for so long, I had no idea how to respond. But eventually I let him take me out for dinner. On our first date, he drove for miles just to take me to an Indian restaurant he thought I would like. I hadn't experienced this kind of attentiveness for a long time. I was overwhelmed and for the first time in years I allowed myself to think that maybe I didn't need to be on my own after all. Most of all, though, I wanted my son to have a father figure in his life and John made me hope this might be possible. To say he was brilliant with Xavier, who has Down's syndrome, would be an understatement. They took to each other instantly and with incredible ease. Perfect father figure: John got on well with Xavier, her son from a previous relationship . Sometimes John would come to our house in the evenings, and Xavier would climb on to his lap and throw his arms around John's neck. Seeing them together made me feel so content. Then, a few weeks into our relationship, John carved a beautiful puppet theatre from wood for Xavier. Looking back, this was the turning point. Seeing John and my son together made me want to weep for Xavier and what I'd nearly deprived him of. Perhaps if it hadn't been for this I might have taken things more slowly, been more rational. When John proposed in September, seven months after we met, I didn't hesitate. He even remembered a ring I'd fallen in love with in a magazine - an art-deco-style platinum band. Most importantly, he said he wanted to give me and Xavier the security we deserved. We married in February last year - a magical winter wedding in one of my favourite places in North Devon. I was marrying a man I loved, and he loved me and my son, too. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot. I see things differently now. I see that I paid for the wedding and put in all of the work to make it happen. It was the start of a pattern. John didn't seem to be doing anything, or making any effort to make me happy . John moved into my home in Braunton, Devon, and - stupid as it might sound now - we agreed I would pay for the day-to-day bills. He would save his earnings from carpentry jobs to put towards the new house we were planning on buying together. This seemed a fair exchange. I had royalties coming in from my novels, and substantial savings. I didn't for a second imagine that John might not be putting away money as we'd agreed. Then, three months into our marriage, John dropped the bombshell that he hadn't saved anything. He'd lent the money to his father, he said. We had an almighty row - our first proper marital humdinger. I wanted to believe him. Worse still, I needed to. We were in the early stages of marriage. I just couldn't allow doubts to creep in. We soldiered on but, much as I wanted to ignore it, everything felt different. From the moment John moved in, it seemed to me that he stopped making an effort. I was doing more than my share: paying the bills, taking care of Xavier and working on my latest novel to support us. John didn't seem to be doing anything, or making any effort to make me happy. I could cope with the fact our sex life had dropped off a cliff, but he also seemed to lose interest in Xavier, who worshipped the ground he walked on. I sought solace in friends, who told me the first year of marriage is always the worst. Deep down I knew it was something more than this. I wasn't ready to face it yet, but an icy feeling of dread was starting to take hold. Short-lived happiness: Faith didn't expect to celebrate her first wedding anniversary with a divorce lawyer . Six months after we married, John started to come home from work reeking of beer. He would plonk himself on the sofa and spend hours on his iPad. There was little communication between us. When we did talk, it was usually a row. Things unravelled with startling speed. It seemed to me that John had simply given up all pretence that he was the lovely man I'd fallen in love with. The façade, as I now saw it, was falling daily. One night he came home drunk and staggering, and for the first time I was afraid of him. Trembling, I told him he was disgusting and that I didn't want him anywhere near Xavier. He lashed back, saying: 'I didn’t marry Xavier - I married you.' Then he became aggressive and threw a pair of shoes across the room at me. It seemed, for the first time, that I was seeing his true colours. I should have thrown him out there and then, but it still felt too soon to admit I'd made a terrible mistake. I was so ashamed that my marriage was failing so quickly. Our marriage lasted just ten sorry months and left me with a string of frustrating, unanswered questions . If I hadn't so desperately wanted it to work, I may have reacted differently. But my parents had enjoyed a long and contented marriage before my father passed away, and I was still under the delusion that I could achieve the same happiness with John. Perhaps if we'd had the backdrop of a deeper relationship, it might have worked. But when the honeymoon was over, there was nothing substantial to sustain us. My marriage was over - that much I knew. I could no longer deny a truth that was staring me in the face. I had absolutely no idea who my husband was. Two weeks before Christmas last year, John simply failed to come home. Of course, I called the police because I had no clue where he was. They investigated and came back with the news that he'd told them he wasn't a missing person. He simply didn't want to be found by me. I was utterly devastated. My instincts had been right but the reality was incredibly hard to accept.Our marriage lasted just ten sorry months and left me with a string of frustrating, unanswered questions. There's no denying John was not the man I thought he was. But who is he? I can't help but ask myself if he was only with me for a few months of rent-free living, or did he simply fall out of love with me? Maybe I wasn't the woman he thought I was when we fell in love. I'll probably never know. Indeed, I haven't seen or spoken to John since the day he left, and all I want now is for him to agree to a divorce and cut me free, so we can put the whole sorry saga behind us. For the past 12 months I've been living a lie, desperately trying to complete a jigsaw with a missing piece that won't fit. And the worst of it is, I've put Xavier through it all in the hope of making his life better, when all I've done is make it worse. But I've learnt my lesson. If something seems too good to be true then, most of the time, it probably is. Some names have been changed.","Faith first met John, 46, at her 39th birthday party .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Almost 4,000 NHS staff given redundancy pay-offs as part of the coalition’s health shake-up have been rehired, new figures reveal. More than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £650,000 are now back working in the health service. Labour accused the government of 'handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired' at a time when the health service is having to find billions in efficiency savings. The revelation will pile pressure on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the handling of the NHS reforms which he inherited from predecessor Andrew Lansley . The revelation will pile pressure on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the handling of the NHS reforms which he inherited from predecessor Andrew Lansley . Under the controversial shake-up of health trusts, 21,100 staff were made redundant. Ministers boast the changes have freed up money for patient care. But new figures released in Parliament show that since May 2010, 2,570 people made redundant have been rehired in permanent jobs in the health service. A further 1,380 have been taken back on fixed term contracts. Under NHS rules staff must only wait four weeks after taking redundancy before they can move to a new job. However Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of NHS England, has asked managers to wait six months at least. Andy Burnham, Labour's shadow health secretary, said: ‘It will be utterly galling for nurses who’ve just had a pay cut from David Cameron to see he’s been handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired. ‘On his watch, we have seen pay-offs for managers and pay cuts for nurses. ‘Cameron's top-down re-organisation has wasted £3 billion and left the NHS in a weak financial position. Nurses are paying the price for his mismanagement of the NHS.’ The number of NHS staff rehired has risen by almost 8,000 since December, with many more expected to return in the coming months. Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust . Mr Burnham added: ‘It’s clear that people who received pay-offs are now coming back to the NHS in ever greater numbers. ‘We need to know whether the Prime Minister has honoured his promise to recover redundancy payments from people who have been re-employed by his new organisations.’ But a Conservative health spokesman said: 'This is sheer hypocrisy from Labour – this Government's hands were tied by unacceptably lax rules on redundancy which they put into contracts in 2006, and which we’re reforming. 'We are working on tough new plans to cap redundancy pay-outs for senior managers and claw back all or part of the payment if they return to work for the NHS within a year of being made redundant. 'Since the election we now have 15,000 more clinical staff and 21,000 fewer administrative posts. Taxpayers want to reduce bureaucracy and increase frontline care staff - that is what we will continue to deliver.' According to earlier figures, some 2,534 people handed payouts were back working in the NHS within a year, including 403 who were rehired that same month. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘By reducing managers and administrators by over 21,100, we are freeing up extra resources for patient care - £5.5 billion in this Parliament and £1.5 billion every year thereafter.’ Non-clinical staff have received average pay-offs of £43,000 but 2,300 received six-figure deals. They include a husband-and-wife team of NHS managers who walked away with £1million in combined redundancies straight into six-figure salary posts. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the government of 'handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired' Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March. Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished. By June both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director. Another manager, Rob Cooper, received at least £370,000 for losing his role as a deputy chief executive at Yorkshire and the Humber Strategic Health Authority but already had another role lined up at a different health trust. Steve Spoerry was paid between £335,000 and £340,000, after his job as managing director of Halton and St Helens Primary Care Trust was axed in March. After taking some interim NHS jobs he is now director of strategy at South and West Yorkshire and Bassetlaw NHS Commissioning Support Unit, . Annette Laban, former chief executive of Doncaster Primary Care Trust, was paid redundancy of £285,000 to £290,000 before taking up a £15,500-a-year part-time role as a non-executive director of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals.","1 in 6 managers laid off by health service walked back into NHS jobs .

"By . Sara Malm . The CEO of global coffee chain Starbucks is donating $30million to benefit the rehabilitation of U.S. war veterans. Howard Schultz’s contribution has been earmarked for research into brain trauma and PTSD suffered by thousands of returning soldiers. This follows Shultz promise last year to hire at least 10,000 veterans and military spouses over the next five years. Big bucks: Starbucks's CEO Howard Schultz has donated $30million for research into post-traumatic stress syndrome and traumatic brain injuries . Mr Schultz also criticised the U.S. government saying they do a better job of sending people to war than bringing them back from the front line. ‘These young men and women who are coming home from multiple deployments are not coming home to a parade,’ he told CBS News. ‘They're not coming home to a celebration. They're coming home to an American public that really doesn't understand, and never embraced, what these people have done.’ He promised that the donated $30million would be used to fund research and treatment for post-traumatic stress syndrome and traumatic brain injuries suffered by veterans of overseas conflict such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr Schultz added that rehabilitation is the key to utilising traumatised veterans as they are ‘incredibly valuable to American business.’ An estimated 20 per cent of U.S. soldiers suffer from some form of PTSD or depression . Devotion: The multi-national chain also promised to hire 10,000 U.S. army veterans and military spouses in the next five years . ‘These life skills can't be taught,’ he said. ‘And what I'm saying is that they're extraordinarily valuable to any business, any institution, any enterprise.’ Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events, such as violent assaults, natural disasters, sexual abuse or combat. It can develop immediately after an event, but sometimes it takes months or years before symptoms emerge. It is estimated to affect one in three who experience a traumatic event, with symptoms including reviling the experience, insomnia and aggression. In November last year, Starbucks announced plans to hire 10,000 U.S. army veterans and military spouses. ‘This is not only about hiring baristas,’ Mr Schultz said. 'Starbucks is seeking individuals with experience in everything from leading teams to building and managing complex, global supply chains.' As the Starbucks expands globally and gets coffee and tea from around the globe, veterans offer international experience and foreign language skills, the company added. According to recent figures, at least 20 per cent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans suffer from PTSD and/or some form of depression as a result of their armed service, but an estimated 50 per cent of those with PTSD do not seek treatment. The Congressional Research Service reported 152,985 cases or PTSD within the U.S. Army between 2000 and 2014. As of January 10 this year, 6,775 U.S. Service members have died in action since 2001 and 51,809 have been injured.","Starbucks CEO donates $30million to research into brain trauma and PTSD .

So he stormed over to his house in Felixstowe, Suffolk, clutching a knife and claw-hammer, and threatened to 'slit his throat'. The pair used to regularly play multiplayer via the internet on the violent gangster game as they sat in their own homes a few doors apart. Ipswich Magistrates' Court heard how jobless Dugdale sent Mr French a message through their on-line game connection, saying he was going to slit his throat. Dugdale, who had taken a cocktail of cider, cannabis and anti-depressants, then stormed round to Mr French’s home with a kitchen knife and a claw hammer. Prosecutor Lesla Small said Dugdale shouted: 'I’m going to slit your throat - I’m going to f*****g kill you.' Mr French swore at Dugdale from a window and told him to go away from his home in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Dugdale was seen stabbing the blade of the knife in the top of a garden fence while shouting at Mr French to come down, said Ms Small. When Mr French’s sister came out, Dugdale smashed the front passenger window of her Renault Clio and raised the hammer above his head. She retreated back in the house and Dugdale returned to his own home at around 5.30pm last Friday. Dugdale, who had cut himself while waving around the knife, was later seen by his mother washing blood from his hand in her kitchen sink. The court heard how she noticed he was angry and saw the hammer on the floor next to the knife. Cut off: The pair frequently played Grand Theft Auto, but Dugdale was angry after Mr French stopped playing . Police were called and found Dugdale walking down the centre of the road outside his home, carrying the knife and hammer in an aggressive manner. Ms Small said officers who approached heard him swearing about someone and asking for help. Dugdale leaned on their patrol car as they got out and began flailing his arms, she added. He then calmed down before he flared up again and started struggling and swearing, threatening the officers by saying he would headbutt them. Ms Small said: 'Grand Theft Auto is quite a violent game in nature. It’s like a virtual city. There’s gang violence, street fighting and stealing cars.' Dugdale who plays games on his 51inch TV admitted two counts of possessing an offensive weapon, criminal damage, affray and resisting arrest. Neighbours: The pair lived a few doors away from each other near a junction between Graham Road and Seaton Road in Felixstowe, Suffolk . He was remanded in custody by magistrates and told his case was so serious that he would be sent to Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing. Dugdale swore loudly as he was taken to the cells after his application for bail was refused. Mark Holt, defending, said Dugdale did not accept that he and Mr French had fallen out while playing Grand Theft Auto. Dugdale claimed he had become angry because he had twice confided in Mr French only for his confidences to be betrayed. Condemned: The game has been repeatedly criticised for allegedly encouraging violent behaviour and has been blamed for four murders in the United States and Thailand . Mr Holt said he had no doubt it had been 'frightening for those who witnessed the incident, but in reality it was all words and bluster'. Grand Theft Auto involves players earning points for carrying out a series of assaults, carjackings and murders including drive-by shootings. The game has been repeatedly criticised for allegedly encouraging violent behaviour and has been blamed for four murders in the United States and Thailand.","Neil Dugdale played violent internet games with Adam French, 22 .

"By . Stian Alexander . A council has been slammed for spending a staggering £1,000 to translate one tenancy agreement into Urdu. Crawley Borough Council splashed the cash to translate the agreement between one tenant and the council, saying Urdu was 'more expensive to translate' than other languages. The council was criticised in 2012 after spending £628 translating its 12-page quarterly magazine Homelink into Urdu after just one tenant called to complain they couldn't read it. A council spent £1,000 translating a single document into Urdu and, while it is an incredibly complicated language, drew criticism for spending so much on one translation . In the past two years it has spent a total of £4,111 translating just 15 documents, including £1,000 for the Urdu translation - paid to Integro Languages - and £526 to translate a tenancy agreement into Russian. Other tenancy agreements included £659 for one to be translated into French and £668 for one to be translated into Portuguese. The council also forked out £30 to translate a health and safety sign at a communal laundry room in a council block into Punjabi and £25 to translate a nuisance behaviour letter to a French-speaking resident. Crawley MP Henry Smith this week slammed the payments, telling his local paper the Crawley News: 'The only time tat translations really are justifiable at that expense is when a large number of people will benefit from it. 'Individual translations which cost that amount are not appropriate (and) I'm concerned it appears as though the council is pursuing that sort of approach.' Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, says councils should cut back spending on needless translations . The chair of Ukip in Crawley, Lee Gilroy said the payments were 'a joke', adding: ""Is that person paying council tax? Is that person working and contributing to the town? 'I just fee that so many people are struggling to pay their council tax will read this and see where their money is going - and be absolutely outraged.' The council was slammed in 2012 after it was revealed it stumped up £628 to translate it's Homelink magazine into Urdu, with Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, saying councils should cut back spending on needless translations. He said at the time: 'Some local authorities translate a range of documents into languages spoken by their residents, and provide interpretation services. 'While there may be rare occasions in which this is entirely necessary - for instance in emergency situations - I am concerned such services are in many cases being provided unnecessarily. 'Such translation services have an unintentional, adverse impact on integration by reducing the incentive for some migrant communities to learn English. 'I understand in Crawley a single person complained. 'The gentleman concerned would be well advised to learn English and become an integrated citizen.' Local Richard Reeves, 43, said: 'I could understand it if it was a for a large number of people, but for just one person £1,000 is totally unacceptable. 'It really sticks in my throat that the council tax we all pay is being wasted on needless things like this when the money could be better spent to the benefit of all.' A spokesman of the Tory-run council said tenancy agreements were 'important legal documents', adding: 'Translations are usually provided to meet legal and safety obligations as wet are required to demonstrate that reasonable steps have been taken to ensure the information has been communicated in ways the tenant can understand. 'We don't automatically provide translations and all request are carefully vetted by a council officer.' She also said translating documents into Urdu was more expensive that other languages. Band D council taxpayers in Crawley pay £1,488 a year. Urdu is a language spoken by more than 400m people worldwide, with the majority of native speakers coming form India or Pakistan.","Council spent entire £1,000 on translating single document .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Sir David Nicholson will celebrate his departure from the NHS with a £12,000 leaving do, it was reported today . The outgoing chief executive of NHS England is planning to celebrate his departure with a £12,000 leaving do, it was reported today. Sir David Nicholson - dubbed the Man With No Shame after he refused to resign over the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital Trust scandal - is said to have organised a drinks party and dinner in central London next week. Around 70 NHS executives and friends of the civil servant, including NHS England board directors Sir Bruce Keogh and Jane Cumnings, are expected to attend the lavish, £180-a-head, party on Monday. They will first enjoy drinks and canapes at St Thomas' Hospital on the banks of the River Thames, before sitting down to dinner at the walkways at Tower Bridge, which cost £12,000 to hire, according to the Sun, although the party is not believed to be funded by the taxpayer. Sir David, a former member of the communist party, is to leave his £210,000-a-year job next month with a £110,000-a-year pension after the party, which is said to be a celebration of his 'service to the NHS'. Today whistleblower Julie Bailey, who exposed the neglect at Stafford Hospital after her mother, Bella, died there in appalling conditions, said: 'David Nicholson has no reason to celebrate. 'He presided over the biggest disaster in the history of the NHS, the Mid-Staffs scandal, as well as the Keogh review, 11 hospitals being put into special measures, the Morecambe Bay baby deaths, the 111 disaster, the care data fiasco, and gagging orders, which we had never heard of before his watch, among others. 'He should be apologising not only to relatives of those involved in the Mid-Staffs scandal, but also to every patient whose care suffered due to the NHS because of his lack of leadership. 'It would be better if he just went quickly and let a leader who cares for the staff and patients of the NHS take over.' Campaigners called for Sir David to be . sacked or resign after the publication of the public inquiry report into . Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, where up to 1,200 patients needlessly died. He was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for the trust for a period while patients were being mistreated. Yesterday Sir David spoke of his 'bitter . regret' over not speaking to patients and their families who were so . badly treated during the Stafford Hospital scandal. Anger: Julie Bailey, whose mother Bella died at Stafford hospital, said Sir David 'should apologise and go quickly' He admitted his response to the Mid Stafforshire report – which revealed serious and systematic failures in care - had been one of the hardest lessons he learned during his 36-year career with the NHS. Sir David said not talking to campaigners and other patients was his 'biggest mistake' of his service. He said he avoided speaking to those affected because he did not want to be embroiled in a media circus - something he now says was the 'wrong call'. The chief executive told delegates at the Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester: 'The biggest and most obvious mistake that I made was when it became clear when the Health Care Commission reported on Mid Staffordshire. 'I went to the hospital and I didn't seek out the patients representatives and the people who were in Cure The NHS, and I didn't do it because I made the wrong call. Neither Sir David nor the NHS responded to calls from MailOnline this morning. Venue: Sir David's leaving do is expected to start with drinks and canapes at St Thomas' Hospital in London .

"By . James Chapman . Iain Duncan Smith has spent nearly four years bearing down on the benefits bill in an attempt to make work pay . The welfare budget is to be capped at just under £120billion next year and will then rise only in line with inflation to stop the benefits bill spiralling out of control. As George Osborne seeks to make further benefit cuts a central election dividing line with Labour, MPs will vote next week on a new system to restrict the amount the state can spend on handouts. From next year, the new limit will include housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and pensioner benefits, although the state pension and jobseeker’s allowance will be excluded. Governments will have to respond to any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what the Chancellor describes as a ‘limit on the nation’s credit card’. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have agreed to cap welfare at £119.5billion next year, rising with forecast inflation to £126.7billion by 2018/19 – a real terms freeze in the next parliament. The Chancellor is understood to want to go further and cut billions more from the welfare budget if the Tories remain in power after the next election. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has spent nearly four years bearing down on the benefits bill in an attempt to make work pay. He is currently rolling out the Universal Credit – a major reform which aims to end the so-called dependency culture. The Treasury says the welfare cap is designed to prevent repeats of the increase in incapacity benefit claims under the Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s, and the surge in housing benefit under Labour. It is also designed to try to bind Labour’s hands by building structural limits into welfare which makes up a huge proportion of government spending. The Coalition will introduce a law requiring a Commons vote to be held if the cap is breached and the Government does not want to respond by cutting spending. An incoming Labour government would be free to set a higher cap at the start of the next parliament, but would have to change the law if it wanted to unpick it altogether. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls indicated last night that Labour would support the proposal – posing questions over which benefits it would cut to enable it to restore the spare room subsidy for council house tenants, a reform it calls a ‘bedroom tax’. Reversing housing benefit reductions for tenants with unused rooms would mean a £465million welfare spending rise in 2015-16. Labour has said it would remove the winter fuel allowance from better-off pensioners, but this would save only £105million a year. Mr Balls said: ‘We’ve supported the idea of a welfare cap, we’ve said that we should keep out the basic pension but include pensioner benefits. Clearly we’ll do things differently from the Government, for example we said we’ll abolish the bedroom tax. As George Osborne seeks to make further benefit cuts a central election dividing line with Labour, MPs will vote next week on a new system to restrict the amount the state can spend on handouts . ‘We actually think that our measures on housing and on young people and jobs can get the wider bill down.’ Mr Osborne said that under Labour spending on welfare was ‘out of control’, with the number of people who have never worked doubling in a decade. He said the state pension was being excluded from the cap because it would not be right to hit ‘those who’ve worked hard all their lives because the costs on, say, housing benefit for young people had got out of control’. Treasury sources said the inclusion of particular benefits in the cap did not rule out a political pledge to protect them. The Treasury says the welfare cap is designed to prevent repeats of the increase in incapacity benefit claims under the Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s, and the surge in housing benefit under Labour . Other benefits included in the cap and therefore potentially vulnerable to being cut back include incapacity benefits, carer’s allowance, maternity allowance and employment support allowance. The Thatcherite think tank the Centre for Policy Studies welcomed the reform, but added: ‘The Chancellor should also look to increase the scope of the welfare cap and consider whether it really does need to rise in line with inflation.’ Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘Pensioners will be concerned that benefits such as the winter fuel allowance, cold weather payments and the Christmas bonus have all been placed into the welfare cap, which could lead to cuts in the future.’ A new £42million research institute to develop the next generation of computer masterminds will be dedicated to  wartime codebreaker Alan Turing (pictured) A new £42million research institute to develop the next generation of computer masterminds will be dedicated to  wartime codebreaker Alan Turing. The centre will aim to make Britain a world leader in analysing large sets of data using huge computing power. George Osborne said the Alan Turing Institute for Data Science would be founded in honour of a man ‘who was persecuted for his sexuality by the  country he helped to save’. Turing, who is widely seen as the father of modern computing, was pivotal in cracking the Enigma codes used by the German navy to send secret messages during the Second World War. With fellow codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, he is credited with shortening the war by up to two years and saving countless lives. But in 1952 he was convicted of gross indecency for having a homosexual  relationship with a 19-year-old Manchester man. At that time homosexuality was illegal, and he chose to be chemically castrated with injections of female hormones rather than go to jail. The conviction meant that he lost his security clearance and had to stop the work that had proved vital to the Allies. He died two years later, aged 41, of cyanide poisoning in an apparent suicide. He was granted a posthumous Royal Pardon in December after a request by Justice Minister Chris Grayling following a long campaign. At the time, Baroness Trumpington – who worked with the mathematician at Bletchley Park – said we could have lost the war had it not been for his work. She said: ‘I really am very pleased. We knew the work he was doing at Bletchley Park was great. Without him, we could have lost the war. Our submarines were being sunk at the rate of knots.’ The institute will research methods of collecting and analysing big sets of data.","MPs will vote next week on a new system to restrict the amount the state can spend on handouts .

"By . Mark Duell . Train passengers will not get the chance to travel directly from Manchester or Leeds to mainland Europe on the new high-speed rail network, it was revealed last night. A £700million connection had been proposed between London Euston station - from where High Speed 2 will depart - and the High Speed 1 Channel Tunnel Eurostar terminal at London St Pancras. But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said it does not offer ‘good value’ and would require ‘too many compromises in terms of impacts on freight, passengers and the community in Camden’. Map: A £700million connection had been proposed between London Euston station - from where High Speed 2 (in yellow) will depart - and the High Speed 1 (in grey) Channel Tunnel Eurostar terminal at London St Pancras . Mr McLoughlin announced yesterday that he was removing the HS2-HS1 link from the HS2 Bill currently going through Parliament - and would look at other ways of linking HS2 with the continent. Those hoping to use the HS2 line to get directly from the North to cities including Paris and Brussels will now have to make a short walk between the two stations in Central London. Passengers will have to disembark at Euston, where the HS2 ends, and walk 700 yards to St Pancras to catch a connecting train. The average person would take seven minutes to walk that distance. HS2 boss Sir David Higgins recommended in a report launched yesterday in Manchester that the proposed link was ‘sub-optimal’. Scrapped: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (left) said the connection in London does not offer 'good value', and HS2 boss Sir David Higgins (right) recommended that the proposed link was 'sub-optimal' He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It was the right technical solution to achieve that linkage, but it was a compromise on everything it did. 'It was the right technical solution to achieve that linkage, but it was a compromise on everything it did' Sir David Higgins, HS2 boss . ‘We should look at what the other options [are] as simple as being able to get between the two stations either by Tube or by walking, as you do in Paris, or a very expensive high speed connection from further outside London to the North.’ It comes as Mr McLoughlin gave a green light to ‘ambitious’ plans by his high-speed tsar to fast-track the £50billion HS2 to the North. And he also signalled the return of a much loved landmark - the Euston Arch - demolished more than 50 years ago as part of the 1960s ‘modernisation’ of the station. Acceleration: Mr McLoughlin has given a green light to 'ambitious' plans by his high-speed tsar to fast-track the £50billion HS2 to the North . The minster backed Sir David’s plans to ‘accelerate’ the route beyond Birmingham by up to six years by creating a new hub station 43 miles to the North at Crewe, which would be operational by 2027. He also backed plans for a much bigger revamp of Euston station - the HS2 London terminus - than the £1.2billion redevelopment currently planned. He said he was asking HS2 Ltd and Network Rail to ‘develop more comprehensive proposals for the development of Euston’. Sir David had concluded the station should be subjected to a more substantial revamp ‘that could truly stand the test of time’ and ‘whose effects will be felt for generations’. Days gone by: Mr McLoughlin also signalled the return of a much loved landmark - the Euston Arch - demolished more than 50 years ago as part of the 1960s 'modernisation' of the station . Significantly it will mean the return of a once much-loved landmark - the Euston Arch - much of which is in storage. He said: ‘This work should include proposals for the Euston Arch which should never have been knocked down and which I would like to see rebuilt.’ Built in 1837, as the entrance to Euston Station, the Euston Arch was demolished in 1961. But 60 per cent of the original stone has been located in the bed of the River Lea at the Prescott Channel in East London, and much of that removed intact. The arch is likely to be rebuilt as part of a wider development of shops, flats and amenities.","£700million connection had been proposed between Euston and St Pancras .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . This could be the car used by the unknown killer of nightclubber Melanie Hall who was brutally murdered 17 years ago, police revealed today. Melanie, then 25, disappeared on a night out in Bath, Somerset, in June 1996. Her remains, dumped beside a slip road on the M5, were not found until 13 years later. The hospital worker had been battered around the head and her body was wrapped in black bin bags and bound with blue rope. Detectives investigating the murder of Melanie Hall believe this car may be linked to the murder . The car - registration C752 CYE - disappeared from official records around the time of Miss Hall's death . Today, police released this photo of a white VW Golf GTi hardtop that disappeared from official records shortly after Melanie vanished. The vehicle - registration C752 CYE - was last known to be registered on August 7, 1996. Police say they do not know what happened to it since - and are appealing for anyone with information about it. They are particularly interested in sightings around the Bath area at the time Melanie disappeared. They also say the car was linked to the Pentwyn area of Cardiff around the time. The latest developments were announced on Crimewatch this evening. Detective . Superintendent Mike Courtiour said: 'We are very interested in this car . and its possible connection to Melanie's disappearance. 'We are appealing for anyone with knowledge of it to contact us, even after all these years. Hospital worker Melanie Hall, who was last seen in a Bath nightclub in 1996. Her remains were found wrapped in plastic bags bound by tape by the side of the M5 motorway 13 years later . 'Our work into Melanie's murder remains very much active and positive. We are following up a number of leads, of which this missing Golf GTi could be very important.' Last November a 44-year-old man from Bath was arrested and questioned for two days before being released on police bail pending further inquiries. Detectives also searched a property on an estate in the city. His was the fourth suspect to be questioned about Miss Hall’s murder since her remains were discovered. At the time, her father Steve, who lives near Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, said the development was 'progress'. He said: 'We are hopeful that progress is being made. It is a long and painful process 17 years down the line. 'This would appear to be connected to the appeal we made at the beginning of October, which is great. We are keeping our minds open on these things. ‘The police are keeping us informed and we are hopeful. It is not the first time someone has been arrested in connection with her death but we are remaining positive.’ Steve Hall and Pat Hall pictured at a press conference shortly after their daughter's remains were found . Miss Hall, who worked in a hospital, was last seen in June 1996 after apparently arguing with her doctor boyfriend in a nightclub. Despite a huge police operation, no trace of her was found until 2009 when a workman found parts of her skeleton hidden in plastic bags. He was clearing undergrowth just a few yards off the northbound slip road at junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury, Gloucestershire, when he found the remains. The find was almost 30 miles from where the psychology graduate was last seen in Cadillac’s nightclub. Five bin-liners contained or covered her remains, including arm and leg bones and her pelvis and skull. Other parts of her skeleton were found partially buried nearby. In the four years since Melanie's discovery, her parents and sister Dominique have issued repeated appeals for members of the public to help police with their inquiries.","Police believe white VW Golf GTi could be linked to Melanie Hall murder .

"By . Lucy Crossley . George Osborne today announced that he would put £340million towards fixing Britain's battered infrastructure by repairing potholes and building new flood defences. Following the winter storms which left areas of the country underwater, the Chancellor announced that he would be making an extra £140million available for repairs to flood defences and providing £200million for local authorities to repair potholes. The winter storms flooded 7,000 homes, killed 11 people and caused untold devastation, with Somerset among the worst-hit areas after the wettest winter since records began. Announcement: A £340million fund for flood defences and repairing potholes has been promised after record storms left swathes of the country, including on the Somerset Levels (pictured) underwater . Soaked: A woman pushes her dog in a wheelbarrow through flooded Staines-upon-Thames last month . Hurricane-force winds and flooding led to felled power lines and blackouts for more than 100,000 families, while it has been estimated that the floods will cost cost small businesses more than £830million. Much of the country’s transport network was plunged into chaos, with roads and railways wrecked, and countless buildings damaged. The Government was also forced to call in troops to help rescue stranded victims. Today's announcement follows David Cameron’s promise during last month’s crisis that ‘money is no object’ in clearing up the damage and preventing a repeat. However, the extra money promised today by Mr Osborne has been criticised for not going far enough in solving either issue, with the flood defence fund described as a merely a 'sticking plaster' by Dr Colin Brown, Director of Engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. 'The £140 million announced in today’s . Budget for repairs to UK flood defences is a ""sticking plaster"" approach and simply does not go far enough,' he said. 'The . Government needs to be investing in new flood defences and ongoing . maintenance projects to ensure long-term UK resilience, neither of which . was mentioned by the Chancellor. Equally, there was no mention of . resilience plans for other extreme weather conditions which the UK will . be increasingly susceptible to in future years. 'Every . £1 spent in resilience saves £4 in future relief and rebuilding costs, . which is why we need to be taking a much longer-term view of UK . infrastructure. 'Elsewhere, . the Institution welcomes the Chancellor’s proposals to provide £7 . billion to cut energy bills for manufacturers in energy-intensive . industries. Ongoing: Flood water remained in fields surrounding the village of Moorland on the Somerset Levels last weekend . After the rain: It has been estimated that the floods will cost cost small businesses more than £830million . 'These . initiatives will help UK firms become more competitive in the global . market by reducing costs and encouraging them stay in the UK. 'The . Institution also welcomes the continuing support for graphene, a truly . British invention with a multitude of future possibilities.  The . creation of a new centre of excellence will advance the already . committed £111m to graphene research and exploitation, and will help the . UK reap the commercial benefits this miracle material. 'Additionally, . while we welcome the support for HS2 and regional airports and the . Chancellor’s vision of seeing this beyond the current plans, we need to . see more details and the Government needs to show more commitment to . creating an integrated UK transport system.' Liz Peace, Chief Executive of the British Property Federation said that the flood defence money was welcome, but raised concerns over flood insurance police. 'We are pleased to see that the . Government is committed to spending on flood defences and helping those . that have been hardest hit by the recent storms, but today's . announcement of £140m funding to repair flood defences do not assuage . our fears about the government's new flood insurance scheme, Flood Re, . which currently stands to expose thousands of homeowners to rocketing . insurance premiums,' she said. Friends of the Earth economics campaigner, David Powell said also criticised the Government's pledge, and said that Mr Osborne had not done enough to address climate change. Budget: George Osborne with the traditional red dispatch box as he departs to deliver his annual budget speech . Funds: Mr Osborne told the House of Commons that money would be available for repairs after the winter floods . He said: 'Merely weeks after promising action on flooding and global warming, the best the Chancellor can manage is a U-turn on his own reckless flood defence cuts, and caving in to big business lobbying on pollution tax. 'Mr Osborne says he wants to make our economy ""resilient"", but Britons face paying a hefty price for his failure to confront the reality of climate change.' He added: 'George Osborne’s self-congratulation on flood spending is ill-founded. 'The ""extra"" £140m only cancels out previous cuts, while households in storm-battered Britain are picking up the bill for the Government’s negligence. 'And if we want to keep pace with the impacts of climate change, far more must be spent on flood defences.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation, welcomed the £200million put aside to repair potholes, but said the money would not be enough to address a road maintenance backlog. ‘A succession of bad weather, including the recent floods, has wrought havoc on our roads and any money to fill the potholes is welcome,' he said. 'But the drip, drip of funding does not address the £10 billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified. It is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for. This creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits.’ Bump in the road: Local authorities will be provided with an extra £200million for local authorities to repair potholes . Backlog: Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation said the money would not be enough to address a road maintenance backlog . Tony Ball, vice chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, welcomed the extra funding, but said the country was facing a 42per cent increase in traffic on local roads by 2040, and the situation on the roads was getting worse. 'This announcement does not go anywhere near far enough. We urge the Government to provide a full and comprehensive package, including the resurfacing of roads, rather than funding in dribs and drabs.' Mr Osborne also announced a number of other transport measures. There will be a guarantee of up to £270million to support the raising of debt finance for the Mersey Gateway Bridge - a project that will see a road bridge over the River Mersey in north west England. Also, the Government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the A1 north of Newcastle upon Tyne further north into Scotland, if the Scottish Government will match fund the costs of the study. Mr Osborne said that the Government had agreed that the Welsh Government can use existing powers to begin investing in improvements to the M4. The UK Government is also financially supporting the Greater Cambridge enterprise partnership's transport and infrastructure plans in a deal that could be worth up to £500 million over 15 to 20 years. Investigation: The Government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the A1 north of Newcastle upon Tyne further north into Scotland . Mr Osborne said the vehicle excise duty (VED) car tax would increase by the RPI rate of inflation from April 1 2014 but, as announced earlier, VED rates for lorries will be reduced and restructured from April 1. Campaign for Better Transport chief executive Stephen Joseph said: 'The Chancellor has done little to reduce the everyday cost of transport which remains one of the biggest costs faced by households . 'The £20 million tax break the Chancellor is giving to bingo halls would be better spent reversing the planned cuts to bus services this year. Extra money to tackle potholes is welcome, but this is a drop in the ocean against the £10bn backlog to local road repairs. These are the issues that matter to people rather than big road building.' Sustainable transport group Sustrans said: 'Any money to repair this winter's damage to our roads is welcome but, considering the £10 billion road maintenance backlog, £200 million is nowhere near enough. 'Potholes are dangerous for all road users. Resolving this crisis will save lives.'","George Osborne pledges an extra £140million for repairs to flood defences .

Solomon Smith raped one prostitute and indecently assaulted another in 2000, and was jailed for nine-and-a-half years at Wolverhampton Crown Court two years later after being convicted. The 52-year-old said he was forced to breathe in second-hand smoke in the cells while serving his sentence at HMP Birmingham, which damaged his health and violated his human rights. High Court battle: Solomon Smith (left), who raped one prostitute and indecently assaulted another in 2000, claims he was forced to breathe in second-hand smoke in the cells at HMP Birmingham (right, file picture) Smith, of Hanley, Staffordshire, launched a legal battle from behind bars using taxpayers’ cash - because he could not afford his own costs - to try to claim compensation from the Government. He claimed being made to share with the smoker for one week in March 2012 was a ‘unjustified interference’ with his right to a private and family life. The publicly-funded case against prison operator G4S and the Ministry of Justice was dismissed at the High Court - but he then appealed the decision. Yesterday, this was also thrown out by three senior judges at the Court of Appeal. Mr Justice Mostyn said: ‘We do not think this appeal gets off the ground - we are not impressed.’ Location: Smith claimed being made to share with the smoker for one week in March 2012 at HMP Birmingham (pictured) was a 'unjustified interference' with his human rights and also invaded his privacy . Smith was forced to share a cell with a smoker after being moved to another part of the prison because he and other sex offenders were being bullied, the court heard. 'We do not think this appeal gets off the ground - we are not impressed' Mr Justice Mostyn . G4S official Scott Matthewson told the court: ‘This was unfortunate but could not be avoided, given the practical and safety considerations. There were limited cells available in the prison, which was overcrowded. ‘In order to protect Smith from abusive or violent conduct from other prisoners, for a short time he had to share a cell with a vulnerable prisoner who was a smoker.’ Jonathan Hall, representing Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, said Smith’s accommodation was an operational decision for the prison. Inside: Smith was forced to share a cell with a smoker at HMP Birmingham after being moved to another part of the prison because he and other sex offenders were being bullied, the court heard . He added: ‘Temporary exposure to second-hand smoke did not amount to an interference with the right to a private life.’ 'This was unfortunate but could not be avoided, given the practical and safety considerations' Scott Matthewson, G4S official . Smith had also called on the Justice Secretary to ban smoking in prison cells to ‘protect’ the country’s 85,000 prisoners, but this was also rejected. Smoking is still allowed in Britain’s prisons despite a national smoking ban in public places being in force for six years. Challenging the ruling, Smith’s barrister Hugh Southey QC said: ‘Prisoners are not in the position where they have some freedom of choice about how to protect their health. ‘If I feel strongly about smoking, I can take steps to avoid it.  What this case demonstrates is that prisoners are not necessarily in that position.' Habit: The 2007 smoking ban in public places did not apply to prison cells (file picture) Some 80 per cent of the 84,300 Prison Service inmates smoke - and tobacco is a valuable currency that is traded on the wings. Some jails already ban the habit for bad behaviour - and 'well-behaved’ inmates look forward to their cigarette breaks out in the yard to help them through the boredom of their sentences. But staff have long objected to breathing in the second-hand smoke of inmates, and there are fears that the Prison Service could face compensation claims from officers who claim that they are victims of passive smoking. The 2007 smoking ban designed to protect people from the effects of second-hand smoke in public places did not apply to prison cells. Last September, it was reported that a pilot was to be launched in some prisons that would ban inmates from smoking in all parts of the jails – including exercise yards. But a Prison Service spokesman said there are no plans to ban smoking in jails at the moment.","Solomon Smith raped prostitute and indecently assaulted another in 2000 .

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . British children using social networking sites have unwittingly been the victim of one of the world's worst ever child pornography rings, it has emerged. Police are preparing to make arrests across the UK of dozens of men who had paid to access the secret obscene image-sharing website. The US authorities - which smashed the international ring - called it 'one of the largest known online child exploitation operations in history'. Scroll down for video . Sting: British police are poised to make arrests after one of the worst ever child pornography rings was uncovered in the U.S. Fourteen men were arrested after more than 250 children, mostly boys were found to be victims. U.S. officials identified 27-year-old Jonathan Johnson (pictured) as the the main administer of the site . Many of the victims were contacted via social network sites and 'enticed to produce sexually explicit material'. Some of the men responsible tricked them by posing as females. More than 27,000 subscribers to the vile secret network had access to 2,000 videos filmed on computer webcams. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the US said they had arrested 14 American men who operated the member-only site from the southern state of Louisiana. Investigators have so far identified 251 child victims, of whom 243 were boys. There were 228 Americans and a total of 23 from Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Belgium. The majority were aged 13 to 15, but 33 were aged under 12 and two were aged just three. The UK's National Crime Agency has been handed detailed intelligence on British users of the site, who now face being arrested. Big win: Officials with customs and homeland security announced the major sting in a press conference held Tuesday . Daniel Ragsdale, of the Department of Homeland Security, said: 'Never before in the history of this agency have we identified and located this many minor victims in the course of a single child exploitation investigation.' He said the agency was fighting 'a growing trend where children are being enticed, tricked and coerced online by adults to produce sexually explicit material of themselves'. Some of the 14 alleged operators assumed female identities to contact their targets on popular social network sites. They have been charged with running a child exploitation enterprise after allegedly distributing the material through the Tor network, or so-called 'dark web'. This allows Internet anonymity by hiding online traffic and a user's location. The network, which was operated for a year from mid-2012 to last June, was unmasked after an item was sent through the US Postal Service to a child. At least 300 subscribers to the site in the US and overseas face lesser charges. An NCA spokesman said: 'We can confirm that information was sent to the CEOP command from our law enforcement colleagues in the United States. 'A number of disseminations have been made to UK police forces, but as investigations are ongoing, we cannot comment further at this time.' Predators: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the fourteen men arrested preyed upon 'the most innocent, most vulnerable members of our society' Earlier this year, the Internet Watch Foundation warned of the dangers of UK teenagers sharing explicit images on social networking sites. The IWF said children who used the likes of Facebook, the imgur or Flickr photo sharing websites or the Snapchat mobile phone app to send explicit pictures or videos to a boyfriend or girlfriend did not believe the images would be widely circulated. But analysts found nine out of ten images posted on the internet featuring young people later re-appeared on so-called 'parasite' websites after being stolen, hacked or copied. Once in circulation, it is very hard for them to be removed. Susie Hargreaves, the IWF chief executive, said young people must understand they were exposing themselves to 'ridiculous levels of risk'. She added: 'It can happen across the board to any child of any class.' Over a period of just 47 working hours - the IWF logged 12,224 sexual images or videos of young people that had been uploaded to the internet. Of these, 10,776 were later found on so-called 'parasite' websites, often designed solely for the purpose of displaying explicit images of children or teenagers. Roy Naim, an immigration activists from Brooklyn, New York (left) and Andrew Korpal from Granger, Indiana (right) were two of the men arrested in the bust . 24-year-old Michael J Eales of Westby, Wisconsin (left) and Tuckerton, New Jersey-resident Stanley Zdon III (right) were also arrested . Speaking earlier this week, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said: 'These . alleged perpetrators preyed upon the most innocent, most vulnerable . members of our society with no regard to the immediate or lasting harm . they caused to their victims and their families.' The investigation was led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Postal Inspection Service. All . of the victims have been contacted by law enforcement officials and the . U.S. victims have been offered the assistance of HSI victim assistance . specialists. There are still some 300 ongoing investigations into the website's subscribers. Eleven of the 14 men, including the man authorities say was the administrator of the network, are being prosecuted in Louisiana. The other three are being charged in New York, Colorado and Wisconsin. Authorities accuse Jonathan Johnson of of Abita Springs, Louisiana, of being the leader of the operation. They said he admitted creating multiple fake female personas from his home and encouraged others to do the same in an effort to entice boys to produce sexually explicit images of themselves. Court papers show Johnson was charged last month through a criminal information, a document that can only be filed with a defendant's consent. It signals a guilty plea. He faces 20 years to life in prison. A lawyer for Johnson did not immediately return a call seeking comment on Tuesday. Jonathan Johnson, 27 . Albita Springs, Louisiana . Daniel Nolan Devor, 39 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . These incredible photographs show the remarkable difference a month has made to the flood-hit areas of Somerset which were brought to a standstill when unprecedented amounts of rain battered the region. Homes, farms, roads and businesses were left submerged in several feet of floodwater following the wettest January in southern England since records began in 1766. Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate their homes and members of Britain’s armed forces were brought in after whole communities were hit by the deluge. Now, after a couple of weeks of drier weather and warm sunshine, the floodwaters have started to recede and those worst affected in the Somerset Levels are starting to get back on their feet. Homes which were half-filled with floodwater a month ago are now drying out – although many remain empty – and main roads which were impassable last month are now back in use. Somerset County Council warned the cost of the damage is 'likely to be several million pounds' but said the full extent of the devastation is still being counted. Properties in the village of Moorland, pictured, were severely flooded at the beginning of this year following the wettest January in southern England since records began in 1766. This photograph, taken on February 18, shows cars and homes underwater shortly after families were forced to evacuate their homes due to the deluge . Houses in Moorland, pictured, which were submerged in floodwater last month are finally drying out. These latest photographs show how the floodwater has subsided thanks to the drier weather over the last couple of weeks . Last month, the A361 at Burrowbridge - one of the main roads through Somerset - was completely impassable due to several feet of floodwater, pictured. It was closed to the public on December 31 and more than 30 tonnes of sandbags were brought in to stem the flow of the flooding . This week, the A361 at Burrowbridge looks remarkably different, pictured. The main road reopened to the public on Friday evening after being shut for nearly three months. A huge clean-up operation was carried out last week to remove fallen trees, used sandbags and damaged vegetation from the carriageway . Gardens were completely submerged and walls trashed after severe flooding hit the Somerset Levels at Christmas. Properties in Moorland, pictured, were evacuated months ago and families have been forced to stay in nearby holiday homes or with friends and family while waiting for the floodwater to recede . Today, the floodwater has finally receded from many of the properties in Moorland, pictured. These photographs show the extent of the damage caused by what has been described as the worst flooding in Britain in living memory . A white car parked in front of a garage in the village of Moorland, Somerset, is nearly completely submerged in floodwater on February 18. It is surrounded by debris and deluge caused by the winter's fierce storms . What a difference a month makes: The same white car which was seen submerged in floodwater in February is now drying out in front of a garage block in the village of Moorland, Somerset. Many residents of the Somerset Levels have struggled to receive insurance pay-outs for the damage caused by this year's floods . Hundreds of people were forced to evacuate their homes in Moorland, Somerset, pictured at the beginning of the year. Members of Britain's armed forces were even brought in to help rescue those affected and lend their support with pumping out the floodwater after whole communities were hit by the deluge .

"By . Louise Boyle . A father who fled the U.S. before he could face justice for molesting his daughter has finally been sentenced in central Ohio after she tracked him down and then bravely stared him down in court as he was handed up to 95 years behind bars. Frank K.C. Hertel and his wife Judy, the girl's mother, fled Arizona before his trial in 2000 and lived a secret life in Germany for nine years before his daughter Heather Orr, now 31, tracked him down in 2009 and he was finally arrested in 2012. He had raped his daughter Heather from the time was three until she was 18 and cruelly claimed it was to teach her a lesson about men. Scroll down for video . Frank Hertel, 51, fled to Germany with his wife before he could be tried in 2000 for raping his daughter from the age of three . Heather Orr has revealed her identity saying that she wanted to give a face and a name to victims of rape . The rapist father sobbed in court as he turned to face daughter Heather (pictured right) and apologize . Hertel had used his brother's identity to . take loans from the German government and run a bar and grill. The . parents refused to allow Mrs Orr's brother to contact her. The pedophile was finally captured thanks to the detective work of Mrs Orr herself. Mertel was extradited to the U.S. in 2009 after his daughter who he abused tracked him down running a bar in Germany . In 2009, she typed her abusive father's name into Google and found a news article about her grandfather, who shares the same name, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Hertel Senior had been arrested on tax evasion at Heathrow Airport in London after he allegedly owed $1.2million to the Canadian government. Comments had been made about the Hertel family at the bottom of the article and Mrs Orr contacted people by email to see if they knew more about her father. A website for a bar and grill revealed that her father was the owner and someone sent her a picture of her brother standing outside the business. Hertel was finally arrested and extradited back to he United States in 2012.. His wife Judy Hertel is not believed to face charges. On Tuesday, the 51-year-old Hertel was . sentenced to serve between 19 and 95 years in prison for assaulting his . daughter during their time in Ohio. He pleaded guilty Monday to three counts of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition. He was sentenced to 5 to 25 years for each count of rape and 2 to 10 years for each count of gross sexual imposition. Hertel admitted in court that between . 1993 and 1995, he raped and molested a female relative under the age of . 13, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Hertel doubles up sobbing in court as he was sentenced to 19 to 95years in jail for raping his daughter. It will be 20 years before he is up for parole . Hertel . moved his family to Arizona where he continued to abuse his daughter. He was charged and found guilty in 2001 of the crimes but fled the . country. Before he was sentenced, the judge allowed Hertel a chance to speak before the Delaware court. Rising . to his feet, he faced his daughter and in a high-pitched wail, sobbed: . 'I'm terrible sorry' adding that he wanted his victim to have 'closure'. Mrs Orr, 31, who is married and has an 11-year-old daughter, faced her abuser in court and revealed her identity. Heather Orr was comforted by her husband Daniel in court, who called his wife a 'hero not a victim' She said: 'I wish more than anything . that a stranger did this to me. I love my dad because he's my dad but he . hurt me more than anyone could imagine.' She added that she now has an 11-year-old daughter, the age she was when the sexual abuse she suffered was at its worst. Mrs Orr's testimony to the court was interrupted by Hertel's cries of 'I'm so sorry Heather.' The married mother said that the only thing her father was remorseful about was being caught and sent to prison. As she finished speaking he yelled, 'I love you, Heather.' Mertel will spend decades in jail for the molestation of his daughter which began when she was just three years old . Mrs Orr's husband Daniel described his . wife as a 'hero, not a victim' and took the stand to ask the judge to put Hertel away . for a very long time. He said: 'She lost her childhood. She should never have had to face anything that she faced.' Outside of the courtroom Mrs Orr told NBC4: . 'I want to give a face and a name to women, I want them to stand up and . say this is not right what is happening to children and women who are abused.' Hertel pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and two counts of gross sexual imposition in Delaware, north of Columbus. Mrs Orr previously told authorities her father molested from from the time she was three until she was 18. He faces 19 to 95 years in prison. Mrs Orr has long sought justice. She first told someone about the abuse when she was in eighth grade in 1991, living in Ohio. While a friend's father reported her allegations to authorities, prosecutors did nothing. Her family then moved to Arizona and the abuse continued. When she was 18 she and her father went to a joint therapy session during which her father admitted what he had done and said it was, according to court records, a 'sexual lesson for his daughter on how men behave'. The therapist then reported him to police and he was arrested. When out on bond, he and his wife fled the country. It will be 20 years before he is up for parole.","Frank K.C.

"By . Tim Shipman . Ed Miliband’s Budget response flopped yesterday because he  had based it on misleading  predictions on Twitter, according to Ed Balls. The Shadow Chancellor said Labour’s leader had to tear up large sections of his speech when rumours of what George Osborne would announce in Parliament proved false. He said Mr Miliband hastily inserted jibes about Education Secretary Michael Gove’s attack on Etonian influence in Downing Street. Ed Miliband's Budget response flopped because he had based it on Twitter predictions, Ed Balls (left) said . Mr Miliband was widely criticised for spending 16 minutes reading out political attack lines while barely mentioning the content of the Budget. Mr Balls was similarly derided for his response to the Autumn Statement in December. Yesterday he appeared to be revelling in his leader’s misfortune in an astonishing post-Budget briefing for journalists. While a stony-faced Miliband aide looked on, he said: ‘Ed Miliband had written pages of his speech which weren’t used in the end, which he thought might be in there that weren’t, but he had to fill the space by going on and on about Michael Gove’s comments.’ The Shadow Chancellor said Mr Miliband and he had read an ‘excellent tweet’ by one journalist that suggested Mr Osborne would ‘link welfare cuts to the personal allowance’. And he said BBC economics editor Robert Peston had ‘made people think something might have been going to happen on [taxes for those on] lower and middle incomes’. Twisting the knife, Mr Balls also took to the television studios to say: ‘It was a difficult speech for Ed Miliband.’ Mr Miliband was widely criticised for spending 16 minutes reading out political attack lines while barely mentioning the content of the Budget . Rather than analysing the announcements about changes to pension annuities and ISAs, the Shadow Chancellor revealed instead that he spent a long section of the speech urging Vince Cable to dig Communities Secretary Eric Pickles in the ribs. Mr Balls said: ‘Eric Pickles fell asleep for a quite extended period of time and Ed and I were worried because there might have been some big cut in local government spending coming which he didn’t know about. ‘We just politely suggested to Vince Cable that he should wake him up. ‘Vince elbowed and elbowed but it didn’t seem to make any difference.’ Mr Balls claimed that after the third nudge from Mr Cable ‘Eric started to nod knowingly at the contents of the speech while still with his eyes closed’. He then claimed Mr Cable gave Mr Pickles a sharp jab which woke him when David Cameron ‘stared daggers’ at him. The Shadow Chancellor said Labour's leader had to tear up large sections of his speech when rumours of what George Osborne would announce in Parliament proved false . A crackdown on tax dodging will raise billions by forcing the rich to pay their bills upfront, George Osborne said. At present, those who sign up to tax avoidance schemes pay what they think they can get away with, and then it is up to HMRC to claw the full amount back through the courts – which can take years. The Chancellor said that in future the wealthy will have to pay the full rate of tax back as soon as their avoidance scheme is deemed by HMRC to be unlawful. They will then have to go to court to argue their case to have some of it returned. Mr Osborne said the move, backed by greater powers and a bigger budget for the HMRC, would raise some £4billion over four years. Mr Pickles claimed last night he was ‘wide awake’ and joked that sleep ‘would have been a blessed release from Labour’s lacklustre response’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was also pictured resting his eyes. Mr Balls’s comments on Mr Miliband’s performance is likely to spark further tensions between the Shadow Chancellor and some Miliband aides, who are said to regard him as a ‘nightmare’. One senior Labour source complained that Mr Miliband had not been given an early sight of the Chancellor’s speech. ‘We’re not very happy about that,’ the source said. ‘You normally get an hour’s notice.’ But an aide to Mr Osborne insisted that Labour had not had an advance copy of the speech in this Parliament. Former Labour adviser Dan Hodges described Mr Miliband’s speech as ‘one of the most wretched I’ve ever seen from a party leader’. ‘It was the Budget that proved conclusively Ed Miliband is not yet ready to be prime minister of this country,’ he wrote. ‘He talked about everything but the Budget that had just been unveiled in front of him. Any leader of the opposition has an obligation to do better than this.’ An aide to Mr Osborne insisted that Labour had not had an advance copy of the speech in this Parliament . Wealthy individuals who try to dodge tax by buying property through companies will be hit by punitive rates of stamp duty, George Osborne said yesterday. The Chancellor announced a major clampdown on the use of so-called  ‘corporate envelopes’ to purchase  residential property – a device popular with wealthy foreign buyers acquiring property in London. The move follows a stampede to buy up valuable real estate, especially in central London, by Russian oligarchs, Middle  Eastern businessmen and other investors who see the capital as a safe haven for their money. Corporate buyers already face a 15 per cent stamp duty charge on residential property worth more than £2million. In future they will be forced to pay the punitive rate on all homes worth more than £500,000. Forecasts said the change would bring in £365million for the Exchequer by 2018/19. Mr Osborne made clear that the change will not affect homes that are rented out, in a bid to leave the commercial property market untouched. Owners of companies which own homes worth more than £2million also currently pay an annual charge of £15,000. A similar charge will now be phased in on homes worth more than £500,000.","Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls revealed his leader had to tear up large sections of his speech when Twitter rumours proved false .

Steven Hayes, one of two convicts sentenced to death for the 2007 Connecticut home invasion of the Petit family, sent a local newspaper a suicide note before his failed suicide attempt this week, it has emerged. Hayes was found unresponsive in his cell at the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers on Monday morning after he apparently saved up prescribed medication and took it all at once. He was discovered by a guard during a routine check and officials said that he was continuing to recover at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington on Wednesday. Now it has emerged that the 50-year-old killer, who has attempted to kill himself on previous occasions in the past, sent a suicide note to the Hartford Courant ahead of the suicide attempt detailing his 'intolerable' prison conditions and the guilt he felt over the murders.

I . can thank DOC staff for showing me the difference.' He stated that he was miserable at the prison, which he called 'a psychological torture chamber'. He said that staff would no doubt blame his suicide on 'unresolved issues' rather than on themselves. In 2012, he filed a civil rights complaint charging harassment, cruelty, unfair punishment and mail tampering by state prison officials - and he said these conditions were the reason for killing himself. Correction officials denied Hayes' allegations in a court filing in June 2013. Most recently, Hayes was disciplined in an incident over a towel and the level of discipline was not appropriate, according to his public defender. Prison officials had cleared out his cell while he was in the shower and put his possessions on a table, and noticed that he had an extra blanket. Hayes refused to return to the cell until he was given the blanket back. A supervisor had given him permission to have the extra blanket, Public Defender Thomas Ullman told the Courant. Shocking: Hayes raped and strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, died of smoke inhalation after they were doused with gasoline and the house was set on fire . Crime scene: The killers broke into this home in Cheshire and held the family hostage . Convicted: Hayes, pictured left in 2007, and Joshua Komisarjevsky, right, are now both on death row . He was placed in 'punitive segregation' for 15 days in January, lost telephone privileges for 45 days and visitation privileges for 30 days. 'They're pushing him into madness,' Ullmann said. It is not the first time the killer has tried to kill himself. At his trial in 2010, he revealed he had attempted suicide both before and after the killings by slashing his wrists and trying to choke himself. Hayes also tried to commit suicide during . his 2010 trial and upon hearing he would face the death penalty, told a . New Haven court 'Death, to me, will be a welcome relief.' He also told The Hartford . Courant in a 2012 interview that he concocted a plan to end his own life . by obtaining oysters, to which he is deathly allergic. He . said he fabricated claims in letters that he killed 17 people in hopes . that prison authorities would notify police and he could then trade . information for food, including oysters. Looking forward: Five years after losing his family, Dr Petit married Christine Paluf last year . Hayes . and an accomplice, Joshua Komisarjevsky, are both on death row . following their convictions in the 2007 triple-murder of Jennifer .

"By . Mike Dickson . Jonathan Trott has insisted that his sudden decision to quit this winter’s Ashes tour was due to physical and mental burnout, rather than depression. He admits, however, that the stress of the trip led to repeat headaches, and to him hiding away from his team-mates at breakfast while being unsure about how he would feel when travelling to the ground. After getting home, he feared that people might view him as a ‘nutcase’. In a Sky Sports documentary to be broadcast on Sunday evening, the England batsman differentiates his case from that of Marcus Trescothick, and he emphasises that he wants to resume his international career as soon as possible this summer. VIDEO: Scroll down for Jonathan Trott on the Ashes and a comeback . Mental burnout: Jonathan Trott's face tells the story after he was dismissed by Mitchell Johnson at The Gabba . A weight off his mind: Trott revealed the reason behind his decision to quit the Ashes tour on Sky . Focused on a return: Trott wants to resume his international career this summer . Admission: Trott says he was consumed by guilt watching his England colleagues struggle without him . Giving what is his first account of the circumstances that saw him fly home after November’s first Test in Brisbane, he concedes that he was consumed by guilt watching his colleagues struggle when back in England. Nonetheless, he is convinced that he did the right thing by leaving Australia, after a recurrence of feelings he has experienced before. ‘I knew I wasn’t helping anyone by being there, I would have been a passenger basically,’ he tells interviewer Ian Ward. ‘I was trying everything to get myself in the right frame of mind to contribute, I was working hard in the nets, but emotionally it was hard to keep myself in check. ‘Just coming down to breakfast I’d sit on my own, away from the guys with my cap over my head, because I didn’t know how I was going to react to having to go to the cricket ground again.’ He states that the brief gap between unprecedented back-to-back Ashes series contributed to the condition building up. Although he does not blame anybody, there is the implicit suggestion that the players were pushed too hard, given the highly unusual schedule. Face facts; The relentlessness of the international schedule contributed to Trott's exhaustion . Opening up: Trott spoke to Ian Ward in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports . Nothing left to give: Trott spoons the ball to deep square leg in the second innings at The Gabba and (right) walks off despondent after giving his wicket away . ‘You end up going back to your room and it’s difficult. You feel sort of hopeless, it’s the opposite end of the spectrum to how it felt three years ago or at the beginning of the English summer. It built up through the end of the Ashes in England, through the ODI series. The three weeks in between wasn’t time off because I was working hard in the nets. ‘It was pretty relentless, getting to Australia a month before the first Test, and I think we had two days off before the first Test. ‘I tried my hardest and ended up finding out myself that I had nothing left to give. It was very difficult for me to operate close to 100 per cent or even 50 per cent of what I was capable of. I didn’t have the emotional energy or the mental energy to get out there. Throughout (last) summer I was getting to 40 and 50 and I just couldn’t watch the ball as hard as I normally do. ‘Even in the Ashes series in England there were times, especially towards the end of the series, when I just had a headache for three or four days, just constantly in a bad place really. I remember driving from Old Trafford to Durham for the fourth Test, it’s normally quite a nice drive and I just wasn’t feeling right. I was just constantly thinking about cricket.’ Headache: Trott admits that even in the winning Ashes series in the summer he found it duifficult . Couldn't switch off: Trott admits he was 'constantly thinking about cricket' during the summer . Matters did not improve in Australia, and he recognised that there was a problem. ‘Going to the cricket ground was quite hard to do, keeping emotionally intact and in the right frame of mind. Starting at the end of Hobart and Sydney (Ashes warm-up matches) it was getting to that point, and then I realised at Brisbane because of the scrutiny of five Test matches I wasn’t going to be in the right space.’ He is sure that his condition was different to that of Trescothick, who similarly departed an Ashes Tour seven years previously. ‘I spoke to Marcus and he wanted to know how I was. There are a lot of similarities people can probably draw from it, I understand people thinking it but it’s a completely different situation.. We were both very upset and confused but also at the same time very different. ‘In Brisbane I spoke to the Doc and on one of the last nights he said, ""You know, if I was a GP I’d sign you off for three weeks from work and say come back and see me in three weeks’ time"", but we’re on an Ashes tour and you can’t do that, so I didn’t have anywhere to go really. Not a factor: Trott says he was 'already out' by the time David Warner made his comments, but the added that he 'didn't have the mental energy to fight it' It all felt the same: Trott concedes people may think Mitchell Johnson's bowling helped send him home but insists it did not matter who was bowling, or how quickly . ‘I remember day two or three (of Brisbane), it was a bit of a blur. I was getting headaches and I wasn’t eating properly towards the end, and that’s when the sleep started getting disruptive and emotionally that was when I was worst and it just boiled over really. I had nothing left in the tank or battery – mentally and physically pretty drained.’ He is insistent that David Warner’s derogatory comments in Brisbane were not a factor, and nor was the full frontal assault of Mitchell Johnson. Of Warner’s comments he responds: ‘No, I was already out so it didn’t make a difference. Those sort of things don’t really bother me,’ although he then adds: ‘I didn’t have the mental energy to fight it.’ On Johnson, he concedes that observers will put two and two together and conclude that the paceman helped send him home: ‘I’m sure people will think that, and people have said it, but to me it didn’t matter who was bowling and that’s the hardest part to accept. It doesn’t matter if it was 100mph, 90mph or 60 mph, it all felt pretty much the same.’ The rock: Trott has been England's calming influence at No 3 for five years . There was clearly a feeling of release immediately he left Australia, although after that it became difficult to watch from afar, with concerns about how the public would perceive him. ‘Leaving Brisbane, I flew to Hong Kong.  I’ve never slept on a plane, but as it took off I slept for eight hours straight. It was really weird, I woke up in Hong Kong and the news was about to break in Australia so it was really strange. And then the guys walked out at Adelaide and things didn’t go well and a feeling of guilt started kicking in. That was the hardest thing, for me to be in contact with the guys and them thinking he’s at home with the central heating on and watching it on TV. ‘I was a little bit worried about going out in public because people look at you and you don’t know what they are thinking. ""There goes that nutcase"" or whatever, and you’re not quite sure what perceptions are. People come up to you and say, ""It’s good to see you out and about"" and I’m like, ""I’m not crazy I was just burnt out"".’ Different: Trott says his case was not the same as that of Marcus Trescothick, who left the 2006-07 Ashes tour after suffering from depression . While pledging that he wants to come . back, and wants to tour again, he admits that this was not the first . time he has experienced such a state of mind. ‘I’ve never really spoken about it but on my first tour I went to South Africa and I had probably a little bit similar feeling towards the end – it was a 10-week tour and I’d never been away and I ended up having not a disaster…but at the Wanderers I wasn’t feeling great. 'I learnt from that mistake for the next couple of years but probably got myself in a similar spiral and situation in the last couple of months before I had a break.’ Trott reaffirms that he is targeting Warwickshire’s match against Oxford University at the start of next month as his comeback, and that he wants to get straight back into the England set up when the international treadmill cranks up again. Bear necessities: Trott will play for Warwickshire in their friendly against Oxford University next month . ‘I know there’s a Scotland game at the beginning of May. I think that would be a good game to get back into the mix, and then at the end of the month there’s Sri Lanka. I don’t want to be one of those cricketers that picks and chooses, I want to be available from the word go. 'I remember almost to the day six weeks after I got back thinking that if I had to go out and bat now at Brisbane six weeks later I’d feel a lot more confident than I did when I actually played. ‘I’ll probably be under a cloud for a bit, ""He left an Ashes tour, is he going to be OK?"" I think as long as I’m feeling OK with myself and where my game’s at I think playing international cricket is fine, there’s obviously scrutiny but it’s how I feel about my own game and how I feel going forward.’ * Watch the full programme Jonathan Trott: Burn Out, on Sunday March 16 at 7pm on Sky Sports 1 .","Jonathan Trott's sudden decision to leave Australia after the first Test was down to physical and mental burnout, not depression .

"By . Luke Garratt . A seaside village has been snubbed by its millionaire benefactor, after she was so upset they protested her beach cafe that she cut the village out of her will. Millionaire Gillian Goddard had intended to leave her shares for a massive 750 acre estate to the village of Bantham in Devon when she died. But when the locals in the village objected to the estates decision to let a food bus use the beach car park, she became so upset she adjusted her will before she died in November last year. The beach is a popular tourist spot for those who enjoy surfing and sandy beaches, but the villagers took exception to commerce on the quiet beach . Bantham is a small village in Devon, whose land is mostly owned by Evans Estates and the Goddard family . Goddard was one of the five directors of Evans Estates, which includes most of Bantham village, as well as surrounding farmland, and a long beach. Her husband Tony, 74, said she had devoted her life to the betterment of the village, and had been keen to leave the village 'several million pounds' as a trust fund when she died. But she changed her mind after Evan Estates' decision to allow a food truck to use the beach car park provoked outcry, including several angry letters of complaint, from the villagers. When the food truck turned up at the beach, the villagers began uproarious protest against it . Intended to give visitors a chance for refreshment when visiting the beach, the Gastrobus soon garnered angry reaction from the villagers . Gillian Goddard, millionaire benefactor to the village, became so upset at the reaction to the food truck that she cut the village out of her will . The estate had charged fees for the Bantham beach car park, but otherwise had been completely free from commerce until four years ago, when the estate allowed a surf school and a food bus to use the beach. Tony Goddard said the aim was to help the villagers and visitors by offsetting costs with commerce, while also allowing them to buy refreshments when visiting the beach. Mr Goddard said: 'Gill's life's work was to look after Bantham. But one of things people . asked for is whether they could get some food or drink on the beach. Now that the intent for the estate is to sell it, the people living as tenants in the village are worried about the state of their tenancy if the new owners decide to change the conditions of the village . 'So they introduced a Gastrobus to avoid putting in some great big cafe, because they thought it would be environmentally friendly. 'The idea for the Gastrobus provoked an enormous reaction from a small number of villagers who objected to commercialisation of the area. 'She was deeply upset by the suggestion that she and her fellow directors, having looked after the estate for all these years, would do something that was against that policy of preserving the estate. 'Her idea of leaving her company shares on the estate on trust for the village disappeared overnight.' Before, the estate had a strict no vendors policy to keep the beach and its surrounding farmland free of clutter, but they decided on instituting an official food truck for financial reasons, hoping it might better visitor trips to the beach . He added that there had been no specific plans for the trust fund, just that it should be used for the benefit of the village. Nick Grodhunce, one of the opponents of the Gastrobus, said he was 'saddened' that the trust fund had been dropped by Mrs Goddard. He said: 'Both Tony and Gilly did a huge amount of work to preserve what we have here and it is to their credit. 'It is sad but my personal opinion is that the community people have clearly stated that they want to preserve whatever Evans Estates said should be preserved.' Evans Estates had previously decided to begin commerce on the beach to offset costs of parking to visitors, such as a surf school . The Bantham estate has been owned by Mrs Goddard's family for nearly 100 years, and is now due to be marketed in May, with no official reason given for the sale. The village have raised concerns about what effect a new owner will have on the area, especially on the tenants of the 21 Evans Estates-owned homes, with many villagers worried about losing their tenancies. Villagers in Bantham are now left worrying about their future . Was established as port selling tin to Gaul during Roman times . Later became centre of pilchard trading industry .

"By . Ben Spencer . Manufacturing firms could see their energy costs fall by £7billion. George Osborne said he would cap taxes on carbon emissions, compensate heavy industry for other green taxes and extend tax breaks for investment. Together, the measures could save a medium-sized manufacturing business £50,000 a year, the Chancellor told MPs yesterday. Glowing praise: Tony Pedder, who says cuts to carbon tax will help firms . Capping . the tax on carbon use will help factories that are forced to shut down . temporarily to save on high energy costs, one boss said last night. Tony . Pedder, of Sheffield Forgemasters, expects his steel plant to shut down . 30 times over the coming months because of energy costs. Its massive furnaces require enormous amounts of power – costs that are pushed up by the Government’s green taxes. Mr Pedder warned this left British companies struggling to compete with foreign rivals.Yesterday . he said: ‘The Government has recognised there is an issue with . competitiveness. It is a step towards a more competitive environment for . Forgemasters and many other manufacturing companies.’ He intends to cap the carbon price floor, which sets the minimum levy imposed on factories and businesses for the amount of carbon dioxide they emit. It was due to hit £18.08 a tonne in 2015, rising to £30 for ten years from 2016. But it will now stay at the 2015 level until 2026. The change to the tax, which particularly . affects big energy users such as steel plants, paper mills and other . large manufacturers, could save industry up to £4billion by 2018 and a . further £1.5billion in 2019, while shaving £15 off a typical household . energy bill. Mr Osborne said: ‘We need to cut our energy costs.’ In . addition, he said he would extend compensation to those firms most . affected by the taxes to 2020. A new scheme will also be set up to . refund energy-intensive industries for levies passed on to them from . wind and solar power. And firms that use fuel to generate both heat and power will be exempted from carbon taxes. A typical energy-intensive business in Britain pays almost 50 per cent more for their electricity than those in France. The move will particularly benefit the most energy-intensive manufacturers, around 80 per cent of which are based in the North, Scotland and Wales. The Chancellor’s move against green taxes comes after the Prime Minister reportedly told ministers to ‘get rid of all the green c**p’ last autumn, and follows Mr Osborne’s pledge in December to cut £50 from household energy bills. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has also refused to accept proposals for legally binding EU targets for renewable energy production after 2020, which would have driven energy prices up. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, said: ‘Taken together with measures to boost investment, exports and skills, the Chancellor deserves a pat on the back.’ Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steel union Community, said: ‘It’s good the Government is finally listening. 'We’ve been saying for years that industry needed help to reduce its energy costs and now the Chancellor has admitted the Government has been getting it wrong.’ But the move was criticised by climate-change experts. Economist Nicholas Stern said the change would create uncertainty for green investment. ‘Chancellors cannot resist the temptation to fiddle,’ Lord Stern said. ‘Fiddling creates policy uncertainty and that in turn reduces investment including, and critically, in the energy sector by raising the cost of capital.’ Company car drivers will be hit by a 2 per cent increase in Britain’s favourite executive perk. But there will be an increase in discounts for ultra-low emission vehicles and a reduction in the rate of fuel duty for methanol. Under the Chancellor’s planned 2 per cent increase in company car tax each year to 2018/19 a £19,000 Volkswagen Golf 1.4 TSI with 123g/km CO2 emissions will cost a higher rate tax payer an additional £608 a year by 2018/19. A £38,000 BMW 525d will see hikes of £1,215 across the same period. But sharing their pain will be those with low emission or electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf Vista, say accountants. Drivers of this £26,000 car will see its tax bill increase from nothing – if it was first acquired in or before 2014/15 – to £1,350 in 2018/19. Ashley Hollinshead, of Deloitte, said: ‘Even those opting for the ultra-green electric cars are starting to bring with them some hefty bills.’ The three-wheeler Reliant Robin is to be classed as a classic car exempt from road tax. Previously only cars built before January 1, 1973 were exempt. The Robin – first manufactured in October 1973 by the Reliant motor company from Tamworth in Staffordshire – will now escape under a rolling 40-year vehicle excise duty exemption rule coming in from April 1. A true classic: The Reliant Robin . Although scorned by some the Robin, last made in 1981, proved popular. It is not to be confused with its older van-like sibling the Reliant Regal, above, which ‘Del Boy’ Trotter drove in Only Fools And Horses. It was already exempt. Other cars that come into the classic exempt category now include the Austin Allegro and the MGB V. Drivers of other cars will see their road tax go up in line with RPI inflation from April 1.","Carbon emissions tax capped with industry compensated for green taxes .

"By . Sara Nathan . Simon Cowell and love Lauren Silverman have officially decided to call their baby son Simon Cowell Jnr, MailOnline can reveal. The X Factor supremo, 54, and his girlfriend are expecting their son next month and he will be born in New York so Lauren can be near her eldest son, Adam. And although many thought Cowell was joking when he said that Simon was his favourite name, a friend of the couple said: ‘Simon and Lauren have decided that their favorite name for the baby is actually Simon.' ‘For a while it was between Simon and Eric- Simon’s dad’s name, but now it looks like Eric will be the middle name.’ Indeed, at Lauren’s baby shower last month, guests brought baby gifts emblazoned with the name Simon on them. Including gifts embroidered with the initials SC. Scroll down for video . Adorable! Simon looked like he had caught a little sun on his chest as the love-birds cuddled up to one another in Barbados last month .

Beverly Hills mansion was decked out in blue and white and a . muscle-bound male server gave out drinks ; and a stunning floral . arrangement was composed using white orchids, yellow orchids, blue . hydrangeas and white roses. After the party the flowers were given to . the nearby Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. Cowell and Lauren, 36, are currently on vacation aboard the Silverstream yacht in St Barts.But it will definitely be all hands on deck when the couple return to Manhattan ahead of their baby’s birth at one of the city’s most exclusive hospitals on February 28. The couple will bring their son home to the $26-000-a-month apartment they are renting in Manhattan. Cowell said that Simon was his favourite name while being interviewed by his former girlfriend Terri Semour for Extra last month. The expectant father said: 'My number one choice is Simon because I like the name.' He revealed that his second favourite for his first child with girlfriend Lauren Silverman is Eric, after his father, who passed away in 1999. The music millionaire said: ‘His birthday is going to be very close to my dad’s birthday,' adding that his father would be proud and amazed if he were here.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A pregnant Florida woman with a strange infatuation with One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles faces criminal charges after she allegedly beat a 57-year-old woman with a cane earlier this week over an argument about butter. But 24-year-old Jennifer Feagley isn't to blame for the violent attack - according to Feagley, her pregnancy hormones made her do it. Authorities were called to a home on Pearl Street in Daytona Beach at 9:19 p.m. Tuesday after the victim, 57-year-old Patricia Marson, called 9-1-1 to report that she had been attacked. Obsessed: Jennifer Feagley lists her occupation Facebook as being 'married to Harry Styles' Hormones: Feagley-Styles claims her pregnancy hormones made her attack a 57-year-old woman with a cane . Marson told police that Feagley was heating butter on a stove in the moments leading up to the attack. When Marson asked Feagley why she was heating the butter, Feagley flew into a rage. According to an arrest report first obtained by the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Feagley started the attack by hitting Marson in the head, knocking her to the floor. She then got on top of Marson and started punching her in the chest and choking her. But the punches and choking apparently wasn't enough. History: Prior to this week's attack, Ms. 'Styles' has been arrested twice for battery . Violent: Authorities say that Feagley choked the victim before hitting with a cane at least five times . After pummeling the woman with her fists, Feagley grabbed Marson's cane and started beating her with it. According to the report, Marson was hit with the cane at least five times. Following her arrest, Feagley explained to police that she was six months pregnant and that her hormones are what caused her to act out. But this isn't Feagley's found herself on the wrong side of the law - according to arrest records, she's been in custody at least two other times, both of which were arrests for battery. Feagley is unemployed, but on Facebook lists her occupation as 'being married to Harry Styles.' She's even changed her name on the social media website to 'Jenn Styles' to reflect her fictitious job.","Jennifer Feagley, 24, allegedly choked victim before beating her with a cane .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . 'This definitely brightened my day': Sidelined skier Lindsey Vonn brought home a rescue dog after announcing she can't compete in next month's Sochi Olympics . Lindsey Vonn cheered herself up on Wednesday after announcing she'll be missing the Sochi Olympics by picking up a new four-legged friend. The injury-plagued downhill ski champ and her high-profile lover Tiger Woods chose Leo, a 9-month-old boxer mix, because he has injuries just like hers. 'He has a bad knee, just like me,' a limping Vonn told reporters as she led the pup from a Jupiter, Florida shelter. Vonn first saw the injured dog the day before Christmas Eve, according to WPBF. At the time, her boyfriend Woods wanted a different dog. But workers at Furry Friends in Jupiter said she came back annmouncing 'I won!' before adopting Leo. Down in the dumps Vonn posted a photo of herself with the dog on Twitter Wednesday evening. 'Leo brightened my day,' she wrote. 'Has a bum knee bc a car hit him #bumkneebuddies #puppylove.' Vonn is widely regarded as the most successful female skier of all time, but a February 2013 knee injury while skiing in Austria has since seriously sidetracked her career. Until Tuesday, Vonn had remained upbeat nonetheless. Less than two weeks after . reconstructive right knee surgery in February 2013, Lindsey Vonn already . was sounding a positive note, saying she was 'really looking forward to . Sochi' and defending her Olympic downhill gold medal. Along . the way to the next Winter Games, though, Vonn began facing more . setbacks. As she'd move past one, another would surface. In the end, it . was too much, even for Vonn, the most accomplished U.S. ski racer in . history. Expected to be one of the biggest stars at the upcoming Games, . Vonn announced Tuesday — exactly one month before the opening ceremony — . she won't be able to race in Russia. Scroll down for video... 'He has a bad knee, just like me': The dog Vonn chose was hit by a car and has since needed surgery on his leg . 'I'm pretty bummed about it': Vonn was terse with a reporter who asked her how she felt about missing Sochi because of her injuries . Vonn exhibited a conspicuous limp as she led Leo away from a Jupiter, Florida animal shelter on Wednesday . In a Facebook posting, Vonn said she is 'devastated' to miss the Olympics, 'but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level.' Like many in her risk-filled sport, Vonn has dealt with injuries often, particularly at major events. She withdrew midway through the 2011 world championships because of a concussion. She raced with a severely bruised shin at the last Olympics. She skipped a race at the 2009 worlds after slicing her thumb open on a champagne bottle. She hurt her knee in training and missed a pair of races at the 2007 worlds. She took a scary fall during training at the 2006 Olympics, then left the hospital to compete. 'She's come back. She'll be back,' Vonn's father, Alan Kildow, said in a telephone interview. 'You'll see a lot of Lindsey Vonn in the future.' Vonn left the 2010 Vancouver Games with two medals: the first Olympic downhill gold for an American woman, and a bronze in the super-G. She is also a four-time overall World Cup champion, by far the most recognized name in Alpine skiing at the moment — and, as it happens, the girlfriend of Tiger Woods. Withdrawal: Lindsey Vonn and her partner Tiger Woods were together the day before Christmas Eve when the skier first met the kindred spirit canine . Add it all up, and she would have been the focus of plenty of media coverage in Sochi, certainly a main character in NBC's coverage for a U.S. audience. 'Lindsey gives you great promotional value, and she's an amazing athlete and an amazing story,' said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics. 'But there are amazing athletes that are going to be in Sochi, many of which we know, some of which we haven't identified yet.' To those in the world of skiing, there's no doubt about the sport's most important athlete of late. 'Without Lindsey Vonn, the races are . just not the same,' Canadian women's Alpine coach Hugues Ansermoz said . last month. 'She just attracts so much interest. When Lindsey Vonn is . here, there are more people coming to watch the race, there is more . interest on TV, more journalists are interested.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Social media really is the end of privacy, if a new algorithm developed by IBM is anything to go by. The tech giant announced on Friday that they have come up with a formula that can track the home city of any Twitter user based on the metadata contained in their last 200 tweets. According to The Daily Caller, the formula has an almost 70 percent rate of accuracy. It's the latest research finding to highlight the possible danger to privacy and security presented by metadata collection and analysis. Be careful what you Tweet: IBM researchers have developed an algorithm that predicts your home location using your last 200 tweets . Researchers say that advertisers looking for specific areas to market and journalists covering major news events have the most to gain from the algorithm. Research head Jalal Mahmud said IBM began the process by seeing whether they could predict the location of a Twitter account by analyzing tweets and matching the content against their geotagged metadata. One of twitter's options features allows for location tagging. The team started by tracking geotagged tweets from the 100 largest cities in America between July and August 2011, and isolated 100 users out of each location. Researchers then examined the last 200 tweets from each user, discounting private tweets from the mix, and were left with 1.5 million geotagged tweets from almost 10,000 users. Ten percent of the data was then set aside to test against later, while the bulk 90 percent was analyzed layer upon layer to create the location-estimating formula. The new formula has again raised questions about social media and privacy, especially for those who would rather their home location remained private . Key to the formula is the additional information users are including in their tweets – 100,000 pulled from the team’s data collection were submitted by users linking their Twitter accounts to the popular Foursquare location-based social networking platform, and in 300,000 other cases, users included the names of cities from the U.S. Geological Service gazetteer in tweets. The team also found the national distribution of tweets was more or less constant on a daily basis, which allowed them to isolate user’s time zones based on their tweet pattern. Even the specifically-worded content of posts themselves aided tracking when users would type in things like the name of a sports team, for example. With their algorithm established, the team then used it on the 10 percent of data set aside before analysis, and found that in less than one second for each individual it was able to correctly identify a user’s home city 68 percent of the time, home state 70 percent, and time zone 80 percent.","IBM researchers went through Twitter to find 100 different users in the 100 biggest cities in the US .

"By . Suzannah Hills . The infamous row between Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi was sparked by a disagreement on whether her daughter should go to university, it has been claimed. The celebrity couple split after remarkable pictures, taken outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London, in June appeared to show Mr Saatchi 'throttling' Miss Lawson. Within weeks of the pictures being published around the world, they had divorced after 10 years of marriage. Infamous moment: Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi were allegedly rowing about whether her daughter Mimi should go to university in the lead up to this incident outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair in June last year . But it has remained a bone of contention as to what caused the heated argument which resulted in Mr Saatchi appearing to grab the 53-year-old TV chef's throat as she broke down into tears. It has now been claimed the couple had been having a disagreement on whether Miss Lawson's daughter Mimi should go to University. According to Vanity Fair, Mr Saatchi told a close friend that he told Miss Lawson that Mimi should continue her internship at The Economist rather than leave to go to university. However, the credibility of the claim in Vanity Fair is contradicted by Miss Lawson's evidence on oath in court that the argument was in fact about her desire to become a grandmother. During the lunch date on June 9, he is said to have pressed the point that Mimi could continue to impress her bosses at the publication and gain an advantage on those leaving university with little or no experience in the profession. Divorce: Nigella Lawson divorced her husband Charles Saatchi after she was photographed apparently being throttled by the millionaire art editor . First interview: Nigella Lawson has appeared on . GMA last week and admitted she'd been 'eating a lot of chocolate' to cope with the . trials of the past year including drug allegations and her divorce . Admission: Nigella told the TV morning show in New York on Thursday that she was 'mortified' by the playing out of her private life in court . As the discussion became more and more heated, Miss Lawson excused herself from the table outside and visited the toilets in the restaurant. Mr Saatchi is said to have told the unnamed source he became increasingly frustrated when Miss Lawson returned to the table and was 'unable to focus'. The source claimed Mr Saatchi only then took a hold of Miss Lawson's neck to 'get her attention'. He is then said to have told Nigella: 'Listen to me. I feel very passionate about this. I think it's great they love her at The Economist.' Miss Lawson is said to have refused to co-operate with the Vanity Fair article. However, the credibility of the claim in Vanity Fair has to be doubted as Miss Lawson gave evidence on oath that the argument in fact was about her desire to become a grandmother. Nigella Lawson, pictured arriving at Isleworth Crown Court in London before giving evidence in the trial of two former personal assistants who worked for her and Charles Saatchi . Charles Saatchi denied he was strangling Nigella as he gave evidence at Isleworth Crown Court . She told the court: ‘Someone walked by with a very sweet baby in a stroller, and I said “I’m so looking forward to having grandchildren”. ‘And he grabbed me by the throat and said: “I’m the only person you should be concerned with – I’m the only person who should be giving you pleasure”.’ Photographs of the incident led directly to Mr Saatchi accepting a police caution for assault and the couple divorcing. It has previously been claimed by . Miss Lawson's former assistants during their trial for fraud that the . argument had been about the TV chef using drugs. But both Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi insisted the row was not about drugs. Admission: Miss Lawson told the jury that she had snorted cocaine seven times in total - including once while married to Charles Saatchi . Departure: Nigella Lawson leaves court after admitting taking cocaine and smoking cannabis during her marriage to Charles Saatchi . Referring to the incident outside Scott's Restaurant in Mayfair, central London, Mr Saatchi told Isleworth Crown Court: 'I was not gripping, strangling or throttling her. I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus, can we be clear? 'Was it about her drug use? No.' During the court case, the TV cook admitted she had snorted cocaine and had even smoked cannabis in front of her children. But she said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Charles Saatchi. During seven hours of testimony, Miss Lawson, 53, was asked: ‘Are you or have you ever been a user of cocaine?’ She replied: ‘I have never been a drug addict. I have never been a habitual user. But there were times in my life when I used cocaine.’ She was testifying against Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo who allegedly went on lavish spending sprees with Mr Saatchi's company credit cards. The sisters were cleared of the charges. 'Drug taking': John Diamond and Nigella Lawson took cocaine while he was suffering from terminal cancer, a jury was told .","The couple split after .

Perhaps this half-witted couple had been smoking a little too much of their own stock when they decided to ring the police to report that their £10,000 cannabis farm had been stolen. Officers easily weeded out dumb duo Colin Roberts and Mandy Coghlan who had contacted them after discovering that dozens of their own cannabis plants had been taken. However, when police tried to arrest Roberts for producing the drug, his partner Coghlan threatened officers with an air pistol, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. The high life: Colin Roberts, right, and Mandy Coghlan, left, told police that their £10,000 cannabis farm had been stolen . The court was told that on arrival at Coghlan and Roberts' home on April 23, they were hit by a pungent smell of cannabis. The pair reported that £10,000 of their belongings had been stolen - and admitted that it was in the form of cannabis plants when questioned. More... Can you sPOT the odd one out?

The court heard that on witnessing her partner's arrest Coghlan became angry and grabbed a loaded air pistol and pointed it at one of the police officers. The pair have been handed 12-month prison sentences, suspended for two years. Weeded out: Police were led straight to cannabis farmers who managed to shop themselves after their stash was stolen . David Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'Coghlan appeared to be intoxicated. 'She . became upset and left the house and found a piece of glass in the back . yard which she held to her throat. The officers took it from her.' After seeing her partner arrested, Coghlan then barged past an officer and went into the kitchen. Mr .

'The . officer grabbed her arm and called for help and another officer was . able to get hold of the gun. The two of them were able to subdue her and . place her in handcuffs.' The pistol-type air weapon had four pellets inside and a fifth was waiting to be fired. Officers . found a 'gazebo set up' in an upstairs bedroom with 16 pots with just . stubs left as the rest of the cannabis plants had been harvested. There . was also 46.33 grams of dry skunk cannabis. The court was told the . potential yield of the plants and value of the drugs left in the house . was about £2,000. Roberts, . aged 47, of Bond Street, who has previous offences for drugs matters, . including cultivation of cannabis in 2009, pleaded guilty to producing . cannabis. Coghlan, of the . same address, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to . producing cannabis and possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of . violence. They accepted there was an element of commercial supply in the growing of the cannabis. Joanne Wallbanks, mitigating for Roberts, asked Recorder Patrick Thompson to give her client a chance. David Bratt, representing Coghlan, said her role in producing the cannabis was lower than Roberts. He also said that she acted on the spur of the moment with the firearm. 'It was just a foolish act of crass stupidity,' added Mr Bratt. As well as the suspended jail terms, Roberts must complete 240 hours’ unpaid work and Coghlan must work with alcohol and drug support service Adsis for 12 sessions.","Mandy Coghlan waved air pistol in face of officers when they tried to arrest her .

As the one-year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings approaches, the family of Martin Richard, the youngest victim, has released a statement and photo of Martin’s sister, Jane, with her new prosthetic 'Cheetah' running leg. The family said the photo shows 'just how far Jane has come on what has been a long and difficult road to recovery'. Jane, then 7, lost her leg in the explosion that killed eight-year-old Martin and two other people in the April 15 attack on Boylston Street, according to CBS Boston. Their mother Denise suffered a head injury and lost vision in one eye.

With the 2014 Boston Marathon now just one month away, we are pleased to share a photo that shows just how far Jane has come on what has been a long and difficult road to recovery.  Last week she received a “Cheetah” running leg, designed for athletics and everyday use.  This was a gift to her from an organization called Wiggle Your Toes; whose mission is to support those suffering from limb . Tragic: Martin Richard, 8, was standing by the finish line with his family when the explosion went off, killing him and two others . loss, in collaboration with Jane’s team at United Prosthetics, who donated their time and labor to construct it and get her up and running.  Never self-conscious and always smiling, Jane has worn it to school several times which speaks to the can-do spirit she has displayed over the last 11 months. With just one month to this year’s Boston Marathon, we find ourselves fully engaged in getting the foundation we set up to honor our son Martin off to a strong start.  In addition to working to support the wonderful team of 100 runners who make up “Team MR8,” we have also been busy networking with established nonprofits as well as private and corporate foundations and even a few think tanks and institutes.  The work being done out there to make the world a better place amazes and inspires us. The team of runners supporting The Martin W. Richard Charitable Foundation (Team MR8) has exceeded our every expectation.  We are blessed to have found a collection of team players that perfectly embody the values that have always been important to our family.  Watching them come together as a team, form friendships and support one another reminds us why we made “community” one of the three pillars of our foundation.  They have been hosting fundraising events in communities all over Massachusetts and around the country.  These wonderful people are giving life to a foundation we hope will pay their dedication, determination and generosity forward for generations. There is much activity in our lives these days, which goes a long way toward distracting us from what is certain to be an emotional one-year anniversary on April 15th.  A day doesn’t pass when we don’t cry over the loss of Martin, but we also laugh when we think about him, which feels like the right way to remember a little boy with a zest for life and a caring heart. Our gratitude will never diminish for the support and love we have received over the last eleven-plus months.  As the next few weeks come and go, we will be thinking about all of the families that have been impacted by the senseless events of last April, and proud of the way the community around us has persevered.","Jane Richard was critically injured in the Boston marathon bombing last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cruel: Officials suspect many the dead dogs discovered in the park are victims of a dog-fighting ring . A city worker in Detroit discovered a grisly scene as the snow began to melt in a park on the city's west side: The bodies of dozens of dead dogs scattered throughout the park. According to the Detroit Animal Welfare Group, the majority of the 28 dogs found so far are either pit bull or Mastiff mixes, most of which are covered in scars and lacerations. Many of the dogs found in River Rouge Park were curled up in the fetal position when their bodies were discovered. DAWG board member Nicole Litzelman says the dogs most likely were used for fighting, and then discarded by their owners in the park. 'A lot of people when they do these illegal activities, they . can’t put them out in the trash because even a lot of the trash collectors will . report dead animals in the trash,' Litzelman told WWJ. 'Or much less, they don’t want to . draw any attention to the house where they’re fighting the dogs illegally.' Litzelman says the park has become a popular dumping ground for dead dogs that have been killed in fights, or killed by their owners after losing a fight. 'Because of the heavy snowfall in the month of January, a . lot of these deceased bodies were discarded there because it was easier to . cover them up. Also, it was an unusually cold month where a lot of dogs froze . outside or were left to starve to death,' Litzelman told WWJ. 'This . is just a small tip of the iceberg. Right now, since the snow is melting, I’m . sure we’re going to find quite a few more bodies in the park.' The body of one dog was found in its crate dumped on the side of the road. Animal officials believe the dog was dumped their by its owner . 'Dumping ground': Officials say Rouge Park in Detroit has become a dumping ground for dog-fighting rings . Litzelman says the majority of the animals show injuries consistent with fighting. Many, she says, have either bled to death or have large wounds that were never treated. Some of the dogs, Litzelman says, appeared to be strays or abandoned by their owners. One of the dogs, she says, was found dead inside of his kennel, which was just dumped on the side of the road. 'It’s just very sad and disturbing to see. I mean, there’s . kids riding on buses in the city of Detroit that pass by these dead dogs every . day, just laying in the park. People walk through the park, they drive through . the park, they see these animal carcasses laying all around. It’s one of the . biggest problems that we have right now in the city,' she said.

At risk: Many live dogs also are in the park, and run the risk of becoming 'bait dogs' for dog-fighting rings . 'The park is about 1,200 acres and there’s so many animals . running around down there, and there’s actually some people who try to gather . some of the dogs that have been discarded that are still alive, and they . actually try to lure them and take them and use them for fighting as bait . dogs,' she said. 'We were just tipped off that there are some people down there . trying to feed these dogs to use them as bait dogs.' Litzelman and DAWG have organized a walk-through of the park for Saturday to raise awareness of what is becoming a growing problem. 'We’re going to have quite a few volunteers come out there . and meet us, bring garbage bags and try to clean up some of the park by . removing the deceased bodies, trying to see if we can catch some live dogs by . setting up traps, and hopefully try to thwart off some of the illegal dog . fighting activities going on in the park,' she said. 'The city is cash-strapped . and is having issues as far as police coverage and animal control coverage so . somebody has got to try to take ahold of the problem and do something.'","So far, animal officials have found 28 dead dogs in Detroit's River Rouge Park .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A journey through Mars’ impressive landscape has been made possible through a series of incredible images that reveal its surface in unprecedented detail. The images allow you to plummet into the breathtaking depths of its darkest canyons, float over its black dunes and revel in the beauty of the red planet’s spiralling whirlwinds. They were taken by Nasa’s observation satellite Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and provide a previously unseen vision of Mars, whose landscape has been taking shape for more than three billion years. Since 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been charting the red planet's terrain. This image shows defrosting of the crests of 'Inca City'. This is the informal name given to a set of intersecting ridges that are located among the layered materials of the south polar region of Mars. Their origin has never been understood . Since its arrival in orbit in 2006, MRO . and its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) telescope . have been mapping the martian surface. The . HiRISE team released preliminary, black-and-white images in March of . that year, and have since collected hundreds more. Now . Xavier Barral has compiled a selection of these in his book ‘This is . Mars’ which is designed to be a visual atlas of the red planet. Black-sand dunes on the floor of Mars' crater have been formed from cooled lava rock. This is one of the first sand dune fields ever recognised on Mars. In winter, these dunes are covered by frost and CO2 ice . The circular depressions, swirls and cliffs shown here are created by frozen CO2 on Mars evaporating into gas. The sun's sharp angle provides the energy that drives this process . As . Francis Rocard, manager of Solar System Exploration at CNES Space Observatory points out: ‘Along with Earth, Mars is the planet whose . history is the most rich and diverse.’ In . order to best capture the geological and mineralogical contours of this . mythical planet, the team decided to maintain a consistent point of . view, with each photograph covering a 6-km wide strip. Highlights . include defrosting of the crests of ‘Inca City’- the informal name . given by Mariner 9 scientists in 1972 to a set of intersecting, . rectilinear ridges on the south polar region of Mars. Their origin on Mars has never been understood, but seems to be linked to volcanic dykes. An impact crater reveals the layers of the Plateau Mawrth Vallis on the red planet. These layers are composed of clay minerals formed by the transformation of liquid water, providing evidence of Mars's ancient, humid past . Cuts into Mars' south pole sedimentary layer reveal that the area was made up of water ice, rather than frozen CO2. The cuts were made due to dramatic changes in temperature which can vary by as much as 100° C . A further image reveals black-sand dunes on the floor of Mars’ crater which have been formed from cooled lava rock. The image shows one of the first sand dune fields ever recognised on Mars. In . winter, these dunes are covered by frost and CO2 ice and deprived of . sunlight. Another group of sand dunes is shown to be lit by the sun shining down directly from above. Last . year, researchers found that sand dunes on Mars, once thought to be . unchanging, are actually dynamic and active today. These canyons show the regions of Granicus and Tinjar Valles, lying at approximately 26.8 degrees north latitude and 135.7 degrees east longitude. The northwest-aligned valles are Mar of the Utopia-Planitia region, an area thought to be covered by a layer of lava. Today, this once-smooth volcanic plain is incised by channels . Fast dunes can travel . a distance equal to their length over 170 years. The book takes you on a . journey into the deep cuts of Mars’ south pole sedimentary layer . revealing that they are made up of water ice, rather than frozen CO2. The cuts were made due to dramatic changes in temperature which can vary by as much as 100° C. Mars has vast glaciers hidden under aprons of rocky debris near mid and lower latitudes. In this image, the lines in the lower left largely parallel revealed the direction the glaciers flowed. The fissures have similarities to those formed by Alpine glaciers . This image shows region of the Polar South formed in Spring and at the end of summer. The dark patches shown fractures in the carbonic ice . Mr . Barral provides a captivating picture of how circular depressions, swirls . and cliffs are created by frozen CO2 on Mars evaporating into gas. He . hopes these images will ‘fuel our imagination, opening up multiple . interpretations and thus inciting us to think about our world and . ourselves.’ Scientists have long known that the red dust on Mars can swirl and blow around in dust storms and small whirlwinds, dust devils. These whirlwinds can cover huge areas of the planet, spiralling random trajectories . A group of sand dunes is lit by the Sun shining down directly from above.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Claims: Kim Kyong-hui, 67, is said to have died, but now there are reports she is in a vegetative state . Kim Jong-un's aunt is alive, but in a vegetative state after an operation on a brain tumour, according a report in South Korea . Kim Kyong-hui, 67, whose husband Jang Song-Thaek was executed under Jong-un's orders less than a month ago, is reported to have had surgery last year in Paris. The revelations conflict with reports earlier last week which claimed that she had died and may her killed herself. There has been speculation on her health and whereabouts since the death on 8 December of her husband, also 67, described as 'scum' by his 30-year-old nephew. Once a key figure in the totalitarian . regime, Mrs Kim, the sister of Kim Jong-un's father, former leader Kim . Jong-il, has not been seen in public since 10 September, when she was . spotted at a concert with her nephew and his wife. A . report in the JoongAng Daily quoted an intelligence official in the . United States that Ms Kim has been in a vegetative state since she . underwent brain surgery in France, reported The Daily Telegraph. An . official in the South Korean government told Yonhap News that Mrs Kim is . in 'a critical condition' as a result of complications stemming from a . heart problem. One story suggested Mrs Kim had been receiving treatment for heart disease, reportedly had a heart attack . soon after her husband was killed. Mrs Kim, front, seen in 2011 with her nephew Kim Jong-un, front right, and husband Jang Song-Thaek, two behind Jong-un . Despite her husband having been . executed, Mrs Kim's life was believed to be safe, particularly when she . was chosen to join other dignitaries planning the funeral of a senior . Workers Party official who died last month. She . is said to have suffered from alcoholism and depression since the death . of her only child, daughter Jang Kum-song, who killed herself in Paris . in 2006. Initial speculation was that Jang had been killed by firing squad, a fate that media outlets said was the usual one reserved for 'traitors'. Condemned: Jang Song Thaek (second right) is escorted in court before being executed. North Korea has not released details about how he was killed . Dictator's aunt: Kim Kyong-hui, centre front, is the younger sister of Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il . However, an alternative narrative of the 67-year old's death emerged on what appears to have been a satirical post on the Chinese Tencent Weibo site that has been repeated by many media outlets worldwide. The December 11 post on Tencent Weibo, which was viewed 290,000 times, said Jang and five aides were killed by dogs. The Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po newspaper then released an article and a screenshot of the Weibo post which it used to justify its report that Jang had been torn apart. Wen Wei Po, although independent, is viewed as being pro-Beijing. Its report was in turn picked up 12 days later by the Singapore-based Straits Times and then by a wide range of US and European media from print to television. Kim Jong Un, believed to be around 30 years old, has been in power for two years and presided over a nuclear test and two rocket test launches that are banned under United Nations sanctions. In 2013, Pyongyang threatened to strike South Korea, the United States and Japan in fiery rhetoric that triggered an arms buildup in East Asia. One of the pitfalls of reporting on North Korea is that few independent media have offices there and visiting media are tightly controlled in a country which ranks among the lowest in global surveys of press freedom. Because of the lack of first hand information, many lurid stories about the country gain credence.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Grammar pedants have been urged by a minister to rise up against councils who have tried to erase apostrophes from road signs. Brandon Lewis said that if humanity can put a man on the moon and split the atom it can build a sat-nav which understands proper punctuation. The local government minister insisted there is ‘no Whitehall rule or Brussels diktat’ forcing town halls to wipe punctuation from the map. Scholars' Walk in Chesterton where somebody has added the missing apostrophes . Councils in Mid Devon and Cambridge have been criticised for removing apostrophes from street names and road signs. Locals armed with black marker pens have fought back, with with missing punctuation, such as that at Scholars Walk, having the  correct apostrophe inserted overnight. On the same sign in the Cambridge’s East Chesterton area, an apostrophe has also been added to Pepys Court. However, Mr Lewis insisted that if the humble apostrophe is ‘good enough for Her Majesty's Government, so should it be for local councils’. Local government minister Brandon Lewis insisted there is no diktat from Whitehall against apostrophes . In a lengthy response to a parliamentary questions, he said there was no Government guidance issued to councils about the use of the apostrophe on street signs. He said: ‘I understand this may stem from a misunderstanding of guidance issued by the Geoplace National Land and Property Gazetteer which is overseen by local government. ‘However, Geoplace has confirmed it doesn't require councils to remove apostrophes either - councils can continue to use apostrophes and punctuation if they're used in the official street name. ‘One of the spurious reasons for abolishing apostrophes has been the suggestion they may cause confusion for emergency services' IT systems. ‘If mankind can put a man on the moon, split the atom and decode the double helix then I'm sure it's not beyond the reach of 21st Century technology to have a sat-nav which can understand an apostrophe.’ Mr Lewis said he could not support ‘grammar guerillas’ who return missing apostrophes to new signs because it is an offence to deface a street sign under 1907 legislation. But in a call to arms to grammar fans across the country, he added: ‘We would encourage residents to defend their traditional place names from over zealous municipal pen pushers.’ Banned: Existing apostrophes such as Blundell's Avenue in Devon will not be changed but no new signs will be permitted to use such punctuation . Official guidance: Mid Devon Council said in future all road signs should avoid using punctuation entirely . Mr Lewis said apostrophes should stay on road signs, and satnav systems could cope . Mr Lewis was responding to a question from Conservative MP for South Swindon, Robert Buckland. Mr Buckland said: ‘I think I join a long queue of people who get upset when they see misuse of this punctuation mark! ‘There is a serious point to be made about how we need to make sure things are spelt correctly - otherwise what is the point in having these rules?’","Some councils have removed punctuation marks from street signs .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Becky Barrow . One in four voters trust Miliband to run the economy, a survey shows . Ed Miliband’s economic credibility took another tumble yesterday after his lacklustre response to the Budget. A new survey found that fewer than one in four voters say they trust the Labour leader to run the economy. Mr Miliband’s support has dropped 10 points since January to 23 per cent while 21 per cent said the Budget had reduced their trust in his ability to manage the economy. Mr Miliband polls even worse than his party with 31 per cent of voters backing Labour to run UK Plc. The telephone survey of 1,600 voters after the Budget by public affairs firm Edelman found that 37 per cent trust the Tories and 23 per cent said the Budget had increased their trust in Conservatives to manage the economy. The data came amid growing disquiet among Labour MPs that Mr Miliband and shadow Chancellor Ed Balls have now botched their response to the Budget and George Osborne’s Autumn Statement last December. There were also signs of tension between the two men yesterday after Mr Balls said Mr Miliband had a ‘difficult’ time because he relied on Twitter to predict the contents of the Budget and revealed that he had spent much of Mr Osborne’s speech trying to wake up Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. An ally of Ed Miliband told the Mail: ‘We always knew it was going to be a difficult Budget with the economy on the turn. It was not made easier by Ed Balls.’ Another said ‘the problem’ for Labour is that ‘we don’t have a strong enough economic policy’ - a barely coded jibe at Mr Balls. Friends of the shadow chancellor claimed he wanted to go further in contesting the Budget but was overruled by Mr Miliband, who used well-worn attacks on Mr Cameron’s Etonian background and membership of the Oxford University Bullingdon Club rather than respond to the Chancellor’s announcements in his speech. Support for Mr Miliband pictured during a visit to the Rosyth Dockyard, Dunfermline, has dropped 10 points since January to 23 per cent while 21 per cent said the Budget had reduced their trust in his ability to manage the economy . A Labour MP summed up mood of frustration about Mr Miliband’s performance on the backbenches: ‘The best you can say is that it was better than Ed Balls’ awful speech after the last Autumn Statement. I’ve no idea why he didn’t talk about anything that was actually in the Budget.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it seemed as if Mr Miliband had been “thinking about the football for an hour” instead of listening to what Mr Osborne was saying. Former Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne said: ‘His speech was the worst speech I have ever seen in the House of Commons.’ ‘I want to have an intelligent critique of the budget and the state of the public finances, rather than lots of shouting about which clubs at Oxford University he did or did not belong to, and which ones David Cameron didn’t do. ‘I think it was demeaning for British politics. It is important for the health of our democracy that we have an official opposition that has an economic policy, and there was no evidence of that yesterday.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell added: ‘The real significance is that you’ve got a leader of the opposition who wants to run the country but he is pretty vacuous when it comes to economics.’","Fewer than one in four voters say they trust Labour leader to run economy .

The family of a British man who died in a jet ski accident in Thailand are having to raise £30,000 to bring his body home. Stephen Campbell, 38, from Blackpool, Lancashire, died in the tragic accident off Larn Island, in the east coast resort of Pattaya, on Wednesday. Unfortunately, Mr Cambell's insurance will not cover the costs of bringing him home - and now his family are desperately trying to raise the money. A Facebook page set up by the barber's family read: 'Unfortunately the insurance does not cover him and the process of repatriation is proving to be expensive and in excess of 30k. 'We desperately want to lay him to rest and bring him home to Blackpool.... 'So...we are asking for a little bit of help to bring him home' Mr Campbell, who owned a barber shop, was on a three week holiday when the accident happened. He was due to return home in a week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The grandmother of a five-year-old girl, who died after taking a mix of pills found at the home of one of her drug-addict mother's friends, has spoken of her heartbreak. Ashton-Lynette Arnold had been raised by her grandmother, Stacy Molinelli, for the first two years of her life as her mother, Elizabeth Rydbom battle with drug addiction. But, for the last three years of her all-too-short life, Ashton was in her mother's care while her devoted grandmother watched helplessly as the tragic steps to her death unfolded. Heart-broken: Stacy Molinelli looks at photos of her granddaughter Ashton, who died after swallowing pills . Tragic: Ashton-Lynette Arnold, who was known to child welfare agencies, died from a drug overdose . Ms Molinelli told the Miami Herald the Department of Children and Families said it would be futile for her to try to apply to be Ashton's legal guardian. She had been caring for her grandchild after the girl's mother suddenly walked out on Ashton when she was just a few months old. This meant the grandmother was left in a custody limbo, caring for the little girl whenever her mother decided to disappear. 'When . Ashton was with me, she was taken care of. She was safe,' Ms Molinelli . said. 'There were times I would see Elizabeth when she had the baby and . she was so high she didn’t know the day of the week. And somehow DCF . thought she was stable enough to care for a child.' The department had investigated Ashton's welfare several times during her short life. Her mother had, according to a DCF report, a 'major problem' with meth and twice tested positive for narcotics. Prison: Ashton's mother Elizabeth Rydbom, left, and her mother's girlfriend, Kimberly Alderman, right, were sentenced to two years for child neglect. They were the girl's caregivers at the time of her death . Charges: Valerie Davenport, left, and Julianne Goldsmith, right, were also sent to prison over Ashton's death. The little girl had taken drugs found at the women's home, where police later found nearly 3,000 pills . Drug treatment was offered but the department never confirmed whether Rydbom took it. 'DCF has been in Ashton's life almost since she was born. They investigated, but they never followed up,' Ms Molinelli told the Miami Herald. 'Had they followed up, had they spent any time on this case, they would have seen that my daughter was a full-blown addict.' Ms Molinelli described watching helplessly as her granddaughter was dragged from place to place in the last three years of her life. Ultimately, it was while at the house of her mother's friends, that the little girl somehow took a fatal cocktail of pills. Four people, including Rydnom and her partner Kimberly Alderman, were charged in connection with Ashton's death. Memorial: Heart-shaped lanterns are set adrift by Stacy Molinelli, right, and her son, Donovan, in memory of Ashton . Cut short: Stacy Molinelli is heartbroken that her granddaughter never got the chance to see more of life . Her mother was accused of failing to raise the alarm as soon as she realized her child was seriously ill. The CPT reported a two-hour delay in seeking medical help for the child. When police searched the house the girl had been staying at, they found nearly 3,000 pills. Rydbom, Alderman, Valerie Davenport and Julianne Goldsmith, of Inglis near the Gulf Coast, were sentenced to two years in prison for child neglect. An autopsy showed Ashton had . diphenhydramine, morphine and amphetamine in her system. A team that investigates neglect cases also ruled that her death could have been prevented. 'The mother . readily allowed her child to stay in her friend’s home several times a . week, knowing the home was filthy and that pills were everywhere and . readily accessible to the child,' the team said. For Ms Molinelli, all she is left with are memories of the child she helped to raise, and a sense that more could have been done to save her. 'I . think about all the things she is not going to be able to do. She is . never going to have that first kiss. She is never going to graduate from . high school,' she said. 'She is never going to dress up and go to the . prom, have babies of her own, go to college and make something wonderful . of herself.'","Ashton-Lynette Arnold died after taking a cocktail of pills found at house her mom was staying in .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . 'Birdman' Steve Elkins faces ruin after unsuccessfully suing the organisers of the Worthing International Birdman Competition . A birdman who was inches from winning a £30,000 prize in a contest to fly 100 metres faces ruin after unsuccessfully suing the organisers. Hang-glider designer Steve Elkins, 51, of Hope, Derbyshire, claimed to have flown the required distance from Worthing Pier in West Sussex during the annual birdman contest in 2009. But organisers Worthing Town Centre Initiative said he was short by 14cm – less than 6in – and denied him the prize. Judge Jonathan Simpkiss ruled at Brighton County Court that they had been correct not to pay out and ordered Mr Elkins to pay WTCI’s £60,000 court costs – £20,000 of it within 28 days. 'I'm quite surprised and quite shocked,’ Mr Elkins said. ‘I have been a fool in some ways.’ WTCI said it had to fight the case or it would not be able to get insurance for the prize, putting the event in jeopardy. The dispute has been ongoing since 2009 when Steve claimed to have flown the 100 metre distance required to claim the prize at the Worthing International Birdman competition. The organisers claimed he was 14 centimetres short and ruled his flight was 99.86 metres. The total cost of TCI's legal fees was £60,000, made up of solicitor and QC costs and expert witness costs. Sharon Clarke, manager of the TCI said: 'We are certainly not rejoicing, it's been a torrid time for all of us. 'Mr Elkins chose to take these actions and he should have been aware of the implications.' Judge Simpkiss said: 'It's one of those things that's happened that would have been much better if it hadn't.'

"By . Simon Cable . With a hefty £1bn price tag, the BBC’s new hi-tech headquarters certainly haven’t compromised on comfort or style. But just 18 months after opening, Corporation bosses have now demanded a costly EastEnders-themed makeover of their central London offices because they claim they are ‘not inspiring enough’. Just weeks after announcing the closure of youth station BBC3, bosses are now spending tens of thousands of pounds re-vamping the sixth and seventh floors of New Broadcasting House with a design based around the popular BBC soap. Re-vamp: Tens of thousands of pounds will be spent on transforming floors 6 and 7 into EastEnders-themed . The new plans, the brainchild of the BBC’s director of television, Danny Cohen, will include an ‘Albert Square’ hot-desking area, with iron railings around it and a Queen Vic-themed meeting room. The 6th floor is being given a ‘Welcome to TV’ theme and is believed to be centred on the most famous characters from BBC shows. Carpets are being torn up while ‘street scape art’ featuring well-known landmarks from the BBC soap is also being installed. A committee put together by Cohen decided that the new themed areas are essential to giving the offices ‘a unique sense of identity’. BBC worker Emma Saunders, who works in arts and entertainment, has written to Ariel, the BBC’s in-house magazine, to complain about the huge cost of the makeover. Corporation bosses have been blasted for the expenditure weeks after announcing the closure of BBC . A hot-desking area will be in the style of Albert Square, the fictional centre of town in EastEnders . She wrote: ‘Can I ask why some of the carpets have been replaced in NBH only 18 months after we moved into the new building? ‘I think many of us would rather have a modest pay rise than be dazzled by a new garish carpet as we step out of the lift.’ However, bosses at the BBC defended the . move, saying the re-vamp was ‘necessary’ after BBC creatives complained . that the 6th and 7th floors was ‘not inspiring’. The news comes the same week W1A premiered, a satire parodying the Corporation's bosses as ditsy . Claire Dresser, the chief adviser for BBC Television, replied: ‘Following Television’s move to NBH last year, there was strong feedback from staff that the sixth and seventh floors did not feel like creative spaces and lacked character. ‘In response, Danny Cohen asked for volunteers from Television staff to join a committee to come up with plans - at a reasonable cost - to make the spaces more creative and vibrant. 'The changes you are now seeing with TV branding, images and props are the ideas this volunteer group from all levels of Television have devised and agreed to. ‘Once the work is completed in the next month, the sixth floor will have a ‘Welcome to Television’ theme and the seventh floor will have the feel of an outside street scape. ‘The committee also made the decision to change the flooring to give these areas a unique sense of identity and the previous carpet is being re-used elsewhere in the building. ‘The railings around the hot-desking area on the seventh floor will be part of ‘Albert Square’ with the outside of the meeting room branded as the ‘Queen Vic’. ‘We want to make our space feel inspiring and creative - a home for BBC Television that reflects our ambitions as the very best broadcaster and producer in the world.’ New Broadcasting House was officially opened by the Queen in June last year, four years behind schedule and £55 million over budget. It was earlier this month that BBC bosses announced it was closing youth channel BBC Three from 2015 in a cost-cutting measure.

"By . William Turvill . Daniel Lee Thomas has been fined £400 for taking his first ever selfie from the public gallery of a crown court - and then posting it on Facebook . A man has been fined £400 for taking his first ever selfie from the public gallery of a crown court and then posting it on Facebook. Daniel Lee Thomas, 28, from Connah’s Quay, North Wales, was prosecuted for taking a publishing and photograph of a judge and other parties at Mold Crown Court. At Flintshire magistrates’ court in Mold, the apprentice joiner pleaded guilty and was fined £400 with £105 costs. It was ruled, though, that his iPhone - which was seized by police - should be returned to him. The court heard that Thomas, described as a colourful character with previous convictions, decided to take the photo because it was the first time he had been in a crown court - when he was not the defendant himself. Magistrates told him it had been ‘a silly misdemeanour’, pointing out there were plenty of signs in the building telling people not to take photographs and it was a well known rule that they should not be taken inside court. They warned him that he could have been fined up to £2,000. The photograph of Judge Peter Heywood, a Swansea-based judge sitting at Mold Crown Court on January 31, was reported to police by court officials following a complaint by someone else in court. Prosecutor Helen Tench said: ‘He attended court as an interested party and took a photograph on his mobile phone. It was subsequently published on the Facebook social media site. ‘It came to light because another interested party made a complaint to the court about it. It was investigated by members of staff.’ Police went to his home, seized the phone and found the offending photograph. Thomas said that he had not seen the signs. ‘He said that he was not aware that it was an offence. ‘Effectively, he did it because it was his first time in court when he was not the defendant himself.’ Gary Harvey, defending, said that his client was a colourful character who had been to court many times. He had not noticed the ‘no photographs’ signs and did not think it was an offence. ‘He took the opportunity to take a selfie complete with the crest of the court and the judge in the background. ‘He put it on Facebook and had no idea how much trouble it would cause him.' Thomas was shocked to have been arrested. ‘He is contrite. He regrets it but will have to pay the penalty,’ said Mr Harvey. Fortunately, he had not been charged with contempt which could have led to imprisonment. Mr Harvey said that there would be no repetition - and said that it would be harsh and disproportionate to deprive him of his expensive iPhone. At Flintshire magistrates' court in Mold, the apprentice joiner pleaded guilty and was fined £400 with £105 costs . Outside court, Thomas said: ‘It was my first ever selfie. ‘I had never been in the public gallery before - it was the first time in court when I was not the defendant.’ He said that he did not know which case was on when he took the photograph. Thomas explained that he had been waiting for three friends to be sentenced after they clambered up on a roof on Deeside and refused to come down. But the judge had refused to sentence them that day before they were appearing via a live television link from prison. ‘I didn’t know it was an offence,’ he said.","Daniel Lee Thomas, 28, from Connah's Way, North Wales, was prosecuted for taking and publishing on Facebook a photograph in Mold Crown Court .

Mulcaire had already resorted to setting up a side project with Goodman to boost his earnings, the former Royal editor claimed, with Mulcaire asking him to line up a move to The Sun in 2006. Earlier today, Coulson’s lawyer Timothy Langdale QC alleged that Goodman’s career was 'in decline' by the time his client became editor of the tabloid. Mr Langdale described Goodman as 'work-shy' and 'out of touch', and said he had been nicknamed 'the Eternal Flame' in the office as he never went out.

"By . Leon Watson . A drunken reveller who was refused a McDonald's after walking to a drive-through has been banned from the road after getting caught driving back in her car. Wendy Simpson was nearly three times over the alcohol limit when police stopped her going back for a late night burger in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. The 25-year-old had initially gone to the fast food outlet on foot following a night out drinking, but she was told she wouldn't be served unless she used the 24-hour drive-through. 'Foolish decision': The McDonald's drive-through in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, where Wendy Simpson was initially turned away from because she was on foot . Simpson, of Northgate, Almondbury, West Yorkshire, admitted making the 'foolish decision' to return to McDonald's in her car. Kirklees Magistrates' Court heard how police stopped Simpson's Vauxhall Corsa on March 8, after they spotted her driving erratically just after 3.30am. They signaled for her to stop after she swerved and hit the kerb. After initially stopping, Simpson drove off again before stopping at a red light. Alex Bozman, prosecuting, said: 'When police spoke with her they detected alcohol on her breath and she was acting in a manner that suggested alcohol had been consumed.” Breath tests revealed that she had 100 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - just under three times the legal limit of 35 microgrammes.

While she was waiting for him to return she decided to go out and get something to eat, Mr Nabi explained. He said: 'She walked to McDonald's but staff refused to serve her. This was because the counter was closed and she couldn't use the 24-hour drive-through unless she was in a vehicle. 'Foolishly she goes home, gets into her vehicle and drives to McDonald's.

"By . Nick Pisa . Amanda Knox has again stressed her innocence - and desire to meet the family of the British student she is accused of murdering. Knox, 26, is being retried for the murder of Meredith Kercher, but is not attending the hearings in Florence, Italy. She is accused of stabbing Ms Kercher to death and sexually assaulting her. Speaking to Italian newspaper La Repubblica as the case reached its closing stages she said: ’I want to speak to them. I want to tell them I had nothing to do with Meredith's death, that I liked her and we were friends. Scroll down for video . Rewording her thoughts: Amanda Knox has clarified an earlier statement where she said she would go on the run if she is convicted of her roommate's murder . Meredith Kercher was sexually assaulted and murdered in 2007 . ‘When I saw them (Kerchers) in court I wanted to speak with them and I asked my lawyers if I could do that. My lawyer approached them but their lawyers rejected it.’ Knox was initially convicted at that trial in 2009, along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 30, but two years ago they were sensationally cleared and freed from jail. The high profile case, which has been marked with controversy, then sparked further headlines last year when that ruling was overturned and the case sent back to trial. Officials switched the hearing from Perugia, where the murder took place seven years ago, to the Florence appeal court where proceedings started in September. Knox has not appeared and explained herself saying: ’It was a really painful decision not to attend the retrial. I wanted to come. I wanted to be present in court. ‘I was put in jail for four years with no proof, but on suppositions.’ Knox added she hoped after being eventually cleared of any involvement it would lead to a meeting with the Kercher family. Support: Kercher's family members (from left to right): Mother Arline, sister Stephanie and brother Lyle, pictured during a news conference in Perugia on October 3, 2011 . She said: ’I know they believe I am the killer of their daughter. They are convinced that I murdered her and so even now it's not the right time to speak with them. ‘That day will come and I hope it will come soon after my innocence has been definitely proved.’ However, she still appeared to be apprehensive over the verdict as she added: ’I have spoken to Raffaele... he is more optimistic than me. If I am convicted then I will be, as they say, on the run.’ Sollecito has made an appearance at the retrial, giving an emotional 15 minute statement proclaiming his innocence and asking the court to ‘give him his life back’. Summing up took place on Thursday and a verdict is expected on January 30, with the Kercher family expected to attend the hearing. Raffaele Sollecito stands in the courtroom ahead of the hearing in the retrial for the murder of Meredith Kercher, in Florence, Italy . Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in Perugia in November 2007. Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, 27, has already been convicted of murder and sexual assault and given 16 years and is eligible for parole next year. When asked about Knox's comments, the Kercher family's lawyer Francesco Maresca said: ’Amanda is the accused. This is the moment of the accused. She should stop her declarations.’ He also confirmed that Meredith's brother, Lyle, and sister, Stephanie, would be in Florence for the verdict. Knox's lawyer, Carlo Della Vedova said: ’Amanda is very worried. She is risking 30 years jail and she knows she is innocent. She is not sleeping at night and is closely watching the trial.’ If she is convicted prosecutors have demanded Knox be jailed for 30 years and would seek her extradition from the United States. However, she is unlikely to return from her home in Seattle, as her legal team will argue that she has in effect already been tried and then cleared before this latest case and would claim double jeopardy. Sollecito, on the other hand, who was in court for Thursday’s hearing and has been spending a considerable amount of time in the Dominican Republic, and who also risks jail, has insisted he will remain in Italy for the verdict.","Knox is currently being retried for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher .

One of the girls freed herself but the other spent an hour trapped before being cut free with hand tools.

One tells the 15-year-old stuck in the swing: 'What I'm going to do is we're going to try and get a box under you, and if you stand on that, we can try and get you out.' The girl's friends are heard swearing and laughing as she says 'ow!' and is lifted onto the box. One says: 'She is actually like full-on stuck.' In other parts of the three-minute video circulating on Facebook, the teenagers are heard encouraging firefighters to use 'some saw s***' to 'just cut her out'. Help!

"By . Emma Glanfield . Janet Tyler, pictured with son Joseph when he was a few months old, claims football star Sol Campbell hasn't seen their son for six and a half years . An ex-girlfriend of former England football star Sol Campbell claims he shows ‘prejudice’ every day because he won’t see their nine-year-old son. Janet Tyler said she feels sorry for the former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur football star because he’s missing out on spending time with young Joseph and urged him to ‘ring or visit’ their son. Mr Campbell caused controversy with the revelation he believed he was overlooked for the England captaincy because of racial prejudice within the FA. Now Ms Tyler has reacted to his comments by making comparisons to the former player's relationship with his estranged son. ‘I feel sorry for him, that’s my biggest emotion. I feel sorry for him that he denies himself the unconditional love that he could have,’ she told BBC Radio 5 Live. However, the footballer, who said in interviews about his new book that it might take him 10 or 20 years to see his son because there’s a lot of ‘anguish and anger’, hit back at the claims. The 39-year-old said: ‘There are two sides to every story. It’s a private thing.’ Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said he had only written one line about his son in his biography because it was a ‘private matter’. He said: ‘It has gone beyond the book now. It is quite disappointing because in the book it only says a few things and this is putting too much on something and giving air-time to someone who is nothing really. ‘It is up to her if she wants to put something on the radio and ring them up and talk to them over the phone.’ Ms Tyler had told BBC Radio Five Live that her son felt ‘the odd one out’ compared to Mr Campbell's other two children. She said: ‘I can’t believe he doesn’t think about Joseph. The fact he has two other children now, surely that taps into him or his feelings . ‘He talks about racial discrimination and I think he practices prejudice every single day because he’s decided which two children are worthy of his love and time and he has another child which isn’t and that to me is the worst kind of prejudice. Footballer Sol Campbell, 39, said in interviews about his new book that he might not see son Joseph for 10 or 20 years because there was a lot of 'anger and anguish' ‘His children’s charity that he does – it’s commendable, fantastic – but it’s hard for Joseph. ‘You’ve got a little boy at home who you don’t bother with and how does he feel when he sees you’re taking strangers somewhere and you’re going on about great you are doing it but yet your own flesh and blood doesn’t have any of those opportunities.’ Ms Tyler also said the football ace hasn’t seen Joseph, who was born in 2004 - two years after the pair met in a restaurant – for six and a half years. She said: ‘He lives 25 miles away from you. He doesn’t live on the other side of the world. You can come and see him, you can ring him up, you can send him a Christmas card. ‘Life is short, time is precious. You will never get these years back. The longer you leave it the harder it’ll be to have a relationship. Janet Tyler, pictured with Joseph when he was a baby, said she wants Sol Campbell to be in their son's life. She said: 'Children need their fathers in their life. He needs him now. If he spent time with Joseph he'd be so proud' ‘Children need their fathers in their life. He needs him now. ‘I want him to see Joseph. I want him to be proud. If he spent time with Joseph he’d be so proud.’ Earlier this month, it emerged Mr Campbell had written in his new authorised biography that he would’ve been England captain if he was white. In the book, which is due to be released later this month, he said: ‘I believe if I was white I would’ve been England captain for more than 10 years. It’s as simple as that. ‘I think the FA wished I was white. I had the credibility, performance-wise, to be captain. I was consistently in the heart of the defence and I was club captain early on in my career. I don’t think it will change because they don’t want it to.’","Janet Tyler claims former England footballer hasn't seen son for six years .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Tristan Chadwick, 36, pictured, has been jailed for two years for stalking and harassing a married female colleague after she ended their affair . A warehouse worker who stalked a married female colleague and threatened to ‘cut up her husband’  after she ended their secret affair has been jailed. Tristan Chadwick, 36, pestered the woman for sex and bombarded her with hundreds of text messages after she spurned his advances in November last year. During a terrifying three-month campaign of harassment he threatened to petrol bomb her house if she did not sleep with him and sent one chilling message warning: ‘If you don’t see me, I’ll cut up your husband.’ A court heard the pair met at a construction firm in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, last summer and at first the office worker was ‘flattered’ by the attention. After Chadwick was made redundant, the pair stayed in touch and even agreed to meet up at a hotel last October. But the woman, who has not been named, decided she wanted to end their relationship in a bid to save her marriage. Chadwick then started to pester her with constant calls and text messages, which became more threatening after she turned him down. The court heard she would wake up in the morning to find hundreds of abusive messages from him on her phone. She became so frightened of Chadwick that she eventually caved in and agreed to sleep with him. But the threats continued and the victim finally confronted him outside his flat, telling him: ‘It’s over. Leave me alone.’ She became so terrified she fled her home in Stoke-on-Trent and went to stay with relatives. Eventually she came clean and told her husband everything and Chadwick was arrested in January. After pleading guilty to stalking at a previous hearing, Chadwick was jailed for two years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday. He was also made subject to a restraining order, banning him from contacting the woman in future after the court heard he had problems with ‘women and rejection’. Tristan Chadwick was jailed for two years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Staffordshire, pictured, for the terrifying three-month campaign of harassment against the married woman . In a victim statement read out in court, she said: ‘The whole situation has left me a nervous wreck. I can’t stop shaking. ‘I’m terrified of going to work. I struggle to eat and sleep because I’m so terrified.’ It also emerged in court that Chadwick, from Stoke-on-Trent, had a history of threatening behaviour towards women. Police had served six separate harassment notices on him in relation to six different women. Defending Catherine O’Relly said: ‘It’s quite clear that he is an individual who has problems with women and rejection. ‘There’s a history of difficulties with previous partners.’ She added that for the first time he had now started to acknowledge his problems.","Tristan Chadwick threatened to petrol bomb her home when affair ended .

"By . Sean Poulter . Smartphones are getting smaller, thinner and cleverer – which probably means it's easier for them slip out of the hand and break, not to mention more expensive to repair or replace. Now a U.S. technology firm claims to have invented two different 'skins' for smartphones to make them nigh-on indestructible. One is a moisture-proof coating, meaning you could effectively take your phone into the shower. And it wouldn't be the end of the world if you dropped it in the sink. A U.S. technology firm claims to have invented two different 'skins' for smartphones to make them nigh-on indestructible . The other skin acts as a shock-absorber, which claims to protect the phone from getting damaged and the screen from shattering when dropped. Until now desperate owners of smartphones such as iPhones and Samsung Galaxies, have come up with DIY methods to avoid repair or replacement costs, for example putting a drenched phone in a bag of dry rice in an airing cupboard for several days to draw out the moisture. Meanwhile repairing a cracked screen on a smartphone requires specialist tools, meaning it has to be sent back to the manufacturer, which can be very expensive. Now users in the U.S. can have Liquipel's Watersafe coating applied to their smartphones. The process involves the phone being placed in a vacuum chamber where it is  surrounded by a gas which enters every nook and cranny before solidifying to form an invisible moisture-proof coating of nano-particles. Until now desperate owners of smartphones such as iPhones and Samsung Galaxies, have come up with DIY methods to avoid repair or replacement costs . The firm is looking for partners to offer the same service in other parts of the world. And Liquipel's shock-absorber skins, which resemble a thin piece of clear plastic, disseminate the force of any impact, protecting the phone's inside and screen from breaking. The benefits were demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, where mobile phones were submerged in water and hit with a half-pound steel ball – and survived. U.S. pop star Pharrell was present to promote the products and admitted he has suffered mishaps with his smartphone in the past and had tried DIY techniques of salvaging it. He said: 'You go to the old wives' tales of putting it in rice or on the refrigerator. You can do that but it's not a 100 per cent guarantee.' Some manufacturers and retailers in the U.S. and other countries, such as Turkey, are now selling smartphones and tablets with the Liquipel Watersafe coating already applied. In the US it costs around £40 to have the coating applied. The skins are on sale on the internet for around £17 each.","U.S. technology firm claims to have invented two different 'skins'

"By . Luke Garratt . Christopher Hines-Randle, 54, from West Cornwall, who has been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment at Truro Crown court for having a home made bomb he planned to use to distract police while he made his way through a 'kill list' A spurned husband, who planned to kill his wife and mother-in-law 'slowly and painfully' after diverting and distracting the police with a series of homemade bomb blasts, has today been jailed for 12 years. Christopher Hines-Randle, 54, from Cornwall made a 'hit-list' following the downfall of his marriage, which in addition to his former spouse and her mother also included a psychiatrist, a social worker and a GP. Hines-Randle, a former tin miner, had experience with explosives and gathered the bomb components over time and had planned to set them off as a decoy for the police while he carried out the murders. He had told a friend that he wanted to inflict a 'slow and painful death' on his ex-wife Sharon, her mother Sandra Martin, and the other targets on his kill list while the police were distracted. His plan was foiled when the friend told the police, who found him in his car with a biscuit tin full of bomb parts. While he had been collecting parts to build the explosives, Judge Christopher Harvey Clark QC dismissed claims that Hines-Randle was a 'mere fantasist' who was unable to build a real bomb. At Truro Crown Court, he said: 'You are a resourceful man who in my judgement would have been able sooner or later to complete the finished article.' Philip Lee, prosecuting, said Hines-Randle, a father-of-two, had been bitter and angry after his marriage broke down and had taken to sleeping rough in his car. His resentment was directed towards his ex-wife and mother of their two children, her mother, Dr Jon Doe, a Cornwall-based child psychiatrist, and social worker Debbie Tully, who had been involved with the family. Police started investigating Hines-Randle when his friend Adrian Richards warned them about his deteriorating state of mind. A Royal Navy bomb disposal team had to deploy a robot to investigate the suspicious package at the Truro Business Park where Hines-Randle's car was found, along with a biscuit tin full of bomb components . Mr Richards told officers that over the course of several conversations Hines-Randle asked him for cooling packs from first aid kits at his workplace. Mr Lee said: 'During their conversation the defendant asked again about the cool packs. When asked why he said they were for making an explosive device.' Mr Lee said Hines-Randle had some knowledge of explosives from when he worked at the South Crofty Mine in Cornwall. He added: 'He went on to tell Mr Richards that he intended to use the explosives to create a diversion in Truro and Penzance in order to divert police attention to these areas and away from St Austell. 'When Mr Richards asked who was in his hit list, he said there were six people and named four of them as his wife Sharon, her mother, Dr Doe and Debbie Tully. 'He said that he had followed Dr Doe home and knew where he lived and that he had followed Debbie Tully but hadn’t yet found her home. Hines-Randle was arrested on the scene, and later plead guilty to the murderous plot to kill his ex-wife, mother-in-law, and two others 'slowly and painfully' 'When asked: ‘You’re not thinking of doing the kids are you?’, he did not reply.' When questioned about what he intended to do to his victims, Mr Lee said Hines-Randle said that Debbie Tully, his ex-wife and her mother were all going to have a 'slow and painful death because they have made me suffer for two years'. The court heard that following the warnings from Mr Richards police found Hines-Randle sleeping in his car and arrested him in the early hours of 6.25am of June 21 last year. Officers found a biscuit tin in the passenger seat footwell which contained items. including gunpowder, which they believed could be used for a bomb. Police sealed off Threemilestone Industrial Estate in Truro and bomb disposal specialist officers attended the scene to make sure the items were safe for examination. Royal Navy officers were also called to the scene where they deployed a remote control bomb disposal robot in order to safely examine the area. Hines-Randle pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to charges of making threats to kill, having an explosive device with intent to endanger life and having an explosive substance under suspicious circumstances. Emergency services waited at the scene where the suspicious package was found at the Truro Business Park. Hines-Randle had always intended to build the bomb in order to distract the police for long enough to carry out murders, but the judge claimed he was a 'mere fantasist' who was unable to build a real bomb . Jeremy Leaning, defending, claimed his threats were a fantasy and that the items found in his car proved that he had not made a viable device. He said: 'This was a plan he firmly maintains he would not have carried through.' Judge Clark jailed Hines-Randle and gave him a restraining order which says he is not to contact his ex-wife, her mother, Dr Doe, Ms Tully, his two children or Mr Richards. Detective Constable Andy Whittle, senior investigating officer, said afterwards: 'Hines-Randle was a very dangerous man and if his plans had been allowed to continue, people’s lives would have been put at serious risk. 'The victims involved in this case have had the stress and fear of Hines-Randle hanging over them for several months, especially his ex-wife and mother-in-law who have had to live with his threats for some considerable time. 'I hope that the substantial prison sentence that has been passed by the judge today gives them some comfort and allows them to get on with their lives.'","Cornwall father-of-two jailed for 12 years for his plot to kill a 'hit-list'

"By . Carol Driver . PUBLISHED: . 10:34 EST, 13 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:46 EST, 17 March 2014 . A ski company is offering to pay fines of up to £700 to parents taking their children on holiday during term time. MountainBase is advertising its skiing breaks in Morzine, in the French Alps, along with the slogan: 'Are schools in the UK taking the PISTE?' It adds on its Facebook page: ‘We think so. Especially with record snow levels across Morzine and yet more snow due to land in the next few days to provide excellent piste conditions. Ski trip: Families face fines of up to £2,500 for taking children on holiday during term time . Offer: MountainBase promises on its Facebook page to pay fines issued to parents taking children on a ski holiday . Why can't you take your child on holiday in term time?Many schools used to give pupils authorised absences of up to ten days during term time.But in September Education Secretary Michael Gove banned the allowance in all but ‘exceptional circumstances’. A maximum fine of £60 per pupil per parent can now be charged, rising to £120 if not paid within seven days. Refusal to pay can mean a fine of up to £2,500 and up to three years' jail. Why do holiday firms increase prices?Travel . companies insist they are responding to demand. They make more money . when demand peaks in the six-week summer holiday, which offsets smaller . margins in low season. They claim they trying to cap charges during school holidays will push up prices year round. ‘So we have a special offer... Book a week with children at MountainBase/Inferno we will if you receive a fine from your school/local authority pay the fine on copy of a receipt from yourselves. 'This is based on any booking in March/April except the free ski pass option.’ MountainBase owner Lee Quince defended the controversial deal. Asked on BBC Radio 5 if he was being 'irresponsible', he said: ‘Yes, in one way but also the law has changed to specifically address truancy, especially in the wake of the riots. ‘In some sense that's affecting people who are not in that set, it's a law change not destined for themselves. They're doing an activity they're not able to do in the UK.’ It comes as figures reveal a 70 per cent rise from 2012 to 2013 in the number of parents issued with fines for taking their children on holiday during school term time. New regulations were introduced by the government last September, stopping schools from allowing children 10 days a year leave for family breaks in ‘special circumstances’. A maximum fine of £60 per pupil per parent can now be charged, rising to £120 if not paid within seven days. Refusal to pay can mean a fine of up to £2,500 and up to three years in jail. A debate was held in parliament in February, after 170,000 signed a petition for action over the high prices of going away during school holidays. A family holiday during half-terms can be twice as expensive as the week before. Mr Quince said his company, which offers all-inclusive holidays starting at £199 per person in the off-peak season, said it is forced to put its prices up by almost 50 per cent during the peak season. Controversial campaign: MountainBase included this image with its announcement on its Facebook page . Social deal: MountainBase has 1,890 followers on its Facebook page, where it made the pledge . ‘People accuse us of ripping families off by charging higher prices during school holidays but we are actually just balancing our books because we can't fill the spaces outside of the half-term holidays,’ he said. He added that the company had accounted for possibly having to pay the £700 fines: ‘We've balanced it in our figures.’ The company director said it was up to parents to decide whether to take the risk of taking their children out of school during term-time. He added: ‘Parents know the situation at the time and whether or not their children are doing well in school. ‘We are offering something (skiing) that is only available at certain times of the year. Also it is a sporting holiday and not just sitting on the beach. ‘The whole change regarding term-time holidays, which was aimed at tackling the problem of truancy, has directly affected families who want to take their children on holiday but cannot afford to go because prices are so expensive during school holidays. ‘In the UK everybody goes on holiday at exactly the same time and from a business perspective it means that you only get your children and family bookings in half-term holidays and it doesn't get balanced out across the rest of our season.’ Mr Quince added: ‘Skiing is a skill children can learn and develop. As a country we don't do particularly well investing in sport and the Olympics. It's fallen by a wayside a bit.’","MountainBase advertised controversial campaign on its Facebook page .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Iain Harrison confessed to the attempted murder of his terminally ill mother. He told his psychiatrist two years after Hope Harrison, 74, died he had smothered her - and had been consumed with guilt ever since . A man has avoided jail after he tried to murder his terminally ill mother by smothering her with a pillow in an act of attempted euthanasia. Iain Harrison, 50, from Weymouth, Dorset, pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of 74-year-old Hope Harrison. A court heard how Mrs Harrison had been diagnosed with lung cancer and . was admitted to the Dorset County Hospital, Dorchester, in March 2011 . when her condition worsened. Mrs Harrison died on April 2. Doctors assumed . she had passed away naturally and her death . certificate recorded the cause as a small valve obstruction and cancer. However, two years later Harrison confessed to a psychiatrist he had smothered his mother and he had been 'consumed with guilt after killing his mother by suffocating her' ever since. The police were called in and Mr Harrison . was charged with attempted murder as there was no medical evidence that . he actually caused her death, despite his admission. He was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court to a two-year prison term, suspended for 18 months, today. The court heard how, on 29 March 2011, Mrs Harrison, whose cancer had spread and was in a great deal of pain, was admitted to hospital and was expected to die within a couple of days. Seeing her suffering in pain, Mr . Harrison asked a nurse if there was anything they ‘could do’ for her and . was told they could only make her comfortable. The nurse made a note of his request in the log at 8pm on April 2, 2011. Mrs Harrison died on the same evening. Following her death Harrison became depressed and attempted to commit suicide. He also had professional help from a psychiatrist - to whom he made his confession. John Locke, senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wessex, told the court how, although it could not be proven Harrison had killed his mother, his confession was enough for a prosecution. He said: 'This is a very sad case, where a son admitted carrying out an act that amounted to the attempted murder of his terminally ill mother because he could not bear seeing her suffering. 'As distressing as it is to see a loved one suffering and dying from cancer or a terminal illness, it is not for a person to decide when someone should die. Euthanasia is effectively murder and murder is a crime. 'The court heard how Hope Harrison, 74, was diagnosed with lung cancer in late 2010 and that the prognosis was that she had not long to live. 'On March 29 2011 she was admitted to Dorset County Hospital after her condition worsened. Her cancer had spread elsewhere in her body and she was in great pain. Mrs Harrison was admitted to Dorset County Hospital, pictured, in March 2011 with only days to live. She died on April 2 - with doctors believing she passed away from natural causes . 'It was felt by her consultant that she would not benefit from surgical intervention; she was to be kept as comfortable as possible as her death was inevitable. 'The nurse in attendance at the time entered in her log book that Mrs Harrison’s 50-year-old son Iain was at her side and asked the nurse to help his mother as she was in great pain. Mrs Harrison was given morphine and midazolam. 'Mr Harrison asked the nurse if there was anything he could do, and the nurse told him that they could only make her comfortable and the only thing he needed to do was to be on her side when she eventually passed away. Mrs Harrison died on the evening of April 2 2011. 'Mr Harrison started to see a psychiatrist as following the death of his mother he suffered from depression. 'On two occasions he tried to commit suicide and he seriously injured himself by jumping from the window of his fourth floor flat. On February 21 2013 he confessed to this psychiatrist he was consumed with guilt after killing his mother by suffocating her. 'He then called the police who arrested him. He made the same confession to the police after declining to have a solicitor. 'After a careful and thorough review of all the evidence in this case, I decided that there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to charge Mr Harrison with an offence of attempted murder, an offence that he pleaded guilty to on February 21 2014. 'Mrs Harrison’s consultant said that her death was inevitable and it was therefore not possible for the prosecution to prove that her son had actually killed her. 'However it was possible to prove that he attempted to do so, based on his own admission.'","Iain Harrison, 50, pleaded guilty to attempted murder of his mother Hope .

"By . Amanda Williams . Mother-of-ten Emma Green launched a tirade of homophobic abuse at her son Scott when he told her he was in a relationship with another man . A mother-of-ten punched her oldest son in the face in front of police officers, after he came out as gay at a family party. Emma Green, 37, launched a tirade of homophobic abuse at her son Scott when he told her he was in a relationship with another man. The family party then descended into a chaotic brawl and Green - who called her son a 'dirty queer' - punched him in the face in front of police officers who had been called. Green was ordered to pay £100 to her son and was fined £200, at Perth Sheriff Court. She admitted carrying out an assault aggravated by sexual prejudice outside the family home in Ross Street, Kinross. Fiscal depute Lisa Marshall told the court: 'The complainer is the accused’s son who had recently disclosed to friends and family that he was in a relationship with another male. 'This caused friction in the family and particularly with the accused. On the Saturday evening there was a gathering at the Ross Street property. 'The accused, the complainer and various other people were in attendance. Drink was taken and over the course of the evening she was calling her son a p**f and a gay b******. 'The complainer ended up in the street being arrested by police in connection with an assault matter. As he was being arrested the accused approached her son and punched him to the head.' She then continued to verbally abuse her son as police told her she was under arrest. She replied ‘I’m homophobic. I don’t care - I hate the little gay b*****d.’” Solicitor John Adams, defending, said: 'My client is 37 and a mother of ten children. The complainer is the eldest son and this incident came about when the family had been at a party together. 'Her son had been acting up against other members of the family and associates of the family. They were all taking alcohol and there was an incident with her son. 'She took umbrage at his actions and reacted in anger. She certainly isn’t proud of her actions. She was motivated by his sexual orientation. Scott Green and his mother Emma in happier times. The family party then descended into a chaotic brawl and Green, who called her son a 'dirty queer', punched him in the face in front of police officers who had been called . 'But the position in the report suggests she has reacted more in anger. That has not got a bearing on their relationship now. There is no ongoing ill-feeling between them. 'She moved to Scotland in 2010 and this is her first time before a court. She is in receipt of benefits and is responsible for a number of children.' Sheriff Lindsay Foulis noted that the assault allegations against Scott Green were dropped by the Crown after the witnesses failed to give evidence against him at a trial. He said: 'It is an inter-familial assault. If she hadn’t been so stupid as to strike her son when he was being held by police officers, nine times out of ten this wouldn’t have seen the light of day. 'You can’t act in this way and it was added to by the fact it was prejudiced.'","Mother-of-ten Emma Green launched a tirade of abuse at son Scott .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Television host Larry King looks set to relive one of the most embarrassing episodes of his career with the publication of a new book that details his criminal past. The biography of King's one-time friend Louis E. Wolfson tells the story of how the pair fell out spectacularly over a bad debt with Wolfson having King arrested for Grand Larceny and almost succeeding in destroying his career. The book, written by Wolfson's daughter Marcia and Harry Hurt III who also penned a biography of Donald Trump, is currently being pitched to publishers. Shamed: Larry King is seen in his 1971 police mugshot following his arrest for Grand Larceny . Wolfson, a Wall Street financier who had become a millionaire by the age of 28, suffered a dramatic fall from grace when he was convicted of 19 counts of conspiracy and illegal stock sales in 1967. On his release he filed a complaint against King, then working as a Miami radio host, accusing him of stealing $5,000 from a $25,000 payment to New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. Wolfson had apparently given King the money to pay Mitchell's firm in a bid to buy influence in government. All in the past: King, pictured this week with his wife Shawn. His 1971 arrest and subsequent sacking almost  ended his career . King reportedly kept the money because he needed to pay off creditors, later admitting to Wolfson what he had done. Hurt told the website Pagesix.com: 'King was the bag man who kept the contents of the bag.' After four years out of the media industry, King managed to resurrect his career to become one of the best known faces on television . When Wolfson was serving his sentence at a minimum-security prison King started to repay the money but soon fell behind. When he was released from prison in 1971, Wolfson was out for revenge against his old friend. King . was arrested after being accused of grand larceny. He eventually pleaded no contest to one count of passing a bad check, although the statute of limitations ran out. Wolfson succeeded in getting King fired from his job at the Miami TV . station WTVY, by claiming that he was a 'menace to the public'. He also suggested the station pay for King's 'treatment in a mental . institution for six months so he can do no further harm in this . community or any other.' The scandal almost destroyed King's career and he was forced to take a job as a racehorse announcer. It wasn't until four years later that he was offered a job at Miami's WiOD radio station and got his life back on track. Wolfson, who went on to breed racehorses, died in 2007 at age 95. Wolfson's daughter Marcia said she hoped King would grant an interview for the book, telling Pagesix: 'We get along. We’re not on bad terms at all.'","New revealing biography of King's one-time friend Louis E. Wolfson .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Chris Christie started the week as America's most admired politician, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. He will finish it either as an electoral has-been, or as a Republican presidential front-runner with a reinforced reputation for integrity and a no-nonsense management style. Or in other words, GOP observers suggest, everything President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lack. 'Christie showed some balls in firing his deputy chief of staff and his campaign manager,' a Republican election consultant told MailOnline, referring to long-time Christie confidantes Bridget Kelly and Bill Stepien. 'We're still waiting for Obama to fire someone over the IRS tea-party scandal,' he said. 'And Benghazi. And the Justice Department's habit of snooping on reporters.' Tea Party Patriots, a conservative group, drew much the same conclusion – although its members say Christie's positions on immigration and other hot-button issues place him closer to the political center than they'd like a president to be. Brash: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured Thursday, offered dozens of apologies for his staff's behavior, but not before firing two of his closest advisers -- a move that could endear him to Republicans accustomed to seeing government officials misbehave without consequences . Heads won't roll: Republican strategists contrast Christie's willingness to fire dishonest underlings with President Obama and Hillary Clinton's habit of protecting their staffers accused of misconduct . Sticking around: Conservatives called on President Obama to sack Eric Holder after his Justice Department was caught snooping on journalists in 2013, but the U.S. Attorney General is still in his cabinet-level job . 'Abuse of power by government officials is wrong, whether it's closing lanes in Fort Lee, using the IRS to target political opponents, or waiving the law regarding Obamacare,' the right-wing group's national coordinator, Jenny Beth Martin, said in a statement. 'Today, Gov. Christie held some subordinates accountable. Time will tell whether this is enough. We're still waiting for President Obama to hold anyone accountable.' While many Republicans see Obama and Clinton as political bullies, New Jerseyans loyal to the governor with a personality to match their state's more enduring stereotypes bristle when they hear that label applied to their man. So does Christie. 'I am who I am, but I am not a bully,' he told reporters on Thursday, as he announced that his axe had fallen on the necks of two long-time members of his inner circle. 'Politics ain't bean bag, OK? And everybody in the country who engages in politics knows that. On the other hand, that's very, very different than saying that, you know, someone's a bully. ... I am not a focus-group tested, blow- dried candidate or governor.Now, that has always made some people, as you know, uneasy. Some people like that style, some people don't.' If Christie survives the 'Bridgegate' scandal, sparked by his aides' use of the George Washington Bridge on-ramps to punish a political adversary with unrelenting car traffic, he could face Hillary Clinton in a 2016 presidential contest. That, said a veteran Republican fundraiser, would set up a favorable comparison for the New Jersey governor. Resigned: Port Authority official David Wildstein left his job in December after the 'bridgegate' scandal began to heat up. He refused to testify in a state assembly hearing on Thursday, earning a contempt citation from lawmakers . IRS official Lois Lerner took the Fifth before Congress in a hearing about politically targeting right-wing groups, but she kept her job -- and her pension once she 'retired' -- in the Obama administration . 'Can you imagine Hillary coming to the press and saying she fired the State Department employees who doctored the CIA's Benghazi talking points? And apologizing publicly? I can't,' he said. Canned: Christie Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly got the axe, the governor said, for lying to him about a plot to snarl traffic in the town of Fort Lee as revenge against the mayor . 'This whole thing will help him in the . long run, not hurt him,' said the operative, who once raised money for . the ill-fated campaign of Clinton's 2000 Senate challenger, Rick Lazio. 'After eight years of President Obama, this guy is a breath of fresh air. Even the tea partiers have to recognize that.' And firing two of his closest advisers could be a move that endears him to Republicans accustomed to seeing government officials misbehave without consequences . Christie himself was all apologies on Thursday, offering his mea culpas more than 30 times during a 90-minute press conference. Turning a New Jersey town's streets into a parking lot as part of a political vendetta, he admitted, 'was an awful, callous, indifferent thing to do. ... And that's why I apologized to the people of New Jersey today and why I apologized specifically to the people of Fort Lee who were inconvenienced over those four days.It's not right, and that's why I'm here apologizing.' Diagnoses of Christie's political future have been decidedly mixed as his administration becomes more and more weighed down by the controversy. One New York Times reporter's analysis concluded that 'the timing of the blossoming scandal is dreadful' for Christie, 'disrupting a highly anticipated plan to present the popular governor to the national electorate as a no-nonsense, bipartisan balm to a deeply divided federal government.' And NBC News reporter Mike O'Brien opined Thursday morning that that Christie's credibility and his reputation as a bipartisan solution-seeker will be unrecoverable after the dust settles. 'If the Christie administration sought to punish a Democrat for being uncooperative, it necessarily becomes harder for Christie to paint a rosy picture about his relationship with Democrats,' he wrote. Hours later, O'Brien tweeted that 'the early reax [reaction] among the GOP consultant class' has been that 'Christie did well today (on balance) ... But his story had damn well better hold up.' New Jersey state Democratic chairman John Currie hinted that Christie isn't yet out of the woods. 'I suggest the governor try a new approach when answering questions: honesty,' he told reporters. But behind the scenes, Republicans are betting that Christie will weather the storm. Some are  suggesting the episode will give Americans who don't live in New Jersey someone to root for. Bill Stepien (L) was Thursday's second 'bridgegate' casualty. The former Christie campaign manager lost a chance to chair the New Jersey Republican Party and a lucrative contract with the Christie-led Republican Governors Association . Bridge to nowhere: Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich is suddenly a household name after Christie aides turned his town's George Washington Bridge on-ramps into a giant traffic bottleneck as a form of retribution for not endorsing their boss . 'A state issue': The White House said Thursday that it won't weigh in on Gov. Christie's brewing troubles, but that line may change once the presidential season begins . 'It's not too often that Americans get a sense of how politicians will react to a gut-check moment before they have a chance to vote for them,' said a Republican pollster who asked not to be identified. 'For Americans in 49 states, that's what's happening right now. And my own gut tells me that they're going to like it.' David Axelrod, the long-time Democratic strategist and Obama adviser, told The Washington Post that Christie is far from mortally wounded. 'If he deals firmly with the offender, and the trail doesn’t lead directly back to him, my bet is that this will be a, well, bump in the road.' he said. Christie's biggest problem, though, is still the split within the Republican party. Moderates like him, as do liberal-leaning Americans who vote Republican – usually on the basis of a single discordant issue like abortion. But the party's most conservative members still treat him with suspicion. The popular conservative HotAir.com blog mocked Christie for a 'Sgt. Schultz-like apology of “I knew nothing,”' referring to the bumbling guard on the 1960s-era show Hogan's Heroes. 'Obama said the same thing about the IRS targeting tea partiers, of course,' one of the site's leaders wrote. 'To which conservatives replied: That’s no excuse.'","How damaged is Chris Christie? Maybe not at all, say some GOP insiders .
While tea partiers have little patience for the sometimes-conservative Christie, Republicans in general may see his candor as a breath of fresh air .
Conservatives draw comparisons to President Obama, who they say has refused to fire several underlings following their dishonesty in office .
Hillary Clinton, a likely Democratic presidential front-runner, also dodged responsibility for State Department messes including Benghazi, they say .
While Christie's reputation as a bully won't win him liberal converts, his hard-nosed, no-nonsense approach is attractive to many Republicans .
Any advantage he takes from his 'bridgegate' mop-up effort would vanish, however, if it's proven that he knew about the scandal and did nothing ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:52 EST, 18 January 2012 . Some of Greece's most-cherished archaeological sites are to be opened up to advertising firms and other commercial ventures. In a move bound to leave many Greeks and scholars aghast, Greece's culture ministry said it was taking the measure to help with the upkeep of the debt-stricken country's ancient ruins. The ministry said the move was 'a common-sense way' of helping 'facilitate' access to the venues. Much-needed income: Greece's most-cherished archaeological sites, such as the Acropolis in Athens (pictured), are to be opened up to advertising firms and other commercial ventures . The Theatre of Dionysos at the Acropolis. Greece's culture ministry said it was taking the measure to help with the upkeep of the debt-stricken country's ancient ruins . The first site to be opened will be the Acropolis. Archaeologists have for decades slammed such an initiative as sacrilege. But the culture ministry has tried to calm fears by saying that strict conditions will be imposed on anyone wanting to rent the sites. According to a ministerial briefing dating from the end of December, a commercial firm could rent the Acropolis for a professional photographic shoot for as little as 1,600 euros per day. Demonstrators could also rent the ancient landmark. Greece needs every euro it can get. The country's public coffers are drained and the nation is struggling to avoid a historic debt default in March. For rent: The Olympic Stadium in Athens dates back to 566BC. The Greek culture ministry has tried to calm fears by saying that strict conditions will be imposed on anyone wanting to hire the sites . Ruins: The stadium at the archaeological site of Olympia, Greece . Greece was bailed out in May 2010 by the European Union and International Monetary Fund and is in the process of nailing down a second rescue, though it is undergoing tough talks with private creditors to reduce its massive debt mountain. Commercial use of Greece's archaeological sites has until now been the responsibility of the Central Council of Archaeology, which has been very choosy about who gains access. In recent decades, only a select few people, including Greek-Canadian filmmaker Nia Vardalos and the American director Francis Ford Coppola, have been able to use the Acropolis, while most filming and advertising requests have been refused.",The first site to be opened will be the Acropolis .
"By . Joe Ridge . Jose Mourinho has dropped his biggest hint yet that Chelsea will make a summer move to sign Monaco striker Radamel Falcao. The Chelsea manager has made no secret of his desire to bring in a striker in the close season and Colombia star Falcao - currently sidelined with a knee ligament injury - is reportedly considering quitting France after just one year due to the lack of competition in Ligue 1. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Radamel Falcao battling back from injury . The main man: Colombia striker Radamel Falcao signed for Monaco from Atletico Madrid for £50m last summer . It's good to talk: Jose Mourinho was discussing his summer transfer targets on French TV . Crocked: Falcao is taken off an a stretcher last month after injuring his knee ligaments . In an interview in French on Canal Football Club, Mourinho also ruled out a move for Paris Saint-Germain's strike duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani. He said: 'I have a team, but no striker. Falcao does not have a team. A player like him can't play in front of 3,000 people. Monaco is a club to end [your career with].' Falcao, 28, joined Monaco for £50million from Atletico Madrid last summer. At around the same time, Uruguay striker Cavani moved to PSG for £54m. He too is unhappy in France and specifically at having to play second fiddle to Ibrahimovic. But Mourinho moved to quash rumours that Chelsea star Eden Hazard could be used as bait to lure Cavani in a swap deal. 'Eden is our boy,' he added. 'We want him . to stay for 10 years. We want to build the team around him. He’s a . player with the style of football that we want to have in our team.' Rehab: Falcao posted this picture of himself on Instagram as he looks to get himself fit for the World Cup . Going nowhere: Eden Hazard has been a star performer for Mourinho this season . Unsettled: Cavani has often found himself playing out wide for PSG to accommodate Ibrahimovic . Monaco's average attendance of just 9,112 is the second-lowest in France's top flight. On Ibrahimovic, Mourinho added: 'Zlatan to Chelsea? It’s impossible. 'He’s happy at Paris. I know because he is my friend and we are in touch. 'PSG, with all its wealth, would never open the door. That’s mission impossible.' Prize asset: The Chelsea boss is convinced mega-rich PSG will not allow Zlatan Ibrahimovic (right) to leave . Falcao has taken a big step towards featuring in this summer's World Cup after he posted a picture on Instagram showing himself without crutches. The striker was thought to be out of the World Cup but his manager at Monaco, Claudio Ranieri, believes he will be fit in time to feature for Colombia. 'He’s doing well and working hard. His knee is reacting very positively,' said Raniei. 'I think he’ll play at the World Cup.'","Jose Mourinho hints Chelsea will make move to sign Radamel Falcao .

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A severely obese man has told how he managed to lose 300lbs in 18 months after telling himself that he 'deserved better'. Mark Monacelli, 34, from Michigan, developed an unhealthy relationship with food as a child and gradually his 5ft 10in frame came to tip the scales at 480lbs. But desperate to 'get married, settle down and grow old with someone', he revealed to the Huffington Post that in 2012 he took drastic action to turn his life around. Scroll down for video . Dramatic transformation: Mark Monacelli, 34,  managed to lose 300lbs in 18 months and get the woman of his dreams after telling himself that he 'deserved better' - he overhauled his diet and adopted exercise . 'What changed was figuring out that I deserved better,' he said. 'I deserved a life, a family, love, everything I had always hoped and dreamed of growing up.' In a bid to fight the bulge he overhauled his eating habits - which meant giving up cookies, pizza and late night binging sessions - and adopted exercise. 'When I finally got down to a size that's about normal, . people started saying, ""You're too skinny, you look unhealthy, eat a . burger""' He also saw a therapist, who addressed his depression and anxiety issues. At first Mr Monacelli  was losing around 15lbs a week. 'It was tough, . but considering death was the alternative and happiness could be right . around the corner,' he recalled. 'I stuck with it. I got a job as a cook and went back . to college. This summer I picked up biking, and the most I did in a . single day was about 24 miles.' While he was overjoyed with his progress, he was surprised when friends suddenly started telling him he was 'too thin.' 'When I finally got down to a size that's about normal, . people started saying, ""You're too skinny, you look unhealthy, eat a . burger."" 'It's really tough to hear that kind of stuff. It's almost as . bad as hearing, ""You need to lose weight.""' Other assumed Mr Monacelli had had weight loss surgery, which he also found frustrating after all of the hard work he had put in. 'I feel pretty darn good about myself now. I still have issues with my . body, but I'm definitely healthier' Concluding on his weight loss journey so far, Mr Monacelli, said: 'I feel pretty darn good about myself now. 'I still have issues with my . body, but I'm definitely healthier. I . still don't always see the man I've become in the mirror. 'But I can tell . myself that reality is different now, and all of those negative . thoughts will go away with time.' He now weighs 180lbs and estimates that he has up to 20lbs of excess skin as a result of his dramatic transformation.","Mark Monacelli, 34, developed a bad relationship with food as a child .

"By . Ruth Styles . Calls for 'busty lab workers', 'sexy nuns' and actresses who are 'slim with teardrop breasts' might sound distinctly 1970s in tone but, incredibly, they don't come from vintage ads. Instead they're just some of the sexist requests that flood casting sites every day, according to the actress behind a blog named Casting Call Woe. Speaking to the Telegraph, the blogger, who has chosen to remain anonymous and goes by the moniker 'Miss L', revealed that the seedy side of acting is still with us and shows no sign of going away. Scroll down for video . Not so glamorous: The star-studded face of film, theatre and TV conceals a grubby truth . Woe no: Miss L's blog, Casting Call Woe, charts some of the more ridiculous casting messages . In an interview with the paper, she explained that her blog is 'a way of letting the world know about these casting calls and a way of showing the world a side of the industry that it doesn’t generally see.' And Miss L isn't the only actress to speak out about sexist behaviour in the world of TV, theatre and film. Speaking at the Empire Film Awards last year, Dame Helen Mirren used a 30-second appearance to lambast the industry and lament the lack of female directors. As she presented Sam Mendes with an award, the actress said: 'Now I just want to say quickly, it was great to hear Sam Mendes's little list of moments that inspired him. Outspoken:  Both Helen Mirren and Thandie Newton have spoken out about sexism in the acting world . 'I did, however, note that there was not one woman's name there behind the camera. I just hope, I pray, I know, that in five or ten years’ time, when the next Sam gets up and makes his or hopefully her speech, there will be two or three or four women's names there.' She added: 'There are wonderful female directors coming up, many of them British, and it's wonderful to see that. So, go girls.' Equally unimpressed is Thandie Newton who used a CNN interview last year to complain about 'casting couch style interviews' and told of an incident that took place when she was a teenager, in which a director asked her to sit with her legs open. She continued: 'We all need to recognise our part in trying to be aware of sexism and exploitation. It's really bizarre that violence against women isn't a number one priority.' Despite their pleas for change, as Miss L's blog reveals, it seems that the casting couch is one film fixture that is yet to be packed away. Along with bizarre requests for sexy nuns and the ability to withstand buckets of fake blood, Casting Call Woe also shines a light on some of the eye-wateringly sexist attributes included in casting ads. Here are some of the worst: . 'Busty Lab Workers: Two very under-qualified lab workers in cute shoes.' 'Male - fully clothed. Female - dressed in thong, semi-naked at times, has to do casting in underwear.' 'Must be able to portray a slag.' 'This production will require no nudity on camera however nudity will be required on set.' 'Be sexy. It sells.' 'She gets a couple of lines, a light-hearted orgy scene and then gets kicked through the window.' 'Well spoken bikini model needed to interview local politicians.' 'Character Traits - Sexy, Glam, Naughty, Lingerie, Barbie, Bimbo.' 'Girls must be up for semi-nudity, kissing and getting covered in muck and goo.' '2 actors & 2 actresses required. Partial nudity required for the actresses.' Source: Casting Call Woe . Watch Dame Helen Mirren's full speech at Empire .","All the requests appeared on casting websites in recent months .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . You remain as young as you feel – and it is just as well… . Our healthier lifestyles and better medicine are helping more of us than ever live past the age of 100. For the first time, the number of centenarians in Britain has passed the 13,000 mark. Official statistics released yesterday show that 13,350 of us were aged 100 or more when the latest figures were collected in 2012. Healthier lifestyles and better medication are helping more of us than ever live past the age of 100 . Of these, 660 were at least 105 years old – which is another record. And there are now half a million people in Britain aged 90 or more. The number of centenarians has risen by 73 per cent in the last decade alone. And life expectancy for the next generation is also rising. A newborn girl can expect to live to the age of 82.6, and a boy to 78.7 – almost six years longer for a girl and eight years longer for a boy than at the beginning of the 1980s. Just before the First World War, there were only 100 centenarians in the whole of Britain. When  King George V sent out the  first congratulatory telegrams  to centenarians in 1917, there  were only 24. Now Buckingham Palace is sending out around 10,000 laser-printed royal 100th birthday cards a year. New figures reveal for the first time the number of centenarians in Britain has passed 13,000 . Those who were aged 100 or more in 2012 are certainly hardy – to  get to this age they faced many perilous challenges in their  early years. They survived the First World War, the deadly 1919 flu epidemic, the high mortality rates of the 1920s and 1930s and then the Second World War. The increase in numbers living into great old age began in the 1950s and has accelerated in recent years. The analysis by the ONS found: ‘The chance of surviving to older ages has increased for both males and females over recent decades, contributing to the rising numbers of those aged 90 and over in  the population. ‘Mortality rates at older ages have improved due to a combination of factors such as improved medical treatments, housing and living standards, nutrition and changes  in the population’s smoking  habits.’  People are living longest  in England, where life expectancy for boys born now is 79 and for women it is 82.8. Scotland still  has the lowest life expectancy in the UK, at 76.5 for a boy and 80.7 for a girl. In Wales life expectancy for newborns is 78.1 for boys and 82.1 for girls, while in Northern Ireland it is 77.7 for boys and 82.1 for girls. Yesterday’s statistics also showed the average amount of years we spend in good health, based on a self-assessment in the 2011 national census. Judging by respondents’ answers on the state of their health at that time, it was estimated that a newborn girl can expect to spend 64.8 years in good health, while for baby boys it is 63.5 years. But there are major regional differences between expectancies of good health. In Guildford and  in Waverley in Surrey, baby girls can expect to enjoy 71.3 years  in good health, while for boys it is 70.3 years. But in Bradford a healthy life expectancy for a man  is just 52.5 years and 51.6 years  for women. Janet Morrison, of the charity Independent Age, said: ‘The stunning 73 per cent increase in the number of centenarians is a massive cause for celebration. Buckingham Palace is sending out is sending out around 10,000 laser-printed royal 100th birthday cards a year. When the latest figures were collected in 2012, the data revealed there were 13,350 centenarians in the UK . ‘It is particularly good news for older men – there are far more men aged 90 or over than ten years ago, and women over 90 now outnumber men by just 2.5 to 1, compared to 3.3 to 1 ten years ago. These trends are expected to continue – it is estimated that half the five-year-olds alive today will live to 100. ‘Yet, we are woefully under-prepared to meet the challenges – and indeed seize the opportunities –presented by population ageing. ‘Urgent action is needed in health and social care, in work, in lifestyles and in our attitudes if we are to adjust to an ageing society.’ The life expectancy of men is gradually catching up with that of women, the Office for National Statistics figures show. The narrowing of the gap between men and women is in line with the decline of heavy industry and manual labour, which means fewer men work in dangerous physical jobs. Also, more women are exposed to the stress of holding down careers and more are likely to indulge in risky behaviour such as heavy drinking. een life expectancy for men and women was six years in the early 1980s, but has narrowed to 3.9 years. The ONS said that ‘males are demonstrating faster improvements’ in their lifespans than women. A recent indicator suggesting there may be growing pressure on the health of women showed that mortality rates have failed to improve for some working women aged between 25 and 59. The professions affected included women working in sales, as counter clerks, clerical grade workers in local government and the public sector, medical and dental technicians, and some creative industries such as graphic designers.","Healthy lifestyles and better medicine are helping more people live to 100 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rock'n'roll legend Roy Orbison's three sons have produced and remastered a previously unheard track by their father for release. Entitled The Way is Love, the song was originally recorded on a home tape-deck by the 'Pretty Woman' singer and will appear on the 25th anniversary edition of Orbison's final album, Mystery Girl. Wesley, Roy Jr. and Alex Orbison have claimed the process of cleaning up the cassette needed new technology specifically developed for the task. New song: Roy Orbison's son's Wesley, Roy Jr. and Alex Orbison have helped create a new song by their father that will appear on the 25th anniversary reissue and expansion of Orbison's final album, ""Mystery Girl"" that is being re-released on May 20, 2014 . In total, nine never-before-heard tracks from the 1960s icon will be released on the deluxe edition of Mystery girl which will be released on May 20. The three Orbison brothers fulfilled a lifelong dream of playing along with their father on a record by adding guitar and drums to the track. Adding to the rock royalty proceedings was John Carter Cash - the son of legendary country singer, Johnny Cash. 'It really brought us closer together in a lot of ways,' said Alex Orbison, 38, who contributed drums and backing vocals to the track.

'We were able to finish it up and get it out by Father's Day, too, which was obviously special to us,' he said. 'We all just wanted to not stop recording,' he added. 'We had so much fun. It was really too much fun.' The deluxe edition will also include, Mystery Girl: Unraveled, a one-hour documentary directed by Alex Orbison. It will chart how the album was put together with interviews from four of the album's producers - Jeff Lynne, Mike Campbell, Barbara Orbison and Bono.

The film includes eight Orbison music videos, including four previously unreleased videos. Orbison was going through a career renaissance at the time he released 'Mystery Girl.' The 'Oh, Pretty Woman' singer had just earned a new round of attention working with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty in The Travelling Wilburys and was excited about the new album. It included contributions from Lynne, Petty and most of his Heartbreakers, Bono and the Edge of U2, Elvis Costello and many other friends. His wife, Barbara, acted as his manager at the time and even sang backup on the album. Wesley Orbison wrote a song as well. Sadly, though, he passed away two months before its release in February 1989 at age 52 of a heart attack. His sons got to experience something of that excitement nearly a quarter of a century later. They weren't able to record with their dad, but it most definitely was a family moment. This is not the first time that recordings have been cleaned up and released after a singers death. In 1995, 15 years after his death, the three surviving Beatles used a John Lennon vocal from a cassette tape to create Free As A Bird - which was released for their successful Anthology project. Fab: The Beatles wave after arriving at the San Francisco airport Aug. 18, 1964 - in 1995 - an unused John Lennon vocal was used to create Free As a Bird .","Roy Orbison's three sons, have helped create a new song by their father that will appear on the 25th anniversary reissue and expansion of Orbison's final album, Mystery Girl .

"By . Emma Glanfield . These dramatic photographs show the moment a sex attacker clambered onto a roof and threatened to throw himself off during a 14-hour stand-off with police. Derek Johnston, 39, has been jailed for 11 years after breaking into the house and attempting to rape a woman who was inside with her children. He was forced to flee out of the bathroom window and onto the roof when the victim's mother arrived at the home. Derek Johnston, 39, clambered onto a roof in Southampton, Hampshire, and threatened to throw himself off during the 14-hour stand-off with police in July last year . Negotiators on a crane, left, desperately tried to coax Johnston, right, down from the roof of the house in Southampton, Hampshire, in baking 27C heat in July last year . Officers sealed off surrounding streets while negotiators on a crane desperately tried to coax him down in baking 27C (80F) heat. Police stood down as darkness fell and returned to the property in the early hours - only to find he had vanished. Officers finally found him hiding under a bed in the same house, in Southampton, Hampshire, the following day. Johnston broke into the home, hid in the garage, and pounced as his victim was using a washing machine, Southampton Crown Court heard. He held his hand around her throat before trying to rape her, as her children played upstairs.It was only when the woman's mother arrived that the victim managed to bite Johnston's hand, cry out for help, and get away. He made his escape as the woman's mother escorted the children out of the house, on July 9 last year. Johnston broke into the home, hid in the garage, and pounced as his victim was using a washing machine, Southampton Crown Court heard. He then fled to the roof after his victim's mother returned home . In a video recording played to the court, the woman said: ‘I thought he was going to kill me. ‘I could hear my children running around upstairs and I thought I would be lying dead downstairs and no one would know.’ Johnston, of no fixed address, denied attempted rape and two counts of sexual assault but was convicted at trial. Prosecutor Rachel Robertson said the victim had been subjected to a ‘sustained’ attack. And she added: ‘There was an element of planning and lying in wait.’ The court also heard how Johnston had attacked the same woman the previous April. Officers sealed off surrounding streets while negotiators on a crane desperately tried to coax Johnston, 39, down from the roof of the house in Southampton, Hampshire, in baking 27C heat . On that occasion, he went into her bedroom and sexually assaulted her twice. Elizabeth Bussey-Jones, defending, said Johnston did not represent a high or substantial risk of reoffending and added: ‘He bitterly regrets it.’ But Judge Peter Henry branded Johnston ‘violent’ and ‘intimidating’. And he told him: ‘You remained hiding in the house for hours on end listening and waiting and then attacked her. ‘The only reason that you didn't rape her is that her mother appeared at the door and she screamed out.’ He branded the roof stand-off and subsequent hiding as ‘bizarre’. Judge Henry imposed a restraining order preventing Johnston from entering a large area of Southampton and ordered him to pay 120 pounds into a fund for victims of crime.","Derek Johnston, 39, climbed onto victim's roof after attempting to rape her .

"By . Laura Clark . Universities Minister David Willetts has admitted that they government 'got the maths wrong' on tuition fees . The controversial £9,000-a-year tuition fees policy risks costing taxpayers more than the old system, new figures reveal. Writing off unpaid student loans is becoming more expensive than under the £3,000-a-year fees regime. The prospect is highly embarrassing for the Coalition, which claimed the higher fees would save at least £1billion a year. It would be particularly devastating for the Lib Dems if it emerged their U-turn on tuition fees was in vain. They reneged on an election pledge to resist higher fees to get the reforms through Parliament. Opposition politicians yesterday said the policy was fast becoming a ‘money pit’ and descending into ‘chaos’. Since autumn 2012, universities have been able to charge fees of up to £9,000 a year – up from £3,375. Students can take out Government-backed loans to cover the fees but must start repaying once they are earning £21,000 a year. Ministers initially estimated loan write-off costs would be  28 per cent of the £10billion lent to students each year. But with earnings forecasts now bleaker due to the economic climate, Universities Minister David Willetts has revealed the figure is 45 per cent. The figure ‘reflects our current estimate of the costs of Government of the higher education subsidy to students’, he added in response to a Parliamentary written question. When write-off costs reach 48.6 per cent the new system will become dearer than the old one, say experts at the consultancy London Economics. Last night a former political adviser to Mr Willetts told the Guardian there should be a rethink of the system and admitted the Government ‘got its maths wrong’ by overestimating the amount of student debt that will be repaid. The spiralling cost of writing off unpaid student debt is becoming worse than under the old £3,000-a-year system . Nick Hillman, who worked for Mr Willetts during the introduction of the policy, called for action to address the ‘big funding gap’. The former adviser, now director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: ‘The thing that hasn’t really entered the debate yet … is now we know how big the shortfall is, what do you do about it? 'How much would you need to change the loan system to actually solve the problem? ‘I’m not defending the Government. The Government has got the maths wrong, plus the economy has changed. The £21,000 repayment threshold is in real terms much higher than the Government expected.’ Shadow Education Minister Liam Byrne said: ‘This is fresh evidence that our university system is turning into a money pit. 'The system is haemorrhaging cash that will never be repaid and reinvested in the next generation. It’s time to call a halt to this descent into chaos.’ The figures raise the spectre of measures to recoup cash, such as higher interest rates for graduates paying back loans or further cuts to university budgets.","Writing off unpaid loans becoming pricier than under £3,000-a-year system .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Snejana Farberov . A 23-year-old Arizona man pleaded guilty Thursday to beating his 19-year-old girlfriend to death last year with a dumbbell. Luis Soltero, 23, avoided the death penalty for admitting to killing Rebecca 'Becky' Kasper last April, but he will spend at least 25 years in prison with no chance for an early release. Soltero admitted to the grisly killing this week nearly a year after Kasper's decomposing body was discovered in the bathtub in the apartment she shared with him. Tragic end: Luis Soltero, 22 (left), pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the horrifying death of his 19-year-old girlfriend Becky Kasper (right) - he beat her to death with a dumbbell . Troubled relationship: Neighbors said the couple, pictured only months before their sad demise, could often be heard screaming and fighting . Soltero's plea deal required him to plead guilty to second-degree murder, kidnapping and abuse, according to the Star-Tribune. Prosecutors agreed to drop a first-degree murder charge that would likely have landed the killer on death row. The Minnesota native had moved to Tempe in 2011 to attend business school at Arizona State University, she met Soltero at a local book store, according to reports. The pair rapidly grew close, spending holidays with each other's families before Kasper abruptly ended the romance only days before her savage killing at the hands of her jealous ex. Soltero drove to a local police station with a copy of her Minnesota driver's license and said she was dead, according to the Star Tribune. He also left a note . next to the apparent murder weapon allegedly admitting to the brutal . slaying. A statement released at the time by ASU said the school 'extends its sincere condolences to her family and friends at this difficult time.' 'Counseling services for those who knew Kasper are being made available to the university community.' The 19-year-old's father, Dan Kasper, said in a press conference shortly after her death that his daughter 'loved being a Sun Devil,' referring to ASU's athletic teams, and was on the Dean's List. Kasper had two sisters and graduated from Northfield (MN) Senior High School in 2011. 'This is like lightning out of the clear blue sky, we had no idea that this was coming,' Dan Kasper, told CBS5 AZ. Appearing dressed in a black ASU Sun Devils T-shirt, Mr Kasper said his daughter, described as a tough and focused young woman, loved Arizona, where the family had briefly lived when she was a child. ASU was the only school she had applied to despite him not wanting her to stray far from Minnesota, he added. She was pursuing a degree in marketing from the W.P. Carey School of Business, and was planning to graduate a year early, but those plans were dashed on a cruel April afternoon by a vengeful Soltero. Devastated: Father Dan Kasper talking last year at a press conference shortly after his daughter's slaying . No warning signs: Mr Kasper said Soltero seemed laid back and nice after meeting him one Christmas . 'She's our daughter, and I just think her story is worth telling,' the emotional Mr Kasper told reporters, adding that Becky was likely going to do something great. The bereaved father also said that he met Soltero before when Becky brought him home to Minnesota to spend Christmas with her family. 'He was quiet, laid back and easy going, seemed like a good kid,' he said. According to Becky Kasper's father, she told him that their relationship came to an end a few weeks ago, but that Soltero did not seem upset by it and took the breakup in stride. Shortly after the slaying, Soltero walked into a Tempe Police Department substation, handed an officer his ID card and Kasper's Minnesota driver's license and said 'My girlfriend is there and she is dead, and I am not going to tell you anything more without an attorney,' according to court papers cited by Phoenix New Times. Police officers went to Soltero and Kasper's home in Tempe, near the ASU campus, they forced open the door to the unit and found Kasper dead in the bathtub. Her body was covered with blankets and a yoga mat, with coffee grounds and baking soda sprinkled on top, according to court documents. The brutally beaten teen's head was covered . with a plastic bag and her face was described as 'unrecognizable' from substantial blunt-force trauma. Gruesome scene: Kasper's body was found inside Soltero's blood-spattered bathroom in this off-campus apartment complex . 'It's a gruesome scene,' Tempe Police Sgt Mike Pooley told the station KTAR. Court . documents indicate that Becky Kasper's wrists were handcuffed and her . ankles were restrained, and there was blood splatter in the tub, on the . walls and floor. The rest of the woman's body was beginning to decay. A blood-covered dumbbell believed to be the murder weapon was found on the bathroom floor. Next to the dumbbell, police discovered an unsigned note wedged into the bathroom doors which read in part: 'I did not treat her right. She deserved better but never accepted it. So I had to make the choice for her.' The author of the rambling missive goes on to say: 'She died on 420 not because of drugs, but because a sociopath talked and treated her nice...I don't know where to go from here. Do I kill again, end it with myself or become invisible?' Police say the note was penned in handwriting consistent with Soltero's, according to the documents. Neighbors told police that Soltero and Kasper had a stormy relationship and often could be heard screaming at one another. The . leasing office recently had to replace the front door in Soltero's apartment . after it was damaged during a fight between the couple. The 19-year-old victim's employer told . officials she often came to work with bruises on her arms as if someone . grabbed her, although she had never reported domestic abuse. Investigators later learned that Soltero and Kasper had recently split up, but were still spending a lot of time together, documents state. A search of Soltero's apartment yielded a handwritten list of 'pros and cons' of 'breaking up with Becky.' Full of life: Kasper's Facebook page paints a picture of a fun-loving young woman with many interests, including skydiving . Tragic: Kasper graduated from high school in 2001 and was a sophomore at ASU when she was killed . Tell-tale signs: Kasper's employer said Becky would often come to work with bruises on her arms as if she had been grabbed . Soltero at one point . asked an officer: 'Do they still have final meals on death row? I was . wondering if I can order something from Texas,' according to court . documents. He was initially charged with first-degree premeditated murder and ordered held on $1million bond. Photos on Kasper's Facebook page depict the dark-haired, smiling young woman cuddling with her cat, having fun with her girlfriend on prom night and skydiving. In one of the images posted on her page in December, a grinning, rosy-cheeked Becky Kasper could be seen happily posing with Soltero against the background of a winter wonderland scene. Her mother wrote in the comments section at the time: 'Now that is a good looking couple!' A tragically doomed one, as one family has lost its daughter and another family's son might never see the outside of a prison again.","Luis Soltero, 22, pleaded guilty to second degree murder for the brutal killing of girlfriend Rebecca Kasper, 19, least year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Classic: David Jason as Del Boy wearing the sheepskin coat . The factory that made the trademark sheepskin coats for football commentator John Motson has closed after 168 years because of falling trade. Nursey of Bungay, based in Suffolk, opened in 1846 but closed on Wednesday after failing to secure a buyer. It has been run by the same family for  generations and employed more than 80 staff at its 1970s peak. But recently it only employed seven people and had not made a profit in six years. As well as BBC sports broadcaster Motson, the company’s coats were also seen on David Jason’s character Del Boy in TV comedy Only Fools & Horses. Guitarist Eric Clapton and This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby are also fans. The firm, which made coats, hats, slippers and gilets, suffered another bad winter after  many of the shops it supplied closed. The factory will shut while an adjacent shop will stay open temporarily. Owner Tim Nursey, 64, was the fifth generation of his family to work at the company and started his training when he was 18. He said: ‘The stress I have gone through in the past month has been unbelievable. ‘I was taking five-mile runs before work just to combat the stress. ‘We had the chance to sell the brand and the stock, but for various reasons I also said no to that. Luxurious: Football pundit John Motson and presenter Holly Willoughby are both fans of the sheepskin coat . The look became almost iconic . thanks to the character of Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter, played by David . Jason, from the BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses. 'We’ll keep the shop open for another week and will then reopen again in mid-October for a while to clear the stock. 'I’d like to say thank you to our customers and the people of Suffolk and Norfolk who have been very loyal to us over the years.’ A number of buyers had expressed interest in the firm, but Mr Nursey said the deals ‘didn’t work out’. The firm’s employees have been handed redundancy payments.","Nursey of Bungay opened in 1846 but closed on Wednesday .

"By . John Stevens . and Richard Spillett . A boss accused of sacking two women sales executives after they refused his demands for a treesome yesterday said it was not true because he is incapable of having sex. Darren Scott has been taken to an employment tribunal by Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, and Anna Mazover, 29, who are seeking £100,000. They claim he subjected them to sexual harassment during the month they worked at a publishing firm before they were both dismissed ‘without notice’. There were clashes in the tribunal today as Darren Scott (left) accused Diana Nicholl-Pierson (centre) and Anna Mazover (right) of making up sexual harassment claims so they could cash in . But the 52-year-old said having a threesome would be his ‘worst nightmare’, because even with Viagra, he is unable to have sex. The sales director told the hearing: ‘I can’t make love to my wife, I can’t make love to anyone.’ He . added: ‘I haven’t felt like a real man in 12 years since I was . diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as one of the symptoms is erectile . dysfunction, which I suffer from. ‘My . worst nightmare would be in a hotel room or my apartment with two . women. When they took their clothes off, we started to get down to it, I . would have a product that didn’t work. The embarrassment would be . unbelievable.’ Mr . Scott claimed that when Miss Mazover found out he preferred blondes she . showed him ‘sexy images’ of her with blonde hair and ‘in lingerie and . sexy poses’ on a website for glamour models. He . also said he had to warn Miss Nicholl-Pierson ‘several times about her . inappropriate clothing, which included short skirts and low-cut tops’. Mr . Scott said he has a 42-year-old wife who is a ‘complete stunner’, . adding: ‘My favourite breasts in the whole world that I love to touch as . often as possible are my wife’s.’ Ms Nicholl-Pierson (left) and Ms Mazover (right) are seeking a combined £110,000 for sexual harassment, victimisation, race discrimination and poor treatment after whistleblowing . Earlier . yesterday, he told the Central London tribunal the women were . ‘street-wise girls’ who are ‘bent on making as much money out of the . company as possible’. In his statement read by the tribunal, Mr Scott wrote: 'I . deny all the allegations against me and I feel very strongly that these . claimants have acted dishonestly and maliciously. 'They clearly have conspired together . to fabricate these claims in order to either get me the sack and/or try . and save their jobs and/or simply try and make some money out of the . company. 'I . particularly resent the fact that they made a complaint to the police . who found there was absolutely no evidence to support the allegations . against me at all.' He said they were ‘pretty useless’ and ‘poor performers’ who only made one sale . between them at London-based publishing firm Entico Corporation, he . said. He said in his . witness statement: ‘I have never been excited by Diana in any way. I . have never in any way found her attractive...’ He added there was ‘no sexual attraction’ between him and Miss Mazover. Ms Nicholl-Pierson (left) broke down in tears today as she told the tribunal she only wants justice . The case had to be briefly adjourned after a heated exchange between Mr Scott and the women’s solicitor. Banging . his fist on a desk, he told him: ‘Get yourselves some witnesses for the . things you’re accusing me of and if you can’t p*** off.’ He . said: ‘These claimants have acted dishonestly and maliciously. They . clearly have conspired together to fabricate these claims in order to . make some money. ‘Both . these girls were out on the party circuit in Soho. They were both . involved, from what I saw, in taking drugs and drinking to excess. There . were rumours Miss Mazover was a part-time sex worker and Miss . Nicholl-Pierson was going out with a drug dealer.’ Ms Nicholl-Pierson and Ms Mazover were both dismissed from the company last June, less than a month after they had started. The accusations had caused problems in his marriage, he added. Mr Scott told hearing that Ms Mazover had a poor record of punctuality, while Ms Nicholl-Pierson was 'simply unable to sell'. He went on: 'Both claimants were actually pretty useless and they are not people we would have kept on in any event.' In . cross-examination, Mr McDonough, asked Mr . Scott: 'Every single allegation that both of these women have made is . 100% true, isn't that right?' The respondent replied: 'No, it's 100% false.' In his statement, Mr Scott described . the office as open-plan and said that if he had said 'anything remotely . inappropriate' it would have been heard by 'numerous other people'. On . the alleged suggestion of a threesome with the women, Mr Scott wrote . that he 'never invited them to my home or to take part in any sexual . activity', and claimed 'the only way they can prosper is by selling . regularly'. He told the hearing he had employed 'at least 4,000 people' in what was a 'tough environment'. He added that some employees only last 'for a few weeks'. Earlier in the hearing, Ms . Nicholl-Pierson cried when Mr Scott's lawyer, Adam Gadd, put it to her . that 'your whole case is a lie' and she had made the claims 'for money'. She replied: 'I want justice. The way they treated me is completely unfair.' She . added: 'What do you expect me to do when I've got no money and I want . justice. I've been sacked and I'm unemployed. I'm not walking away.' Ms Nicholl-Pierson told the tribunal when she went to complain to the publishing firm's director, James Ramsey (pictured), he started crying . The claimant told the hearing that her former colleagues at the London-based company did not protect her. 'These . men cowered behind their computers like idiots even though they have . probably got children and wives,' she said. 'Do you think that is . appropriate behaviour?' Ms . Nicholl-Pierson told the tribunal that she was not the only person at . the company who believed there were issues with Mr Scott. 'A lot of people felt that Darren was perverted and strange. I think he knows this himself,' she said. She said that when she went to complain to the publishing firm's director, James Ramsey, about Mr Scott’s behaviour, he started crying. Describing . the meeting, she added: 'He (Mr Ramsey) burst out crying. He (Mr . Ramsey) didn’t protect me. He doesn’t protect women, he stays there . crying and does nothing.' The . two women started at the London-based company in May last year - Ms . Nicholl-Pierson on May 13, and Ms Mazover on May 20 - and they were . dismissed on June 14. Mr Scott denies all the allegations. The hearing continues.","Darren Scott hits back at women who accuse him of sexual harassment .

"Calvin Payne says you can learn a lot about history from studying drain covers . A Yorkshireman has been named Britain's only 'drain spotter' after spending his time scouring the streets for rare sewer covers. Calvin Payne, 42, spends hours visiting hundreds of drains - recording them with his camera and chronicling their history. Dubbed 'The Sherlock of the Sewers', Calvin's hobby sees him visiting drains around his home city of Sheffield and further beyond. He admits his hobby is unusual and 'quirky', but insists it is 'not as boring as trainspotting'. Calvin's . passion was first ignited several years ago and since then he has since . become obsessed - and is now thought of as Britain's first drain spotter. He is also part of local preservation group called 'Streets Ahead' who work hard to retain heritage features. Calvin . said: 'You can get in a spot of trouble - me and a friend crawled under . a car once to take a look at a drain and I guess what we were doing . could have been misconstrued. 'I . like doing this because it's quirky but it's also important. If these . drains were to disappear in a road resurfacing scheme it would be very . disappointing. We honestly aren't as boring as trainspotters.' Calvin's . passion was sparked one day when he was walking down a street in . Sheffield and he noticed three metal grates embossed with words 'Sheffield . Local Board.' Mr Payne spends hours photographing and cataloging sewer covers in his home city of Sheffield . Mr Payne has taken pictures of scores of drains as part of his unusual hobby . Baffled . by the name he eventually tracked down the company to 1838 during the . cholera outbreak - meaning the drains were evidence of one of the first . modern sanitation systems. He said: 'We have reason to believe these were installed in the late 1840s. They're certainly around 160 years old. 'Once you start looking down at the streets, you soon come across plenty of lasting relics of times gone by. 'For example, there are still cut-off poles and electric access points for the old tramway, which closed in 1956. Mr Payne says some drain covers have fascinating links with history and has traced some back to an 1838 cholera outbreak . Despite some suggesting his obsession is boring - he insists it is more interesting than trainspotting . 'And . there is a National Telephone Company Ltd cover which dates back to a . time when there were just 12 telephones in Sheffield.' Calvin . added: 'You're more likely to see something ornate or interesting if . it's in your eyeline. If it's on the ground it's not so obvious.' Commenting . on drains in the area, local councillor Jack Scott said: 'We are . restoring a number of old sewer gas street lamps and retaining old stone . features, such as kerbs, where we can. 'We . are upgrading road drainage across the city to reduce road flooding . and, unfortunately, this will involve replacing many of the old gully . grates. 'We . need to do this because, whilst the old ones are solidly built, they . are prone to blocking, are difficult to maintain and can create problems . for cyclists.'","Calvin Payne spends hours photographing different drain covers .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . People living in Britain’s 10 richest constituencies pay almost 10 per cent of the nation’s tax bill, new figures show. All of the seats are in or around London and between them contribute £13.6billion-a-year, more than the whole of Scotland, Northern Ireland and most English regions. The official data from HM Revenue and Customs comes as Chancellor George Osborne faces fresh criticism for failing to act to ease the burden on higher earners, with 5million people set to be dragged into the 40p rate. People living in these 10 London constituencies contribute £13.6billion in tax each year, equivalent to almost 10 per cent of the total tax paid by the whole country . Latest figures from HMRC show that in 2011-12 total tax paid by individuals came to £165billion. The Conservative constituency of Kensington contributed £2.45billion, the Cities of London and Westminster (Con) £2.16billion and Chelsea and Fulham (Con) £1.87billion. Hampstead and Kilburn, where Labour’s Glenda Jackson is MP, contributed the fourth highest amount  £1.47billion, followed by Richmond Park (Con) £1.16, Westminster North (Lab) £1.15billion, Esher and Walton (Con) £939million, Wimbledon (Con) £930million, Battersea (Con) £874million and Islington South and Finsbury (Labour) £823million. Together the constituencies account for 906,000 people paying more tax than 2.64million living in the North West. By contrast Clacton in Essex paid just £92million in tax, the lowest in the country. Other low tax areas include Torbay, Wolverhampton South East, Blackpool North and Cleveleys, Blackburn and Blackpool South. The figures reveal the over-reliance on London as an economic powerhouse, with a small number of mega-rich individuals bankrolling much of the public sector. The figures show that the top 10 constituencies contribute more tax than Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and most English regions . Nick Faith, from Policy Exchange think tank, said: ‘London is now home to the largest number of millionaires in the entire world and their taxes continue to prop up the rest of the country. ‘It wasn’t always this way. But as northern towns and cities suffered the effects of deindustrialisation, London’s dominant service based economy grew, leading to a brain drain of talent to the Capital. ‘London is one of the world’s leading cities and we should look to maximise its potential.’ He said the government had to make other cities more attractive for the next generation of millionaires. ‘Investing in better transport links, building more homes through a more streamlined planning system and aligning public sector and private sector pay to boost job creation are all measures that will help attract British born and foreign business leaders to set up home in other regions of the UK.’ However the situation is likely to be exacerbated by plans to further increase the amount of money people can earn before paying tax. Mr Osborne used his Budget on Wednesday to announce the income tax threshold will rise by another £500 to £10,500. Tory Chancellor George Osborne has faced calls to ease the tax burden on middle earners but Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg has insisted tax cuts be focused on low and middle earners . The top 25 per cent of earners will contribute 75 per cent of the total £167billion income tax . Nick Clegg, who has championed the Lib Dem policy, claims this ‘workers’ bonus’ will be worth an extra £100-a-year. But Tory MPs are angry at the refusal of the Treasury to offer more help to those people dragged into paying 40p tax rate. Since the coalition was formed Mr Osborne has frozen or lowered the point at which workers start the higher rate of tax. It means that of 2million more people sucked into the 40p rate since the last election, 1.4million more than would have been affected under Labour’s plans. Those caught by George Osborne’s failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £546 worse off next year, according to the respected  Institute for Fiscal Studies. But the Chancellor’s changes to Labour’s plans for the 40p rate, once reserved for the wealthiest in society, mean the Treasury has raked in an extra £3.6billion. If Labour’s plans had been adhered to by Mr Osborne, people would have begun to pay the 40p tax rate if they earned £47,845 in 2015-16. This year 4.4million people will pay the 40p rate, up from just 3.02million when the coalition was formed in 2010 and only 1.35million in 1988. If it had risen in line with wage growth, the 40p rate would only apply to someone earning more than £75,000. Instead it has fallen to £41,450. Official figures show that in 2013-14, the 25 per cent highest earners will pay 75 per cent of all income tax, while the top ten per cent, on £47,913 or more, will account for 59 per cent. The top 1 per cent will pay 28.3 per cent, or £47billion. The Treasury said that thanks to the £10,000 allowance, in 2013-14, higher rate taxpayers are about £45 better off than if tax thresholds had grown in line with inflation.","Income tax cut for low earners means more is raised from the wealthy .

"By . Simon Cable . Its intriguing mysteries and gentle brand of humour have proved a hit with audiences worldwide. But fans of BBC detective series Jonathan Creek were left shocked after the latest episode of the popular drama used a highly-offensive racist word, apparently without realising its meaning. Viewers immediately took to Twitter, revealing their disbelief that the word ‘Jigaboo’ – a derogatory term used to describe a black person – had featured in the episode which was broadcast at 9pm last Friday. The BBC has apologised after the word 'Jigaboo' appeared on a Scrabble board on Jonathan Creek . It was included in a scene in which actors John Bird and June Whitfield were playing Scrabble. A close-up of the board was shown on camera, with the word clearly visible at the top of the screen. The characters, seemingly oblivious to the word’s meaning, are then shown innocently discussing whether it is a real word or not. The incident was unconnected to the rest of the episode, which saw the super sleuth trying to solve a kidnapping case. Such was the level of shock among some viewers, that they immediately posted messages online questioning if they had heard correctly. One Twitter user wrote: ‘Did someone just say “jigaboo” on Jonathan Creek? Is that allowed?’ Valentine Smith said: ‘Oh dear BBC. In Jonathan Creek one of the nonsense Scrabble words was a very offensive racist word. You must try harder to be less offensive.’ Another, calling themselves Nasa, added: ‘Racist scrabble #Jonathan Creek’, while another said: ‘This unnecessary racist slur appeared on Friday’s episode of Jonathan Creek. Any chance the BBC will apologise?’ The show stars comedian Alan Davies as Jonathan Creek, a magician's assistant turned detective who specialises in solving seemingly supernatural deaths with a comedy twist . The show stars comedian Alan Davies as Jonathan Creek, a magician’s assistant turned detective who specialises in solving seemingly supernatural deaths with a comedy twist. It is written by David Renwick, who has also penned a string of much-loved BBC series including One Foot in the Grave and Love Soup, as well as the ITV series Hot Metal. The programme was first broadcast in 1997, running until 2004. The show won the Bafta for Best Drama Series in 1998. Following a five-year hiatus, the series returned for a one-off special on 1 January 2009, while a further 90-minute special was shown in 2010. A third special aired at Easter last year, and the fifth series started last month and is watched by around 5.5m viewers. The BBC has frequently been accused of trying too hard to be politically correct. In 2012, the corporation told its journalists not to describe Abu Qatada as an extremist in order to avoid making a ‘value judgement’. They said he should be referred to as radical instead. It was in 2011 that the BBC faced a backlash from leading presenters over suggestions that they should use ‘religiously neutral’ terms instead of ‘BC’ or ‘AD’ to avoid causing non-Christians offence. The BBC last night apologised for featuring the word ‘Jigaboo’ in an episode of Jonathan Creek. They claimed that the writer has been searching for words to include in a scene where the characters were playing a ‘Klingon’ version of Scrabble. A spokesman said: ‘In searching for obscure words for a Klingon-themed game of Scrabble, a word was unwittingly featured in the board game that it since transpires has negative connotations. No offence was intended.’ It was included in a scene in which actors John Bird and June Whitfield were playing Scrabble .

"By . Jane Fryer . Perhaps it’s the six pigtails streaming in the wind. Or the two mad pompoms bobbing about on his muscular hind quarters as he prances through the waves on Blackpool beach. Or perhaps it’s the four-hour bespoke luxury ‘wash and set’ that comes after. Whichever, it’s safe to say that Afterglow Maverick Sabre, aka Ricky the standard poodle, is not a dog that should ever be described as ‘standard’. Daily Mail's Jane Fryer meets two year old poodle 'Ricky' the Best of Breed winner at Crufts 2014 . Owner Jason Lynn leads 'Ricky'  at play on Blackpool Beach. A day at the beach is all fun and good, but afterwards comes the intense procedure of cleaning the dog . He spends his life whizzing from dog show to dog show in a smart red Mercedes van, loves Radio 2, adores watching himself on telly, enjoys a daily romp on the beach ‘to help him glow’, and this month was crowned Best In Show at Crufts — beating nearly 22,000 dogs from 45 countries to win immeasurable glory, a vast two-tone green rosette and a cheque for £100. This week, he has graciously invited me to his home at the Lilliput Kennels, near Blackpool, to share in the minutiae of his doggy day. The majority of which, it soon becomes evident, is taken up by an ablution regime that would put Hollywood divas to shame. Dogs like Ricky need a bit more than a quick sponge and a pat dry. Dogs like Ricky need a bit more than a sponge off and a quick dry, instead the procedure of getting him ready for crufts is one that takes hours of prep beforehand . After a good hose off Ricky is taken over to a special table where his owner can carry on the next part of the primping procedure . 'Ricky' gets dry after his bath, with help from his owner Jason Lynn . 'Ricky' gets a blow dry, his hair is far too thick and curly to drip dry or simply use a towell . The blow-dry process takes around three hours, and if it is not done thoroughly, the dog's hair will have nasty knots and tangles . Happily, he has dedicated staff on hand in the form of owners Jason Lynn, 35, and Michael Gadsby, 52, who tend to Ricky in a specially adapted doggy beauty parlour. ‘Our lives revolve around our dogs and keeping them happy,’ says Jason. ‘It’s a labour of love.’ It certainly is. First, Ricky’s 12 matching lilac hairbands are gently teased from his long, bluey-black mane, where they’ve been lending him more than a passing resemblance to Snoop Dogg, the extravagantly coiffured American rapper. Next, his muzzle is given a good scratch and sweet nothings muttered in his ears. Then, once Jason has treble-checked the temperature of his personal doggy Triton shower unit, Ricky is gently hoisted into his special plastic bathtub. Such is the lustrous thickness and amazing water resistance of his coat, it takes a good few minutes just to wet it through. 'Ricky' falls asleep whilst owner his owner drys and combs his hair, to make sure it has no tangles . Soon, Ricky's hairstyle begins to take shape as he is combed again and again . Ricky, a prize winner, stands out amongst his breed, even with six other brothers and sisters of the same breed . Next, it’s a good lather in Plush Puppy shampoo — a sweet-smelling Australian preparation — a rinse, a dab more shampoo, another rinse, and then a deep massage with Plush Puppy conditioner. Ricky is used to being pampered. He has a special diet of Eukanuba brand dog food, chicken mince, tripe, chicken wings, steak and the odd illicit banana. When on the road at dog shows, which is about 30 weekends a year, he often secures his own hotel double bed. He is also used to winning. As well as triumphing at pretty much every show he’s entered in the UK, his trophy haul includes Poodle Pup of America, and the $10,000 (£6,000) first prize in the Olympics of dog shows, the U.S. Eukanuba World Challenge — the first time a British dog had ever won. His father Dino was a best-in-show winner, his grandfather Afterglow Sugar Daddy (known as Alan, after Lord Sugar) was a U.S. and UK champion. Jason Lynn with Ricky the Standard Poodle, as they celebrate winning the Best in Show category . Ricky the Standard Poodle and the tropy he and his owner have won for the best in show award . In the beauty parlour, things are moving slowly. After half an hour of lathering, massaging, rinsing and more lathering, Jason swaddles him in a cornflower-blue towel. ‘I’m afraid we’ve only just started,’ he tells me. ‘Now it’s the blow dry. You might want to go and get some lunch or something. It’ll take about another three hours.’ Three hours! For a dog. ‘If I don’t get him completely dry, we’ll have a nightmare next time. It’ll be all knotty and nasty. So I start with the power blaster.’ This looks a bit like a handheld hoover and blasts out the excess water with hot air as Ricky reclines elegantly on a high table, pink tongue flopping out like a rasher of bacon, occasionally shivering with delight. Even romping about as a ball of black fur with his six brothers and sisters, Ricky stood out. ‘The best puppy is the one that catches your eye — the one that’s posing and arching and making you look at him,’ says Michael. ‘That was Ricky. He’s a confident dog. He loves himself, and he always has.’ But a real champion also needs something called ‘good confirmation’, he explains. ‘They need the basics of a well-constructed, healthy animal. ‘And then they need the particulars of the breed. For poodles, it’s all about the quality of the coat.’ And the poodle ‘trim’, of course — an extraordinary canine topiary created with scissors, clippers and skill. There are four versions: the all-over puppy cut, the Bikini or Miami, the English saddle (very complicated, with pompoms down the hind legs) and the Continental — Ricky’s ‘do’. The Continental, with its closely clipped feet, face and hindquarters, looks a teeny bit chilly around the important bits, but apparently a dog’s body temperature is four degrees higher than ours, so they really don’t mind. Michael is in charge of clipping and scissoring. ‘I taught myself, and I had some unbelievable disasters to begin with. But it’s always going to grow back, isn’t it?’ So if he accidentally lopped off one of Ricky’s bobbing pompoms, how long would that take? Jason pales behind the dryer. ‘About a year.’ Daily Mail writer Jane Fryer meets two year old poodle 'Ricky' the Best of Breed winner at Crufts 2014 . Within the dog show world, poodle people have a unique camaraderie. They compare hair products, send each other power blasters in the post, empathise with the onerous grooming requirements and travel thousands of miles not just to show their charges but to allow their champions to breed. ‘You have to have the kind of temperament that finds all this enjoyable,’ says Jason over the roar. Another hour on and he’s swapped the blaster for an upright hair dryer on a stand that leaves his hands free to groom. And groom. And groom. ‘For me, it’s very relaxing — it’s very far from being a chore.’ Jason and Michael, who met at a dog show in America, are both utterly delightful, but they must make a daunting pair on the circuit. Their office is brimming with vast glass trophies, rosettes and photos of award-winning poodles. This month, Lilliput became the first kennels ever to breed two Crufts’ winners. As well as Ricky’s triumphs in utility dog and best in show, an American cocker spaniel called Pearl, bred by Jason and Michael, won the gun dog category. ‘I thought I was going to explode with bloody pride,’ says Michael. Back on the table, the grooming goes on. To be fair, while not every dog would enjoy a four-hour shampoo and set, Ricky doesn’t look remotely put upon. In fact, he looks close to heaven. During what (I pray) is the final styling session, where Jason sprays on a leave-in conditioner, Ricky actually falls asleep, legs flopped open, paws jiggling in some exciting doggy dream or other. When it is eventually over, Jason gently teases him awake, lifts him down and adjusts his extraordinary coat one last time. ‘You always think you can make it look better — but look at that volume!’ We all watch in awe as Ricky bounces about, strutting, preening, pirouetting and ready to undo four hours of coiffing with another run on the beach. A true champion. Fit, lithe and happy. Who just happens to resemble a giant pompom on sticks.","Ricky the poodle is a champion winner at Crufts 2014 .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . For Chicago-born bride Rachael Kay Albers and her fiancé Roberto Hess, one wedding was never going to be enough for them to say how much they truly loved each other. So, after canceling their traditional wedding, the couple agreed to say 'I do' to each other every day for a whole year. The couple, who on Friday will have their 76th wedding, say their vow to wed every day has brought them closer together. First dance: Rachael Kay Albers and Roberto Hess at their 63rd wedding . First kiss: The couple share a tender moment after picking their rings for wedding number 3 . Since their first wedding on January 5, the couple have held ceremonies with their family and friends, and been married at their home, in city squares, and surrounded by mist-covered hills. Although they are not yet legally wed - something they have planned for later this year - the couple say their plan has made them fully appreciate and love one another more. 'It's an opportunity to show [Rachael] how important [she is] to me, and how romantic can I be ... for that, one day is never enough,' Hess said in a video on their website, as the couple tried to explain why they are having 365 weddings. Albers, who met Hess whole salsa dancing in San Cristóbal, where the couple live and work, said as they prepared for their traditional wedding she realized it didn't really reflect their values. Sharing: Their parents have been used to officiate at ceremonies, including the first family wedding on day 15 . Special day: The couple were joined by friends for their Andador wedding on day 44 . Cheers: Roberto's family toast the bride and groom on day 15 . Admitting she was turning into a 'bridezilla', Albers said: I began to realize this wasn't an event that reflected us. It didn't in anyway feel like it was an entrance into our partnership.' The couple decided to cancel their planned March 8 nuptials and instead used their wedding budget to hold smaller ceremonies that meant more to them. Each ceremony is unique - from the vows, outfits, location and witnesses - but each wedding is a more personal reflection of their love, the couple say. Through their website, Albers and Hess have encouraged people to suggest places for them to marry. This has led to some original weddings, including the one for their 74th ceremony, which was officated live on Huffington Post by Caitlyn Becker. Binding love: The couple pick out wedding bands on day 3 . Guest of honor: The couple's dog joined them for wedding number 20 . By getting married every day, the couple have a constant stream of firsts - from the first reception on day 3, and the first family ceremony on day 15, to 365 first kisses. While they sometimes involve guests and witnesses, other times the ceremony is more simple with just the couple exchanging vows and rings. And, although they don't always look like a traditional bride and groom, Albers says she has saved a special dress for the 365th wedding day. New traditions: The couple, pictured with guests on day 63, have embraced a new way to show their love . Celebration: The couple gather with friends and family for wedding number 63 .

"By . Jenny Awford . When nine-year-old Emma Ross collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest in her school playground, her father could only look on in horror. She has been fighting for her life in a coma for more than three weeks now and it is feared that she has suffered brain damage. Her mother Robyn, 36, has spoken of her fear at seeing her little girl lying ‘dead’ in the playground at Heathhall Primary in Dumfries. Emma Ross had a cardiac arrest in the school playground three weeks ago and is now in a coma . She said: ‘I rushed to the school after a friend called me to say Emma had fallen and smashed her nose in the playground. ‘When I arrived I saw Emma lying dead and motionless. She was completely blue and she was not breathing. Her teacher Mrs Black was standing over her giving CPR. ‘It was a complete shock because I had no idea it was so serious. Her dad Lindsay who had gone to pick her up from school was hysterical. ‘Emma is so popular and funny, I miss her so much. I know she is going to pull through. She had a chance to leave me and she didn’t. Three times I was told she was not going to make it, but she is still fighting.’ A priest was called for Emma at one stage, but she pulled through and responded well to treatment. Both parents have praised the quick actions of Emma’s teacher, Mrs Black, as the emergency first aid may have helped to save her life. It is feared Emma (pictured with her mother, Robyn, and sister, Evie) has suffered brain damage . Emma (pictured with her mother, Robyn) has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy - a disease of the heart muscle. This is the same condition that footballer Fabrice Muamba has . Emma, who is in primary five, has now been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, the same disease of the heart muscle that almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba in 2012. Robyn who has a younger daughter Evie, 18 months, said that Emma has never been ill or admitted to hospital before. She said: ‘Emma is such an athlete, she loves mountain climbing and she is always dancing and playing outdoors. She suffers from a very rare heart disease, there are only two or three cases a year. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. It can run in families and can affect one or many members of a family. There are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart. They can also affect the heart's electrical system. There is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy. Source: British Heart Foundation . ‘It’s the same disease as Fabrice Muamba who collapsed on the pitch. He was out for 87 minutes, but Emma was passed out for 44 minutes. ‘The whole community has been so supportive and she has been sent hundreds of cards and messages of love. When I go and visit her in the hospital she definitely knows that it is me. ‘It’s all down to Emma now, her life is in her hands.’ She has been critically ill at Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow since her cardiac arrest on February 27. Doctors say she could be in a coma for months, and it’s feared she has suffered brain damage. A cardiac arrest occurs when there is a problem with the heart's electrical system. It is different to a heart attack which occurs when there is a problems with the heart's 'plumbing'. Emma was taken first to Dumfries Infirmary before being transferred to Yorkhill which has a paediatric intensive care unit. ‘All the paramedics were distraught, but they refused to give up on her. They were brilliant. They paralysed her and put her in an induced coma before giving her a scan,’ said Robyn. She was going to be taken by helicopter but the weather changed and she was taken by ambulance. Emma's family remain confidence and hopeful that she will make a full recovery . Her mother has spoken out about the lack of a specialist retrieval team which serves the area surrounding Dumfries. ‘It took nine hours for Emma to receive the proper medical help as she had to be transferred to a children’s hospital in Glasgow. 'I think this is absolutely disgusting and something should definitely be done to make sure the process is more efficient. ‘It was such a critical time and I felt like a lot of time was wasted waiting around for her to be transferred to the best place. More damage could have been prevented.’ Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system. It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia. Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning. Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing. In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked. This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert.","Emma Ross had a cardiac arrest three weeks ago and is now in a coma .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A 54-year-old Atlanta woman who lost more than half her body weight through a diet and exercise overhaul now wants to inspire others. Val McLeod told ABC's Good Morning America on Friday that after struggling with obesity since childhood, her turning point came when she had to be weighed in hospital by a freight scale. Ms McLeod, who weighed 620lbs at her heaviest, is now an author and motivational speaker. Scroll down for video . Double take: Val McLeod, 54, lost over half her body weight and has now written a book titled 'Empoword' to help others. Pictured here before, left, and as she is today, right . On her worst days, Ms McLeod said she would consume over 30,000 calories, eating fried chicken, cookies, chips, ice cream and soda in portion sizes that were large enough for three people. By her mid-twenties, she was using upholstery fabric to make clothes because she couldn't find anything that fit, even in plus-size stores. 'We would just roll out as much fabric, yards, as I needed and put elastic in the waist,' she explained.After decades of failed dieting, Ms McLeod attempted gastric bypass surgery in 1989 - dangerous for a woman of her size - and went into respiratory failure during the procedure. She was on life support for three days. Wake up call: Ms McLeod tells ABC News that her turning point came when she had to be weighed on a freight scale prior to her gastric bypass surgery in 1989 . In preparation for the surgery, she had to be weighed. Too heavy for the hospital scales, Ms McLeod was taken outside and loaded onto the freight scale. 'I wanted to die!' she says of the experience. But finally, she had received the wake-up call she needed so badly. Ms McLeoad, who explained on her Facebook page, Shaped 4 Success, that she 'had no idea what healthy eating was,' hired a nutritionist to educate her on health and wellness and a therapist to help her overcome some of the deeper emotional issues she had with food. 'Weight loss and being overweight is as much mental, psychological as it is physical,' she explains. Lifestyle overhaul: Ms McLeod, pictured, credits WeightWatchers with the 'lions share' of her weight loss and now exercises at least five times a week and sticks to a diet of fruit, vegetables and fish . Slowly, she started to incorporate exercise into her daily routine. When she first started walking, Ms McLeod said she could 'barely even go a block.' She now tries to exercise at least five times a week and walks four miles a day. Ms McLeod, who attributes the 'lions share' of her weight loss to WeightWatchers, no longer eats processed food and now sticks to a diet of fruit, vegetables and fish. She has lost a whopping 393lbs in total, an achievement that took her 25 years, and says she still wants to lose 50lbs more. An Inspiration: Ms McLeod, now an author and motivational speaker, has lost a whopping 393lbs in total, an achievement that took her 25 years -  and she says she still wants to lose 50lbs more . 'Make one change that's healthier and the body is so intelligent, I say the body has a brain, it will respond to anything you do for it that's in the right direction,' Ms McLeod says. She has now written a book 'Empoword - Build a Life of Success with Powerful, Positive Language!' and is a certified trainer, retreat and seminar leader.","Val McLeod, 54, from Atlanta lived on 30,000 calories per day at her heaviest ."
"By . Victoria Woollaston . Samsung has already taken its first steps into the world of wearables - with its Gear range of smartwatches - and rumours suggest it’s gearing up to launch a Google Glass rival in the autumn. These reports were bolstered this week by a Samsung patent that not only hints at an upcoming wearable device – it details a system in which wearers could turn their hands into the keyboard. In the proposed system, people wearing a camera - on a Google Glass-style device dubbed Galaxy Glass - would be able to look down at their hands, which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard, and use their thumbs to select the keys. The patent was filed in 2013 to the World Intellectual Property Organisation.

The patent was filed in 2013 to the World Intellectual Property Organisation as well as South Korea’s Korean Intellectual Property Office, and was found by Galaxy Club Netherlands. It relates to 'an input apparatus and method for providing a camera-assisted input operation for use in a portable device.' ‘Recently there is much interest in the wearable computers such as glasses-type terminal and wristwatch terminals,’ continued the patent. ‘Such wearable computers are even more limited in space for mounting an input means such as button type keypad and touchscreen.' The system involves a camera for capturing an image, a storage unit that stores the ‘key to hand mapping table’, a display and a control unit. Numbers could . be assigned to a forefinger, for example, while symbols could be assigned to the middle . finger. Alternatively, letters could be plotted at various points . across the fingers and palm from top to bottom. For example, numbers could be assigned to a forefinger, middle finger and closed fist, pictured, while symbols could be assigned to a little finger.

Users would then use their thumb to ‘press’ the various keys on both hands. The camera would capture the movement of the thumb, or identify the force pressed onto each finger, to establish which key had been pressed and type the message accordingly. Reports in The Korea Times in January were the first to suggest Samsung is working on a Google Glass rival. The article explained the Galaxy Glass would sync to a smartphone and let the wearer make and receive calls, and listen to music.

We’ve had phone cases that double up as tasers, Swiss Army knives and even edible cases made from rice - but the latest design is much more practical, and could save your life. The Wello case, from Indian firm Azoi, has been fitted with monitoring sensors that measure a number of key health vitals. It tracks blood pressure, electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood oxygen, temperature and lung functions with what the company calls a ‘high level of accuracy’ - and the measurements can be shared. The Wello case, pictured, is fitted with monitoring sensors that measure a number of key health vitals. It tracks blood pressure, electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood oxygen, temperature and lung functions with what the company calls a 'high level of accuracy' - and the measurements can be shared . ‘Fast and easy-to-use, Wello empowers people to track key data, improve awareness of their body’s state and make more informed lifestyle choices,’ explained Azoi’s founder and CEO Hamish Patel. ‘Over the last two years, we have focused our efforts on coming up with a technologically advanced tool to help people monitor their health. Patel described Wello as ‘a not-so-small engineering feat in microelectronics, nanosensors, imaging, data analytics and design.’ Measurements are taken by holding two fingers and thumbs over the four sensors on the back and side of the case. Blood . Pressure: Wello gives a blood pressure reading, it also gives multiple readings so users can track any patterns that cause spikes or dips. ECG: The case takes an ECG reading without wires. An ECG is a mapping of electrical signals from the heart. Heart . Rate: Wello keeps track of a user's heart rate or pulse. A pulse provides clues to the state of a person's fitness, potential heart . problems or other illnesses. Blood Oxygen: The case helps measure the amount of oxygen being used to pump blood around a body. Temperature: . The sensors read a person's body temperature from their fingers. This is used to monitor a fever, for example. Lung . Function: Wello reads how much air a user inhales and exhales, which may point . towards possible obstructions or underlying conditions. These sensors measure all the vital health signs and record them on the Wello app. The results appear ‘within seconds.’ These measurements can be shared with family members and doctors, for example, or used to plot changes in health over time. ‘All too often, health problems go undetected until they are too late to address,’ continued Patel.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Nasa’s Mars rover Curiosity has found water in the first soil sample taken from the red planet's surface. The first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. Study lead author Laurie Leshin, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Dean of Science, said: ‘One of the most exciting results from this very first solid sample ingested by Curiosity is the high percentage of water in the soil. Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity has found water in the first soil sample taken from the red planet's surface . Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived on Mars in 1971. Mariner 9 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers. Mars is currently in the middle of . an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present . time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the . past. In June this year, Curiosity rover found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. ‘About two per cent of the soil on the surface of Mars is made up of water, which is a great resource, and interesting scientifically.’ The sample also released significant carbon dioxide, oxygen, and sulphur compounds when heated. Curiosity landed in Gale Crater on the surface of Mars on August 6th last year, to try and find out if Mars could have once supported life. To do that, Curiosity is the first rover on Mars to carry equipment for gathering and processing samples of rock and soil. One of those instruments was employed in the current research: Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) which includes a gas chromotograph, a mass spectrometer, and a tunable laser spectrometer. These instruments enable it to identify a wide range of chemical compounds and determine the ratios of different isotopes of key elements. Paul Mahaffy, principal investigator for SAM at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre, said: ‘This work not only demonstrates that SAM is working beautifully on Mars, but also shows how SAM fits into Curiosity's powerful and comprehensive suite of scientific instruments. Curiosity landed in Gale Crater on the surface of Mars on August 6th last year, to try and find out if Mars could have once supported life . ‘By combining analyses of water and other volatiles from SAM with mineralogical, chemical, and geological data from Curiosity's other instruments, we have the most comprehensive information ever obtained on martian surface fines. ‘These data greatly advance our understanding of surface processes and the action of water on Mars.' Doctor Leshin added: ‘This is the first solid sample that we've analysed with the instruments on Curiosity. ‘It's the very first scoop of stuff that's been fed into the analytical suite. Although this is only the beginning of the story, what we've learned is substantial.’ In the study, published in the journal Science, researchers used the rover's scoop to collect dust, dirt, and finely grained soil from a sandy patch known as ‘Rocknest.’ They fed portions of the fifth scoop into SAM. Inside SAM, the ‘fines’ - as the dust, dirt, and fine soil is known - were heated to 835 degrees Celsius. 'About two per cent of the soil on the surface of Mars is made up of water, which is a great resource, and interesting scientifically,' according to lead researcher Laurie Leshin . Baking the sample also revealed a compound containing chlorine and oxygen, likely chlorate or perchlorate, previously known only from high-latitude locations on Mars. This finding at Curiosity's equatorial site suggests more global distribution. The analysis also suggests the presence of carbonate materials, which form in the presence of water. In addition to determining the amount of the major gases released, SAM also analysed ratios of isotopes of hydrogen and carbon in the released water and carbon dioxide. Isotopes are variants of the same chemical element with different numbers of neutrons, and therefore different atomic weights. SAM found that the ratio of isotopes in the soil is similar to that found in the atmosphere analysed earlier by Curiosity, indicating that the surface soil has interacted heavily with the atmosphere. Dr Leshin said: ‘The isotopic ratios, including hydrogen-to-deuterium ratios and carbon isotopes, tend to support the idea that as the dust is moving around the planet, it's reacting with some of the gases from the atmosphere.’ She said the results shed light on the composition of the planet's surface, while offering direction for future research. Dr Leshin added: ‘We now know there should be abundant, easily accessible water on Mars. ‘When we send people, they could scoop up the soil anywhere on the surface, heat it just a bit, and obtain water.’","Mars rover found that surface soil contains two per cent water by weight .

"By . Ruth Styles . With 36FF breasts and a dress size 18 on top but a 10 below, Dawn Roberts, a 45-year-old nail technician, was fed up. Although she'd already had one successful breast reduction, she decided to have a second operation ahead of her wedding day. But thanks to a bungling surgeon, in place of the petite 36C breasts she had hoped for, she woke up to find she had badly scarred square breasts that were pitted with holes and an unwanted triangular protuberance on one side. Disfigured: Dawn says she has been left mutilated and miserable by the botched breast reduction . 'My breasts were quite large, 36FF, and I didn't like them because I looked so top heavy and it meant I was size 10 on the bottom and 18 on the top,' she remembers. And after the first operation to reduce them, she was thrilled with the results. 'Within weeks, I was was like a new woman and I couldn't believe it,' she remembers. 'I had this small bust and there was no pain.' But disaster struck when Dawn began to gain weight and her new, smaller bust regained its old volume. 'They grew a lot bigger than the rest of me,' she adds. 'They grew quite quickly and the back pain was back, the neck pain was back, so I went back to the doctors and the surgeon suggested I have a second breast reduction.' With her wedding just three months away, Dawn was worried that her breasts wouldn't be healed in time but the surgeon reassured her that things would be fine. Humiliated: Because of her disfigured breasts, Dawn says she is too embarrassed to go on holiday . Hidden pain: At her wedding, Dawn had to resort to wearing a bandage in her bra in order to have a cleavage . Happier: Dawn before having the surgery that has caused her so much pain . They weren't and when Dawn woke up, she was horrified to discover that she'd been left with square shaped, indented breasts, no cleavage and an unexpected triangular lump on one side. 'One breast is higher than the other and both are completely square,' she reveals. 'On one side, there's a big triangle bulge - it's complete disfigurement.' Determined to look her best on her wedding day, she walked down the aisle with a rolled up bandage in her bra to give herself a cleavage and hid the disfigurement beneath her dress. But too embarrassed to wear a bikini, her dream Egyptian honeymoon had to be postponed indefinitely. 'We've been married for 12 months and we've still not been on our honeymoon,' says Dawn's husband, Steve. 'We were planning to go to Egypt but haven't been able to go because of the way Dawn was left. She doesn't feel comfortable wearing a bikini or any sort of swimwear. He added: 'The intimacy side has become very difficult. She doesn't like me touching her because she's so self-conscious about it.' Dawn herself says she feels guilty about what happened and the burden it has placed on her relationship with her new husband. 'Steve has had to take on awful lot,' she adds. 'It's not fair on him to be burdened with this as soon as we got married. 'Even though he's been very patient and very supportive, I'm not the same person that he met. I've been left so disfigured, I just don't feel like a woman anymore. It really has ruined my life.'

"By . Penny Stretton . Monica Porter caused a stir when she wrote about being '60 and irresistible to men of 20 who want sex with no strings attached'. Her unashamed account of how she she took 15 lovers, most under 30 and even slept with two men in the same day met with a rather mixed response. Some said 'good on her!' and others claimed she'd come to regret her exploits and even struggle to find a man who would now want to settle down with her. But the grandmother has revealed that far from being lonely and rejected, she has since been inundated with offers of dinner and dates from 'eligible, age appropriate' men. Scroll down for video . Monica Porter appeared on This morning to talk about sex with younger men and how she's received plenty of other offers since her revelations. In an interview on This Morning the writer also said the response to her revelations about sex with much younger men has been overwhelmingly positive, with many women of the same age getting in touch to tell her they too have been dating well below their age range. She told the presenters: 'So many people have been in touch to say they are in support and I have had so many messages from women in my age group who have done the same thing.' Monica's year of dating came about after she found herself aged 60 and living alone for the first time following a relationship breakdown. The grandmother now says she's given up online dating with younger men and has had many offers from men who are closer to her age range . The mother of two explained: 'I'd been through two long term relationships that had ended and others in between and you begin to feel, well, maybe the happily ever after isn't for me. 'I was coming up to 60 and going to live on my own for the first time and I thought 'how do you do this single thing? 'I was sad and lonely until friends told me I should internet date and lo and behold. 'The first site was for older people and fairly boring so I went on to a more mainstream site and realised there were a lot of young guys interested, I was staggered.' Monica Porter chatted on This Morning about the reactions she had to hr stories of dating much younger men . Monica explained that although many online conversations came to nothing, many did involve dates and that younger men told her sleeping with an older women was their fantasy. Sixty and single: Monica enjoyed her year of 'dating dangerously' but has had enough of online encounters. 'They would say they had always been interested in older women,' she said, adding that she believed internet dating had made it easy for these fantasies to come true. Though most of Monica's dates were positive, even though she says the first one with a 23-year-old had  a 'vague Benny Hill sauciness about it' she has admitted that some verged on dangerous, recalling one man who put his hands around her throat during sex. 'Yes there was one edgy experience,' she told the presenters of the ITV show 'there were risks and that was not good, it was uncomfortable.' When asked if the sex was always safe she admitted 'occasionally it wasn't safe - even at 60 you get carried away at times, I admit that.' Monica admitted that the modern online dating world can be addictive and that she found herself glued to a dating app on her phone that matched her with singles in her area. 'The app is so easy to get addicted to, it's like you're playing a game. 'I used to sit around reading a book and suddenly I was addicted to a dating app!' But now she says she has quit online dating, after penning a book about her experiences called Raven: My Year of Dating Dangerously and has revealed she has no shortage of offers despite being so frank about her sex life. 'I've deleted all my online dating accounts now,' she says 'I've got something out of my system - it was just a reaction to my situation and not something you can do for very long, you have to move on. 'There were some people who said ""who'd want to be with her now?"" but actually I have had lots of lovely messages from age-appropriate men, eligible men, who want to take me out so I don't think I'll have to go on a dating site again.' In her interview Monica also revealed she hadn't always had safe sex with her dates, but said even 60 years old women can be reckless.","Monica Porter spent a year dating men in their twenties and thirties .

"By . Jonathan Block . A police dog was shot in the face and the bullet traveled all the way through his body until lodging in one of his lungs during a shoot-out... but he miraculously survived. Bruno, a 7-year-old Sable German Shephard with the Anaheim, California, police was with his partner, Officer RJ Young, following an incident involving probation officers. When the probation officers arrived at the home of a man they were checking on, he was with two friends, who ran. Although the officers did not chase the men, one officer walked down an alley to see if he could spot them, Anaheim Police spokesman Lt. Tim Schmidt told KTLA. Veterinarians at Yorba Linda Regional Animal Hospital work to save the life of police K9 Bruno who was shot in the line of duty leaving a bullet in one of his lungs . When the officer found one of the men, the suspect shot three or four times at the officer, forcing him to take cover. They then radioed for backup from the Anaheim Police Department, who also sent a SWAT team in. Two schools nearby the scene were placed on lockdown. Nearly an hour after the police were searching for the men, Bruno found one of the them hiding by a trash bin in the courtyard of a nearby apartment complex, according to the Orange County Register. He then fired several shots at the dog and officers, with one of the bullets striking Bruno in the mouth by his jaw. At least one officer returned fire, striking the suspect, killing him. Anaheim, California Police dog Bruno rests after successful surgery to remove a bullet from his lung . Anaheim Police K9 Bruno with his partner Officer RJ Young . Police have not identified the dead man, his friend, or the probationer. However, they said all three are suspected gang members. The probationer was in custody, but the other man escaped capture. Officer Young took his inured partner to the Yorba Linda Regional Animal Hospital, where Bruno underwent surgery. Since the round entered Bruno's chest area, veterinarians had to remove part of his lung. Around 9p, Anaheim Police posted on their Twitter page that Bruno made it through surgery and is expected to survive. It is uncertain when or even whether he will return to duty again. With six years of experience, Bruno the most senior K9 on the force. Other police departments are sending Bruno well wishes. Thursday night, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck tweeted, 'Great to hear @AnaheimPD K9 Bruno is out of surgery. Well wishes from #LAPD for his full recovery and back to work with his partner.' Police in Denton,Texas also tweeted, '@AnaheimPD glad to hear! K-9 Gino & his handler as well as the rest of DPD sends our thoughts and prayers out to K-9 Bruno & his handler.'

"You would expect to find plastic in your lunchbox, not on Saturn’s distant moon Titan. But that's exactly where Nasa has found an ingredient of plastic - the first time the chemical has been detected on another world. The Cassini spacecraft found small amounts of propylene, a chemical used to make storage containers on Earth, in the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon Titan. Scroll down for video... The Cassini spacecraft found small amounts of propylene, a chemical used to make storage containers on Earth, in the atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon Titan. The moon has a radius of about 1,600 miles, is bigger than planet Mercury and is the second-largest moon in the solar system . Titan is among the few bodies in the solar system with a significant atmosphere made up of hydrocarbons. The discovery could help us better understand how chemistry works on Titan, which many scientists regard as similar to how chemistry operated on ancient Earth before oxygen became significant ingredient. The small amount of propylene was identified in Titan's lower atmosphere by Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). It is only present in a few parts per billion, and scientists would need to chain together the molecules to mould it into polypropylene plastic. Titan is Saturn's largest moon - with a radius of about 1,600 miles (2,574 kilometers), it's bigger than planet Mercury - and is the second-largest moon in the solar system. The atmosphere of Titan is largely composed of nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich organic smog. The climate -including wind and rain -creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. CIRS measured the infrared light, or heat radiation, emitted from Saturn and its moons in much the same way our hands feel the warmth of a fire. By isolating the same signal at various altitudes within the lower atmosphere, researchers identified the chemical with what they claim to be ‘a high degree of confidence’. ‘This chemical is all around us in everyday life, strung together in long chains to form a plastic called polypropylene,’ said Conor Nixon, a planetary scientist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center. ‘That plastic container at the grocery store with the recycling code 5 on the bottom - that's polypropylene.’ The Voyager spacecraft had previously found propane, the heaviest member of the three-carbon family, and propyne, one of the lightest members. But the middle chemicals, one of which is propylene, were missing . The detection of the chemical fills in a . mysterious gap in Titan observations that dates back to Nasa's Voyager 1 . spacecraft and the first-ever close flyby of this moon in 1980. Voyager identified many of the gases in Titan's brownish atmosphere as hydrocarbons, the chemicals that primarily make up petroleum and other fossil fuels on Earth. It detected all members of the one- and two-carbon families in Titan's atmosphere. From the three-carbon family, the spacecraft found propane, the heaviest member, and propyne, one of the lightest members. But the middle chemicals, one of which is propylene, were missing. It was finally found as a result of more detailed analysis of the CIRS data. Cassini's mass spectrometer, a device that looks at the composition of Titan's atmosphere, had hinted earlier that propylene might be present in the upper atmosphere . ‘This measurement was very difficult to . make because propylene's weak signature is crowded by related chemicals . with much stronger signals,’ said Michael Flasar, Goddard scientist and . principal investigator for CIRS. ‘This success boosts our confidence that we will find still more chemicals long hidden in Titan's atmosphere.’ Cassini's mass spectrometer, a device that looks at the composition of Titan's atmosphere, had hinted earlier that propylene might be present in the upper atmosphere. However, a positive identification had not been made. ‘This new piece of the puzzle will provide an additional test of how well we understand the chemical zoo that makes up Titan's atmosphere,’ said Edgington, Cassini's deputy project scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.","Discovery could help us better understand how chemistry works on Titan .

"By . Ashley Collman . A 36-year-old New Jersey woman plead guilty today to charges she killed a 2-year-old girl, nearly four years after the toddlers violent death. Sheila Polanski was babysitting little Madeline McHenry on July 5, 2011 when she shook the toddler to death because she was whining and Polanski was stressed out. The violent shaking caused Madeline to go unconscious, and it was revealed that Polanski didn't call police until hours later. Violent end: Madeline McHenry died in July 2011 after her babysitter Sheila Polanski shook her violently and then left her to die on the floor . Crying in court: Madeline's babysitter plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter in New Jersey court today. Above, pictures of Sheila Polanski tearing up during her arraignment in July 2011 . Lost loved one: Madeline's family also cried in court during the July 2011 arraignment . Madeline was taken to the hospital, but died two days later. In court on Thursday, Polanski plead guilty to charges of aggravated manslaughter. She initially faced murder charges and the possibility of life in prison. After her initial arrest, the girl's family said that Polanski passed the time playing a game on her Facebook account while Madeline lay dying on the floor. 'She threw her to the ground and then proceeded to go and play ""Yo-ville"" on Facebook because there were Facebook entries of her playing ""Yo-ville"" for the two hours while my baby lay there dying on the living room floor,' Maddy's grandfather Ted Helgren told ABC 6. Happy girl: Madeline's dad Dan McHenry described his toddler daughter as having the 'best personality in the world'. 'She loved everything. She loved to sing. She's just the sweetest, cutest little peanut on the planet.' If the charges weren't downgraded, she could have faced up to life in prison for murder. Polanski is due back in court on May 2 for sentencing. Parents Jen and Dan McHenry hired Polanski to take care of their daughter, and say she came highly recommended. It was only after Madeline's death that they discovered Polanski was on medication for mental health issues and that she had a prior criminal record. When Polanski finally called 911, paramedics found fresh bruises on the girls body which Polanski at first denied having anything to do with. She eventually copped that she shook the girl because she wouldn't stop whining and she was under pressure over a recent eviction. Bad babysitter: The McHenrys said Polanski came highly recommended. It was only after their daughter's death that they learned Polanski was on mental health medication and had a prior criminal record . Madeline was transported to the hospital, but taken off life support two days later and died. When Polanski was initially arraigned on murder charges in new Jersey court that same month, she openly cried in court. Madeline's parents also wiped away tears as they faced their little girl's killer. 'I don't know what was going through her mind or how she could pick her up and shake her and throw her across the room and kill my little girl,' Madeline's dad Dan McHenry said. 'She had the best personality in the world, very outgoing,' Mr McHenry added. 'She loved everything. She loved to sing. She's just the sweetest, cutest little peanut on the planet.'","Madeline McHenry, 2, died in July 2011 after her babysitter shook her violently and then left her to die on the floor .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A father's lasting tribute to his little girl was deemed too offensive by an Australian pub, which asked the man to leave for violating its 'no face and neck tattoo' policy. Andrew Lester, a 30-year-old professional photographer, was asked to leave the Alma Tavern in Adelaide while enjoying a meal with friends on Saturday night. Two security guards approached his table and gave him an ultimatum: cover up the large tattoo which reads 'Love Is Blind' - a tribute to his little girl - or leave. Love Is Blind: Andrew Lester's tattoo is a tribute to his young daughter, who was left blind by optic nerve damage, and was deemed offensive by an Adelaide pub . Andrew was told by two security guards to cover up the tattoo with band-aids - while enjoying dinner with friends . Mr Lester, angered by the pub's actions, posted an angry message on the Alma Tavern's Facebook page (below). The post has since been removed but dozens of punters have added messages of support to other posts on the page. 'I was honestly absolutely shocked, I was just laughing and said ‘you can’t be serious, surely that can’t be something that happens’, and they said I had to cover it up with a band-aid,' he told The Advertiser. Mr Lester was inked with the tattoo, which looms large on the right side of his neck, 18 months ago as a reminder of his daughter Juno's numerous health problems. Juno had just been diagnosed with optic nerve damage, leaving her blind. 'It was part of the healing process for me after receiving that diagnosis to say I’m proud of my daughter,' he said. 'It’s something that I want to be open about, which is part of the reason I chose to put it on my neck so when I’m with my daughter people can see it and understand the significance.' Mark Ricciuto (L), former captain of the Adelaide Crows AFL team, is a co-owner of the pub and himself sports several large back tattoos; Dustin Martin (R) is one of a number of high-profile footballers with a neck tatt . The pub is co-owned by former Adelaide Crows AFL captain Mark Ricciuto, who himself sports a number of large back tattoos. Mr Lester told the Mail Online he has since met with Mr Ricciuto, and while the pair have 'agreed to disagree' on the pub's policy, they have shaken hands over the incident. 'He's an awesome bloke. He copped a lot over the past couple of days,' Mr Lester said. 'I want to set it straight that it was in no way a personal attack. It's just an argument over policy. It has nothing to do with my daughter.' Mr Lester was planning to issue another Facebook post to declare an end to the feud, which he says has forced the club to review its stance on tattoos. 'They believe it's crucial to the safety of their patrons, that from their experience people with tattoos on their face, neck or head are more likely to cause trouble,' he added. 'I've never had any issues in the past. It came as such a shock. After returning home from the pub, Andrew posted this angry message on the Alma Tavern's Facebook page - demanding a formal apology . Apology: The club says it's sorry Andrew was left embarrassed by the situation and asks to meet him in person . 'I can't see the problem with it. It's not something I've come up against before.' Several high-profile Australian athletes and celebrities have neck tattoos, including Richmond AFL player Dustin Martin, Cronulla NRL player Todd Carney and former Australian Idol winner Stan Walker. Mr Lester's initial Facebook message read: 'I’m married with three kids and own my own business in the CBD so I am a respectable member of society, and to be treated like Im some sort of criminal really rubs me up the wrong way, simply because I decided to put a tattoo on my neck.' He posted a link on his own Facebook profile and encouraged his friends to get involved, saying 'Pls comment and share guys, this really p***ed me off'. The pub later messaged Mr Lester to apologise. Mr Ricciuto said: 'I understand his tattoo was one involves his daughter and is a sad story but security don't look at the individual detail of tattoos. ''We're sorry for the embarrassment caused to him.'","Andrew Lester, 30, confronted while having dinner with friends .

"By . Mark Duell . George Michael has revealed how he rarely left his cell while in prison during a traumatic experience that saw him ‘put in with the paedophiles’. The singer served half of an eight-week sentence at HMP Pentonville in North London and Highpoint Prison in Suffolk three years ago after crashing his car into a shop while high on cannabis. He said going to Category B jail Pentonville in September 2010 was a ‘horrific’ experience, before he was transferred to the Category C prison Highpoint, which is known for its easy-going regime. 'Horrific' experience: Singer George Michael, 50, has revealed how he rarely left his cell while in prison . Life on the inside: Michael spent three nights of his jail sentence in the tough HMP Pentonville in North London . Michael, 50, told BBC Radio 2: ‘Pentonville was really quite a horrific experience, and I was put in with the paedophiles and the bullied, I suppose. I didn’t leave my cell very much in those few days.’ The former Wham! Star added: ‘From the moment that last crash happened (I started to get sober) - because apart from anything else, I realised it had to be something to do with me. ‘It shook me out of my denial in a way that the others hadn’t, probably because there was a chance I’d go to prison. So from the day after that crash happened, I started in drug counselling.’ He told the Up Close with George Michael programme that he spent two weeks in detox, without making it public, and that his troubles relating to taking illegal drugs ‘feel so completely behind me’. Jail time: Michael arrives for his sentencing at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in September 2010 (left) and is pictured after his release four weeks later (right) Inmate: The singer was sent to HMP Pentonville after crashing his car into a shop while high on cannabis . Michael said he decided to end his relationship with Kenny Goss, his partner of 13 years, and added that his jail time led to a ‘burst of creativity’ that saw him write eight songs in less than three weeks. Following his release from jail in October 2010, Michael said that he wanted to 'start again' and stop running away from the press, adding: ‘You'll get sick of me. You'll see me about.' He said it was 'fantastic' to be free, that he wanted to 'go out', and added: 'It's a beautiful day. I just want to say thank you for everybody who has supported me in there, it's quite inspirational.' Michael was jailed in September 2010 after he admitted driving while unfit through drugs and possessing two cannabis cigarettes when he appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. How it finished: Michael said he decided to end his relationship with Kenny Goss, his partner of 13 years . Category C: The singer was held in the good behaviour unit of Highpoint Prison in Suffolk, which houses the most trusted inmates in the jail, leading to claims he was getting preferential treatment . He served the remaining four weeks of his eight-week sentence on licence, in addition to paying £1,365 in fines and costs and a five-year driving ban.

"By . Ian Drury . Sickening claims that British troops executed innocent Iraqis in cold blood were sensationally dropped at a war crimes inquiry yesterday. After a year-long inquiry costing taxpayers £22million, the case fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard evidence the insurgents were unlawfully killed in UK custody. Lawyers for the families accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight, dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, near Basra in 2004. The extraordinary concession came on the final day of evidence at the Al Sweady Inquiry into claims that soldiers mutilated, tortured and abused detainees. Sickening claims that British troops executed innocent Iraqis in cold blood were sensationally dropped at a war crimes inquiry yesterday. This photograph shows a soldier with Iraqi detainees . It provoked outrage that British troops accused of the most serious crime have had their names ‘dragged through the mud’ by publicly-funded lawyers. The collapse of the central allegation is certain to have severe implications for more than 100 others involving claims of abuse by British troops in Iraq. The public inquiry was announced in 2009 after a long legal battle between Iraqi  families – represented by Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers – and the Ministry of Defence. The Birmingham-based firm  has alreday been paid millions from the public purse. But in a statement, Public Interest Lawyers said: ‘Following the conclusion of the military evidence and current state of  disclosure by the MoD, it is our view there is insufficient material to establish  that Iraqi civilians were unlawfully killed whilst in the custody of  British troops.’ Inquiry chairman Sir Thayne Forbes said the statement was ‘of very considerable significance’. Last night Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded UK forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘Many in Iraq and Afghanistan have sought to discredit British soldiers for political purposes or have made claims for personal financial gain. ‘In some cases, these people have been wittingly or unwittingly looking to turn a quick buck at the expense of our fighting troops. ‘It is tough for the MoD, who are under great pressure to answer these cases, but to avoid wasting public funds we must be ready to make stronger rebuttal.’ Former infantry officer Patrick Mercer, an independent MP, said: ‘This drives a coach and horses through the very texture and core of this case. Al Sweady's father is pictured here with a photograph of his son . ‘I do wonder if our enthusiasm for prosecuting our own soldiers has been excessive. This has left the nation poorer and demoralised our Armed Forces’ morale.’ A Whitehall source said: ‘The taxpayer has been led a merry dance by PIL whose charlatan clients have, it seems, simply falsified accounts – all underpinned by  public money. Human rights lawyers have cost taxpayers a staggering amount of money.’ Mr Shiner, 57, has made his name pursuing British soldiers through the courts over alleged war crimes in Iraq. He has represented alleged victims of abuses by troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody. On Afghanistan, Mr Shiner led a legal case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, compelling the British military to keep Taliban prisoners in detention. He was awarded the title ‘Human Rights Lawyer of the Year’ in 2004. On his firm’s website, his profile reads: ‘Phil is a committed socialist and the roots of his career as a lawyer are firmly planted in the law centre movement of the 1980s.’ The Al Sweady hearing was examining allegations that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others after the battle at the Danny Boy base. It was named after Hameed Al Sweady, 19, one of those who died. The Iraqis had alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge at a camp and detention facility for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year earlier. The claims were strenuously denied by the Ministry of Defence, which insisted the men were insurgents killed in battle. Enemy dead would normally be left on the battlefield. The UK soldiers were apparently given an order to identify those killed to try to find the ringleader in the murder of the six Red Caps. In a statement, John Dickinson, of Public Interest Lawyers, said: ‘From the outset, the families have had the simple objective of discovering the extent of any wrongdoing and, if so, how it came about and who was responsible. It is accepted that, on the material which has been disclosed to date, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding of unlawful killing.’ The firm said there were still ‘numerous’ claims of abuse of prisoners for the inquiry to consider. So far, it has sat for 167 days and heard evidence from 281 witnesses, of which 55 were Iraqi and 221 from the British military. Some 15 Iraqis travelled to the UK to testify and another 40, including relatives and medical staff, gave evidence via videolink from the British Embassy in  Beirut, Lebanon. Closing submissions will be heard next month. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We have long said that there was no credible evidence for these allegations and are pleased that they have been withdrawn.’","Sickening claims that British troops executed innocent Iraqis in cold blood were sensationally dropped at a war crimes inquiry yesterday .

Now she's beaten her own battle with the bulge, she's on a mission to help others get in shape. Reformed: Josie has lost 6st since taking up exercise and changing her eating habits . Josie told MailOnline the first step on any weightloss journey is realisation - accepting you are not leading a healthy lifestyle and becoming aware of the impact that can have on your day-to-day activities and self-esteem. She explains: 'There were lots of times I wanted to lose weight in the past - I call . them ""wake up calls"". I think at the start of everyone's weightloss . journey it's important to write your wake up calls down and keep them in sight. 'My wake up calls were lots of things but mainly the abuse I was getting on Twitter from people I didn't even know; the time I couldn't do up a pair of knee high boots in plus-size shop Evans and the time I couldn't do a flying lesson my friends had bought me for my birthday due to my size.' The Bristol-born star said these wake up calls should then become your motivation to change your ways by exercising more and eating less fattening foods. Josie used to weigh 16st 7lb, left, now she's a size 8 and wants to help others on their own weightloss journey . For those that need a kick start to get in shape, she's running a number of GI Jane Bootcamps (or more apt GI Josie) sessions in Kent this April. Participants can book in for a few days midweek, at the weekend or for a full week where they will undertake fitness classes and learn about nutrition. 'The Bootcamp is suitable for women of . all shapes, ages and sizes who want to have fun, burn fat and educate . themselves on health and fitness. You will leave ready to take on the . world,' she said. Josie, a qualified personal trainer, will lead the sessions which will include military circuits, BoxFit and dance classes. She describes the boot camp as a ""fitness holiday"" where she will pass on the knowledge she has gleaned on how to burn fat through exercise and eating well - without yo-yo dieting. Work it! Josie leads one of the sessions at her GI Jane boot camp . Kick start to fitness: Josie and the GI Jane team with some previous boot camp participants . She said: 'I had tried everything to lose weight. All I ever wanted to do was beat my genetics. I've found a way of doing . that now and I want to show others the way. 'Changing habits and getting fit is no easy road for a person starting . their weight-loss journey. The key to everything is educating yourself, . setting realistic goal and loving the person you are.' She added: 'Forget fad diets! Nine out of 10 people on a fad diet will always end up putting weight on . again. The healthiest way to loose weight is to eat natural and clean . foods. The environment we live in almost wants us to be sick and fat. We . need to make a change together so the food industry changes with us. Josie said she will give talks on nutrition during the boot camp revealing how her knowledge of food has changed, helping her drop from 16st 7lb at her heaviest to a svelte size 8 now, weighing 10st 2lb. 'I will advise on how I shop for food, eating habits and all the little tips I've learnt along the way to keep fit and healthy,' she said. 'Some people think its all about the amount of calories you eat vs the amount of exercise you do, but it's so much more than that. Some of my friends eat the same things I once did, but will never put the weight on. It boils down to your genetics, what you eat, your environment, how you shop for food, how you feel about yourself, your addictions and all sorts of factors.'

She's also joining forces with ballet dancer Darcey Bussell for a day of mass participation exercise classes. Called the BIG BURN, the stars will each take centre stage to lead sessions for 1,500 people at a time. The fitness routines choreographed by Darcey and Josie have been specially designed to suit all levels of fitness ability. Strictly judge Darcey's session is a full body aerobic workout programme based on dance steps from ballet to the jive and Charleston. Meanwhile, Josie will lead a series of intense work-outs from her fitness DVD, '21 Day Fat Burn', which was released in January.

"By . Ian Drury . Graphic photographs of the Iraqis that British soldiers are said to have ‘tortured and murdered’ in cold blood were shown to an inquiry into alleged war crimes yesterday. On the opening day of the long-awaited Al-Sweady Inquiry, film footage of ambulances taking the bodies of the dead from a British base to a nearby hospital and mortuary – and of distraught relatives identifying their loved ones – was also played. Retired High Court judge Sir Thayne Forbes is examining claims that UK troops executed up to 20 prisoners, including a 14-year-old boy, and abused nine others after a  battle at an Army checkpoint in May 2004. Stand-off: A British soldier guarding Iraqi prisoners in 2003. Graphic photographs of the Iraqis that British soldiers are said to have 'tortured and murdered' in cold blood were shown to an inquiry into alleged war crimes yesterday . Iraqi death certificates for some of the victims documented signs of torture, including mutilation with several having missing eyes, broken bones and one man’s penis had been removed. The inquiry was told that one Iraqi witness said he saw one of the dead men have his eyes gouged out by a soldier with a bayonet. The allegations have been vehemently denied by the Ministry of Defence, which says the victims were insurgents killed in battle. The inquiry is named after 19-year-old Hameed Al-Sweady, one of those who died after a firefight between UK soldiers and  insurgents at a checkpoint three miles north of the town of Majar  Al Kabir. According to Army accounts, the soldiers from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were heavily outnumbered in the ambush but fought back heroically, mounting a bayonet charge at one point until the attackers were defeated. The inquiry is looking at claims that Iraqis were unlawfully killed at Camp Abu Naji and that five Iraqi detainees were tortured and ill-treated there, and at a detention facility at Shaibah Logistics Base. Long-awaited: Thayne Forbes, the chairman of the Al-Sweady public inquiry, arrives for the first day of the hearing into claims British soldiers mistreated and murdered Iraqi detainees during the Iraq War in 2004 . Jonathan Acton Davis, lead counsel for the inquiry, said in his opening statement that enemy dead would normally have been left on the battlefield. But soldiers were apparently given an order to identify the dead to try to find a man thought to be involved in the murder of six British military policemen in 2003. Examining evidence: Counsel to the inquiry Jonathan Acton Davis QC (pictured) said in his opening statement that enemy dead would normally have been left on the battlefield . The Iraqis claim the British troops took bloody revenge for the Red Caps massacre a year earlier. Mr Acton Davis said: ‘It is the claimants’ case that not all of the 20 died on the battlefield, but that at least one of them was murdered by a British soldier after he had been returned alive to Camp Abu Naji, while other Iraqis were tortured and ill-treated.’ The inquiry began after a team, including 12 former Metropolitan Police detectives, spent more than three years compiling evidence. The hearing, in central London, was shown the photos of 20 blood-stained corpses taken by a British army captain for identification. Several were wearing insurgent uniforms and one was identified with the help of a card in the name of the Movement of the Mujahideen of the Islamic Republic of Iraq. The inquiry, ordered in 2009,  follows a legal battle by Mr Al-Sweady’s uncle and five Iraqis who claim they were abused by British troops after the firefight. Some 15 Iraqis will travel to the UK to give evidence to the inquiry later this month. A further 45 Iraqis, including relatives and medical staff, will give evidence via video-link from the British Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon. Evidence from military witnesses is due to start around September, continuing until February next year. It is hoped the inquiry report will be finished by the end of 2014.","Hearing to probe deaths of up to 20 prisoners in May 2004 .

"A monster great white shark has been caught and killed in waters just metres from where some of the world's top women surfers competed in an international professional surfing competition off an Australian beach. Eight women surfing champions including Australian Stephanie Gilmore, Americans Lakey Peterson and Courtney Conlogue, and Hawaiians Carissa Moore and Malia Manuel were competing in clear, pristine waters off a surfing point break called Snapper Rocks on Wednesday morning. One of the lifeguards on jetskis who patrol the waters for sharks during the competition spotted the shark, which was also reported by a swimmer. Shark alarm: Hawaiian surfer Carissa Moore was one of eight female professional surfers off Snapper Rocks in Queensland where  lifesavers spotted a great white shark which was later caught and killed . Monster: the 3.4m shark, a great white like the shark pictured (above) was lurking in waters off the spot where a professional surfing competition is underway, with champions from around the world . World champion surfer Kelly Slater competes on the Snapper Rocks surf break off Greenmount Beach this week, where a giant great white shark was caught and killed by fisheries officers . The competition finished early and the women surfers left the water because the quality of the waves was declining, Will Hayden-Smith of the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) told MailOnline. The ASP is staging a 12-day surfing competition in the Roxy Pro and Mens Quiksilver Pro, with professional surfers including US champion Kelly Slater and Australian triple world champion Mick Fanning. Queensland Fisheries officers later snared the 3.4m great white on a drum line 300 metres off  Snapper Rocks, on Queensland's Gold Coast, and killed it with a spike through its brain. Fisheries Shark Control Program manager Jeff Krause described the great white as 'a pretty big shark' with 'the potential for something nasty' for the board riders in the water for the Roxy Pro competition. Lives in danger: Shark control manager Jeff Krause said the women board riders, including Australian Stephanie Gilmore (above, surfing on the morning the shark was found)  were in danger from the 3.4m shark . Record numbers: around 80 sharks of different varieties including great whites (above) have been caught off the coast of Queensland in the last two months . Metres away: US surfer Lakey Peterson (pictured, above, surfing on Wednesday) and the other board riders were oblivious to the fact a great white shark was in the waters off Coolangatta . 'The successful removal of this dangerous shark from a popular swimming beach was particularly important given the Quiksilver Pro surfing competition currently underway,' he said. The ASP said the women surfers were 'aware of the risks' of competing in the ocean off Snapper Rocks, which is an internationally renowned surf break. The shark is the biggest great white to be caught off the Gold Coast tourist strip in more than seven years. Caught in the net: early last year, a tiger shark like the shark pictured (above), but measuring almost five metres long and weighing more than 500kg was caught by a deckhand off Coolum Beach . Cut short: Sally Fitzgibbson competing (above) in the Roxy Pro quarterfinals on Wednesday before teh competition was called off as the wave quality declined and, later, a large shark was discovered offshore . Swimmers at risk: Crowds line the beach to watch surfer Joel Parkinson compete in the Quiksilver Pro in a 12-day tournament where professional surfers 'know the risks' of shark attack . Shark kill controversy: the Australian public (pictured, above, at the Quiksilver Pro surf classic this week) are divided over whether to conserve shark populations or destroy killers  after ten shark deaths in three years . The great white is the latest in a record 80 plus sharks which have been caught by Queensland Government shark hunters off the coast in the last two months alone. One was a whopping 3.8m great hammerhead caught last month at Miami Beach, 18km north of Snapper Rocks, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported. The shark was slightly longer than a small car like the Nissan Micra, which measures 3.78m. Early last year, a giant tiger shark almost five metres long and weighing more than 500kg was caught by a deckhand off Coolum Beach, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. This week, a 4.85m tiger shark as caught off Townsville. Infested waters: US surfer Courtney Conlogue braves the surf in southern Queensland, where unusual shark numbers have been recorded off the coast . Hammerhead: this species of hammerhead shark was caught in net off Queensland last month a giant 3.8m great hammerhead size of a small car was caught off Miami Beach . Food for predators: Lifeguards at Greenmount Beach where Hawaiian surfer Malia Manuel competed  (above) on Wednesday say the giant shark is not surprising because of the 'beautiful, clear water and a lot of fish and a lot of bait around, so you expect to see large predatory fish every now and then' The pregnant female was believed have stalked board riders  and spooked surfers for weeks before it was caught, destroyed, measured and had its stomach contents examined, revealing several baby sharks. Mr Krause this week reaffirmed the need for drum lines, the baited hooks  attached by wire to a buoy which are used by fisheries inspectors to lure sharks, and for netting to prevent shark attacks on swimmers. He said samples of the great white were taken for research before it was killed and disposed of at sea. 'The shark  was brain spiked. It's quick and it's the most humane way to kill a fish,' he told  the MailOn;ine . Controversy over whether to destroy killer sharks has divided Australians, since Western Australia introduced a shark cull policy, following the deaths of seven swimmers off the Western Australian coastline between 2010 and 2013. The policy has drawn global opposition from conservationists and scientists, and public demonstrations around Australia. Marine activists such as Sea Shepherd have described drumlines as 'cruel, barbaric and unsafe' for whales and dolphins as well as 'endangered' sharks. Only four women remain in the Roxy Pro competition. The qualfying semifinalists were Stephanie Gilmore, Carissa Moore, Bianca Buitendag and Lakey Peterson.","Monster shark caught metres from women pro surfers off Australian beach .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Caitlin Hunt who died after being 'knocked off her scooter' and hit by a bus . A mother has paid tribute to her 'beautiful' nine-year-old daughter after she was knocked down and killed by a bus as she rode her scooter near her home. Caitlin Hunt was playing with her brother and a friend outside a parade of shops when she apparently darted out in front of the single-decker. Neighbours living nearby heard screams which 'went on for an eternity' and dashed to find her pregnant other Claire, 42, while paramedics tried to save her life. However,  by the time the mother-of-nine arrived, Caitlin had died at the spot in Swindon, Wiltshire - which is now marked with floral tributes and cuddly toys. Caitlin's older brother Aidan, 10, was with her when the accident happened at 5.50pm on Tuesday. It is the second tragedy to befall the family in recent months after Caitlin’s eldest sister, Jamie, died from pneumonia aged just 22 last October. Ms Hunt - who is pregnant with her tenth child - paid tribute to her daughter who dreamed of becoming a professional singer. She said: 'Caitlin absolutely loved to sing. She loved having her photo taken and videoing herself. Caitlin wanted to be a star when she grew up. 'She said when she reached the age of 16 she wanted to go on Britain’s Got Talent and was also going to go on The X Factor. 'She was always singing. She seemed to start when she was just six months old and then didn’t stop. 'Her favourite band was One Direction, but she loved everything really. 'She was always asking to borrow my make-up, saying she wanted to look like me, but I just told her she didn’t need it as she was beautiful enough. 'I’m just feeling empty at the moment. 'She was loved by all of her brothers and sisters and absolutely adored her 13-month-old sister Georgia. 'Aidan is very quiet but he is coping and wants to go back to school.' Dozens of flowers have been left at the scene, outside a row of shops in Blair Parade, Moredon, paying tribute to nine-year-old Caitlin Hunt who was killed after being 'knocked off her scooter by a bus' Dozens of floral tributes and teddy bears paying tribute to the 'beautiful angel' were today left at the scene of the collision in Moredon, Swindon, Wiltshire . A Thamesdown Transport bus, like the one which was involved in the collision with Caitlin Hunt, passes the scene where friends and family have laid floral tributes . Caitlin Hunt was believed to be out on her scooter with her brother and a friend when she was struck by the single decker Thamesdown Bus in front of a row of shops, pictured, in Swindon, Wiltshire, yesterday . Neighbours described the scene of the accident as 'carnage'. 'I was in my back garden and I heard this scream,' said Nicki Turnbull, 39. 'It was a girl and it went on for what seemed like eternity. I came out the front and it was carnage.' Another neighbour who did not want to be named said she called the ambulance to the small parade of shops in Moredon. She said: 'I heard just lots of noise and shouting and I thought it was dogs fighting. 'I looked out and saw the bus and called the ambulance. I didn’t know it was a little girl at the time.' Ms Hunt thanked residents who tried to help her daughter before she arrived. She added: 'Several people rushed over to try and save her and we are very grateful for that.' Fellow pupils and teachers at Rodbourne Cheney Primary School, where Caitlin was a pupil also paid tribute to the ‘popular’ schoolgirl, . who has been described as ‘a vibrant and passionate learner’. Shocked residents of Moredon, Swindon, Wiltshire, have been leaving tributes to 'beautiful' Caitlin, who was killed after being 'knocked off her scooter' while playing with her brother and friends . The youngster has been described as a 'a popular girl' who was 'loved by teachers, pupils and classmates' at Rodbourne Cheney Primary School, where she was a year four pupil . In a statement released on behalf of the . whole school, Rodbourne Cheney principle Denise Lyon said: ‘It was with . great regret and sadness that we heard of the tragic death of one of . our pupils, Caitlin Hunt, last night. ‘Caitlin, . a year four pupil, was a vibrant and passionate learner at Rodbourne . Cheney Primary School and her lack of presence in the future will be . noticeable. ‘She was a popular girl, loved by teachers, the pupils but especially by her classmates. ‘It is hard to imagine the terrible . sense of loss and tragedy, which is being felt by Caitlin's family at . this time and our deepest sympathies are with them. ‘The . loss will also be felt within the school by pupils, staff and parents . and we are grateful for the pastoral support being offered by the local . clergy, specialist bereavement councillors and The Samaritans.’ A Wiltshire Police spokesman said today: 'Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Team are appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision and have not yet spoken to police to come forward immediately' Caitlin Hunt was hit by the single decker Thamesdown Bus in Swindon, Wiltshire, shortly before 5.50pm yesterday.

"By . Rosie Taylor . and Sophie Borland . A third of intensive care  beds at weekends are taken up by patients critically ill from  alcohol, according to the NHS’s head of critical care. Dr Bob Winter said it had become socially acceptable for people to drink themselves into an ‘anaesthetised state’ on Friday and Saturday nights, and he also warned of the trend of ‘front-loading’ – becoming intoxicated before going out. The prices at supermarkets and off-licences were so cheap it was possible to buy enough alcohol to ‘die from’ with a £10 note, he added. Drunk: Dr Bob Winter, head of NHS critical care, warned of 'front-loading', drinking plenty before going out . Dr Winter called for an urgent change in the culture of drinking and said the Government needed to take responsibility for the problem by banning cheap booze. Official figures show that alcohol costs the NHS an estimated £2.7billion a year, including £1billion in A&E alone. Last year, 1.2 million patients went to casualty as a result of drinking too much alcohol – a rise of 50 per cent since 2002. Dr Winter said that last Sunday, he counted the patients in intensive care at five NHS trusts in the East Midlands. A total of 25 out of 85 patients had illnesses such as liver disease, conditions affecting the pancreas or were seriously injured as a result of drinking too much. Addressing the NHS Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester, Dr Winter said: ‘If you just go into the centre of any major conurbation on a Friday or Saturday night, you see people going into town in the state I would have gone home in when I was a student. Last year, 1.2million patients went to casualty after drinking too much alcohol - up 50 per cent from 2002 . Alcohol costs the NHS £2.7billion last year, and £1billion in accident and emergency alone . ‘People drink themselves into an anaesthetic state and their friends think it is acceptable. They think it is reasonable for an ambulance to come if needed. ‘People vomit all over the inside of the ambulance and then it is off the road for 45 minutes.’ Dr Winter, an intensive care consultant at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ‘It was never socially acceptable in my youth to go out and drink to the point of vomiting but somehow it is now, and that is just wrong. ‘We need a change in the culture of drinking. It must start with education. ‘It should be physically impossible to buy enough alcohol to die at 10am for £10. We laugh at America for having relaxed gun laws, but here you can go out with a tenner  in your back pocket. You can buy  a bottle of vodka that would take the paint off your car and then drink it. ‘Local authorities need to take some responsibility for the licensing of these places and the Government needs to take some responsibility in terms of minimum pricing.’ Plans for a lower limit of 40p per unit were dropped in July to avoid penalising responsible drinkers . Dr Winter said that on one New Year’s Eve, he went out with an ambulance crew and all 25 patients they treated were ill through alcohol. They included a student suffering from hypothermia after jumping in a river and a man on the street who was doubly incontinent and vomiting. ‘People think it is funny,’ he said. ‘There was a big group of people taking photographs.’ The Government dropped plans to bring in a minimum price for alcohol over the summer and has since been accused of caving in to the drinks industry. David Cameron had initially pledged to introduce a lower limit of 40p per unit, claiming it would save 900 lives by the end of the decade. But these plans were dropped in July, with ministers saying there was not enough evidence it would be effective without penalising responsible drinkers. It later emerged that ministers had held 130 meetings with drinks firms and supermarkets before the U-turn.","Last year 1.2m patients went to A&E after drinking too much alcohol .

"By . Katy Winter . Queen of the kitchen Mary Berry has taken to the seas and helped to break a world record in the process. The celebrity chef was part of an effort which saw the record for the most ships inaugurated in one day by one company. Mary travelled to Amsterdam to break a bottle of bubbly over one of 14 new Longships that were sent to sea for the first time yesterday; all part of the Viking Cruises fleet.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A paramedic's decision to stop trying to resuscitate a girl who had suffered a cardiac arrest after a severe asthma attack was ‘a gross failure to provide basic medical treatment’, a coroner has said. South Yorkshire assistant coroner Michael Mellun spoke out about the death of seven-year-old Izabelle ‘Bella’ Easen, who collapsed and died at her home in Thorne, near Doncaster. Paramedic James McKenna tried to revive the ‘lively and lovely’ youngster in April 2008 but pronounced her dead after deciding there was no sign of life. Treatment: Paramedic James McKenna (left) tried to revive Izabelle ‘Bella’ Easen (right), of Thorne, South Yorkshire, but pronounced her dead after deciding there was no sign of life . The coroner ruled yesterday that this decision was taken no more than 11 minutes after Mr McKenna started his resuscitation attempt in 2008. The paramedic was later struck off by a panel that heard how ambulance service guidelines stated all children should be given life-saving treatment until they arrive at hospital. Yesterday, as he delivered a narrative conclusion, Mr Mellun said he could not rule that the failures in the care of Bella amounted to negligence because the chances she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital were so slim. In his conclusion, the coroner said: ‘Whilst the continuation of basic life-saving followed by advanced life saving and conveyance to hospital would have advanced her prospect of survival, on the balance of probabilities it is unlikely she would have survived.’ Earlier, Mr McKenna told the inquest in Doncaster that he got the protocol wrong as he believed at the time that the requirement to always take young patients to hospital only related to babies. But he said there were no signs of life in Bella and he believed that taking her to hospital would not have saved her. The court heard that Bella had . suffered from a severe form of asthma for about three years and had been . admitted to hospital numerous times after attacks. Mr McKenna said he began life-saving treatment after he arrived from Doncaster ambulance station in a car on April 9 2008. Sad case: The court heard that Bella had suffered from a severe form of asthma for about three years and had been admitted to hospital numerous times after attacks . He said he found Bella on the bathroom floor. She was pale, had blue lips and no pulse, he said. The former paramedic described how he . began basic life-saving treatment with the help of a police officer who . arrived shortly after him. 'Pain': Lorna Robinson, Bella's mother, has said it was 'morally wrong' that she was not informed of the disciplinary action against the paramedic . But, he said, he could not apply any more advanced life-saving techniques because he was the only clinician there at the time. Mr Mellun told the court: ‘I am satisfied there was a gross failure to provide basic medical treatment.’ Earlier, consultant chest specialist Simon Taggart, who provided an expert review of the case, said the chances were that Bella would have died anyway. But he said that there was a 5 per cent chance she could have survived if resuscitation had continued and she had reached hospital. Dr Taggart said: ‘If she has a 5 per cent chance, that failing contributed to her death.’ He said: ‘I view it that children are robust and should be given every chance.’ Asked by the coroner if he wanted to say anything, Mr McKenna said: ‘I'm sorry the way things have turned out. I did what I thought was right. Whether it's down to training or not, I don't know. ‘If it could have been any other outcome, I would have had it that way. ‘If I had thought for one minute she hadn't reached that 20-minute limit (the minimum time paramedics should give CPR to adults before pronouncing death), I wouldn't have called it. ‘There was no reason for me not to have transferred her to hospital.’ The court heard from the two ambulance . technicians who arrived at the house after Mr McKenna who said they were . surprised he had pronounced ‘life extinct’ on the young girl. 'However you look at it, it's a pretty appalling set of circumstances that sees a child die at home of a condition as commonly understood as asthma and the emergency services are there within minutes' Mary Ann Charles, family solicitor . Dawn Holliday said: ‘I was very surprised. We left the ambulance running in the street and we expected to be picking up a child and taking them to hospital.’ Mr McKenna was struck off in 2010 after the Health Professions Council (HPC) heard about Bella's case and other, separate incidents - including one in which he ‘behaved without compassion, feeling or tact towards the patient and his family’. Bella's family only found out that Mr McKenna had been disciplined and struck off years later, after a Sky News investigation. The case is one of a number uncovered by Sky News in which relatives were not told about paramedics being disciplined after treating members of their families. Survival chance: A consultant chest specialist said it was very likely that Bella would have died anyway . Bella's mother, Lorna Robinson, was not in court yesterday but Bella's grandmother, Julie Hodson, said she thought Mr McKenna should have been prosecuted. Ms Robinson has previously said it was ‘morally wrong’ that she was not informed of the disciplinary action against the paramedic. Mary Ann Charles, the family's solicitor, said the verdict ‘brings an end to a period of unimaginable pain and distress endured for far too long by those who loved Izabelle Easen’. Ms Charles said that Ms Robinson spent years blaming herself for not doing enough for Bella. ‘In face she did everything she could,’ she said, ‘it was the health services which had failed her daughter.’ Ms Charles said the Yorkshire Ambulance Service had admitted serious breaches of its duty of care to Bella but still did not accept liability for her death due to the slim chances of her survival. She said: ‘However you look at it, it's a pretty appalling set of circumstances that sees a child die at home of a condition as commonly understood as asthma and the emergency services are there within minutes.’ Giving evidence in yesterday's inquest, Dr David Macklin, the deputy medical director of the Yorkshire Ambulance Service, apologised for not informing the family about what had happened at the time of the incident. He said procedures had been overhauled.","Izabelle 'Bella' Easen collapsed and died in Thorne, South Yorkshire .

"By . Rebecca Camber . Shameless: Gary Dobson was convicted in 2012 of murdering Stephen Lawrence . Stephen Lawrence's shameless killer has bragged from behind bars that a public inquiry into the case will clear his name. Gary Dobson, 38, is attempting to use an official review into undercover policing ordered by the Home Secretary following revelations that police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence, to claim that he has been 'fitted up' by corrupt detectives. In a series of bizarre rambling messages left on Facebook, the murderer currently serving life for the stabbing of the black teenager, mused that the development could be 'life changing' for him. The development comes as the detective suspected of acting corruptly during the initial botched murder inquiry emerged from his holiday hideaway yesterday for the first time since a damning report by barrister Mark Ellison, QC, suggested that he helped shield Stephen's killers. Ellison's review contained shocking allegations of police corruption, cover-up and evidence that an undercover police officer spied on the grieving parents of the 18-year-old aspiring architect, who was knifed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an racist attack in Eltham, South-East London, on April 22, 1993. The report did not challenge any of the forensic evidence which led to the conviction of Stephen's killers. Although it raised the prospect that undercover police operations may have led to wrongful convictions in other cases. But less than 24 hours after its publication, Gary Dobson instructed his sister Hayley to post this message: 'A message from Gary. 'Hello everyone, Finally the met police look like they are being held responsible for the monumental wrong doing they have orchestrated in this case over the last 21 years. Stabbed to death: Stephen Lawrence was killed by a gang of white youths at a south-east London bus stop in 1993 . 'The ""evidence"" I am sitting in prison for was corrupted and I now hope someone will be held accountable for this. 'The failings in this investigation fall in all directions, not all in my favour, whenever the surface of this case is scratched more revelations are revealed that bring the whole establishment into question. 'No wonder they fitted us up to take the edge, or focus, off of this travesty they have done to many family's (sic). Just how deep does it go?? 'In the mean time I am incarcerated for a terrible crime I played no part in, and my children grow up without their Dad. 'I look forward to this inquiry with life changing interest, and thank all you people for your relentless support, defeat is only bitter if swallowed! 'All my love Gary x' Jailed: David Norris was also convicted of murdering Stephen . Yesterday it emerged that Dobson, who was convicted in 2012 of Stephen's murder, along with David Norris, 37, has been posting regular messages on Facebook despite strict rules banning prisoners from going online. He manages to get his misspelt missives out through his sister Hayley who posts them on the Justice For Gary Dobson page, which has 858 members. In another rant the same day, he wrote: 'A lot of people out there ie. the police, media, government and any other secret service involved in this case need to be brought to book, heads need to roll. 'Stop the cover up.' Dobson's shameless bid to use the public inquiry to his own end is a bitter blow to Stephen's mother, Doreen who took great comfort in the fact that Dobson had finally admitted his guilt when he dropped an appeal against his conviction exactly a year ago. Then Baroness Lawrence said: 'It took me and my family almost 20 years to get justice for my son Stephen when Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of the murder in January 2012. 'In those years I had put my grieving on hold and had to struggle against police racism. It would have been a great comfort to me and my family if Gary Dobson or his accomplices had admitted what they had done. 'Now that Gary Dobson has dropped his appeal I can only assume it is because he has finally admitted he murdered Stephen.' Intervention: In 1997 the Daily Mail used its front page to name Dobson, Norris and three others of killing Stephen . But far from accepting guilt, Dobson's family and friends are now attempting to use the Ellison review to mobilise a demonstration to get the killer out of jail. His mother Pauline wrote: 'Corruption Works Both Ways.....Free Gary Dobson.' The Ellison review published earlier this month looked at whether the hunt for Stephen's killers was damaged by corruption. The QC said there was a high level of suspicion that Detective Sergeant John Davidson, who worked on the original murder inquiry, was corrupt and had links to Norris' gangster father Clifford. The former detective, who has run a restaurant in the Spanish holiday island of Minorca for 15 years since taking early retirement from the Metropolitan Police, has been in hiding since the review. But yesterday he emerged from his home sporting a deep tan as he indulged in some shopping.The National Crime Agency has announced a probe into whether Mr Davidson was in the pay of drug smuggler Clifford Norris. He could be questioned on suspicion of misconduct in a public office or perverting the cause of justice - both of which carry heavy jail terms. But the Glasgow-born 68-year-old, who was nicknamed OJ for 'Obnoxious Jock' during his time on the Met, has denied any wrongdoing, telling fellow expats: 'They'll never lay a finger on me. I've done nothing wrong. 'They've got nothing to do me for.' April 1993 - Stephen Lawrence is stabbed to death in Eltham, south-east London. Days later a letter naming the suspects is left in a telephone box. Police begin investigating.May-June 1993 - Neil and Jamie Acourt, David Norris, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight, are arrested. Neil Acourt and Knight are charged with murder, which they deny.July 1993 – The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) drops the charges, citing unreliable evidence.September 1994 – Stephen’s parents, Doreen and Neville Lawrence, launch their own prosecution against Dobson, Knight and Neil Acourt.April 1996 – The private prosecution fails after Neil Acourt, Knight and Dobson are acquitted of murder charges at the Old Bailey.February 1997 – An inquest into Stephen's death returns a verdict of unlawful killing, describing the attack as ‘unprovoked’ and ‘racist’. The next day, the Daily Mail accuses the five men of murdering Lawrence on its front page, adding ‘If we are wrong, let them sue us’.March 1997 – A police probe is launched into the handling of the case, which later highlights ‘significant weaknesses, omissions and lost opportunities’. Four months later Home Secretary Jack Straw announces a judicial inquiry into the case.February 1999 – The judicial inquiry reports back, and accuses the Metropolitan Police of institutional racism.September 2002 - Norris jailed and Neil Acourt are jailed for a racist attack the previous year.May 2004 – The CPS say they will not prosecute anybody for Stephen's murder.April 2005 – The Government scraps the principle of ‘double jeopardy’. This enables people to be tried more than once for the same crime.July 2006 – Police review their evidence after a BBC documentary into the murder. A year later they say they are examining new forensic evidence.July 2010 – Gary Dobson is jailed for five years for supplying class B drugs.May 2011 – The Court of Appeal rules that new forensic evidence means Dobson and Norris can be prosecuted again.November 2011 – Dobson and Norris are tried at the Old Bailey, where jurors her that Stephen’s DNA was found on their clothes.

"By . Tim Shipman . and Hugo Duncan . Nearly five million people will be trapped in the 40p tax band by next year, a think-tank said yesterday. Two million of them will have been sucked in since the last election, 1.4million more than would have been affected under Labour’s plans, it said. Those caught by George Osborne’s failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £546 worse off next year, according to the respected  Institute for Fiscal Studies. Osborne's failure to lift the threshold in line with inflation will be £546 worse off next year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says . But the Chancellor’s changes to Labour’s plans for the 40p rate, once reserved for the wealthiest in society, mean the Treasury has raked in an extra £3.6billion. If Labour’s plans had been adhered to by Mr Osborne, people would have begun to pay the 40p tax rate if they earned £47,845 in 2015/16. But the Chancellor’s curbs on raising the threshold means the tax rate will kick in at an income of £42,285 – a difference of £5,560. Doubts: Gemma Tetlow . George Osborne was yesterday accused of fudging his figures amid warnings that Britain faces even deeper spending cuts after the General Election. The Institute for Fiscal Studies raised questions over how the Treasury plans to pay for nearly £5billion of giveaways outlined in the Budget. The respected watchdog also warned that Britain is not even half way through the cuts required to balance the books. In his Budget speech on Wednesday, Mr Osborne boasted that unlike under previous governments his figures ‘are not fiddled but fair and independent’ as they are audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility. But the IFS said it was not clear how he would pay for £4.9billion of giveaways such as the increase in the personal allowance to £10,500 and tax cuts for savers. ‘The Chancellor is getting into bad habits,’ said IFS researcher Gemma Tetlow, adding: ‘Permanent giveaways are being paid for by unspecified spending cuts and temporary increases in tax revenues. And he is announcing spending commitments but with no means to pay for them.’ In total there will be just under five million higher-rate taxpayers in 2015/16, according to the IFS, up from three million in 2010 and 4.4 million today. That figure is 200,000 higher than recent estimates, suggesting the problem is even worse than Tory MPs had feared when they called on Mr Osborne to raise the 40p threshold in the Budget – demands he rejected. Another 350,000 people earning more than £150,000 a year will be paying the top rate of 45p, bringing the number of people paying a  tax rate of 40p or higher to 5.3 million in 2015. David Phillips, senior research economist at the IFS, said: ‘Our best estimate of how much it would cost to increase the higher-rate threshold to £47,845 is £3.6 billion a year. ‘This would then leave most higher-rate taxpayers £546.04 better off in 2015/16 than under the plans inherited from Labour.’ The 2 million people who are being sucked into paying the higher rate – those earning between £42,285 and £47,845 – will be worse off as they are paying 40p income tax and 2p National Insurance rather than 20p income tax and 12p NI on the difference. Someone on £43,285 will be £100 worse off, someone on £47,285 is £500 worse off. Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) think-tank, said: ‘Under George Osborne, nearly 1.5 million more  taxpayers are paying this rate. This  is an attack on aspiration and entrepreneurship.’ When David Cameron came to power, the difference between the starting salary for 40p tax and the country’s average full-time salary was £18,000. But research published by the Taxpayers’ Alliance says this gap has narrowed to just £14,400 today, a sign of how more modest earners are being trapped. Rather than being a tax on the wealthy, it has become a tax paid by ordinary workers from teachers to nurses, middle managers to Tube drivers. For married couples, the impact of becoming a higher-rate taxpayer is a double blow because they will also lose their married couples’ allowance. From April 2015, couples will be able to transfer £1,050 of their tax-free personal allowance to each other – but only if neither is a higher-rate taxpayer. Mike Warburton, a director at the accountants Grant Thornton, said: ‘We are now witnessing a groundswell from many hard-working families, who do not consider themselves rich, that enough is enough. ‘It is important that 40 per cent tax does not become the accepted norm for such families by default.’","Two million have been sucked into 40p rate since last election .

"By . Sean Poulter . Children are being targeted by junk food TV ads because companies like KFC and Haribo have found a way around controls, claim health campaigners. In theory, foods high in sugar, fat and salt are banned from being advertised around programmes that are specifically for children. However, food companies have resorted to targeting programmes in family peak viewing time, such as Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, X Factor, The Simpsons, and Hollyoaks, which have huge child audiences. Children are being targeted by junk food TV ads because companies like KFC and Haribo have found a way around controls, claim health campaigners . In theory, foods high in sugar, fat and salt are banned from being advertised around programmes that are specifically for children . Now, doctors, the British Heart Foundation, and the Children’s Food Campaign are calling for controls on the advertising of unhealthy foods to be extended until the 9pm watershed. An analysis of over 750 adverts found almost one in four TV ads shown between 8pm and 9pm were for food. Viewers were bombarded with as many as eleven junk food adverts per hour, according to a team of researchers from Liverpool University’s Department of Psychological Sciences. Within these food ads, the most frequently shown were unhealthy products from supermarkets such as Aldi and Morrisons, followed by fast-food chains such as KFC and then chocolate and sweet companies like Lindt and Haribo. Figures show that children’s TV viewing peaks around 8pm, but regulations created to protect them from targeted ads do not typically cover this time. An alliance of concerned organisations, Action on Junk Food Marketing, which is headed by the Children’s Food Campaign and the British Heart Foundation (BHF), commissioned the research to spur the Government and broadcasting regulator Ofcom to take action. However, food companies have resorted to targeting programmes in family peak viewing time, such as Ant & Dec¿s Saturday Night Takeaway, X Factor, The Simpsons, and Hollyoaks, which have huge child audiences . The researchers said the clips . analysed seem designed for a young audience, with nearly a third of food . adverts shown between 8pm-9pm using themes of ‘fun’ rather than more . adult concerns of price or convenience. Over half of the clips – 53per cent - used children or child-aged characters to promote their food. Around a third of ads studied ended with a website or Twitter hashtag - a key way of reaching teenagers, as thirty six per cent of 8-15 year olds use smartphones or laptops ‘most times’ when watching TV. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the BHF, said: ‘Parents don’t expect their children to be bombarded with ads for unhealthy food during primetime TV, but that’s exactly what happens. ‘Even when the show is over, junk food marketers could be reaching out to young people online. A lack of regulation means companies are free to lure kids into playing games and entering competitions – all with a view to pushing their product. ‘We want the Government to protect children by switching off junk food adverts on TV until after 9pm and putting rules in place to stop children becoming fair game for internet marketing.’ Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Parents don't expect their children to be bombarded with ads for unhealthy food during primetime TV, but that's exactly what happens' Professor Mitch Blair, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘Currently junk food advertising on television is banned during children’ s programming – but we know that millions of children are watching ‘family friendly’ programmes like the X Factor and Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway later in the evening. ‘And we know that advertising to this age group at this time, works;  not only are children and young people easily influenced and parents worn down by pester power, but food companies wouldn’t spend huge amounts of money if it wasn’t effective. ‘Extending the ban to 9pm would not only have a positive effect in changing behaviours, but it would also send a clear message to the industry. 'Children should not be commercially exploited and the advertising industry must take some responsibility for helping tackle the growing problem of childhood obesity.’","Health campaigners criticised junk food companies for targeting children .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . People living in the leafy suburbs of Guildford in Surrey can live up to 20 years longer than those in the city of Bradford, according to a new analysis of life expectancy. Boys born in Guildford and Waverly can expect to live to 70.3 years and girls 71.3 years but 220 miles away babies in Bradford can expect to live to only 52.5 years for boys and 51.6 for girls. It comes as figures show the traditional age gap which sees women outlive men has narrowed nationwide to less than four years for the first time. This map shows how life expectancy at birth varies across the country from the highs in the area west of London to lows in north west England . A baby boy born today can expect to live 78.7 years and a newborn baby girl 82.6 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said: ‘The gap between life expectancy at birth between boys and girls in the UK has narrowed from six years in 1980-1982 to under four years in 2010-2012.’ Life expectancy for men has increased by two and a half years per decade since 1980, but by only two years per decade for women, leading to the narrowing gap. When men reach 65, they can expect to live for another 18.2 years, a 40 per cent increase from 1980-82 to 2010-12. However women aged 65 can expect to live for another 20.7 years, a rise of only 23 per cent in three decades. A new analysis of heath areas reveals the wide disparities between different parts of the country. How life expectancy has narrowed . A breakdown of NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups, which replaced Primary Care Trusts in the coalition’s health reforms, shows where life expectancy is longest. The gap between the best and the worst areas was 17.8 years for men and 19.7 years for women. NHS Guildford and Waverley had the highest healthy life expectancy at birth for men (70.3 years) and women (71.3 years). By comparison, NHS Bradford City has the lowest life expectancy at birth, 52.5 years for boys and 51.6 years for girls. All 10 of the best performing Clinical Commissioning Groups were ‘clustered in an area to the south and west of London’, the ONS said. The CCGs with the lowest life expectancy were in the North, the Midlands and some ethnically diverse parts of East London. In 2010-2012 a man in the UK aged 85 had an average further 5.8 years of life remaining and a woman 6.8 years . The ONS said: ‘Life expectancy at birth in the UK has reached its highest level on record for both males and females. ‘A newborn baby boy could expect to live 78.7 years and a newborn baby girl 82.6 years if mortality rates remain the same as they were in 2010-2012 throughout their lives. ‘Women continue to live longer than men, but the gap has been closing. Although both sexes have shown annual improvements in life expectancy at birth, over the past 30 years the gap has narrowed from 6.0 years to 3.9 years with males demonstrating faster improvements in mortality compared to females.’ Life expectancy across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the last three decades. The ONS said: ‘In England life expectancy at birth has risen to 79.0 years for males and 82.8 years for females, the highest of all constituent countries in 2010-2012 . ‘Life expectancy for 2010-2012 in Wales has reached 78.1 years for males and 82.1 years for females while in Northern Ireland it has reached 77.7 years for males and 82.1 years for females. ‘Males in Scotland have a life expectancy at birth of 76.5 years and for females it is 80.7 years, the lowest of all constituent countries in 2010-2012. ‘The greatest gains have been seen in Northern Ireland where male life expectancy has increased by 8.5 years and female life expectancy by 6.6 years since 1980-1982. ‘The lowest gains in life expectancy at birth have been seen in Scotland. Since 1980-1982 male life expectancy at birth has increased by 7.4 years and females have seen an increase of 5.4 years. ‘Scotland continues to have the lowest life expectancy at birth of all the constituent countries for both males and females. ‘This could be associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption, a greater smoking prevalence and higher levels of cardio-vascular diseases in Scotland compared to the other constituent countries of the UK.’","Boys born in Guildford can expect to live to 70.3years, and girls 71.3 years .

"By . Michael Seamark . Disgraced NHS chief Sir David Nicholson wants to join a Press regulator to defend the Health Service against newspapers that ‘hate’ it. He was branded ‘the man with no shame’ after presiding over the Mid Staffs Hospital scandal, in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly. Much of the appalling care at the hospital was uncovered by journalists and whistleblowers. Resigned: Sir David Nicholson wants to join a Press regulator to defend the Health Service . Having resigned, he hopes to work with a new Press regulator to prevent so-called sensational stories undermining the NHS. The news was met with incredulity by one campaigner who helped expose the scandal. Julie Bailey, who set up the Cure The NHS group after her mother died following horrific care at the hospital, said: ‘This is exactly the job he should not be going for – so he can silence newspapers, silence whistleblowers and complainants.’ She hit the headlines after pressurising politicians to hold a public inquiry into Mid Staffs, which led to an announcement that the hospital trust would be dissolved. She added: ‘If it had not been for newspapers and journalists exposing him, he would have continued to live in the long grass, reaping harm on the workforce and patients. Former NHS CEO Sir Nicholson has been branded 'the man with no shame' by his detractors due to the number of stories that arose during the time of his leadership . ‘We want the Press to be able to speak out about behaviour like this, performed while he has been in office. He should have nothing to do with the public and the public sector again.’ Sir David, who had to retire early from his £211,000 post as NHS chief executive, leaves next month on a £110,000-a-year pension. He has been accused of presiding over a Stalinist culture in which staff were afraid to speak out about poor care. As head of West Midlands Strategic Health Authority from 2005 to 2006 – the body supervising Mid Staffordshire, he failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care there. Elderly patients became so thirsty they drank dirty water from vases, while nurses left wards in tears because care was so poor. When a report revealed that hundreds of patients may have died needlessly, Sir David insisted he was not ashamed of his record – comments that led to him being called ‘the man with no shame’. Whistleblowers who contacted the former communist were paid off and made to sign gagging clauses. The Government’s Royal Charter on Press regulation was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists. It underpins with statute a body to oversee regulation, with publications that refuse to comply facing exemplary damages in libel cases. Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up over fears that it would bring an end to 300 years of Press freedom. Instead, the Press is establishing an independent body called the Independent Press Standards Organisation, able to impose fines of up to £1million for systemic wrongdoing. Sir David claims to want to become a ‘non-executive director of the proposed Press regulator’ but did not specify which. He said he did not intend to prevent criticism of individuals in the NHS or to ‘stop the Daily Mail doing whatever it does’, but to protect confidence in it as it strives to publish figures tracking quality of care. He said a regulator would have an important role as the NHS tries to be more open about  failings, adding: ‘We’ve got to have a media and a context which is supportive of that.’ Otherwise, he said, coverage could result in staff being ‘frightened or hiding things’ which would be ‘really dangerous’. ‘My real worry is... we get attacked and what gets undermined is the principle of public services [and] public confidence.’ Asked if he thought newspaper coverage of Mid Staffs was motivated partly by a desire to attack the public sector, Sir David said: ‘It’s no accident is it that the people who led it hate the NHS?’","Hopes to work with Press regulator to prevent stories against the NHS .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A four-year-old girl who was hit by a mysterious polio-like disease that left one of her arms paralyzed showed how the condition still affects her on Monday evening. Sofia Jarvis, who was two when she was struck by the illness, smiled for the cameras and held up her paralyzed left arm as her family appeared at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California for a press conference. 'I was with her in the ER when she was having difficulty breathing,' her mother, Jessica Tomei, from Berkeley, said. 'I know we are so lucky that she's here.' Sofia became the first known case of the disease in 2012, and since, 24 other children between the ages of two and 16 have been hit by the disease. All suffered paralysis of one or more arms or legs. Scroll down for video . Life-changing: Sofia Jarvis, whose left arm is paralyzed due to a mysterious polio-like disease, is held by her father Jeff Jarvis during a news conference at Stanford University hospital in Palo Alto on Monday night . While their symptoms appear like . polio, tests reveal that none of the children have the disease that . plagued 20,000 Americans a year before a vaccine was created in 1955. Public health officials have not yet identified any common causes connecting the cases. The . illness is still being investigated and appears to be very unusual, but . Dr. Keith Van Haren warned on Monday that any child showing a sudden . onset of weakness in their limbs or symptoms of paralysis should be . immediately seen by a doctor. 'The . disease resembles but is not the same as polio,' he said. 'But this is . serious. Most of the children we've seen so far have not recovered use . of their arm or their leg.' This is the case for Sofia, who first developed what looked like asthma two years ago. Her mother told MailOnline that she rushed Sofia to the hospital after she started wheezing and vomiting. She spent four days in hospital after being diagnosed with asthma and was discharged - but Tomei said she knew something else was wrong. Struck down: Sofia, from Berkeley, California, had the first known case of the illness in 2012 . In hospital: Jarvis, who was two when she was struck by the disease, suffered breathing problems and loss use of her left arm. Her mother said she thought they were going to lose her . The toddler had full use of her left . arm when she left the hospital but 24 hours later at a follow-up . appointment, Tomei noticed the girl wasn't moving her left arm - and it . has remained paralyzed. 'You . can imagine,' her mother said at the press conference. 'We had two boys that are very healthy, and Sofia was . healthy until that point. We did not . realize what we were in store for. We did not realize her arm would be . permanently paralyzed.' Before the development of a vaccine in 1955, some 20,000 American children were infected with the illness every year. The virus mostly affected children under the age of three, which is why it was also called infantile paralysis. Polio is spread from person to person, mainly through ingesting contaminated food or water. Most who become infected with the virus are asymptomatic, meaning they don't even get sick. But one to five in 1000 cases can experience paralyzation. Most paralyzation cases are caused by spinal polio which leads to paralysis in the legs, and unfortunately for those who caught spinal polio before the immunization, there was no cure and paralysis was permanent. Polio has since been eradicated in U.S. and most of the world. Only three countries have had polio uninterrupted: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. In the U.S., children receive four doses of the inactive polio vaccine (IPV) to guard against the illness. Sofia has undergone intense physical and occupational therapy to restore function to her arm, but nothing helped. She had surgery nerve transplant in April 2013 but Tomei says the family may have to wait a further two-and-a-half years before they know if it was effective. Right now, Sofia's arm is completely flaccid and her muscles are shriveled from lack of use. Sofia improved little after her illness and now has a paralyzed left arm, weakness in her left leg and some breathing problems. Otherwise, she is a happy, healthy pre-schooler, and Tomei is grateful the mystery illness wasn't worse. 'We know we are lucky that the virus did not affect other areas of her spine as that may have caused paralysis of her legs or worse, all four limbs,' she said on Monday. Doctors are not sure if her illness was a . virus or something else. Van Haren said he has studied five . cases from Monterey up through the San Francisco Bay Area, including two . that were identified as the disease enterovirus-68, which is from the . same family as the polio viruses. He said there have been about 20 cases . statewide. 'We want to temper the concern, because at the moment, it does not appear to represent a major epidemic but only a very rare phenomenon,' he said, noting similar outbreaks in Asia and Australia. Van Haren, who diagnosed Sofia, said polio vaccines do not protect children from the disease, but he stressed that it is still important for children to receive that vaccine. Dr. Jane Seward of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said Monday that the research is still underway in California, and there are a variety of infectious diseases that can cause childhood paralysis. Concerned: Sofia's mother Jessica Tomei, pictured, said the family initially had no idea she would never be able to use her arm ever again. Sofia's father and two brothers (one obscured, left) joined them . Relief: Tomei added that they were just glad that they did not lose Sofia to the mystery illiness . Any of a number of illnesses could be . at work, and it's possible some of the cases had one infection and some . had another. Regarding the presence of EV-68 in at least two cases, ""it . could be an incidental finding,"" Seward said. Until officials get more information, Seward said they are not looking around the country for similar cases of EV-68. The . California Department of Public Health has not identified any common . causes that suggest that the cases are linked, said Dr. Gil Chavez, the . deputy director of the Center for Infectious Disease and state . epidemiologist. 'Physicians and public health officials who have encountered similar illnesses have submitted 20 reports to CDPH, and CDPH has conducted preliminary tests on 15 of these specimens,' he said. Mid-century disease: Iron lungs in the Hynes . Memorial Hospital in Boston during the Polio epidemic sweeping . Massachusetts in 1955.

"By . Andrew Levy . Teachers should not ignore children who remain silent or deny abuse, the Children's Commissioner has warned (library image) Child abuse victims ‘all too easily become invisible’ because teachers and social workers expect youngsters to tell them if they are having problems, the Children’s Commissioner is warning. Adults in schools and other professional settings have a ‘duty to protect’ children – but too often they take a child’s silence or denials as ‘a reason for doing nothing further’, Maggie Atkinson said. Young people often fail to seek help because they assume what is happening to them is normal, blame themselves for it or fear the consequences of speaking out, according to research commissioned by Dr Atkinson. Common sense recommendations in a report accompanying the research include adults ‘not relying unduly on children telling them verbally before providing help’. The report, published today, follows a string of tragic cases where children have died after suffering appalling abuse at home. They include Daniel Pelka, four, who was tortured to death by his mother and her partner when teachers, medics, social workers and welfare officers failed to ‘think the unthinkable’. Despite numerous referrals to children’s services at Coventry City Council, social workers concluded on four occasions that he was not at risk. In another recent case, Keanu Williams died after months of abuse by his mother. The two-year-old, who was found with 37 injuries, had been to A&E and his GP at least 12 times and nursery staff were made aware of signs of neglect and abuse. But agencies in Birmingham believed his mother’s claims that he had simply picked up bumps and bruises. A serious case review found they had been ‘unwilling to challenge’ or show ‘professional curiosity’. Dr Atkinson, a government-appointed adviser whose role is to champion the interests of young people, said: ‘Sadly, far too many children continue to suffer physical and emotional abuse and neglect at the hands of adults and far too many professionals with whom they come into contact, who have a duty to protect them, fail to do so. Dr Maggie Atkinson, pictured, wrote the report following a string of cases where children died after suffering abuse at home . 'Children often don’t understand they . are being abused. If they are old enough to do so, it takes incredible . courage for them to overcome the barriers to talk to someone about it. ‘So . those with responsibility for protecting them must take heed of the . practical advice and recommendations in this report and improve the way . they identify and work with children who may be being abused.’ Dr . Atkinson added: ‘Children all too easily become invisible. ‘If children do not talk about abuse, their silence is not a reason to do nothing further. The onus cannot be on them to come forward.’ Researchers found the most common way . that abused children came to the attention of their school or social . workers was through their behaviour and attitude, rather than seeking . help. Daniel Pelka, aged four, died severely malnourished after being starved in the months leading up to his death by his mother and stepfather . The report said: ‘It is important for professionals to notice signs and symptoms of children and young people’s distress at any age and not to rely unduly upon the child or young person to talk about their abuse. ‘A significant risk of reliance on verbal telling is that a child’s silence or denial means that abuse is not pursued.’ In the report, adults are advised to ‘be curious and concerned about young people who appear to be struggling’ and ‘be aware of the reasons why children and young people might avoid telling or deny that there is a difficulty’. Keanu Williams, pictured, died on January 9, 2011, after being admitted to hospital with multiple injuries .","Adults in a position of authority or care take children's silence as a reason to doing nothing, Children's Commissioner Maggie Atkinson has said .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Two senior NHS workers are suspected of secretly enslaving a man for a quarter of a century. Scotland Yard is investigating after a Nigerian man walked into a police station and claimed he was being held as a slave. Ofonime Sunday Edet, 38, said he has been held against his will since being trafficked to Britain in 1989, when he was just 13. 'Kept as a slave': Two senior NHS workers are suspected of secretly enslaving a man for a quarter of a century. Ofonime Sunday Edet, 38, said he has been held against his will since being trafficked to Britain in 1989, when he was just 13. File picture . Edet told officers he was enslaved by a couple in his native Nigeria who promised him work, lodging and an education so he could support his family. Instead, he claims, he was lured to Britain and forced to undertake menial tasks for years for little or no pay while being threatened not to speak to anyone else. He was inspired to break free by the national outcry surrounding the release last October of a group of women held in a cult-like Maoist ‘slave house’. The three women were rescued by a specialist charity after spending three decades in the thrall off an ultra far-left communist group. It is believed Mr Edet tried to break free several times before, including once as long as 10 years ago, only to be rebuffed by the authorities. After escaping he told police he contacted them before, as well as social services and an MP but was apparently told ‘there is nothing we can do’. Mr Edet’s two alleged captors, Dr Emmanuel Edet, 59, and his wife Antan Edet, 56, have been charged with holding a person in servitude and immigration offences. Dr Edet is a respected gynaecologist who worked for Surrey County Council and has written several academic works on child welfare. He is an expert on teenage pregnancy and who worked as a non-clinical adviser and is the author of guidelines followed by hundreds of health workers. Investigating: His alleged captors Dr Emmanuel Edet and wife Antan Edet, of Perivale, West London, are charged with holding a person in slavery or servitude and immigration offences following the investigation by Scotland Yard's Human Trafficking Unit . His wife is a senior ward manager at Ealing Hospital, less than four miles from their modern terraced home in Perivale, North West London. Neighbours reacted with shock to their arrest last night, describing them as a ‘perfectly ordinary couple’ with whom they exchanged gifts at Christmas. One said he regularly saw their man who . claims he was a slave sweeping the path in front of their house and . carrying out errands. He said: ‘It is hard to believe this can be true. Everyone assumed the man was their grown-up son, who simply never left home. ‘I would often say ‘hello’ to him outside the house. He certainly never said anything to me about being held against his will.’ He told investigators that he fell into the hands of his alleged captors after his father died when he was a young boy in Nigeria and he was forced to support his younger siblings. He claims he was promised an education and work in Europe and first travelled to Israel before arriving in Britain on New Year’s Eve 1989. Senior NHS workers: Mrs Edet is a senior ward nurse at Ealing Hospital (pictured) while her husband is a leading gynaecologist and has previously worked for Surrey County Council . By this time his name had been changed to include the surname Edet and he was added to the family passport. Dr Edet and his wife have two sons who police are yet to track down. The family moved around Britain, staying in Caterham, Scarborough and the West Midlands before settling in their rented Perivale home in 2001. Mr Edet claims he was stopped from going to school and banned from speaking to anyone as he spent up to 17 hours a day cooking and cleaning. Investigators were told he feared he would be deported as an illegal immigrant if he spoke out and he had not money or other means of survival. He finally contacted police shortly before Christmas after hearing a report about the Maoist cult on the radio. The Edet family had travelled to Nigeria for a festive break and he was left alone, monitored by a CCTV camera. A Met spokesman confirmed the couple have been charged with holding a person in slavery or servitude following an operation by its Human Trafficking Unit. Dr Edet and his wife deny the offences. They face a maximum sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and will appear at Harrow Crown Court later this month.

"By . Peter Campbell . Tax dodgers who refuse to cough up could have their bank accounts raided by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs after stronger powers were handed to the taxman. A raft of radical measures unveiled by George Osborne is expected to rake in an additional £4bn for HMRC. This is part of a wider international effort to clamp down on individuals and companies that avoid tax, with Britain vowing to lead the way. The Chancellor declared: ‘The public tolerance for those who do not pay their fair share evaporated long ago – but we’ve had to wait for this government before there was proper action.' Anyone owing more than £1,000 in tax or tax credits could see their bank account raided if they have been contacted several times and are able to pay. At least £5,000 would be left in an account, the Chancellor said, as he ramped up HMRC’s debt collection powers. The move brings Britain into line with France and the US, which both have similar systems. Companies that shift profits overseas by borrowing from divisions based in offshore tax havens will also be hammered by the changes. Mr Osborne said he ‘will block transfers of profits between companies within groups to avoid tax’. The heavily criticised technique has been used by a host of overseas firms such as Thames Water, Npower and Starbucks to reduce UK tax bills. Chancellor George Osborne said public tolerance for those who do not pay their fair share evaporated long ago . But critics said the move could hit some large international companies not trying to avoid tax. Eloise Walker, partner at Pinsent Masons law firm, said: ‘This draft legislation is drafted extremely broadly, meaning any profit transfer between two companies in a group that incurs any tax advantage at all will potentially be subject to UK tax, even if it has already been taxed overseas.’ The number of registered tax avoidance schemes has halved, while the amount collected by Government through compliance has doubled, Osborne said. Now anyone found to be using personal tax avoidance schemes queried by HMRC must pay back the disputed sum immediately – and will only be reimbursed if the scheme is found to be legal. Previously tax avoiders only had to pay up if their case was struck down by the courts. ‘If people feel they’ve been wronged, they can of course go to court,’ said Osborne. ‘If they win, they get their money back with interest.’ Tax experts said the move would deter the wealthy from entering into such schemes. Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte, said: ‘It will reduce the individuals doing these schemes because if you don’t get an immediate cash benefit there’s nowhere near so many people who will do a scheme.’ The new rules will apply retrospectively, meaning investors who participated in the schemes in the past – which could stretch back as far as 2004 – and are involved in a dispute with the authorities are likely to be asked to pay their bill come July. The Chancellor also pledged to stop people – often foreign nationals – avoiding stamp duty by owning homes through a company. From midnight anyone buying a home worth £500,000 or more through a company must now pay 15 per cent stamp duty.","Osborne says public tolerance with tax dodgers evaporated long ago .

"By . Tara Brady . A careless council has been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after it painted new white lines on a potholed road before covering them over with tarmac. Flood water had ravaged Whiteway Road, in Kent, leaving it pockmarked with dozens of dangerous craters. Kent County Council workers arrived but ignored the potholes and instead painted new white lines through them - only to return days later to re-tarmac the whole road. Before: Council staff went to Whiteway Road to re-paint the white lines but ignored the potholes . After: Despite painting new white lines, workers were called back to the street days later to re-tarmac the road . Taxi driver Neil McLennan, 42, of Queenborough, Kent, said: 'It’s shocking. Why can’t they set it up where somebody does the potholes first and then paint the lines? 'However much it costs to fill in the lines on the road they are going to have to do it again. 'Kent Highways is always saying, well we haven’t got the money to repair the roads. Well stop wasting it then. It’s really not rocket science.' A spokesman from Kent County Council yesterday admitted it should have painted the road markings after the repair work was completed and pledged to spend another £3million tackling potholes in the county. He said: 'We have just experienced the wettest winter on record. In many cases we’ve seen a week’s rain fall in just a few hours, leading to widespread flooding and high water levels. This has led to an increase in potholes. 'We are poised to begin a countywide drive to fix potholes now that the weather is becoming drier. 'In this instance the white-lining, which was also essential maintenance work, should have followed the pothole repairs that have now taken place in Whiteway Road, Queenborough.'","Flood water had ruined Whiteway Road, in Kent, leaving it pockmarked .

"By . Ruth Sunderland . A rogue trader has been fined nearly £700,000 by City watchdogs for trying to cash in on the Bank of England’s efforts to rescue the British economy. Mark Stevenson, a former dealer at City bank Credit Suisse, attempted to exploit the Bank’s Quantitative Easing (QE) programme – which involves injecting newly-minted money into the economy to boost growth – for his own personal gain. In a telephone conversation with another trader, he described the QE operation as ‘cake’, meaning an easy way to make profit. ‘We’ve been loading up with QE trades for months…..QE’s are cake,’ he said. Mark Stevenson, a former dealer at City bank Credit Suisse, pictured, attempted to exploit the Bank¿s Quantitative Easing programme - which involves injecting newly-minted money into the economy to boost growth - for his own personal gain . The errant dealer planned to sell his £1.2bn holding to the Bank, having driven it up to an artificially high price. His actions that could have cheated taxpayers out of millions of pounds if it had subsequently had to be sold at a loss. But he was thwarted within less than an hour of his attempts to rig the bond market when rivals reported his unusual trades to the authorites. Stevenson, a seasoned dealer with nearly 30 years experience, was fined £662,700 by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  and banned from the industry. His fine would have been £946,800 but he qualified for a 30pc discount by agreeing to settle at an early stage of the investigation. The regulator said this was ‘the action of one trader on one day’ and that there was no evidence of collusion with traders at other banks. But it is the latest in a line of market abuse scandals that have rocked the City. Big banks have already been fined billions of pounds for rigging Libor interest rates and are under investigation for suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. In an attempt to stamp out the wave of malpractice, the Bank appointed Minouche Shafik as the new deputy governor to police financial markets. The FCA said Stevenson’s attempt to manipulate the gilt market was ‘particularly egregious.’ ‘Stevenson’s abuse took advantage of a policy designed to boost the economy with no regard for the potential consequences for other market participants and ultimately for UK taxpayers. He has paid a heavy price for his actions,’ said Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement. The fine is the first time regulators have taken action over malpractice in the market for ‘gilts’, which are IOUs issued by the UK government. The Bank of England carries out its QE operations by buying up gilts from traders, pension funds and other investors. The cash paid to the sellers is injected into the economy, where it helps the flow of money to firms, which in turn stimulates growth. Stevenson was attempting to cash in on the process by cornering the market in key gilts, in order to sell them to the Bank at a hefty gain. Stevenson, a seasoned dealer with nearly 30 years experience in the city, pictured, was fined £662,700 by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and banned from the industry . He gradually accumulated a huge stake worth more than £500m between 1st July and 5 October 2011. On Thursday 6 October, the Bank announced it would start a fresh bout of QE on 10 October. Between 9am and 2.30pm on that day, Stevenson amassed another £331m of the gilts, accounting for more than 92pc of turnover that day. He then offered to sell £850m of the gilts to the Bank, at a price that had been pushed higher by his own dealings. Bank officials ‘identified the highly unusual price movement’ and declined to buy. The FCA  declined to comment on how much profit Stevenson  could have made if his ruse had come off, but the figure is likely to have been in the millions. The profits would have accrued to his employer, Credit Suisse, but would have helped boost his bonus. Credit Suisse said: ‘We agree with the FCA’s decision to sanction Mr Stevenson and are pleased to note that neither Credit Suisse nor any other employed individuals have been found at fault. The bank cooperated fully with the investigations into this matter by the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority.’ Stevenson was employed by Credit Suisse from 2008 and was suspended in October 2012. He left the bank in December 2013. Prior to that, he worked at RBS.","Mark Stevenson a former dealer at City bank Credit Suisse .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A mother has admitted pulling off her baby daughter’s finger and toe nails in an horrific year-long campaign of abuse. The 26 year-old began hurting the child when she was just six months old. Suspicions were first aroused when the child’s GP noticed the injuries to her nails in August 2010. Horrific: The 26-year-old mother, whose child has been taken into care, appeared at Peterborough Crown Court (pictured) The mother initially claimed her baby was suffering from infected nails, but doctors found there was no medical cause for the injuries. The woman, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. was arrested and charged with wounding with intent. Shocking: The mother cannot be named to protect her child (photo posed by models) She was due to stand trial later this year, but changed her plea to guilty on Monday at Peterborough Crown Court. The woman spoke only to confirm her name and whisper her plea of 'guilty'. The court ruled that the woman cannot be named in the media to protect the identity of her child, who was taken into care in 2011. Graham Huston, defending, asked for the case to be adjourned for psychiatric and pre-sentence reports. He said he had concerns about the defendant’s mental health and had asked for time for expert reports to consider the defence of criminal insanity. Judge Patrick O’Brien ordered the reports be carried out after granting the young mother bail. He said: 'The granting of bail is no indication of sentence, and it could be a custodial sentence. 'However, a mental health order is also a possible outcome of the case.' Sentencing will take place at Cambridge Crown Court on May 14.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The 30 Somali teenagers - both boys and girls - all agreed: Female genital mutilation is harmful and the practice should be abandoned. But what they really meant, they revealed moments later, is that girls should have their genitalia cut - just not sewn shut. 'It's our tradition and if the girls are not subjected to suna(cutting) she will not be accepted for marriage,' said Asthma Ibrahim Jabril, 17. Teenage girls attend an after school club which the U.N. children's agency UNICEF helps fund. One of the discussions was the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) The students, who are part of an afterschool club in Somaliland which the U.N. children's agency helps fund, discuss issues like child labor, early marriage, and female genital mutilation in a classroom with several large hearts scrawled along the walls. UNICEF is weaving a delicate campaign to educate communities in Somaliland about the harms of female genital mutilation and to get leaders, who are meeting there this month to debate the practice, to denounce it. Child rights advocates in nearly 30 countries are fighting to reduce the number of girls subjected to the cutting of their genitalia, a practice that goes back thousands of years and that Somali practitioners often link to Islamic requirements. All 15 girls sitting opposite the boys at Sheik Nuur Primary school have undergone suna-the removal of the clitoris and the labia minora. They all said it was the right thing to do. Child rights advocates in nearly 30 countries are fighting to reduce the number of girls subjected to the cutting of their genitalia . Female genital mutilation comes in many different forms. The other form known by the Somali teens is sewing the vagina shut until marriage. Everyone agreed that this should be ended. 'I want it to be eradicated. It's an old tradition,' said Ikram Ismail, a confident 18-year-old in a pink headscarf and a black hijab. 'When my mother was young no one could speak about it publicly, but now people understand that it causes a lot of harm so that's why we talk about it.' Female genital mutilation can cause severe bleeding and problems with urination, cysts, infections, infertility and complications with childbirth, including an increased risk of newborn death. More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in 29 African and Middle Eastern countries, the World Health Organization says. In Somalia, the cultural expectation for girls to undergo genital mutilation comes down to sex and marriage. Men expect to marry a virgin. Debate: Teenage girls take part in an after-school club discussion run by the U.N. and discuss FGM . If a girl has not undergone female genital mutilation, she is considered unclean. 'It's that she is not pure,' said Charity Kinya Koronya, a child protection officer for UNICEF who was raised in a community in Kenya where young girls undergo genital mutilation. Her father would not allow the procedure to be done on her. 'You are stitched and not opened up until the day of your marriage,' Koronya continued. 'They say someone who is open, anyone can go in.' Last month about 60 religious and civic leaders in the capital of Somaliland - a semi-autonomous region in northern Somalia that has remained largely peaceful during Somalia's decades of conflict - attended a daylong seminar and debate on female genital mutilation. Sheik Khalil Abdulai Ahmed, the government minister of religious affairs, told the room that female genital mutilation can lead to death, pain and mental issues. UNICEF is weaving a delicate campaign to educate communities in Somaliland about the harms of female genital mutilation . Amina Mohamed Jirde, the wife of Somaliland's president, pleaded with the group to stop genital mutilation. 'This practice is not good for the girl,' Jirde said. 'It is good for you to marry all the girls without discrimination.' Officials with UNICEF tried to underscore that they do not believe female genital mutilation is required by Islam, though it is not strictly practiced by Muslims. Haydar Nasser, a UNICEF official who is Iraqi by birth but now a Canadian citizen, told the leaders that they were following a custom first practiced by the Egyptians some 6,000 years ago, long before Islam was founded. 'So the question to you to discuss today is why as a Muslim practice do you employ a pharaoh practice, pharaohs who went to hell because they are kaffirs,' he said, using the Arabic word for someone who doesn't believe in Islam. Islam's holy book, he continued, says that human beings are created perfectly. 'So if a human is in a perfect way, why do we practice something that' alters the body, he said. At a small community centre made of metal sheeting in one of Hargeisa's lower income communities, two dozen women and girls, who have been in an education program run by aid group Tostan, and supported by UNICEF, spoke about their views on the practice. Amran Mohamud, 40, spent 15 years cutting girls. She remembers the girls who wouldn't stop bleeding. She remembers the infections that set in. After she began attending Tostan classes four years ago, she abandoned the trade, a profession she learned from her mother that paid between $30 and $50 per procedure. Mohamud carried out the cutting procedure on her oldest daughter. But her granddaughters will not have it done. Mohamud said even her mother is against the practice now. 'I reminded her of the problems we've seen,' Mohamud said. An imam from the small community in Hargeisa, Mohamed Said Mahmood, 54, said the world is changing. 'There are men willing to get married to uncut girls,' he said, while acknowledging not all men his age back his viewpoint. At the end of the daylong meeting that UNICEF had hoped would end in a decision to abandon female genital mutilation, the religious leaders - including the minister of religious affairs - say they cannot agree to abandon suna. The practice of female genital cutting will continue.","Students are part of an after school club in Somaliland which the UN funds .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Sensational breakthrough: Police are looking for a man who sexually abused young British girls in the resort where Madeleine McCann went missing in 2007 . Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are looking for a prolific paedophile who sexually abused five girls at holiday homes in the Algarve before the British toddler went missing. British detectives announced their astonishing breakthrough today as it emerged three of the reports linked to the same man were only reported to them after they launched a fresh appeal for information last October. The tanned, dark-haired man is suspected of breaking into holiday properties where British families were staying and sexually abusing five white British girls aged between seven and 10, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said today. The sex attacks took place between 2004-2006, shortly before Madeleine vanished in 2007, and are among a series of 12 break-ins to holiday homes in the Algarve that police believe were committed by the same man. In six of the break-ins, the man sat on or got into bed with young girls.  On one occasion, he abused two young girls in the same villa. Two of the attacks were in the resort of Praia da Luz, where Madeleine was staying in a holiday apartment with her family when she was taken. There were also four in Carvoeiro and six in the Vale da Parra, Praia da Gale district. Most of the attacks took place in low season, police said. They had previously been discounted by Portuguese investigators because they are spread over a wide geographical area and there were no apparent attempts at abduction. Nine of the 12 incidents were reported to Portuguese police at the time they happened, and details of three of those became known to British investigators only after they made televised appeals last autumn. Witnesses describe the man as having dark, tanned skin with short dark unkempt hair. He spoke in English with a foreign accent, his voice was described as slow, or possibly slurred. He was sometimes bare chested, some describe him as having a pot belly, and three victims said that he had a noticeable odour. On two occasions in Vale de Parra and Praia da Gale he was wearing a distinctive burgundy long sleeve top, on one of those occasions it was described as having a white circle on the back. DCI Redwood said: 'This is an offender who has got a very, very unhealthy interest in young, white, female children whom he is attacking whilst they are on holiday in their beds.'

Police said the suspect may have been . in the villa or looking round the villa for some time before committing . the offences or being disturbed either by a parent, or the child waking . up, and said he remained calm, even when disturbed. On two occasions, they said, the noise of a bin collection lorry could be heard nearby. DCI . Redwood said today that tracing the man is one of his priority lines . of inquiry. He said: 'We need to establish the identity of this man - these offences are very serious and no-one has been charged in connection with them.' Resort: Madeleine went missing from this holiday apartment at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz in May 2007 . He said some of the offences were previously known about, but three of them, including what is believed to be the first in the series of 12 break-ins, were new reports to police and came about as a result of their appeal for more information last October. Mr Redwood's team currently have 38 people classed as 'persons of interest' to the inquiry, and are also sifting through details of 530 known sex offenders whose whereabouts they cannot account for.Of those 59 are classed as high priority, and some of those are British. British investigators have so far sent three international letters of request to Portuguese authorities over the investigation, covering 41 priority areas for the team, involving 287 separate requests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt showed his anger at the slow pace of the legal process, saying: 'That's causing us frustration because we know what we want to do and we are ready to go with that. But the process is the process.' Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann posed two years ago with a picture of how she might now look . Another 30 letters have been written to other European countries, but the force would not reveal where. Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's disappearance in July last year - two years into a review of the case - and made renewed appeals on television in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany. After shelving their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance in 2008, Portuguese authorities said last October that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify reopening it.","Dramatic new breakthrough in seven-year search for snatched toddler .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The new 'Spanish supernanny' hired by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to help them look after Prince George has been named as Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. William and Kate are said to be 'delighted' that the full-time nanny has decided to join their royal household . The couple's new employee will be joining them and their young son on their forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand - and she will have been specially trained in self defence as well as how to 'skid pan' a car in poor weather conditions. Helping hand: The new 'Spanish supernanny' hired by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to help them look after Prince George has been named as Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo . A . Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'Maria is a full-time nanny, who . started work with us recently, and will be accompanying the Duke and . Duchess and Prince George to New Zealand and Australia. He added: 'We will not be giving further details on Maria or her employment, except to say that the Duke and Duchess are of course delighted she has chosen to join them.' Ms Borrallo trained at the prestigious Norland College which has been producing childminders for the rich and famous since 1892. The institution's students are known for their distinctive uniforms and are schooled in all aspects of looking after youngsters during their three-year degree course. The training costs £36,000 in total and the college in Bath recently added martial arts training and stunt driving to its curriculum to cater for modern clients - many of whom are celebrities and the super-rich. Tae Kwon-Do is believed to be the martial art of choice - which has been specially adapted to include how to dodge a potential kidnapped with a pram. Nannies are also trained in how to deal with paparazzi and are taken to Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire to perfect their driving skills and learn how to drive at high speed in any weather condition. Driving away from pursuing photographers being the main reason for the training. Ms Turrion Borrallo is from Spain and started working for the Cambridges a few weeks ago. Happy family: William and Kate, pictured at their son's christening, are said to be delighted the full-time nanny has decided to join their royal household .

Speaking about the tour of New Zealand and Australia he added: 'When they're out and about she will be looking after Prince George as she's been doing for the last couple of weeks.' Earlier this month it was revealed that the couple had chosen Ms Borrallo, who was described as a 'Spanish supernanny' to help them care for baby George. The nanny, thought to be in her mid-thirties, is believed to have worked for high-society families for two decades. Grandmother: The couple have often enlisted the help of Kate's mother Carole Middleton to care for baby George . Earlier this month picture emerged of the eight-month-old prince with a childminder in Hyde Park, as his parents holiday in the Maldives. It is not known if this woman was Ms Borrallo. Before news was announced of Ms Borrollo's hiring, a friend of the, then unnamed nanny, told Hello! magazine: 'She has worked with other prominent high-society families in the past. 'It was from there that the Cambridges heard of her and hired her. 'She is not married and doesn't have a boyfriend as her life is totally dedicated to the family she is working with. 'She is known for being totally professional - married to the job.' William and Kate have made clear they intend to be hands-on parents. They have often enlisted the help of Kate's mother Carole Middleton, as well as occassionally employing William's former nanny Jessie Webb. However, with their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, sources claimed the royal couple were eager to secure an aide.","William and Kate said to be 'delighted' the full-time nanny has joined them .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Bungling workmen accidentally recreated a famous scene from Only Fools and Horses by dropping and damaging a stately home's historic chandelier. The council contractors had removed the expensive crystal antique worth thousands of pounds from a ceiling so they could change its bulbs. However, while lowering it to be cleaned the workmen were understood to have dropped the chandelier, which hangs as a centre piece in the main hall of the 16th century Towneley Hall in Burnley, Lancashire. Before and after: Workmen accidentally recreated a famous scene from Only Fools and Horses by dropping and damaging a historic chandelier at Towneley Hall in Burnley, Lancashire . Life imitating art: The incident echoed the plot of an Only Fools episode where Del and Rodney were hired to clean chandeliers - but accidentally smashed one . It crashed to the floor and several of the crystal arms were broken - meaning the chandelier had to be taken away for repairs. The incident echoed the plot of an Only Fools episode where Del and Rodney were hired to clean priceless chandeliers in a country mansion - but accidentally smashed one. A spokesman from Burnley Council, which owns the hall, confirmed that the cost of repairs to the chandelier was £2,960 but it is covered by insurance. He said that council staff were carrying out routine cleaning at Towneley Hall when the damage to four crystal arms occurred - but added that the fall had been less dramatic than Del and Rodney's accident. 'Caring for all items in the museum, whether in the collections or on loan, is fundamental. 'This was an unfortunate accident that happened as the chandelier was being lowered to be cleaned. 'It was nothing like the Only Fools and Horses episode and any comparison is totally irrelevant and paints the wrong pictures.' Simon Goff, head of Green Spaces and Amenities at the council said: 'During a routine bulb change on the chandelier in the Great Hall at Towneley, slight damage occurred and the chandelier has been removed for repair and cleaning. Missing: The chandelier which usually hangs in the main hall has now been removed for repairing and cleaning . Return: Simon Goff from Burnley Council said the chandelier had suffered 'slight damage' and would be returned 'as soon as possible' 'We will also take the opportunity to re-wire the chandelier and it will be returned as soon as possible. 'The care and conservation policy for the museum's collections is followed at all times whilst carrying out routine work.' Councillor Roger Frost, who is also a member of Burnley Civic Society, said: 'It is a great pity that this has happened. 'People recognise it as an integral part of the entrance hall to Towneley. I hope something can be done to repair the chandelier. It is a really impressive piece.' The Only Fools episode Touch Of Glass was aired in December 1982 and was the first episode from the series to top 10 million viewers. Towneley Hall originally belonged to the prominent Catholic family of the same name. The male line of the family died out in 1878 and in 1901 one of the daughters, Lady O'Hagan, sold the house together with 62 acres (250,000 m2) of land to Burnley Corporation. The family departed in March 1902, leaving behind a building almost completely empty except for a couple of tables and a few pictures in the chapel. The park was opened to the public in June 1902, and in May 1903 the Great Hall and the south wing of the house were opened for a temporary art exhibition. Today the museum houses a variety of displays, encompassing natural history, Egyptology, local history, textiles, decorative art and regional furniture, together with an art gallery which focusses on romantic Victorian and pre-Raphaelite art, with some earlier paintings.

"By . Emma Glanfield . An illegal immigrant who smuggled himself into Britain on a fake passport has mounted a ‘human rights’ battle to stay in the UK - after fathering five children since his arrival. Mohammed Zulfiqar, 55, paid £15,000 to a mystery person for forged travel documents so he could enter the country illegally in 2002. But after spending 11 years in the UK he was arrested after he applied for a licence to get work as a doorman in the security industry and used the bogus passport to support his application. Zulfiqar, from Bradford, West Yorkshire but originally from Pakistan, was jailed for 21 months at Leeds Crown Court, pictured, for using a fake British passport to gain employment . Inquiries revealed the man named in the passport had reported it stolen, while a national insurance number quoted by Zulfiqar belonged to a dead man. It also emerged Zulfiqar had begun a relationship with a woman after arriving in Britain and had five children with her. Now Zulfiqar, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, is fighting a bid by the Home Office to deport him back to his native Pakistan. It is believed he may be using Human Rights laws to stay in Britain under the Article 8 ‘the right to famly life’ legislation. His partner is said to have ‘health difficulties’. All his children are under the age of six. Details emerged at Leeds Crown Court where Zulfiqar was jailed for 21 months after being found guilty of using the fake British passport to gain employment and possessing the Pakistan passport with counterfeit endorsements. Martin Robertshaw, prosecuting, said Zulfiqar’s home in Bradford was searched on August 28 last year and a Pakistani passport was found with counterfeit entries on it including one that said there was no limit to the period he could stay in Britain. In mitigation Zulfiqar’s lawyer Lisa Julian confirmed her client had five children under the age of six and a wife with health difficulties and was trying to fight deportation proceedings. The Judge Mr Recorder Keith Miller said the fake British passport was a sophisticated forgery and it was only an expert who was examining it in minute detail who would spot some spelling mistakes in the small print. The European Court of Human Rights in the French eastern city of Strasbourg . In January last year, an Algerian terror suspect was allowed to stay in Britain because a judge said he may commit suicide if he was forced to go back home. The 43-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was believed to support one of the terrorist groups which carried out the deadly attack on an Algerian gas plant earlier this month which claimed the lives of 39 hostages including six Britons. Mr Justice Mitting, chairman of the Special Immigrations unit, ruled that the terror suspect could not be deported because it would breach his human rights. In May last year, rioters Ubong-Luke Nkanta, of south-east London, and a second man, who has been granted anonymity, escaped deportation by citing their human right to 'family life'. Nigerian-born Ubong-Luke Nkanta, from Thamesmead, was jailed in November 2011 for 18 months for burglary during the riots in London. He argued his relationship with his two biological children in the UK as well as his current partner's children meant his human rights would be breached if he was deported. In September 2011, a Nigerian rapist escaped deportation after European judges ruled he had a right to a ‘private life’ in Britain. Akindoyin Akinshipe, 24, was due to be sent home after losing appeal after appeal in the British courts over his jailing for an attack on a girl of 13. But in a staggering reversal, the European Court of Human Rights said this would breach his right to a ‘private and family life’. But it had been spotted and when immigration officials went to his home they found the other passport with counterfeit stamps on it, including one purporting to be a visit to Islamabad. Recorder Miller said: ‘I believe you know very much more than you are prepared to divulge about the circumstances in which you acquired the British passport and the stamps on the Pakistani passport. What is clear is that you are in this country illegally. ‘There is no record of your having entered the UK and during your evidence you stated you paid £15,000 to an agent in order to come here.’ He said in the worst cases such false documents could be used to engage in acts of terrorism, although that was not the case here. ‘In this and similar cases to yours the misuse of false passports undermines the legitimate purpose of the authorities in seeking to regulate immigration and the influx of people who wish to use our health, education and housing services,' he said. Recorder Miller told Zulfiqar it would be up to the Home Office what happened over his deportation but it was open to his family to go to Pakistan themselves. Last year, 200 offenders - including rapists and muggers - successfully challenged their removal from Britain by citing Article 8 of the Human Rights Act.","Mohammed Zulfiqar paid £15,000 for a forged passport to enter UK in 2002 .

"By . Louise Boyle . A former business partner of a Romanian couple wanted by Interpol for an alleged $73million oil tax evasion said today that his dealings with the suspected fraudsters left him on the brink of losing his company. Doug McCrea, who runs a wine business in Yelm, Washington, first came into contact with Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, in the fall of 2012. They were introduced to the vineyard owner by Greg Simmons, a 'very nice gentleman' and marketing director of a mystical spiritual organization known as the Ramtha School of Enlightenment (RSE). Mr McCrea had known Mr Simmons as an acquaintance for several years after he attended an 'open-house' wine tasting at the vineyard. Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, are facing extradition to Romania to face charges that they dodged millions in fuel taxes. They were caught hiding out in Washington state where they had joined a spiritual group . Mr Simmons was then director of marketing at RSE but was retiring and taking on the role of the Nemes' business manager when he approached Mr McCrea in fall 2012 about investing in his wine business. Mr Simmons, 68, had reportedly . travelled all over the world spreading the message about . the enlightenment school which has levied accusations of being a cult. By 2008, RSE was widening its reach around the world to  countries including Chile, Japan, South Africa - and Romania. Doug McCrea almost lost his business after dealing with the Nemes - who have been arrested after being chased by Interpol from Romania for tax evasion . Mr . McCrea told MailOnline today that Mr Simmons vouched for the couple, . who were presented to him as ‘extremely wealthy’ and members of the RSE . community. The Nemes told Mr McCrea that they had made their money . from a variety of business interests – including oil. Mr MrCrea said that living in Yelm often means running into people from the ‘School’. He said his impression is that they are people of 'impeccable integrity' and that several of his winery employees were members of the . organization. The . School of Enlightenment was established in Yelms, a town of 6,000, in . the late 1980s and has grown to around 2,000 followers. The . RSE was established by female leader J.Z. Knight, a business school . drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico, who claims to channel messages from a . 35,000-year-old warrior. Her spiritual method claims to bring . together ancient wisdom with the power of consciousness and the latest . scientific discoveries. Ms Knight, (the J.Z. stands for Judy Zebra), . a 68-year-old who has three marriages under her belt, holds retreats . for her followers on private land attached to her French chateau-style . mansion. A promotional poster from J.Z. Knight who founded the Ramtha School of Enlightenment in 1988 in Yelm, Washington . The Ramtha method uses ancient wisdom and scientific developments, according to its followers . In 2007, her business filed profits of $2.6million from retreats, books, CDs and DVD sales. The . Nemes, who arrived in the U.S. in 2012 after reportedly fleeing their . native Romania following charges of tax evasion, settled in the quiet town, . far out west. It is then that they became members of the school of . enlightenment. They have two sons, aged eight and nine, and local sources have claimed that Mrs Nemes is pregnant again. Mr McCrea told MailOnline that despite being informed of the couple’s abundant wealth, they were quiet and unassuming. He . said occasionally the couple came for a glass of wine at his bar but . kept to themselves. He described Mrs Nemes as a 'petite blonde' who came . across as a very nice person. The wine-maker said: 'I take people at face value whether they are from Romania or . Nicaragua. They expressed an interest in investing in the winery and . said it seemed like an exciting thing to do.' Mr McCrea, who was looking to grow his business Eagleview Hill, LLC, agreed to a partnership with the couple. Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, established in 1988, is an 'academy of the mind' based in Yelm, Washington . Ramtha is run by J.Z. Knight (pictured) who claims to channel a 35,000-year-old warrior spirit . At . no point, did he have any awareness of their criminal past and is not . aware if Mr Simmons knew of the couple's previous shady dealings. A business plan was drawn up with lawyers and an operating agreement put in place by March 2013. The . investment was large enough to make Mrs Nemes a majority stakeholder, a . strategy which the couple claimed was essential to obtain her an E-2 . visa - which allows a non-citizen to stay in the U.S. if  they are a . majority owner of a business. Mr Nemes did not sign the business agreement. Mr McCrea said at this point the couple stipulated that Mr Simmons would come on board as the business manager of the winery. Mr . Crea said: 'He [Simmons] was planning to retire from Ramtha after 25 . years and said this gave him something exciting to do. I took it at face . value.' According to . business filings, Mr Simmons is listed as a business partner along with . Diana Nemes and Li Yew Heah on Magdalena Properties LLC. He is also listed on . a company called Mt Rainier Properties LLC along with Mrs Nemes and . James Capezio. Court documents show that the Nemes bought a home in Thurston . County, and were allegedly in the process of building a lavish property on the grounds with the . illegal funds, according to investigators. They also owned a a . restaurant and a large commercial property in Yelm. By October 2013, the cracks were beginning to show in the wine business partnership. The . Nemes met with Mr MCrea to tell him that they didn't believe that the . business was going well - despite the company's accountant confirming . that the winery was on track to meet its projections for turning a . profit. Mr MrCrea said: 'They basically said that the business was not what they wanted to do.' A . few days later, Mr Simmons showed up with a purchase-and-sale agreement . from the Nemes wanting to buy Mr McCrea’s whole company - at about a . third of the value of the company's inventory. One of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment retreats which encourages followers to 'become a remarkable life' A Romanian couple accused in a plot to dodge $73 million in oil taxes in Romania were arrested this week while living in Yelm in rural Washington state . He was told if he decided to sell within 72 hours, the couple would not stop funding the winery. Mr McCrea refused to sell the business which he started in 2006 – and abruptly the Nemes' funds stopped. Mr . McCrea told MailOnline today that he has not heard from the couple, or . business manager Mr Simmons since October. Mr McCrea believes that Mr . Simmons is still in Yelm as he has seen his car around town. The first Mr McCrea heard of the Nemes' shady past was when authorities came to his home this week. Radu Nemes, 39, and his wife Diana, 38, . were arrested by the FBI on Tuesday and are facing extradition to Romania to face charges that they colluded with a high-ranking . official to dodge millions in fuel taxes. According to filings, Radu Nemes . allegedly worked as part of a criminal gang to illegally import 1million . tons of diesel fuel and sell it in Romania through shell companies . between 2011 and 2012. The shell companies were set up in names of homeless people to distance the Nemes from the fraud. The massive tax dodge came by importing the fuel for manufacturing purposes then selling it directly to consumers. Diana Nemes allegedly helped her . husband by laundering money from the fuel scheme through Dubai accounts . and then bringing it into the U.S. At . least 20 others have been charged in the massive tax dodge, according . to Romanian investigators including a senior official at the national . customs office. The Nemes, who remain in jail, are due to appear in court today. Several calls to numbers for Mr Simmons went unanswered today. He has not been charged with any crimes. Although . Mr McCrea said that although the whole experience was, and remains, extremely . stressful, he has been left with an overarching sense of sadness, . particularly because the Nemes have two young sons. He added: 'They have created it, now they have to live it.' He said that although the wine business is a 'little tough' at the moment, he remains optimistic. 'We are realigning our priorities, we have to slow it down. But we can go forward,' he said. A spokesman for the Ramtha school issued a statement to MailOnline today saying the school 'has no information about allegations from the Romanian government or the student referenced. Mr Simmons retired from principal in March 2013 and we have no information about his private matters.' Ramtha's School of Enlightenment, which claims roots in the teachings of a 35,000-year-old warrior from a mystical land, was founded 26 years ago by a business school drop-out from Roswell, New Mexico. JZ Knight (born Judith Darlene Hampton in 1946) is the spiritual school's 'high priestess' after she claims that she was visited in 1977 by an entity named Ramtha, an ancient warrior who channels his teachings through her. Followers participating in an event at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment . Ramtha, the 'Enlightened One', marries ancient wisdom with neuroscience and quantum physics to allow followers to access their own 'direct channel' with God. Between 1979 and 1988, Knight traveled the U.S. having private 'dialogues' with students. In 1988, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment was founded on former ranch land in Yelm, a small city in rural Washington state. It is . an 'academy of the mind that offers retreats and workshops to people of . all ages and cultures', according to its official website . By 1995, Ramtha's school had an international reputation. J.Z. Knight was touring Australia, Italy, Japan and South Africa to spread her message of how students can use their brain power to 'Become a Remarkable Life'. The school has a 80-acre fenced compound, not open to the public, which is the site of retreats for students and staff. The 68-year-old religious guru's company, JZK Inc. posted profits of $2.6million in 2007 from these courses along with books, tapes and DVDs. In 2008, Ramtha's School of Enlightenment spread to 20 more countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and Chile.

"By . Richard Spillett . Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson 'set up the payments to facilitate' phone hacking, it was claimed in court today. The paper's former royal editor Clive Goodman made the accusation against his old boss on the fourth day of his evidence at the hacking trial. He also claimed Coulson told him he could keep his job if he told police he acted alone after his arrest in 2006. The Old Bailey heard claims today that ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson knew about phone hacking during his time at the paper . Goodman, 56, was jailed along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in 2007 for hacking the phones of aides to Princes William and Harry. Goodman told the Old Bailey jury yesterday that he felt he was 'being hung out to dry' after his arrest. Describing his feelings after he was taken into custody, he said: 'I thought...lots of other people at the NotW were doing this and I was the one that got caught. 'Andy Coulson actually set up the payments to facilitate all this'. After Goodman was charged, Coulson . rang him and tried to persuade him to plead guilty as soon as possible . and 'make a clean breast of it', he said. 'He wanted to know the depth of the police investigation and other names involved from the NotW,; he added. The paper's former royal editor Clive Goodman claimed Coulson told him not to tell police about other people's involvement . Goodman later described another meeting with Coulson at a cafe in Wimbledon, south west London, when his then-boss allegedly tried again to convince him to admit he was a 'lone wolf' and had 'gone off the reservation'. Goodman said Coulson promised him that if he pleaded guilty he could come back to a job at the NotW. He claimed Coulson told him: 'You could be one of those people who come back - it’s up to you.' Goodman said he was concerned about the dialogue between his lawyer and News International (NI) and claimed he was getting views of the company as well as the solicitor. On a suggestion by his lawyer to give papers on the case to the NotW, he said: 'I absolutely did not want a set of prosecution documents going to the NotW because I did not trust them - and newspapers are leaky places.' Former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks and her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks arrive at the Old Bailey, where they both deny the charges against them . The court heard that during a meeting about the upcoming case, a company lawyer told him he would not be dismissed as long as he did not implicate anyone else. If he named others, Goodman said he was told: 'You cannot expect Andy to take you back after that.' At a subsequent meeting about the case, Goodman was advised by another lawyer, paid for by NI, not to implicate others in a five-page mitigation document, he said. Goodman said that was despite the names of three more NotW staff appearing in prosecution papers as having contact with Mulcaire. He told the court that since none of them had been arrested, police must have taken the decision to 'stop at me'. He added: 'Despite this evidence, nobody was doing anything so I did not seem to have any choice.' Coulson, 46, of Charing, Kent, denies conspiring to hack phones and commit misconduct in a public office. Goodman, of Addlestone, Surrey, admitted hacking with Mulcaire in 2006. However, he denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office in the current trial. Former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, 45 – whose two weeks of testimony ended last week – also denies conspiring to hack phones, misconduct and perverting the course of justice. Her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, 51, denies conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over allegations evidence was hidden from the police.

Clifford exposed himself twice in his office in London in 1979 or 1980 after the woman went there for interviews about a film role, she told his indecent assault trial. Giving witness evidence at Southwark Crown Court, she said that at the first interview he exposed himself and held his penis in his hand. He then criticising its size, describing it as 'useless' and asking 'How can I satisfy a woman with this?', she said. In a bizarre twist to the case, Clifford's lawyers insisted the woman must be lying and cannot have seen his penis - which they claimed is actually 'average-sized'. He twice promised an Italian director would call her, but, she told the court, when a man with an Italian accent called her he also talked about the size of Clifford’s penis and invited her to join in with the abuse. She declined to do so, she said. During a second call she twigged that the Italian accent was false and realised it was Clifford himself and there was no film, she told the court, so she hung up. She said the experience had been 'strange', but she did not walk out when he exposed himself because in those days she 'didn’t stand up for myself'. Clifford with one of his legal team, who today told the court he has a 'normal-sized' penis . She added: 'Also...back in those times, as a woman, you kind of accepted that sort of behaviour a bit more than you should have.' The former model is not one of the complainants in the case. Defence barrister Richard Horwell QC told the woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, that because she described Clifford’s penis as 'tiny', she could not have seen it. He said: 'His is an average-sized penis. That shows you cannot have seen it.' She replied: 'I did notice that it was small.' The woman insisted Clifford exposed himself after looking at her modelling portfolio when they were alone in his office. She told the court: 'He got his penis out. He just undid his flies and took it out and held it and talked about it. 'He said ""Isn't it tiny and useless? How can I satisfy a woman with this?"" 'I was embarrassed, I didn't do anything.' The court heard today that Clifford exposed himself to a woman in 1979 and 1980 and made jokes about his penis . She said she refused to join in with the criticism, adding: 'Knowing me, I would probably have been nice to him, saying something like ""It's not that bad"".' She continued: 'He was normal, like he was talking about anything really, like it was normal that someone would take their penis out and talk about how small it was.' She told the jury Clifford promised that his friend, an Italian film-maker, would call her about a movie role. She told the court: 'I replied ""Yes, he did"" and then he began to insult Max Clifford's penis. 'I felt I was meant to insult Max Clifford's willy.' She said she did not join in but the man on the phone invited her to meet him and Clifford at the defendant's office for a second interview. She told the court that, when she arrived, only Clifford was there and told her the Italian could not make it. She said, she said, Clifford again exposed himself and insulted his manhood. Despite telling her partner and later some close friends what allegedly happened, she did not go to police until the day Clifford was arrested in December 2012, which she saw on television. She said she had been 'angry' when she saw him on television earlier that year discussing Jimmy Savile and saying that no-one asked for girls' birth certificates in the 1970s. She said: 'I thought he looked nervous and, when he said girls were just throwing themselves at pop stars...I thought he was trying to pass the blame on to girls.' Mr Horwell questioned whether the woman had even been to Clifford's office, because she could not recall where in London it was, or what floor of the building it was on. If the events she described had happened, he asked her, why did she not just walk out? She replied: 'I didn't stand up for myself. I was a very silly girl. I should have left but I didn't.' Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges. The trial was adjourned until Monday.

"By . John Hall . Death: Jimmy Mubenga (pictured with his wife) was being deported to Angola when he died . Three G4S detainee custody officers are to be charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of Jimmy Mubenga, the Crown Prosecution Service said today. Mubenga, 46, was on a British Airways flight bound for his native Angola when security guards noticed he was not breathing. The father-of-five later died in hospital. Officers Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig will now be charged with manslaughter after earlier inquest found that Mr Mubenga had been 'unlawfully killed' during his deportation. The G4S guards had been tasked with removing Mr Mubenga on a British Airways flight to his native Angola in October 2010. The inquest found Mr Mubenga died of cardio-respiratory collapse, where the heart stops beating and a person stops breathing. Prosecutors decided in July 2012 that no charges should be brought in relation to Mr Mubenga’s death. The case was reconsidered by the CPS after the inquest last year recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. Kaler, 51, from Bedfordshire, Hughes, 53, from Hampshire, and Tribelnig, 38, from Surrey, have been charged with unlawful act manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter as alternatives, the CPS said. However, G4S will not face charges of . corporate manslaughter charges after the CPS decided there was . insufficient evidence for such a prosecution. Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of CPS . Special Crime, said: 'We have completed a fresh review of all of the . evidence relating to the death of Jimmy Mubenga, including the new . evidence arising from the inquest, and decided that three men should be . prosecuted for manslaughter.' Charged: G4S detainee custody officers Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig have been charged with manslaughter after an inquest found Mr Mubenga had been 'unlawfully killed' during his deportation . 'There is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig.' 'Criminal proceedings are now under way and the defendants have a right to a fair trial. Adrienne Makenda Kambana, Mr Mubenga's widow, said: 'My children and I have waited a long time for this decision. We hope the CPS will now move this case forward quickly. We feel like we are another step closer to getting justice for Jimmy.' Deported: The G4S guards had been tasked with removing Mr Mubenga on a British Airways flight to his native Angola in October 2010 . Mark Scott, solicitor for Mr Mubenga's family, with Bhatt Murphy solicitors, said: 'The family look to the Crown Prosecution Service now to ensure that they prosecute the case with the rigour and robustness required by the evidence available to them.' 'It has been a three-and-a-half year struggle for the family to get to this point and they hope to get on with their lives once this final challenge is met.' Kaler, Hughes and Tribelnig will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on April 7.

"By . James  Nye . Convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff has said that he doesn't think he has got anything left to live for but refutes any suggestions that he purposely betrayed Jewish people in an interview given from his jail cell in North Carolina. Asked whether he was afraid of death, Madoff, 75, replied that he is not because it could never compare with being ostracized and rejected by his family for the shame he has brought them. The disgraced financier admitted his responsibility for the 2010 suicide of his son Mark, fighting back tears as he complained, 'The thing that was important to me was family, but that's all gone. That's more punishment than being incarcerated.' Defiant: Bernie Madoff has used a recent interview to unleash his opinions on politics and his enormous multi-billion dollar Ponzi fraud scheme . Madoff, who is serving 150-years in prison for operating a Ponzi scheme that is conservatively estimated to have stolen $18 billion, came clean to his wife Ruth and their children Mark and Andrew at the end of 2008. They turned him over to authorities, but the shame of his father's deception proved too much for Mark - who hung himself. 'I hold myself responsible for his suicide,' he said to Politico's MJ Lee. 'My grandchildren are without their father. That’s probably the worst.' Ruth, Andrew and Mark all have maintained that they were in the dark as to Madoff's enormous financial scams. For her part, Ruth has said that she regrets not cutting off ties with her husband of 54-years sooner - which her eldest son Mark requested before his death. Now she only communicates with Madoff about health issues - mainly his youngest son Andrew's battle with lymphoma. Madoff told Politico he believes in God and that he prays every day for the health of his family. He declined to talk about the last conversation he ever had with his wife, claiming only to understand his decision to distance herself from him. Madoff also turned his anger on Jude Denny Chin who sentenced him to 150-years for his 'extraordinary evil'. 'How do you give a 70-year-old man a 150-year sentence?' he asked. 'I think the judge is an idiot. For all intents and purposes, it’s a life sentence.' Indeed, it is Madoff's deception within New York's Jewish community which he sees as an unfair accusation too. Accepting responsibility: Police remove Mark Madoff's body from his apartment where he was found dead in New York on December 11, 2010 - in a recent interview his father accepted full responsibility for his son's death . Tragic: Mark Madoff and his wife Stephanie - his father Bernie Madoff admitted in a recent interview that the suicide of his son was all his fault and that the shame he has heaped on his family is the regret of his life . He was well known within Jewish circles in the Big Apple and his fraud hit many charities and individuals he knew for years. 'The thing that was important to me was family, but that's all gone. That's more punishment than being incarcerated.' - Bernie Madoff laments his multi-billion dollar fraud . However, during the course of the Politico interview he became annoyed at the suggestion that he singled out any particular group. 'I don’t feel any worse for a Jewish person than I do for a Catholic person,' he said. 'Religion had nothing to do with it.' 'I don’t feel that I betrayed the Jews, I betrayed people,' before adding, 'I betrayed people that put trust in me — certainly the Jewish community. I’ve made more money for Jewish people and charities than I’ve lost.' During the course of the rare interview given at Butner, North Carolina, Madoff boasts that he 'has freedom to move about the compound, where the cells are not locked at night.' He even goes as far to claim the prison is 'actually very pretty' and 'more like a college campus. Everything's provided for you.' Rejected: Bernie Madoff said that since his wife, Ruth (pictured) cut him off along with his surviving son Andrew- his life has lost all meaning . Dead to him: Andrew Madoff no longer speaks to his father Bernie Madoff - a move which has left the Ponzi schemer struggling to find meaning in his life . Madoff even makes the claim that he never wanted his deception to go as far as it eventually did. He said that losses he suffered in the early 1990s led to the Ponzi scheme in an effort to reduce the damage. He said he 'wishes people could understand' it was never his intention to deceive his clients for so long. 'I’d like to believe that there was something mentally wrong with me. It would make me feel better.' - Bernie Madofff on his weekly visits to a psychiatrist . 'I don’t believe I’m a bad person. I did a lot of good for people. I made huge sums of money for some people,' he said. 'It wasn’t just for money. I already had huge amounts of money. It wasn’t to buy yachts or homes. I had that from the beginning from legitimate money I made.' He added, 'There’s nothing to repent for. I already knew what I did was wrong.' Ominously, Madoff also claims that he is convinced there is almost certainly another Ponzi swindler out there. 'There’s always going to be bad players like myself,' he said to Politico. He also attacks politicians such as President Obama,  Hillary Clinton, Senator Chuck Schumer, Jersey Governor Chris Christie and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. He claims to have grown weary of their 'never ending' requests for cash for campaigns when he was still thought to be wealthy. 'These politicians take money from anybody — Democrats, Republicans,' he said in what is his fifth interview since being jailed in 2009. 'I basically think everybody would be better off… if people weren’t able to exert so much influence on politicians with money.' No big fan: Bernie Madoff said that he thinks the Hilary Clinton will make a terrible president and would not have voted for President Obama in 2012 because he is too socialist . Madoff claims that he voted for Obama in 2008, but now believes he is 'terribly disappointed' in the president and would not have voted for him a second time. 'His policies are too socialist.' Warming to this theme he attacks New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, claiming, 'I’m not a great fan of redistribution of wealth,' Madoff says. The fraudster also claimed he doesn’t think Hillary would make a good president. 'I certainly wasn’t impressed with her as secretary of state. Our foreign policy is a mess,' he said. Politico points out that it wasn't that long ago that Madoff lived in a $10 million duplex penthouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and had access to a private jet and 55-foot restored yacht. Now, he rises at 4am and is in bed by 8pm. He passes the time by reading and watches hours of television and listens to radio news. Loss of luxury: The apartment building that wasthe home of accused swindler Bernard Madoff on New York City's upper east side . He says the food is alright but he reserves special disdain for the chicken fried race at Butner, which is in his opinion, 'horrible.' Madoff makes about $40 per month keeping the living quarters clean as part of a five-inmate crew. He refutes the recent reports that he has kidney cancer, but does admit that he has a form of kidney disease that is under control. He says his recent heart attack was caused by a blocked artery but that he has had a stent put in place to correct it. 'I’m on so much medication — heart, kidney blood pressure,' he said. 'I never took a pill before I came here. Anxiety medication. I must take 14 different meds every day.' He also visits a psychiatrist once a week - for all the good he says it does him. 'I can’t tell you how many hours I’ve spent with the psychiatrist — to try to make some sort of peace with myself, to understand how I did it,' he said. 'I’d like to believe that there was something mentally wrong with me. It would make me feel better.' Madoff said he dreams of living a different life. 'I would go find myself an island somewhere with my wife, if she were willing to, and go fishing.' But he’s not sure Ruth would go with him. 'I don’t know. I would hope so.'","Bernie Madoff has claimed that losing his family is a fate worse than death .

"By . Leon Watson . Tormented: Helen Cowan, 26, fell victim to John Robertson, 45, when she was just eight years old . A woman has told how a secret letter she penned to an agony aunt revealing her uncle had sexually abused her helped to jail him. Helen Cowan, 26, fell victim to John Robertson, 45, when she was just seven years old. The abuse took place at her grandmother's farmhouse during holidays in Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire. Miss Cowan, of Edinburgh, wrote a letter begging for help and detailing her years of abuse to More magazine when she was 14. She wrote: 'For the last seven years John Robertson has sexually abused me. I am ashamed and embarrassed. Can you help me?' The note was never sent and lay hidden in her bedroom until her anxious parents discovered it. They contacted the police and Miss Cowan was interviewed about the allegations but no charges were brought against Robertson, her mother's brother. But after other victims came forward in 2011 police spoke to Miss Cowan again and her evidence has now helped jail her abuser. Miss Cowan, who has waived her legal right to anonymity, has told of her relief after her attacker was jailed for 12 years at the High Court in Glasgow this month. She said: 'I had a great childhood and loved going on holiday to my gran's farm. But my perfect family holidays soon turned into my worst nightmare. 'We were a close family and I always looked up to my uncle who lived with my gran as he was nearly 20 years older than me . 'I felt I could trust him because he was my mum's brother and he'd say I was his favourite niece and he let me sleep in his room. 'One day, when we were alone he came up and kissed me fully on the mouth. I didn't know what was happening and as time progressed so did his abuse.' Miss Cowan's agony saw her withdraw into herself and her behaviour became more erratic. She added: 'As the years went on my behaviour changed completely and I became withdrawn. When I got to 14 I decided to write a letter to an agony aunt in a magazine saying my uncle had been abusing me for years and asked for help. Convicted: John Robertson, 45, abused Helen Cowan when she was just eight years old . 'I didn't have a stamp so I hid the letter. But my parents were so worried about me they decided to search my room and found the note I'd hidden. 'I came home from school and my parents confronted me about it and I burst into tears admitting it was true. It divided my entire family.' Detectives quizzed Miss Cowan and Robertson about the allegations but said there was not enough evidence to press charges. But despite the set back and dealing with her own personal demons Miss Cowan steeled herself to face Robertson again after three other girls claimed he abused them. Miss Cowan, of Edinburgh, wrote a letter begging for help and detailing her years of abuse to a teen magazine when she was 14 . Detectives quizzed Miss Cowan and Robertson about the allegations but said there was not enough evidence to press charges . She said: 'The police contacted me and told me other victims had come forward. I was terrified of dragging up the past but I knew I had to speak out so I could finally get justice.' Robertson forced his victims to appear in court after denying he raped or sexually abused them between 1990 and 2002. He was found guilty of sexually abusing Miss Cowan and another girl and of raping two others. Brave: Miss Cowan when she was aged around 12 (left) and 16-years-old (right) Miss Cowan said: 'I couldn't believe he pled not guilty. I was so nervous but when asked if I wanted to sit behind a screen I said no as I wanted to face him. 'And for the first time in years I looked him straight in the eye and thought, â€˜You took so much away from me and you deserve to be punished.' 'When I heard he had been found guilty, I wept with joy and relief. No amount of time will make up for what he took away but now he will lose years of his life like the ones he took from me.' Judge Michael O'Grady QC told Robertson: 'You have been convicted of an appalling course of conduct. You spent years preying on children. 'Two of them were raped on seven occasions. With some of your victims you have blighted their young lives and with some you have ruined and haunted their adult lives.' Miss Cowan added: 'Now I have seen justice done, I feel I can close that chapter in my life. I have a good family who have supported me through everything. I'm looking to the future and moving on with my life.' A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'Helen was very brave to come forward and report this crime. 'Even after the passage of time all reports of sexual abuse will be thoroughly investigated and we would encourage any person who has been a victim to report this to the police.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . Loner: Iain Merrick was jailed for seven years after putting a bomb in a pillar box and labelling local postmen paedophiles . A man who tried to blow up a postman and made and distributed indecent images has been jailed for seven years at Manchester Crown Court. Iain Merrick, 39, of Cheriton Gardens, Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, began a four-year hate campaign after complaining that he kept getting other people’s mail. The Post Office delivered, he claimed, up to 30 letters a day when they should have been delivered to neighbours. Merrick’s grudge campaign against Royal Mail started in 2008 when he began to experience problems with his post at his flat where he lived alone. It was claimed his upstairs neighbour would mistakenly get his post and Merrick asked that his own mail be redirected to another address for six months. Eventually it was agreed that staff would hold his mail at the post office and he would collect it personally. But in July 2010 he complained of getting post addressed to his neighbour and made several complaints to the post office. In November, police spoke to Merrick about him harassing Royal Mail workers and he told them: ‘I’m not going to send a bomb in the mail or anything. Bomb site: Winter Hey Post Office in Horwich near Bolton Greater Manchester where 'obsessive loner' Iain Merrick placed a bomb in the pillar box (on the left) as part of a campaign of intimidation against postmen . When his grievances were ignored, Merrick did build a bomb from nails, razor blades, light bulb fragments and fish hooks then posted it in a letter box near his home on April 15, 2011.’ Postman Ian Platt on collecting duties opened the pillar box outside Winter Hey Lane post office and spotted the cigarette packet-sized device which had a 12 volt battery and two wires protruding from it – each one attached to a nail. Bomb disposal experts were summoned and the police evacuated the immediate area, creating a 100-yard cordon around the scene while the device was defused. The homemade bomb: Iain Merrick built a bomb from nails, razor blades, light bulb fragments and fish hooks and posted it in a pillar box near his home . During the trial Merrick said: ‘It could range from three to four letters a week to 30 a day, more than that. I did go down to the depot but they said they are not allowed to hold onto any mail.’ Police searched Merrick’s home in September 2012 and found a pen drive in a boiler cupboard. The drive contained a folder entitled ‘Dangerous’, which had hundreds of pages of information including an article containing a diagram and instructions on how to make a pipe bomb from a 2010 issue of the terrorist publication Inspire. Unemployed Iain Merrick became so annoyed with the Post Office that he planted a bomb in this pillar box. Police found terrorist-related information in his home. He also had a collection of more than 500 child porn photographs and also had an unhealthy obsession with the Harry Potter actress Emma Watson . Police also discovered books entitled Bombs: Explosives and Experiments, The Anarchist Cookbook and Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. The authorities learned that during his vendetta Merrick had also sent letters to six primary schools containing pornographic photographs of children along with the names and occupations of postal workers in a bid to smear them. He had also put white stickers around the area falsely claiming one postal worker was a convicted paedophile. Search: police and forensics staff examine the home of Iain Merrick who had waged a four-year vendetta against the Post Office . Police also found 533 indecent images of children and discovered Merrick had been searching on the internet for mocked up ‘pseudo’ nude images of Emma Watson, the Harry Potter actress. At Manchester Crown Court Judge Martin Steiger QC called Merrick an ‘obsessive loner’ and added: ‘This campaign caused intense distress. ‘It escalated to be a ruthless and relentless campaign waged against local postal workers. It must have been perfectly obvious that this was a wicked thing to do. The defendant used his high intelligence and technical sophistication.’ He was found guilty of 17 counts of making indecent photographs of a child, four offences of distribution of an indecent image of a child and placing an explosive substance in a postbox with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. As well as his seven-year sentence, unemployed Merrick was told that on release he would spend another five years on licence.","Iain Merrick, 39, launched a four-year vendetta against Royal Mail because he got neighbour's post .

The tabloid’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, admitted he hacked Tom Parker Bowles’s voicemails, along with those of an equerry to princes William and Harry. Goodman, 56, was jailed in 2007 after he admitted hacking three aides to the princes, but said the newspaper’s hacking operation had also targeted other people associated with the royals.

He said he had hacked Mr Dyer in 2005 and had ‘briefly’ hacked Mr Parker Bowles in 2006 after suggesting the now defunct tabloid should carry out an undercover sting on the food journalist. Goodman denied he had paid palace policeman for information, despite emails he sent to editor Andy Coulson asking him to approve payments.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Pollsters say it is only when politicians and journalists become sick and tired of soundbites that voters start to even notice. But Labour leader Ed Miliband may have taken the advice a little too literally, after grinding out the same attacks on the government in response to yesterday's Budget. He faced criticism for failing to address any of the measures actually announced by George Osborne, but examination of his speech shows that his slogans on borrowing, bankers and the Bullingdon Club were all just a case of history repeating. The tie and the haircut might change, but Labour leader Ed Miliband has used the same Budget soundbites in (left to right) 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 . Mr Miliband was repeatedly interrupted during his speech in the Commons yesterday, with deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle having to call for quiet. But there was no mention of any of the policy changes announced by Mr Osborne, even those trailled in the media in the days before. Privately many Labour MPs were dismayed at their leader's response. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Mr Miliband had faced a 'difficult speech' because he had planned to attack policies which ended up not being included. Mr Balls told journalists: ‘Ed Miliband had written pages of his . speech which weren’t used in the end, which he thought might be in there . that weren’t, but he had to fill the space by going on and on about . Michael Gove’s comments.’ It is thought the Labour leadership had fallen for speculation on Twitter that Mr Osborne would move to cut income tax, but when it failed to appear Mr Miliband had to tear up large chunks of his speech. Aides also complained that Labour had not been given early sight of the Budget to help them to prepare. So instead Mr Miliband turned to his earlier Budget speeches for inspiration, starting with an observation about how long Mr Osborne spoke for, accusing him of giving with one hand and taking with the other and rounding off with a swipe at an 'out-of-touch Chancellor'. Here we examine what Mr Miliband said in the Commons yesterday, and how his attacks have echoed down the years... 2014: ‘The Chancellor spoke for nearly an hour. But he did not mention one central fact. The working people of Britain are worse off under the Tories’. 2012: ‘The Chancellor spoke for an hour. But there was one phrase that did not pass his lips. One claim he has abandoned. ‘We’re all in this together’ 2011: ‘The Chancellor spoke for nearly an hour. But one fact says it all. Growth down last year, this year and next year’ 2014: ‘2011 - living standards down. 2012 - living standards down. 2013 - living standards down’ 2013: ‘Growth last year, down. Growth this year, down. Growth next year, down’ 2012: ‘Growth down last year. Growth down this year. Growth down next year’ 2014: ‘It’s a classic Tory con. Give with one hand and take far more away with another.’ 2013: ‘The Chancellor is giving with one hand, and taking far more away with the other’ 2012: ‘All he is doing for ordinary families is giving with one hand and taking far more away with the other’ 2011: ‘Let me tell you what the Institute for Fiscal Studies told us this morning: ‘there is an awful lot of giving with one hand. and taking away with lots and lots of other hands’. It's the classic Tory con. 2014: ‘And these are the people that had the nerve to tell us we’re all in this together. It’s Tory values. It’s Tory choices. It’s the same old Tories.’ 2012: ‘Wrong choices.  Wrong priorities.  Wrong values. Out of touch. Same old Tories.’ 2011: ‘Every Tory tax cut ends up costing them more. Same old Tories. Same old deceit’ 2014: ‘Maybe today we can get the straight answer we haven’t had so far? Will he rule out a further tax cut for millionaires to 40p?

Nod your head if you are getting the 50p tax rate’ 2012: ‘Just nod if you’re going to benefit from it, or shake your head if you’re not. Come on, we’ve got plenty of time.’ Repetition: This word cloud shows how people and tax dominated Mr Miliband's speech in response to the 2014 Budget . 2014: 'What is the latest rebrand from the Bullingdon club?' 2013: 'The Bullingdon boys really are both in it together.' 2014: 'This recovery’s not working for working people.' 2012: 'The truth is that for ordinary families, it’s hurting but it’s not working.' 2011: 'It's hurting but it isn't working.' 2014: ‘So the Prime Minister chooses to afford a tax cut of £200,000 for a banker. But he can’t afford a pay rise of £250 for a nurse.’ 2013: ‘John the banker, remember him? He’s had a tough year, earning just £1m. What does he get? He gets a tax cut of £42,500 next year. £42,500, double the average wage.’ 2012: ‘That is this Chancellor’s priority – giving 14,000 millionaires over £40,000 each.  And what happens to families who earn in one year half what the Chancellor has so casually given away to the richest in the last hour?  Families on £20,000 a year – the nurse, the lorry driver’ 2014: ‘Under them it’s a recovery for the few not the many’ 2013: ‘And they don’t understand, you need a recovery made by the many not just a few at the top’ 2012: ‘Unfair. Out of touch. For the few, not the many.’ Ken Clarke and his . tum were just behind me – on Budget day lots of MPs use upstairs . overspill benches which abut the press gallery. Gaseous, . pre-prandial rumblings emanated from his direction. They sounded like a . boiler we replaced at home last week. George Osborne’s changes to . investment tax breaks found favour. ‘Egggsellent,’ exhaled Ken. Smoky snufflings and hoggy gruntlings sounded from the . depths of the Clarke maw when Mr Osborne extended limits for ISAs and . lending for exports. Dreadful: Ed Miliband's response to George Osborne unveiling the big'un was almost void of financial content . Then the Chancellor reached . his clincher, the unexpected announcement about pensions. Silence. No . one, not even Ken, knew what to think. Cue panic in the press corridor, reporters turning to one another and saying: ‘Annuities? Remind me. What the heck are they?’ A . slimmed Osborne spoke for 57 minutes. At the end, Government MPs did . their customary ballyhoo and Mr Osborne gulped down water. His voice had been fading badly. Had the Budget been any longer, he would have needed a squirt of WD40, or subtitles. The Chancellor looked genuinely drained – relieved, too. His face at the end seemed to say ‘crumbs, I did it’. After past budgets he has often looked cocky but this expression was different. It . was as though he realised it was a big ’un. The silence from the Labour . benches reinforced that impression. Ed Miliband’s remarkably vacuous . response did not much lift Labour’s gloom. The Labour leader's remarkably vacuous response did nothing to lift his party's gloomy silence . The main words in Mr . Osborne’s speech were ‘saver’ and ‘resilient’. There was all this stuff . about steady-as-she-goes and restoring the economy brick by brick. Then, . wham, he concluded with the beyond-Thatcherite freeing of pensions. A . pitch for UKIP sympathisers? Maybe. It certainly looks a defining moment . for Mr Osborne’s Treasury years. What . heckling there was from Labour (deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle had little . trouble keeping order) came chiefly from that party’s women. Islington’s . Emily Thornberry barked the occasional insult and frontbencher Maria . Eagle, standing near Brother Emily, kept up a running commentary of . abuse. ‘Wot about the . debt?’ bawled Emma Reynolds (Wolverhampton N). Susan Elan Jones (Clwyd . S) muttered and twitched, a hobgoblin from Dylan Thomas’s Llareggub. Ed . Balls kept doing a discreet thumb gesture, a furtive hitch-hiker. Big . Jimmy Hood (Lab, Lanark) sat in a splodge of silence, nibbling on a . petite little pinky: such a hefty yet his poise so balletic. On . the Tory side, slinky Liz Truss, education minister, sat on the floor, . stretching her pale neck.Gentlemanly Kwasi Kwarteng (Con, Spelthorne) strode over to check her tender bottom was not in any distress. Bill . Cash (Stone) cleaned his spectacles with a large mouchoir. Ed Balls roared laughting as Osborne compared Miliband to King John, a weak leader who betrayed his brother . Claire Perry, a whip, . was another Tory woman on the floor. She perched there, peering over . baronet Sir George Young’s right shoulder like Long John Silver’s . parrot. Moments of levity: . hearing a tax break for bingo, Suffolk Coastal’s Therese Coffey, having . campaigned for it, cried ‘House!’; and Mr Osborne mentioned a grant to . the Magna Carta Trust, simply so that he could refer to King John as ‘a . weak leader who had risen to the top after betraying his brother, . compelled by a gang of unruly barons to sign on the dotted line’. The House twigged the Ed Miliband/trade unions analogy. Mr Balls roared with laughter. When . Mr Osborne hailed improving prospects in the north of England, Maria . Eagle’s atonal soprano gave a ‘have you ever been there?’ Mr . Osborne’s Tatton constituency is actually next to Manchester. Labour . glumness was now so evident that smoothiechops Mark Garnier (Con, Wyre . Forest) shouted: ‘Smile!’ The . Chancellor was watched from the VIP gallery by not only his mother but . also his wife and their daughter. The little poppet (daughter, that is) was rapt for the first ten minutes. The following 47 she found more of a . test. Join the club, honeybun. Mr . Miliband’s Budget response, almost entirely free of financial content, . was the speech of a chef trying to make an omelette without eggs. It was . a chopped, half-fried, gabbled nothingness, little more than a smear of . slogans. Dreadful.","Labour leader criticised for not addressing any of Osborne's policies .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A distraught mother says she cannot leave the house after undergoing a 'botched' eyebrow tattoo. Marie Johnson, 43, from Walker, Newcastle, had imagined elegant light brown brows would transform her look. But now she says she breaks down in tears every time she looks in the mirror - and she is even considering launching a legal claim over the £120 semi-permanent cosmetic procedure. Marie Johnson is preparing to launch a legal claim and says her tattoo has left her looking 'like a clown' But the tattooist says the eyebrow inkings - which were discussed with Marie - will shrink and fade as the area heals, and the matter has been 'blown out of proportion'. The tattoos were done on Friday at Pretty In Ink, on Linden Terrace, Whitley Bay, as an early Mother’s Day gift from 18-year-old daughter Leonie. Marie had wanted her eyebrows to look more substantial as they were beginning to thin. 'I had been getting down and my daughter said I should get the tattoo for a Mother’s Day present,' she said. 'The pictures online looked excellent.' A consultation cost the family £60 before Marie went to Whitley Bay for the procedure on Friday. But Marie was immediately disappointed with the results. 'When I sat up I was instantly horrified,' she said. 'I said: ""What have you done? This isn’t what I asked for."" The eyebrow tattoo was bought as a Mother's Day present . The 43-year-old had imagined elegant light brown brows would transform her look . 'She had given me thick brows. I look like something between a drag queen and a clown. I’m absolutely devastated, I’m horrified. 'In the picture, the brows were a lot thinner and a lot lighter - a natural sort of colour. Leonie keeps saying she’s sorry because she feels like she is to blame.' A spokeswoman for Pretty In Ink said the matter has been 'blown out of proportion' and the procedure was discussed with the client fully. She said: 'At one stage, [the eyebrow tattoo] did look a little thin, which Marie agreed, so I did [them] thicker for her and I showed her in the mirror at that time. 'As I did explain to her, within the four-week healing process, they will lose up to 40 per cent of the colour and shrink.' Marie fears the semi-permanent tattoos could last anywhere from two to six years. She added: 'My daughter can’t look at me and I can’t look in the mirror.' The tattoo was an early Mother's Day gift from 18-year-old daughter Leonie - who can no longer 'look at her' Marie says she breaks down in tears every time she looks in the mirror . A North Tyneside Council spokeswoman confirmed they are investigating a complaint. She said: 'We can confirm we have received a complaint about a registered tattooist in North Tyneside. 'The complaint relates to several different issues and these are currently being investigated. 'However, we have advised the complainant that the issue concerning the quality of service provided would be a civil matter.'","Procedure was an early Mother's Day present from daughter Leonie, 18 .

"By . Dan Bloom . Crusade: Greg Wallace rooted out the lavish spending after he was suspended as a head teacher . A superhead once hailed as one of Michael Gove's 'Magnificent Seven' exposed how his own bosses blew almost £60,000 on jaunts to luxury hotels, the U.S. and Canada. Greg Wallace launched the crusade after he was suspended as the executive head of five schools in Hackney, north east London, amid an investigation into alleged financial irregularities. He discovered board members at The Learning Trust stayed for two days at the Royal Automobile Club complex at the 17th Century stately home Woodcote Park in Surrey - just 20 miles away. An offshoot of the London private members' club which opened in 1897 and was endorsed by Edward VII, it has a banqueting room, a billiards room, two restaurants, two bars and a golf course. Other overnight trips were to the 17th Century red brick Wotton House in Surrey, whose Italian-style garden was the first in England, and the nearby four-star Selsdon Park, which is set in 250 acres of countryside and has one of the south east's premier golf courses. The annual meetings - all within 60 miles of Hackney - cost the Trust £38,266 over seven years. Headteachers were also sent on two foreign 'study trips' lasting nine days each to Ontario, Canada, and Tucson, Arizona - which cost the Trust £21,525 and Hackney schools another £21,525. The eye-watering £59,790 total has led to questions why the Trust did not hold the annual meetings in its own school buildings. At the time The Learning Trust - since re-named the Hackney Learning Trust - was a private company but received large sums of public money to do its work. It has since been re-absorbed into Hackney Council. Lavish: A stay at the 17th Century Selsdon Park hotel in Surrey - 17 miles from Hackney - cost £7,100 . Costly: Another stay at the nearby Wotton House Hotel cost almost £5,500. At the time The Learning Trust in Hackney was a private firm but received substantial amounts of public money to do its work . Stately home: Many of the trips were to Woodcote Park, which is now owned by the Royal Automobile Club . The annual away days were taken from . 2004 to 2010. Only in 2011 and 2012, due to financial constraints, . did the board choose one-day seminars at the UBS bank instead. Learning Trust board chairman Richard Hardie is also the chairman of UBS's London Advisory Board. Jonathan . Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'It’s . astounding that the Trust thought it reasonable to waste taxpayers’ money on these expensive away days and foreign jaunts. Annual two-day away days for board members of The Learning Trust, Hackney . 2004: The Royal Automobile Club, Woodcote Park, Surrey. 19 attendees.

(Half funded by Trust, half funded by schools) 'Rather than swanning off on these expensive trips the trust should have focused on its job in Hackney. 'There’s no reason why these away days couldn’t have taken place on council property.' A . Hackney Council spokesman said: 'These training days were part of the . professional development of The Learning Trust's board members and took . place while it was a private limited company. They cost an average of . £263.90 for each person per year. 'Since . Hackney Learning Trust rejoined Hackney Council in 2012, training days . have been held in house or with partner organisations, at a much lower . cost.' The U.S. and Canada trips were each taken by 16 headteachers. Three members of Learning Trust staff accompanied them each time, but were paid for by consultancy Leannta . Education Associates, which organised the trips, and not public funds. Mr . Wallace was suspended in July last year after Hackney Council launched . an investigation into financial irregularities under his leadership, which related to the awarding of computer contracts. He submitted the Freedom of Information requests about spending in September. He . tendered his resignation effective at the end of the year, but by the time that came he had already been sacked. Hackney Council completed its report into the alleged conduct but it has not been made public. The council cited legal reasons. A Hackney Council spokesman said: 'A . routine audit at a Best Start Federation school uncovered concerns about . financial irregularity and the procurement of ICT contracts. 'A . full independent investigation was carried out and although Mr Wallace . tendered his resignation during the disciplinary process, the procedure . was completed and we can confirm Mr Wallace was subsequently dismissed . from his position. Luxurious: The Selsdon Park Hotel in Surrey was at one time the seat of the Bishops of Rochester . History: Wotton House was a seat of aristocracy and the birthplace in 1620 of diarist and gardener John Evelyn . Variety: Another of the trips was taken to the Basingstoke Country Hotel in Hampshire, pictured . 'The report also made a number of . recommendations to tighten financial and procurement procedures in BSF . schools. 'The Federation's governing body has agreed to defederate the . schools and new governing bodies will be set up for each school. Those . new bodies will take forward the recommendations.' Mr Wallace launched his career in education as headteacher of Woodberry Down primary school, north London, in 2001. He . was deemed so successful he was drafted in to turn around four more . underperforming schools - London Fields in Hackney, Whitmore in Hoxton, . Mandeville in Lower Clapton, and Burbage in Hoxton. They all came under the umbrella of the Best Start Federation. Education . Secretary Michael Gove lavished praise on Mr Wallace in a speech to the . Association of School and College Leaders in 2012. Career: Mr Wallace rose through the ranks after taking a post at Woodberry Down Primary School . Singling . him out alongside six other superheads, he said: '[His] students are . drawn from the poorest parts of Hackney and have benefitted hugely from a . rigorous approach to reading in the early years which makes them . enthusiastic devourers of every book they can get their hands on. 'The . reason I mention these - and I could mention many more - is that I . don’t think any leader in education should give a speech or appear in . public to talk about education without celebrating success and giving a . shout-out to those who’ve achieved it. 'But . there’s a special reason I mention these magnificent seven today. And . it goes to the heart of the moral purpose of this Government. I’ve said . in the past - will say again - and the evidence backs me up when I say . it. 'We have the best generation of young teachers ever in our schools. We have the best generation of heads ever in our schools.'","Greg Wallace went on crusade after he was suspended in Hackney, London .

Final farewell: L'Wren Scott's funeral will be held in Los Angeles, California, at the request of Mike Jagger, pictured in 2010, and her brother . The singer has only just flown back . to the United States from Australia, where the Rolling Stones were on tour . when he received the tragic news that the 49-year-old had taken her life.

Campbell Funeral Chapel on Manhattan’s Upper East Side since Wednesday, when the Medical Examiner’s office released it after confirming her death was a suicide.' Scott did not leave a note and many have speculated the stress of her business facing severe financial issues may have contributed to her hanging death. The designer - who was raised in Utah - . also has a sister, Jan Shane, however, according to Page 6 she has been . barred from being part of the funeral. Glossy front: Despite a long line of famous fans, the 49-year-old's fashion line was a financial failure and she owed creditors nearly $6million, despite Mick's financial support .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If Californians thought they had it rough dealing with the drought plaguing the state they now have a new concern. The dry spell is causing a higher number of skunks to come out of the woods and into residential areas as they look for food and water. The problem is particularly bad in El Dorado County, an area east of the capital, Sacramento, in the famous Gold Country. Jennifer Hamburg of the El Dorado Animal Control Division told CBS Saramento that in a typical year, the department gets between five and seven reports of skunk sightings. But in the last two months alone, she has received word of 7 sightings. And alarmingly, many of the sightings are in residential areas. Rabid skunks are on the rise in some parts of California as the drought there is causing more skunks to come out to search for food and water . While skunks are usually harmless as long as you keep your distance from them, Hamburg said the drought is causing some skunks to become more hostile. “They’re dangerous in the fact that the calls that we have received so . far seem to be they are a little bit more aggressive complaints,' she said. 'They are charging after people’s dogs.' Rabid skunks can be spotted as they tend to have trouble walking or drinking water. And if your pet spends time outside, it's best to have them vaccinated against rabies as well. Unfortunately, the drought situation doesn't seem to be letting up anytime soon. Residents say some of the skunks seen have been aggressive even charging at their dogs . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday released its seasonal outlook. The agency found that California just had its warmest and third driest winter on record. However, NOAA added that the drought is expected to persist or intensify. And if that wasn't enough of a concern, a good portion of the state is under an above average wildfire threat for the spring.","Lack of water and food is causing more skunks to appear in residential areas .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The body of a Florida restaurant owner has been found six days after he disappeared while diving into the Ganges to save a holiday-maker. Hector Rolotti, who ran the popular Novecento chain, which has four restaurants in Miami, had been on a yoga retreat in India with his wife, Mora Barber, when he was swept away. The 47-year-old was one of six people who jumped into the river on Monday, after seeing a member of the retreat crying out for help. Found: The body of Hector Rolotti, pictured with wife Mora, has been found six days after he was swept away . For a week search teams had searched sections of the river near Rishikesh, where Rolotti was last seen, in the hope of finding him. Success: Rolotti opened the the first of many restaurants at the age of 24 . Because the father-of-three was physically fit, family and friends had held out a glimmer of hope that he had somehow survived, after being pulled under by the strong current. On Saturday, his restaurant group released a statement saying the Argentinian-born restaurateur's body had been found. 'It is with great sadness that Novecento . Group informs that the body of founding parter Hector Rolotti was found . in the Ganges River,' the statement, published in the Miami Herald, said. 'The body . was found intact due to the low temperatures of the Ganges this time of . year. He was found by a group of locals who then alerted the authorities . and search team.' Rolotti and his wife had been on a yoga retreat, which they attended every year. The . couple had been in India for about a week, and were due to return this . weekend. Instead, Rolotii will now be cremated before his ashes are . returned to Miami and Argentina. Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Rolotti at the weekend, remembering him as 'a tireless entrepreneur and family man, always concerned about his children, wife and parents'. A customer at one of his Florida restaurants commented on his efforts to save a friend, telling CBS Miami: 'I think it’s heroic and very inspirational and hopefully his journey in the afterlife is taking him somewhere else pleasant.' A statement from the restaurant read: 'Hector’s great . achievement with Novecento was much more than a restaurant chain, it is a . meeting point for friends and communities.'

He had left Argentina for New York and, by 1991 had founded the first of many successful establishments. His philosophy behind what made a great restaurant, he told Argentinian newspaper La Voz del Interior, was to create a place where 'people can meet friends or do business'. 'Just providing food doesn’t make it. You have to offer more, you have to set up places people want to meet,' he said. Rolotti went on to open 13 branches of his restaurant, including four in Miami, two in Mexico, five in Argentina, and one in Uruguay.","Hector Rolotti and his wife Mora had been on vacation when he was swept away .

"By . Jonathan Block . Scroll down to see epic trailer . Positive early buzz surrounding the much anticipated Bible epic 'Noah' starring Russell Crowe could mean huge crowds — and box office receipts — once the film opens to wide release on Friday. Although artistic liberties are taken, the movie, which had a reported budget of $130 million, tells the story of Noah, made famous in the Bible after God commanded him to build an ark prior to a giant flood that would destroy the earth. The film also stars Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson. With 11 reviews posted, 'Noah' has a 73% fresh rating on the popular film reviews site rottentomatoes.com, with 8 reviews being positive. Russell Crowe (center) as the title character in 'Noah', with Jennifer Connelly (second from left) and Emma Watson (second from right) In his review for the Hollywood Reporter, Jeff McCarthy calls the film 'an arresting piece of filmmaking that has a shot at capturing a large international audience both for its fantasy-style spectacle and its fresh look at an elemental Bible story most often presented as a kiddie yarn. He also mentions that the word 'God' is never mentioned in any of the dialogue. Although he found 'Noah' uneven, Variety chief film critic Scott Foundas nonetheless gave a generally favorable review. 'Counterintuitive, perhaps, but by no means sacrilegious, [director Darren] Aronofsky’s uneven but undeniably bold, personal, visually extravagant take on the Old Testament tale will surely polarize critics and audiences while riding a high sea of curiosity to strong initial worldwide B.O.,' Foundas wrote. 'Only time — and word of mouth — will tell if it can stay the course for anywhere near 40 days and nights.' Russell Crowe works on building an ark in the film 'Noah' Russell Crowe looks up to heaven as heavy rain falls in 'Noah' Foundas added that Crowe's acting was 'superbly played.' Perhaps the most glowing review came from Pete Hammond at Movieline as he called 'Noah' 'magnificent.' 'Truly epic in its scope and ambition,' Hammond said in his video review. 'It stays with you long after you leave the theatre. This 'Noah' is unlike any other film of its kind — an intimate and stirring new take on a biblical story we only thought we knew.' Even the National Catholic Register liked the film. It reviewer, Steven D. Greydanus, wrote, 'For a lifelong Bible geek and lover of movie-making and storytelling like me, Noah is a rare gift: a blend of epic spectacle, startling character drama and creative reworking of Scripture and other ancient Jewish and rabbinic writings.' He added that 'Noah' 'presents biblical characters facing challenges, dilemmas and uncertainties as knotty as those we face today.' Some critics, however, didn't find the film pleasing. Alonso Duralde, chief critic for The Wrap.com, compared Noah to Kevin Kostner's 1995 sci-fi adventure dud Waterworld. 'The film winds up feeling like a bit of a soggy slog, both overblown and underwritten,' Duralde wrote. Russell Crowe attends the UK Premiere of 'Man of Steel' in London on June 12, 2013 . Director Aronofsky, who reportedly was working on getting 'Noah' to the big screen for 15 years, made a name for himself in late 2010 following the release of 'Black Swan,' starting Natalie Portman. The movie ended up as box office gold, grossing more than $329 million worldwide. The take is even more astounding given the film's budget was $13 million, a pittance in Hollywood. The story of Noah was brought to the silver screen before, back in 1928 as the disaster film 'Noah's Ark,' which was written by Daryl F. Zanuck, who later became a famed Hollywood studio executive. During the filming of the climactic flood scene, three extras drowned.","Bible epic, which cost $125 million to make, opens on Friday in the U.S.

"By . Ryan Gorman . New York’s sky-high cigarette taxes have led to more than half of all packs sold in the state being smuggled in illegally, a new report has revealed. The 56.9 per cent of packs sold illegally in New York are the highest percentage in the country, according to the Tax Foundation, and are likely a direct result of the state having the highest cigarette taxes. The Empire State levies a $4.35 cent per pack tax on smokers jonesing for their fix. Packs bought in the Big Apple also face an additional city tax of $1.50 – bringing the total cost per pack to as high as $15 within the five boroughs. On display: Cigarettes behind the counter of Duane Reade, a ubiquitous store in New York City, but many more are sold in the city's thousands of bodegas . New York’s high taxes are not alone in causing high rates of illegal smuggling across state lines. Arizona’s 51.5 per cent of packs sold illegally place it second in the nation, New Mexico and Washington come in at 48 per cent each, and Wisconsin rounds out the top five at just under 35 per cent, according to the Tax Foundation. Arizona’s $2 per pack tax ranks twelfth in the country and is one of the highest in that part of the country, according to Fox News. ‘Public policies often have unintended consequences that outweigh their benefits,’ study author John Henchman wrote, according to Fox News. ‘One consequence of high state cigarette tax rates has been increased smuggling as criminals procure discounted packs from low-tax states to sell in high-tax states,’ he continued. Nowhere is that practice more prevalent than in Manhattan, where people walking through Chinatown and Midtown come across people hawking cigarettes almost as often as they try to sell counterfeit bags and sunglasses. Lost revenue: Shelves full of cigarettes at a store in Manhattan - half of all cigarettes sold in New York are brought across state lines illegally . This anecdotal evidence is backed up by another study cited by the Tax Foundation which found that almost 60 per cent of all packed tossed in the trash come from outside the five major northeast cities surveyed. The states with the highest rates of outbound smuggling – New Hampshire (24.2 per cent), Wyoming (22.3 per cent), Idaho (21.3 per cent), Virginia (21.2 per cent) and Delaware (20.9 per cent), according to the study – coincidentally ranked among the lowest in per pack taxes in the nation. Smugglers try to hide their illicit activities with counterfeit state tax stamps, by hijacking trucks and selling knock-off cigarettes, according to the report. In some instances, officials even turn a blind eye to the sales. As much as $5billion a year in revenue is lost each year to illegal cigarette sales, according to U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives statistics cited by Fox News.","Almost 57 per cent of all cigarettes sold in New York are smuggled in from out of state, according to a new report from the Tax Foundation .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The head of Scientology has met with local government officials in Clearwater, Florida after the controversial church has been in a public spat with the town leaders for years. The trouble began when the Church of Scientology bought a one-acre plot of land across from the Clearwater Marine Aquarium that the city was planning on using as a parking lot. The church refused to part with the land when the city offered to buy it off them earlier this year, and the spat grew from there. Meeting of minds: David Miscavige (left) had a meeting with Clearwater city manager Bill Horne (right) on Thursday after a very public dispute over local property . Scene stealers: The Church of Scientology bought a plot of land opposite the Clearwater Marine Aquarium that the city was planning on using as a parking lot . The Tampa Bay Times reports that the city began looking at other options for the parking lot- including one directly across from The Flag Building, a seven-story property that is the closest equivalent of a cathedral that the Church of Scientology has. City Manager Bill Horne stoked the fired even further, previously telling the paper that because of the city zoning code's lack of height restrictions, the city could theoretically build as 'high as we want' in that particular plot. The back-and-forth prompted David Miscavige, the reclusive head of the controversial church, to meet with Horne in a rare face-to-face sit down. 'His interest was- in light of everything that has happenedâ€” how do we move forward? That was the tone of the meeting,' Mr Horne told the Tampa Bay Times about the discussion that took place Thursday. Backlash: in response, the city bought a plot opposite the Scientology Flag Building (pictured) and threatened to build a structure higher than the Flag Building . Important: The Flag Building is the closest thing Scientology has to a cathedral, so they want to protect the area around it (Miscavige shown on a big screen at the building's dedication in November) Horne hadn't spoken to Miscavige directly over the past three years before the Scientology head called and suggested this week's meeting. 'The last time we met was a little rocky. This time, it was a positive meeting,' Mr Horne said. The City manager added that Miscavige's biggest point of complaint was actually the newspaper itself and how the Church had been covered in the press, specifically in relation to the Clearwater property disputes. No final decision was reached over the property across from the aquarium, but Horne said that it appears as if Miscavige is more open to discussions than he had been in the past. 'I think there's some opportunity, one of which is, maybe we can get the site we really want to build a garage,' Mr Horne said.","David Miscavige, the head of the controversial religion, has met with local leaders in Clearwater, Florida after a public land dispute .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida police officer under investigation for sexual battery and kidnapping committed suicide on Thursday as deputies were on their way to arrest him. North Port officer Ricky Urbina, 44, was accused of handcuffing a woman at a party on March 2, taking her into a bedroom and sexually battering her while on duty and in uniform. A second officer, Melanie Turner, who was at the party but off-duty, was arrested Thursday on the same allegations, according to ABC Action News. While the incident is still under administrative investigation, officials said both Urbina and Turner had been cooperative, and an agreement was made that authorities would contact them if and when they take them into custody. Deceased: Ricky Urbina, 44, described as a loving husband and father, was under investigation for the sexual battery and kidnap of a woman at a party. He killed himself on Thursday as officers were en route to arrest him . Melanie Turner, a mother of two, turned herself into police on Thursday. She has been charged with sexual battery and kidnap. Her attorney said the incident was consensual . Charged: Melanie Turner makes her first appearance in court this week after turning herself in and the death of her colleague, Ricky Urbina . Scene: Police were on their way to arrest Ricky Urbina on Thursday when they recieved reported of a shooting at his home in North Port, Florida (pictured) When investigators contacted Urbina on Thursday, he asked investigators to meet him somewhere besides his home. While en route, deputies received a report of a shooting at Urbina’s home. He is believed to have shot himself, according to FOX4. According to a Sheriff’s Office report, the woman who made allegations against Urbina and Turner said the battery occurred at her home while hosting a birthday party for her boyfriend that Turner, who was off duty, was attending. Urbina, whom the victim did not know, arrived at the party after Turner invited him. The report says Urbina noticed Turner helping a guest remove a pair of handcuffs. After the guest was freed, the victim was placed in handcuffs. Witnesses at the party identified Urbina as the person who handcuffed her. Urbina and Turner took the victim to the master bedroom, the report says. Police officers Ricky Urbina (left) and Melanie Turner (right) were accused of handcuffing the female host of a party, taking her into the master bedroom, lying her face down on the bed and subjecting her to sexual battery . North Port police chief Kevin Vespia issued a statement Friday morning in the aftermath of the arrest of one of his officers and the suicide of another . The victim told investigators she remembered one of them mentioning a 'body search' and Turner locked the bedroom door behind them. 'Up to this point, the victim stated that she felt that the actions of Turner and Urbina were merely party fun and felt that she would be released,' the report says. 'However, she was not released.' Turner removed the victim’s pants without her consent and Urbina sexually battered the woman while Turner kissed her, according to the report. The victim saw the window blinds open and said her boyfriend is 'going to kill you both' if he were to see what was occurring. Turner put the woman’s pants back on and Urbina removed the handcuffs. Ricky Urbina was said to be scared the arrest would ruin his career and marriage . Turner and Urbina left the room together, leaving the victim behind. She eventually left the room herself in tears and told a friend at the party she had been 'violated'. Another off-duty officer at the party contacted a police supervisor. Turner was interviewed four hours after the incident, but deputies redacted a summary of her statement from the report because she was intoxicated. Urbina refused an interview until his attorney could be present, the report says. During that time, he made statements to an investigator that he 'would be fired over this incident, he would not fight the allegations and that the allegations would cost him his marriage'.","Ricky Urbina, 44, was on-duty and in uniform when an off-duty colleague, Melanie Turner, invited him to a party in North Port, Florida on March 2 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hard-partying New York nightlife impresario Vikram Chatwal is fighting to get back the engagement ring he gave his supermodel ex-fiance six months ago - and is taking the battle to the Manhattan Supreme Court. According to Page Six, Chatwal - the founder of Manhattan's luxe Dream hotels who once dated Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss and has been linked to Lindsay Lohan - is suing Esther Canadas, best known for being the face of DKNY, for the $300,000 8-carat rock, which is made of emeralds and diamonds. 'The plaintiff, Vikram Chatwal, believed his dream had come true when defendant, Esther Cañadas, accepted his marriage proposal, but his dream morphed into a nightmare when upon the termination of the engagement, the defendant left the United States with the engagement ring as the spoils of the romance,' the suit says.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . U.S. Navy handed over control of a seized oil freighter to Libyan forces while in international waters Saturday,. The saga of the North Korea-flagged tanker Morning Glory, which authorities now say is bound for the capital Tripoli, has illustrated the extreme weakness of Libya's government, vying with rebels for dominance since the 2011 ouster and death of Moammar Gadhafi. Officials also said that they had interrogated the captain and learned that it belonged to a Saudi company. Homecoming: North Korean-flagged tanker the Morning Glory, pictured here on March 8 docked at the Es Sider export terminal in Ras Lanuf, was returned to Libya Saturday by the U.S. Navy, which had seized it last week . Entourage: USS Elrod escorted the tanker on its way to Libya, with its 34 sailors staying about the Morning Glory . The main force behind the tanker is a well-known militia commander in east Libya who was planning to sell oil in defiance of Tripoli. But Ibrahim Jedran's international partners have until now remained unknown. North Korean officials say they have canceled the ship's registration after the incident. Last week, U.S. Navy SEALs seized the ship off the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, stopping an attempt by a Libyan militia to sell its shipload of crude in defiance of Tripoli. Under cover of darkness, the elite team of commandos swooped onto the The Morning Glory from a helicopter after tracking it down to a bolt hole some 18 miles southwest of the island nation. A Pentagon spokesman said they were met with next to no resistance as they swept silently through the vessel's corridors and cabins, arresting all inside. Nobody was injured in the operation. Jedran, whose fighters control the terminal where the tanker took on its load, is part of a movement demanding autonomy for the east of the country. He has warned the U.S. against handing over the tanker and three of his fighters, reportedly including one of his brothers, who are on board. Libyan authorities at first planned to . bring the tanker Morning Glory to dock at the port of Zawiya refinery, . 25 miles west of the capital Tripoli, according to Ayoub Qassem, . spokesman for the Libyan navy. However, . just as it came into sight of Zawiya, the country's top prosecutor . ordered that it head to Tripoli port for further investigation, Abdullah . Rashed, supervisor of operations at Zawiya port, told The Associated . Press. Rashid said the vessel would arrive late at night at Tripoli port and then continue on Sunday or Monday to Zawiya, though a navy spokesman declined to confirm this. Members of Libya's naval coastguard man speed boats as they wait for the arrival of the Morning Glory at Zawiya port, Libya . Qassem had earlier told the official news agency LANA that three Libyan navy ships escorted the vessel into national waters. Hours before the handover, at least 16 people were wounded when Libyan rebels occupying three eastern oil ports clashed with troops and attacked an army base, where pro-government forces had been preparing to break the rebel blockade. Anti-aircraft gunfire and explosions were heard overnight and after dawn on Saturday in Ajdabiya, the hometown of rebel leader Ibrahim Jedran, whose fighters seized the ports last summer to demand a greater share in Libya's oil resources. Last summer, Jedran's militia took over Libya's oil facilities in the east. As a result, the country's exports of its biggest revenue earner have slowed to a trickle. This month, the militia loaded the Morning Glory with $30million worth of oil. It set sail and evaded a Libyan blockade to escape to the Mediterranean, and the militia said they would sell the oil on behalf of a council that claims to be a government in the east, challenging the central authority. Qassem said three Libyans and 21 crew . members who were on board were detained by the Libyans after the U.S. Navy handed the ship over. A . Libyan security official confirmed that one of Jedran's brothers was on . board. He said a boat of the Libyan navy forces had taken the Libyans . and the crew aboard to Tripoli. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters. A . spokesman for the guards of the oil terminals, Walid al-Tarhouni, said . Saturday that officials had learned that the ship belonged to a Saudi . company following interrogation of the vessel's captain, and after . reviewing the ownership documents. Change of plans: Just as the tanker came into sight of Zawiya (pictured), the country's top prosecutor ordered that it head to Tripoli port . Rogue militiamen: Rebels under commander Ibrahim Jedran unload ammunition from a boat at Es Sider port in Ras Lanuf; Jedran was planning to sell oil in defiance of Tripoli . Al-Tarhouni said Jedran's threats are ‘media talk’ that have no effect and that the army in the eastern area is working to regain control of the oil terminals. Jon Ki Chol, deputy director-general of North Korea's Maritime Administration, has previously said that although North Korea had provided a flag for the tanker Morning Glory, it canceled registration of the ship after being notified of the incident. When the ship docks into the harbor, it's expected to take 10 to 15 hours to unload 350,000 barrels of oil, Abdel Satar el-Terbel, coordinator of the naval operations in Zawiya Refinery Company, said. The attempted oil sale fueled political crisis in Libya and led to the parliament's removal of Ali Zidan from his post as prime minister, saying it had underlined his weakness. Libya's three rebel-held ports account for around 700,000 barrels per day of Libya's oil export capacity, or around half of its total petroleum shipments. Ransom: The vessel was stolen from the port of As Sidra last month by Libyan anti-Government insurgents, who are demanding a greater share of oil wealth and autonomy from the country's fledgling administration. They were tracked down near Cyprus .","The Morning Glory was escorted by USS Elrod to Tripoli Saturday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A mother-of-two has been left in a coma after having routine dental surgery in Hawaii to remove her wisdom teeth. Kristen Tavares went into cardiac arrest on Monday, during a procedure to remove four teeth, and has been left with swelling on the brain. The 23-year-old, who gave birth to her second son just three months ago, was described as fit and healthy, and had no medical conditions or allergies. Unexpected: Kristen Tavares was having a routine dental operation when she suffered cardiac arrest and went into a coma . Vigil: The family of Tavares, pictured here with her two sons and boyfriend, Chauncey Prudencio, are waiting for her to wake up . Ms Tavares' family are now left waiting for her to recover, as they struggle to care for her new baby and four-year-old son. Operation: Dr John Stover was removing Tavares' wisdom teeth when she went into cardiac arrest . 'We have to wait and see. They will run . tests in the next few days or so but there is no timeline on what or . when. It just takes time from here,' Chauncey Prudencio, her boyfriend, told Hawaii News Now. 'It's really hard especially for her . family and just having our three-month-old son. It's very strenuous and . stressful for everyone,' he said. Dental staff at Dr John Stover's . office in Hilo had to use a defibrillator to get Ms Tavares' heart . beating again, and she was then air lifted to Maui, where hospital staff . say she is unresponsive. Her heart is also currently too weak for doctors to carry out any medical procedures, according to Opposing Views. It is not clear what caused the healthy young woman to go into cardiac arrest, but a medical expert not involved with the case speculated that her airways could have become blocked. 'Statistically it's usually an airway issue. Perhaps a foreign body drops into the airway like a tooth, or a piece of gauze or perhaps the patient might vomit and get fluid up their airway and then down into their lungs,' Daniel Orr, of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Anesthesiology, said. Dr Stover, who has three dental surgeries in Hawaii and is licensed to perform cosmetic surgery, has not yet commented on Ms Tavares' case. Surgery: Tavares had booked in at this Hilo dental office to have her teeth removed . Waiting game: Doctors say Tavares, who has two young sons, is too weak to have any medical treatment . Two complaints - from 2012 and 2013 - are outstanding against Dr Stover, who is allowed to use full anesthesia at his surgery. However, two previous complaints about failure to comply with laws governing professional conduct were dismissed because of a lack of evidence, Hawaii News Now reported. It is the second time this year that a dental patient has fallen into a coma. In January, three-year-old Finley Boyle died after going into a coma during a routine procedure. The American Association for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons states that serious problems and deaths caused during routine dental treatment are rare, with a 1 in 365,000 chance of dying or suffering a brain injury while under anesthesia for dental work.","Kristen Tavares was airlifted to hospital and has swelling on the brain .

But, it has been revealed the 43-year-old nanny would never smack a young child because her training at Norland College in Bath forbids it. Prince George will never be smacked by his new 'Spanish supernanny' Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo because her training at Norland College in Bath forbids it, according to writer Louise Heren . Norland College in Bath, pictured, where nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo trained, teaches its students that ¿a child is never naughty¿ . Norland Nannies pictured at their Bath in their distinctive uniform. The elite childcare training institute teaches its students that a child is 'never naughty but their behaviour is' The elite childcare training institute teaches its students that ‘a child is never naughty’ and would strike off any graduate who used physical punishment, according to writer Louise Heren. Ms Heren spent a year making a TV documentary about Norland College and told the Daily Express: ‘They will never ever smack. They will be struck off if they do. A child is never naughty but the behaviour is.’ The institution's students are known for their distinctive uniforms and are schooled in all aspects of looking after youngsters during their three-year degree course. With their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were eager to secure an aide for Prince George . Norland College, founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, is a leading provider of childcare training. Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates needed to be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition. The founder focused her training on the principles of Friedrich Froebel, the German educationalist who developed the 'kindergarten system'. Its Early Childhood Studies course concentrates on numerous aspects of childhood. Students study elements of social science, psychology, child health, history, literature and education. It also trains its students - known as 'Norlanders' when they graduate - how to work with families, develop a child's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child not only how to cook, but how to cook healthy meals. Along with the traditional skills of cooking, sewing and first aid, new subjects on the curriculum include Taekwondo, self defence, skidpan driving - and escaping from paparazzi. In the second year of the course, students learn from a stunt driver on the Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire who prepares them for all kinds of situations, from icy roads to potential kidnappers or paparazzi. The training costs £36,000 in total . and the Bath college recently added martial arts training and stunt . driving to its curriculum to cater for modern clients - many of whom are . celebrities and the super-rich. Taekwondo . is believed to be the martial art of choice - which has been specially . adapted to include how to dodge a potential kidnapper with a pram. Nannies . are also trained in how to deal with paparazzi and are taken to Castle . Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire to perfect their driving skills and . learn how to drive at high speed in any weather condition. Driving away . from pursuing photographers being the main reason for the training. Ms Borrallo, who started working for the royal couple a few weeks but was only named on Thursday, has been getting to know Prince George, who is eight months old today. Ms Heren said: ‘If he is crawling, she will have worked out what has attracted his attention and move that beaker or toy a couple of yards further away each time.’ A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed Ms Borrallo’s appointment and said she would be accompanying the Duke and Duchess on a forthcoming tour of New Zealand and Australia.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Denied: Lisa Mehos, whose abortion was used against her in a custody battle, has lost her kids . The mother-of-two whose post-divorce abortion was used against her in a custody battle has lost the children over her rampant pill abuse, it has emerged. A Manhattan judge ruled that Lisa Mehos, 38, should not be the primary caregiver for the children, aged four and six, because of lies she reportedly told about her drug use. Justice Lori Sattler said in her ruling that Mehos had lied to her, court experts, doctors and drug counselors about her problem, the New York Daily News reported. Mehos, who divorced her banker Manny . in 2011, had claimed she started taking antidepressants after the split . but subpoenaed records showed she had actually been reliant on them . since she married her husband in 2006, according to the court ruling. It . revealed that she has been prescribed drugs, including Xanax and . Valium, by 28 different doctors since 2008 - even sometimes getting . prescriptions from 2 different doctors on the same day. Sattler . ruled that the drugs use endangered her children, citing one example . from 2012 where she passed out on a place and her son, then two, ran in . the aisle without pants or a diaper. The decision comes after she admitted to . having sex with a friend a year after her marriage to . Mehos, 59, came to an end, and the fling resulted in her being . pregnant and having an abortion. Mr Mehos and his 'relentless' attorney . Eleanor Alter went so far as to suggest that Mrs Mehos' abortion . undermined her claim of being a Catholic, which in turn speaks to her . overall credibility. After subpoenaing Mrs Mehos' medical . records to show that she had an abortion, Ms Alter used the procedure to . suggest she was a hypocrite for asking to have custody of her two . children over Easter. Alter also said the pregnancy showed she might have . been dishonest when she claimed she never had men over to her apartment. Battle: Her ex-husband Manny, pictured, had argued that her abortion after their divorce showed her up as a hypocrite when she said she wanted to be with her children on Easter Sunday . As a result, Mrs Mehos was forced to testify about having sex with a long-term friend at his home. Her husband used the abortion against her in court to increase his custody prospects and Lisa lost temporary custody of her daughter Macy, six, and son John, four, in August. Speaking to the New York Post, she said: 'I’m divorced. I’m not Mother Teresa! I feel like I’ve been beaten up and raped. I had sex with someone I knew for 20 years, and I’m somehow this terrible, bad parent!' She now only sees her children on Mondays and alternate weekends. 'It just breaks my heart. They're so confused,' she said. Devastated: Mrs Mehos said that she has been made out to be a bad mother for her choice . It's not the first time the couple have made headlines for a court appearance. Mr . Mehos was arrested last year and accused of battering his wife but . charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed . her black eye was from a Botox injection. Earlier this month, a Texas judge also ruled . that Manny no longer had to pay Lisa $5,000-a-month in child support, leaving her to fear she could lose her Upper West Side apartment. Her lawyer is appealing the ruling. The most recent decision also allows Mr Mehos to move their children back to Houston, but that he is responsible for his ex-wife's travel expenses when she visits. The judge said she'll reconsider the custody arrangement if Mrs Mehos has clean drug tests for a year.","Lisa Mehos, 38, lied to the court and doctors about the extent of her drug use, according to a ruling by a Manhattan judge .

Brown, 31, is accused of posing as a podiatry student and 'sucking on a woman's toes' A registered sex offender was arrested on Monday at a Walmart in North Carolina for allegedly sucking on a woman's toes while posing as a podiatry student. Michael Brown, 31, was taken into custody on Thursday night and charged with a misdemeanor assault on a female after police recognized him in surveillance photos of a man leaving a Walmart store on North Generals Boulevard. Brown approached Erika Porras, 40, who was shopping in the Walmart on Monday with her daughter Kattie. Brown, who has a foot fetish, told Porras he was a podiatry student and asked her if he could do 'research' by accompanying her while she tried on shoes. He said, ‘Follow me to the shoe department,’ and Porras, who thought he worked at the store, obeyed. Erika's daughter Kattie told WCNC that he said, ‘I need to take a picture for research,’ and when he did, he stuck her foot in his mouth.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two sisters were killed in an automobile accident early Friday morning on a Delaware road with a long history of tragedy. Ashlyn and Devyn Sisson, 23 and 22 years old, respectively, were traveling down Paper Mill Road, just north of Newark, Delaware, when the older sister lost control of her 2002 Plymouth Neon, crossed a low concrete median and slammed into a utility pole, killing both women. Their deaths are the ninth and tenth automobile fatalities on that stretch of road since 2000. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: The Sisson sisters, Ashlyn (right) and Devyn (left) were killed in a tragic car accident early Friday morning . The car the sisters were in jumped the median and crashed into a utility pole on a road known for fatal accidents . The two sisters crashed as they were driving home from work at The Greene Turtle Sports Bar and Grille in Newark, where co-workers were grieving the loss of the two young women. 'This is a tragic loss for us, the Turtle family and the . restaurant,' restaurant manager Jerry Mazurowski told Delawareonline.com. He went on to say that the Sisson sisters had worked at the restaurant since it first opened in December of 2012, adding that 'they were great young ladies.' Initial reports show that drugs or alcohol were not a factor in the crash. However, neither sister was wearing her seatbelt. 'They always wore their seat belts,' friend Sydney Pensky told the publication. 'They even put the seat . belt on the dog, Sephora.' History: The Sisson sisters are the ninth and tenth fatalities from car accidents on Paper Mill Road since 2000 . Sephora was Ashlyn's husky, which is now being cared for by family members. Pensky says that if the sisters weren't wearing their seatbelts, it was likely because 'they must have been trying to get out.' Pensky says the women were as close as two sisters could be . 'They were always together like yin and yang,' she said. 'They never . left each other's side. They just got matching tattoos of yin and yang.' The girls' friend says that she is at a loss for what could have caused the crash, as it happened on a road they frequently drove. 'They weren't drinking, they weren't smoking, they were sober,' Pensky said, adding that 'I think there must have been a deer or something.' Authorities are still investigating the crash on the road that has seen several fatal accidents over the last several years. Close: The two sisters did everything together and recently even got matching yin and yang tattoos . According to Delawareonline.com, four construction workers from Mexico were killed in October of 2007, when they collided with another vehicle near the same intersection where the Sisson sisters were killed. The driver of the second vehicle was an unlicensed 17-year-old who had been drinking and also died. Another fatal crash occurred in 2000, killing a Pennsylvania man. Alcohol was factor in that crash, as well, according to the publication. A 23-year-old woman was killed in 2010 when her car crossed over the median near the same intersection on Paper Mill Road, overturned and struck a utility pole. Another crash - this one in October of 2011 - took the life of a 40-year-old woman after a 21-year-old man who later was charged with manslaughter, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license caused a six-car accident when he rammed into the back of a stopped car near the intersection where the two sisters were killed.","The two sisters were driving home from work when their care went off the road and hit a pole .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Johnny Weir has opened up about his divorce from his husband - claiming his husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money. In an ugly twist, the 29-year-old former skater shared details of his two-year marriage with Victor Voronov, a non-practising attorney, in an interview with Access Hollywood on Thursday. While he was all smiles and professionalism during his stint as a commentator in Sochi, behind the scenes, he struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner, he said. He filed for divorce on February 12, while he was in Sochi. And in a sign that this split may be about to get uglier still, Weir's ex released an image of the bite mark he claimed the presenter inflicted on his arm. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Former figure skater Johnny Weir appeared on Access Hollywood to talk about his divorce from his husband, who he claimed was emotionally abusive and relied on him to make money . Attack: TMZ reported this picture shows the bite marks when Johnny Weir attacked his partner Victor Voronov . 'Sochi was one of the hardest times in . my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own . personal hell that I was living in. 'My husband was behaving very . erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was . on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.' He said that while the damage . couldn't be seen on his body, he was controlled emotionally and Voronov . forced him to cut out friends, professional contacts and even his . mother. He added that their . fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, . including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.  Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court earlier this month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case. Speaking to Access Hollywood, Weir said that physical attacks weren't just made by him. 'Some of my closest friends have seen him hit me before,' he said. He . added that he had added pressure because Voronov, whom he married after . a short romance, had taken on the 'traditional' role and Weir was left . to provide for the two of them. Happier times: Weir has been married to Victor Voronov, pictured together in 2012, for two years . 'He was not super accepting of the . fact that I work and I have to work this week in Russia, this week in . Los Angeles, next week in Tokyo,' he said. 'I was supporting two people and whether it seems like a . big deal or not, I come from a lower middle class family that has to . work, no matter what. 'If you can’t be an attorney this . week, then you better go get a job next week, otherwise the bills won’t . get paid. I had to travel to work to support myself and to support my . family.' Split: Weir revealed that he had broken up from his husband on his Twitter account earlier this week . Shock: Voronov wrote on Twitter that he had only just learned that his husband had filed for divorce . On Friday, TMZ also reported that Weir emailed Voronov last September, claiming that he had destroyed his pricey Birkin bag. 'If you decide to wreck things, please wreck cheaper things than Birkin,' he wrote. 'He goes on ...""The f*** you on the Birkin is kinda cool, though, you artist.' Despite . the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter account that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement this week. Weir had written on Wednesday: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' 'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote on Wednesday. On Thursday he added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.' Stars of Sochi: Weir and fellow skater Tara Lipinski were applauded for their colorful commentary in Sochi - but Weir has revealed that throughout the experience he was arguing with his husband . Together: The couple married in December 2011 after they started sating that summer . United front: Despite appearances, Weir said his husband was emotionally abusive and would slap him . Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.' But Weir said he's not worried about the scandal - and that his ex has nothing up his sleeve that could do any damage. 'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he said. Weir officially came out as . gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay . suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate. Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi . Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told . IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in . Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired . to be in a relationship with'. He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind. He's . wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my . razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually . do.' But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A . marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage . between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both . constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's . constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'","The former figure skater and Olympics commentator, 29, announced the break up with Victor Voronov on Twitter on Wednesday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Texas man with a lengthy criminal record has been indicted on murder charges for allegedly killing his wife's newborn daughter - whom law enforcement officials say he resented because the little girl wasn't his - in July of 2013. Brian Christopher Keith, 29, had just been released from prison for an arson conviction nine days before he allegedly murdered 4-week-old Nevaeh Keith. After he was released from prison, Keith moved in with his wife, Shanna Keith and little Nevaeh, in their home in a Houston suburb. 'Killer': Brian Keith resented the fact that his wife's newborn belonged to another man, authorities say . According to authorities, On July 2, 2013, Keith was heading to work at about 4 a.m. when he heard the baby crying in her crib as his wife slept. Keith later told authorities that before he left for work he remembers 'patting the child on the head and maybe striking the baby.' Later that morning, at about 11 a.m., Child Protective Services agents stopped by the Keiths' home to bring Shanna Keith to a treatment facility. When the CPS agents got to the home, they discovered that Nevaeh was unresponsive and immediately called 9-1-1. Tragedy: Nevaeh Keith died from 'compression death' after Keith claims he 'patted her head or struck her' The little girl was taken to a local hospital where she later was pronounced dead. An autopsy showed that Nevaeh was killed by 'compression death, which essentially is any form of blunt-force trauma to the body. Keith, authorities contend, resented the baby because she wasn't his, which may have been a motive for the killing. Only a few days after the baby's death, Keith was arrested for a road rage incident and thrown in the county jail on assault charges, according to KHOU. Keith was released on probation, which he soon violated and was sent back to jail where he remains. Rap sheet: Keith has been accused of 23 different criminal offenses since 2005 . As Keith was sitting in jail for violating his probation, a grand jury was deciding whether to indict him for the murder of Nevaeh. On Friday, Keith was served with a murder indictment while still behind bars in the Liberty County Jail. No bond has been set. Since 2005, Keith has been accused with more than 23 criminal offenses, including assault, arson and now murder.","Brian Keith was released from prison nine days before he allegedly killed his wife's newborn .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A man who was just 17 when he brutally beat his parents to death before throwing a party with their bodies still inside the house has been sentenced to life without parole. Tyler Hadley beat his parents, Mary Jo and Blake Hadley, to death with a hammer at their St Lucie, Florida home in 2011, then spent three hours clearing up their blood so he could have a party. In February, Hadley pleaded no contest in February to two counts of first-degree murder and on Friday Judge Robert R. Makemson handed Hadley two life sentences. Sentenced: Tyler Hadley, who murdered his parents, walks from the courtroom after being sentenced to life in prison without parole at the St. Lucie County Courthouse in Florida on Thursday . He branded the crime brutal, heinous and premeditated. Hadley's attorney had argued for two 30-year sentences, to be served concurrently, with a review after 20 years. Hadley couldn't receive a death sentence because he was 17 at the time of the killings. A fellow inmate has said Hadley signs autographs and refers to himself as 'hammer boy' behind bars. After the shocking crime, a friend of Hadely's, Markey Philips, recounted that two weeks before the horrific murders, the teen had seemed withdrawn when they hung out at his home. In court: Circuit Judge Robert Makemson called the crime brutal, heinous and premeditated . Stress: Ryan Hadley, who'd previously called his brother a 'pathological liar', listens to the verdict . Emotional: Family members exit the court after Hadley was given two life sentences on Friday . Hadley, who had been in trouble with the law in the past for arson and was a known drug taker and underage drinker, told the friend that he 'wanted to kill his parents and have a big party after' - because nobody had ever done that before. The friend did not take him seriously. On the morning of the killings, Hadley was asked by a friend if the party he had been bragging about all week was still on and if he was going to kill his parents, to which he reponded: 'no but im gonna.' He took three ecstasy pills and used a claw hammer to murder his parents, authorities said. That night, about 60 people gathered for a party at the family's Fort Pierce home, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking while the victims' bodies were locked in their bedroom. Friends described Hadley as being in a . good mood and hospitable during the party. One friend said Hadley had . planned to hold a second bash the following night. Victims: Mary Jo and Blake Hadley were beaten to death and locked in their room as their son partied . Plan: Hadley locked his parents' bodies in their bedroom then threw a party for 60 people downstairs . At the party that night, Hadley asked an unidentified friend to step outside to talk and told him about the killings. The friend was shown a bloody footprint in the garage and, ultimately, the bodies in the bedroom, police said. Word of the killings eventually made its way around the party, police said. The friend tipped off police, leading to Hadley's arrest early the next morning. Hadley told a friend interviewed by police that his father had punched him in the face several times, according to investigative files previously released by prosecutors. But a fellow inmate said Hadley told him . he'd never been beaten or molested, the files stated, and the man's . brother, Ryan Hadley, called his parents 'awesome' and said his brother . was a 'pathological liar.' Scene: Hadley told a friend about the killing and word spread around the party before the police were called . Stains: Hadley told an inmate that he knew his parents loved him because they didn't try to stop him . Evidence seized from the home hinted at some mental problems for the defendant, including a receipt for a mental health center and a bottle of an antidepressant medication, authorities said. An inmate, Justin Toney, said that Hadley was famous throughout the prison and had signed autographs. He said Hadley knew he had 'shocked the world' and realised something about his parents as he allegedly attacked them with a hammer. 'I said, ""Did they try to stop you?""' Toney asked about the attack. 'And he was like, ""No, that's how I knew that they really loved me.""'","Tyler Hadley given 2 life sentences on Thursday for the gruesome murders of his parents, Mary Jo and Blake Hadley, at their Florida home in 2011 .

"By . Associated Press . Black students are more likely to be suspended from U.S. public schools — even as tiny preschoolers. The racial disparities in American education, from access to high-level classes and experienced teachers to discipline, were highlighted in a report released on Friday by the Education Department's civil rights arm. The suspensions — and disparities — begin at the earliest grades. In this March 14, 2014, file photo, Education Secretary Arne Duncan speaks to reporters during briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington . Black children represent about 18 percent of children enrolled in preschool programs in schools, but almost half of the students suspended more than once, the report said. Six percent of the nation's districts with preschools reported suspending at least one preschool child. Advocates long have said get-tough suspension and arrest policies in schools have contributed to a 'school-to-prison' pipeline that snags minority students, but much of the emphasis has been on middle school and high school policies. This was the first time the department reported data on preschool discipline. Earlier this year, the Obama administration issued guidance encouraging schools to abandon what it described as overly zealous discipline policies that send students to court instead of the principal's office. But even before the announcement, school districts have been adjusting policies that disproportionately affect minority students. Overall, the data show that black students of all ages are suspended and expelled at a rate that's three times higher than that of white children. Even as boys receive more than two-thirds of suspensions, black girls are suspended at higher rates than girls of any other race or most boys. The data doesn't explain why the disparities exist or why the students were suspended. 'It is clear that the United States has a great distance to go to meet our goal of providing opportunities for every student to succeed,' Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a statement. 'This critical report shows that racial disparities in school discipline policies are not only well documented among older students, but actually begin during preschool,' Attorney General Eric Holder said. 'Every data point represents a life impacted and a future potentially diverted or derailed. This administration is moving aggressively to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline in order to ensure that all of our young people have equal educational opportunities.' 18 per cent of  students enrolled in preschool in the U.S. are black and more than half have been suspended at least once . Nationally, 1 million children were served in public preschool programs, with about 60 percent of districts offering preschool during the 2011-2012 school year, according to the data. The data show nearly 5,000 preschoolers were suspended once. At least 2,500 were suspended more than once. Daniel Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies for the Civil Rights Project at UCLA, said the findings are disturbing because the suspended preschoolers aren't likely presenting a danger, such as teenager bringing a gun to school. 'Almost none of these kids are kids that wouldn't be better off with some support from educators,' Losen said. 'Just kicking them out of school is denying them access to educational opportunity at such a young age. Then, as they come in for kindergarten, they are just that much less prepared.' Losen said it's appropriate to discipline a 4-year-old, but a more appropriate response might be moving them to a different educational setting with additional services. 'Most preschool kids want to be in school,' Losen said. The Obama administration is aiming to take away strict suspension policies keeping children from learning . 'Kids just don't understand why they can't go to school.' Judith Browne Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a think tank that specializes in social issues affecting minority communities, has been advocating against the overly zealous use of suspensions against African-American students. Unfortunately, she said it didn't surprise her to hear that even younger black students were being kicked out of school at a high rate. 'I think most people would be shocked that those numbers would be true in preschool, because we think of 4- and 5-years-olds as being innocent,' she said. 'But we do know that schools are using zero tolerance policies for our youngest also, that while we think our children need a head start, schools are kicking them out instead.' Kimbrelle Lewis, principal of Raleigh-Bartlett Meadows Elementary School in Memphis, said she's never suspended a child in her school's preschool program and would only consider it in an 'extreme circumstance.' She said her district provides behavior specialists and other services to children with discipline problems so strategies can be worked out with teachers and parents if preschoolers need additional support. If there are racial disparities among preschoolers disciplined, 'I do think it's something to look it. I think it's a conversation to have,' said Lewis, who served on a committee with the National Association of Elementary School Principals looking at issues affecting younger school children.","More than half of the 18 per cent of black students in preschools have been suspended once .

A nine-year-old boy from North Carolina who was forced to leave his favorite lunch bag at home because his school said it made him a target for bullies is now allowed to bring it to class. Grayson Bruce had been subjected to taunts and bullying from classmates over the My Little Pony-themed bag. After a meeting on Thursday, the Buncombe County school decided that the boy should be allowed to take his favorite bag to school because the rule that he must leave it home implied that the bullying was the boy's fault. Shocked: Noreen Bruce with her son, Grayson, who was told to stop bringing his My Little Pony bag to school because it attracted bullies . Fan: Grayson's lunch bag is based on Rainbow Dash, his favorite character in the popular cartoon . 'We are pleased the school system is working closely with us,' the boy's mother Noreen Bruce said after Thursday's meeting to Fox News. 'We had a real heart-to-heart talk,' she said after her productive meeting with superintendent Tony Baldwin and director of student services David Thompson . Bruce said she would work closely with the school to create a parental advisory council on youth bullying. The school released an official statement apologizing for forcing the boy to leave his book bag at home last week because he was the target of bullying, . 'Every situation with young children is a teachable moment and we will use this example in our efforts to address a wider issue of bullying. We ask for everyone's patience and understanding as we continue to work collaboratively with the family toward a resolution,' the statement said. His case comes less than two months after another North Carolina boy, Michael Morones, tried to take his own life after being bullied for his love of the cartoon. Michael, 11, is still recovering in hospital after suffering brain damage from the attempt. Both boys are part of a large male fan-base known as Bronies, who are drawn to the animation-style and moral values promoted in the show. Because they fall out of the show's target demographic, Bronies can find themselves the target of bullies. In Grayson's case, he says he has been pushed and punched because he is a fan of the show. 'They're taking it a little too far, with . punching me, pushing me down, calling me horrible names, stuff that . really shouldn't happen,' he told ABC 13. The bullying became worse when he got a Rainbow Dash themed lunch bag, which is shaped like the blue pony character. Popular: The My Little Pony animated series has a large male fan base, known as Bronies . 'Most of the characters in the show are . girls, and most of the people put it toward girls, most of the toys are . girlie, and surprisingly I found stuff like this,' Grayson said, as he showed off the bag. His defense against attacks that the show is 'girly' because of the animated animal characters has been echoed by other Bronies in the past, who have pointed out other cartoons popular with boys, such as Pokeman, also had cute characters. Grayson's mother, Noreen Bruce, said she was shocked by the school's response to the bullying and wants those involved punished. She was appalled that the school had called his lunch bag a 'trigger for bullying', adding: '[It's] like saying a short skirt is a trigger for rape.' Mrs Bruce also defended the show, saying: 'It's promoting friendship, there's no bad words, there's no violence, it's hard to find that, even in cartoons now.' Teased: Michael Morones, who also lives in North Carolina, is recovering in hospital after trying to take his own life after bullies picked on him because of his love for My Little Pony . Fans of the show have also rallied round the schoolboy, setting up a Support For Grayson page for him on Facebook, which has more than 9,900 likes. Voice actress Tara Strong, who played Twilight Sparkle on the show, also lent her support to Grayson, tweeting: 'Don't worry Grayson, I'll get 'em.' A statement from Buncombe County Schools said: 'An initial step was taken to immediately address a situation that had created a disruption in the classroom. 'Buncombe County Schools takes bullying very seriously, and we will continue to take steps to resolve this issue.' An online petition has been started, calling on the school to 'allow Grayson to bring his backpack to school, and crack down on bullying'.","The school released a statement yesterday saying they would allow Grayson Bruce, 9, to bring his backpack to school .

"By . Associated Press . Charla Nash, the Connecticut woman disfigured in a 2009 chimpanzee attack, has appealed for permission to pursue a $150million lawsuit against the state. She appeared before lawmakers on Friday to argue that officials knew the animal was a threat and failed to take action. In brief remarks to a legislative committee, Nash said the money could help her pay medical bills and give her a chance at a comfortable life. Slow recovery: Charla Nash, seen on Friday in a Connecticut government building, is hoping to have the right to sue the state because she thinks they should have done more to protect her from being attacked by a chimpanzee . Scars for life: Nash, 60, was blinded, lost both her hands and underwent a face transplant following the attack . Pleading her case: Nash rarely makes public appearances but came to the legislative office building on Friday to appeal to lawmakers to pass a ruling that would allow her to pursue her $150million suit . Nash, 60, was blinded, lost both her hands and underwent a face transplant following the attack. 'The state knew what was happening and failed to protect me,' Nash said. Last year, State Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr. refused Nash's request for permission to sue the state, but the General Assembly's Judiciary Committee is considering a bill that would override that decision. The state generally is immune from lawsuits unless allowed by the commissioner. The 200-pound animal, known as Travis, attacked Nash on February 16, 2009, when she went to the Stamford home of its owner, Sandra Herold, to help her friend and employer to lure the chimpanzee back inside. The animal went berserk and ripped off Nash's nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer. Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen told lawmakers the state cannot be held responsible. 'I am not here to diminish Ms. Nash's suffering,' Mr Jepsen said. Constant care: Charla was accompanied to the hearing by her daughter Briana Nash (left) Pricey: Nash's nursing care expenses cost approximately $16,000 per month and that does not include the cost of additional medical care . 'The law does not support this claim.' Nash resides at a Massachusetts convalescent center, where she is awaiting a second attempt at a hand transplant. At the same time as her 2011 facial transplant, Nash also had a new pair of hands attached but doctors were forced to remove them because they had poor circulation and she had contracted an infection. She reached a $4million settlement in 2012 with the estate of Herold, who died in 2010. Nash's attorneys say that will only cover a small portion of her medical costs. Her nursing care expenses cost approximately $16,000 per month and that does not include the cost of additional medical care. Nash's attorneys argue that the state law prohibited ownership of primates weighing more than 50 pounds without a permit, and officials had an obligation to seize the chimp because it was owned illegally by Herold. Experimental: Nash had a full facial transplant surgery in 2011 . Excruciating: Nash is seen pulling the mesh cap the protects her wounds away to show the legislators . Months before the attack, a state biologist warned state officials in a memo that the chimpanzee could seriously hurt someone if it felt threatened. 'They're all negligent because none of them did anything in the face of knowledge that this was an accident waiting to happen,' Mr Willinger said according to The Hartford Courant. '(The Department of Energy and Environmental Policy) knew you're dealing with an inherently dangerous situationâ€¦they're the ones that knew the foreseeable harm and did nothing. That's negligence.' The claims commissioner concluded that no law at the time of the attack prevented Herold from owning the chimpanzee. What remains: Nash is seen holding hands with her daughter on Friday. Nash lost one of her hands entirely and other other hand (pictured) was left with only one finger . He added that if the state had failed to seize the animal, 'The duty owed was to the general public and does not create a statutory obligation to ensure the safety of a private individual'. On Friday, Jepsen said if Nash is allowed to sue, claiming the state was negligent in not seizing the animal, others will likely pursue lawsuits concerning alleged negligence involving millions of state permit and license-holders. Jepsen said there are 'cases waiting in the chute' for a decision in the Nash request. 'The risk of floodgates opening up is very significant,' he said. Before the accident: Charla was close with Travis' owners and the owner called her to help when he was being unruly .

"By . Jill Reilly . A Norwegian museum says it has agreed to return a Matisse once looted by Hermann Goering to the family of Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg. The 1937 painting, Woman in Blue in Front of a Fireplace, has been the centrepiece of the Henie Onstad Art Center near Oslo since the museum was established in 1968 by shipping magnate Niels Onstad and his wife, Olympic figure-skating champion Sonja Henie. The museum said in a statement that although it acquired the painting in good faith, it has 'chosen to adhere to international conventions and return the painting to Rosenberg's heirs.' A Norwegian museum says it has agreed to return Woman in Blue in Front of a Fireplace,  left, a Matisse once looted by Hermann Goering, right, to the family of Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg . Norway is a signatory of the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, which requires museums to review their collections for potentially looted works and when such a work is found, to try to locate rightful owners. Niles Onstad was apparently unaware of its provenance . Now worth an estimated $20 million, the painting was taken by Goering after Rosenberg fled to New York in 1940, and sold to a Parisian art dealer later convicted of dealing in Nazi looted art. It was acquired from a different French gallery in 1950 by Onstad, who was apparently unaware of its provenance. The museum investigated the painting's past only after being notified by the Rosenberg family of their claim to it in June 2012. The museum said that in the wake of the investigation - which it . believes is the first of its kind undertaken in Norway - it has called . upon the country's government to establish a committee to actually meet . its obligations under the Washington Principles. Similar reviews have been launched in the U.S., Netherlands and Germany. 'Ultimately, . it was the strength of the moral claim that persuaded the Henie Onstad . Art Center to restitute this painting unconditionally to the Rosenberg . heirs,' said Chris Marinello of Art Recovery Group, a lawyer . representing the family. Yesterday a panel set up by the German government said a medieval treasure trove at the . centre of a long-running ownership dispute should stay with a Berlin . museum and not be given to the heirs of Nazi-era Jewish art dealers. The . recommendation on the fate of the Welfenschatz, or Guelph Treasure, by a . decade-old commission created to help resolve restitution claims isn't . binding but carries strong moral weight. The . collection includes silver and gold crucifixes, altars, intricate . silverwork and other relics. Some experts have estimated its current . value at between 180 and 200 million euros ($248 and $276 million. The medieval Dome Reliquary of the Welfenschatz, is displayed at the Bode Museum in Berlin. A panel set says a medieval treasure at the centre of a long-running ownership dispute should stay with a Berlin museum and not be given to the heirs of Nazi-era Jewish art dealers . The heirs maintained that their . ancestors had no choice but to sell the Christian artifacts in 1935 to . the Nazi government for less than their value. The . foundation that oversees Berlin's museums said the collectors weren't . forced to sell the treasures, arguing among other things that the . collection was not even in Germany at the time of its sale. In . its recommendation, the commission wrote that, after thoroughly . investigating the sale process, it came to the conclusion that it was . not a ""forced sale due to persecution."" It said it can ""not recommend . the return of the Welfenschatz to the heirs of the four art dealers and . other possible former co-owners."" The . president of the museum foundation, Herrmann Parzinger, welcomed the . panel's conclusion and praised it as a ""thorough recommendation ... that . considers all the facts."" Representatives of the heirs weren't . immediately available for comment. Germany's culture minister, Monika Gruetters, said she hopes the Jewish heirs will accept the recommendation. She . said it ""does not change ... the fact that the German government will . continue to do everything to shed light on to the Nazis' art thefts and, . when in doubt, will press for restitution."" The . collection, which has been on display in Berlin since the early 1960s . and is currently at the city's Bode Museum, is considered the largest . collection of German church treasure in public hands.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . An illegal taxi driver tried to escape from police by hiding under his car - and then refusing to come out. Jiang Tseng, 42, was stopped by police after they received a tip-off that he had been carrying passengers without a permit. But instead of giving himself up, the driver hid under his cab and then refused to come out. Illegal taxi driver Jiang Tseng from Chengdu, China, hid under his cab to escape police .

Tseng handed it over with the keys but then while officers were looking at the documents the man suddenly vanished. Police spokesman Shaiming Jen said: 'They didn't need long to find him. 'As they hadn't seen him run off they knew he was somewhere near – and actually he had ducked under the bus. 'Although it was clear he wouldn't be able to get away, he still refused to come out and every time they tried to grab him he would wriggle away.' A group of officers had to drag Tseng from underneath his vehicle when he refused to come out as pictured here . The incident caused a major pile-up of traffic in the city of Chengdu. Pictured here is Tseng attempting to hide from police . The stand-off lasted for an hour and caused heavy traffic on a busy main road.
